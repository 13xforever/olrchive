{"text": " This week, 7 Days of Awesome Games Done Quick results in over 1 million dollars raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Congratulations to the organizers, runners, and thank you to all the donors. Tonight, ready your shots with this week's VR news and join us for the show where every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 627 for this January the 10th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts, coming to you live from Sacramento, California in Studio N7. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and sadly not joining me tonight in Studio DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. DarkSakura, if you were listening to last week's show, her and the husband went to Disneyland to bid a final farewell to some parts of the park where today is actually, today actually is the last day that they're going to be open because the construction for Star Wars Land starts I guess tomorrow or whenever Disney's ready for that. So they are doing one last goodbye to the Bucket of Meat restaurant and the Petting Zoo and some of those places there. I've been looking at some pictures on her Facebook and I'm sure she'll be back next week to tell us about Hyperspace Mountain and any games she might have ran into there because I know they have some of the old Flynn's Arcade from Electronica they have by Space Mountain now so I'm not sure if any of that's changed. We'll check in with her because I'm sure her and Dan were keeping an eye out for that. If there was a Tron pinball machine to be played, you can guarantee they played it. So we'll be saying hi to her next week. In the meantime, we are joined in studio by Techmaster Loki! Hello! Who is not sadly at Disneyland. It's not sad, I don't really care for Disneyland too much. Oh that's right, you're not as big, you never got into the Disney thing like the rest of us did. You don't like fun. No, I just don't like roller coasters to be honest. That's right, you were never a big fan of us. I have a fear of heights and I don't like, I don't like the feeling of like, dying and uh. But then I could see why you wouldn't want to go to like Magic Mountain or somewhere where more of the thrill rides are. Well yeah, I mean and even like I, like there was a short period of time that actually was psyched up and I got myself over my whole like kind of fear of roller coasters. And I don't actually fear them, like I know personally like that I'm not, I'm completely safe on them and everything, so like I know that, but my body doesn't know that and it's just like oh my god oh my god oh my god! And like, like even on stupid shit like on um, like you have it in over California Adventure or whatever the fuck it is, it's like that stupid ride that they have it like um, even just like a midway ride or whatever it's like where you get in the swings or whatever and it goes up a little bit like, like it spins you around. Oh yeah, it used to be a big orange, I think they changed it, the silly symphony swings I think it is now. Like even that like, I just like, having like a mild panic attack with. I can actually see that, so the California Adventure has more of the thrill stuff, you know, they have the roller coaster that actually goes upside down. Tower of Terror is not for everybody and if you're not a heights person you're not going to enjoy that. But I get it, Loki, not every fear is necessarily rational. No, but like there's seriously the one trip though that I got over it and it was like, you know, big, you know, big mountain or thunder mountain railroad like over and over and over and over and over again and then like matter over and over and over and over again and like I was completely fine with it and stuff. Did you get over it with the help of our friend Xanax or what? No, like I just went on it like a few times and like I was like oh this isn't that bad and I had a lot of fun with it and then finally, you know, that was like when I was like a teenager and stuff and then I came back later as an adult and it's like oh look I'm scared of it again. It's like what the fuck happened there? So I don't... Will you do the virtual reality coasters? You know we got a lot of VR news this week. Will you do the coasters of virtual reality? Or is that going to... No, I'll do those just fine and yeah I still get that vertigo feeling and stuff but it's not like I'm like oh my goodness I'm going to die. Because I know it's just a headset I have on. Even though we do not have Dark Soccer here tonight, we are expected a little later in the show. Alan's going to join us here in studio. He's wrapping up some stuff for his job. He'll be joining us a little later to do like a classic game of the week and some of the Jamie stuff in her absence. But in the meantime we are joined every week by you guys live. We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, our pal Bobby. You want to talk VR? We're going to get into that tonight. And Bobby's really been following that VR scene for a very long time so you know he had some words about the news this week. So check out his show this week if you missed it live. But if you are listening live of course head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and we do read comments from chat throughout the night where we can fit them in. And then of course we'll take calls later on on our Skype line username Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. And actually some folks in chat were talking about the thrill rides. Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight saying I love coasters, those spinny rides not so much. And I can kind of see that because I love coasters. I really do. And I'll even do the Magic Mountain coasters but you know what I won't do which is weird because I used to do it as a kid but now that I'm an adult I can't do it is the Gravitron. You know what that is? The fair? I don't know if this is a national thing. I'm kind of assuming it is but if you don't know what the Gravitron is it looks like a big spaceship and it spins around really fast so that in the inside basically you kind of lose gravity. I don't even thinking about it is making me ill. Like the sensation in that ride. Like it's just I can't do it. So I think there is a big difference between the spinning and the coasters. It's weird but I can't explain it. I guess the spin of a loop on the roller coaster is one time and it's not as fast as the Gravitron. So let's see. Bobby Blackwolf says so Sky wouldn't do mission space at Epcot. Probably not if that's what it involves is the spinning around thing which I know a lot of space training is so that would make sense. Don't they have a special version though? Like they have one side for people that can do it and one side that can't. I'll do the side that can't. That's how we have to do and I swear it's a video game show but people, theme parks, who doesn't love theme parks besides Loki? Finding Nemo, my friend that I usually go to Disneyland with, Lady Victoria, she was on the show like a million years ago. She's claustrophobic and will not do those subs because even though the sub is not a thrill ride it really goes around. They're very claustrophobic. Very claustrophobic and you're underwater so it's not for everybody. So whenever I go to the park with her I have to do that handicap accessible version of the ride which is basically you go in a little room and they project what you would be seeing on the wall with the same narration and everything else. I make it sound really lame but Disneyland has a certain way of making, they use lights and things to really give you a similar sensation. They do a decent job of it considering you're not actually going underwater but I always have to do that version of the ride. If they have that for Mission at Mars I would do that. I can only hope that the version of Hall of Presidents that I've been seeing has been like the handicap accessible one and like the real one. Abraham Lincoln comes out as a giant robot and starts attacking people with laser vision. That would be awesome. Bobby Blackwell says there is a green team side that doesn't do the 2.5G's. It's more like Star Tours. Star Tours is fine. Star Tours is cake. I love Star Tours. That's a lot of fun. I hear they enhanced that with something from the new movie so I'm excited to see that at some point. One of these days I'll get back to Disneyland. It's super expensive now. Five years ago when you would hear me talk about it on the show all the time, back when I had an annual pass and I was going every few weeks, it wasn't nearly as expensive but because of the success of California Adventures Remodel and Cars Land, those passes are really expensive. A little bit of greed too but I get it. I think in a way they want to price people out because they don't want the insane crowds for special events that they usually have. Or they're just saying, how high can we make this before people stop coming? Maybe. It's a video game show. We could talk about Adventures in the Magic Kingdom on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Did you ever play that? Adventures in the Magic Kingdom on NES? It was actually kind of bad. Maybe. I don't remember. It was one of those early Capcom games and it actually had a replica map of Disneyland that for an 8-bit game is pretty accurate. But the whole deal is that you go around to these rides, the big rides of the park, the e-ticket rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, and each one was just basically mini games. Throwing out the terminology that most people are going to miss. E-ticket means the big budget rides. The big stuff. The stuff I named. Pirates of the Caribbean. Not like, I hate to say it because I love the teacups, but the teacups is not an e-ticket ride. That's kind of a lower budget ride. Anyway. Let's see. Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. DarkTetsuya is saying, we could also talk about Kingdom Hearts 3. If we were talking about Kingdom Hearts 3, then that would also be, I suppose, acceptable to keeping it Disney related. I guess that's a good point. I'm just sorry. Some of these rides, I can understand if you're strapped into the roller coaster. Cool. Okay. That makes sense. You're not going to fall out and stuff. But like, how's anybody not dying on Pirates of the Caribbean? That's all I have. Alright. Let's see. BobbyBlackWolf in chat reminding me, Rob made me ride Small World after making him almost puke on the teacups. Me and Jason. Yeah, I think I do remember it spinning really fast, those teacups though so we were all in it. Anyway. Alright. Let's get into games. Kickoff topic tonight. So, I know many of you were watching this past week the awesome Games Done Quick marathon that happened on Twitch is how most of us were watching it. I know it was also a live event that they did, I think in DC is where they have it at a hotel out there. And you know, many people throughout the speedrunning community playing games as fast as they can for charity. And I don't know about you, Loki, but I find that I've been watching this more and more with each marathon. And they do, part of what I really have enjoyed about it is seeing them glitch games that I grew up with. Like Final Fantasy IV was the very last thing they did last night. And I watched a bit of that run. And there's all these glitches they did for like duping items and stuff that I just didn't even realize you could do in the game when I played through it when I was 12. And yeah, I was almost like inspired in a way by it. I took a game that I thought, well, if I were to speedrun any game, what would I want to learn how to speedrun? And we actually talked about this a few weeks on the show. And I think the game I kind of settled on that I want to try to get better at is Super Mario Brothers 2. Just because that's just a platformer I just loved as a kid and I still love today, even if I have to play stupid Toad to really be as fast as possible because Toad can pick the grass just slightly more. But I swear, I swear some of those worlds, I've seen some of the speedrunners do it. And I swear Princess is better than Toad at some of the stuff they're trying to do. So we'll see. We'll see. I'm going to give it a go. Try to work on it. It's hard. It is not as easy as it looks. You have to really time things perfectly in order to be able to do that. So yeah. Dar Tetsuya in chat says hey Toad is not stupid. I'm sorry. I can't stand playing him in Mario 2. He feels so gimp to me in Mario 2. I used to like Toad. The Princess float is so OP. But maybe that's just what I remember when I was a kid is I would play Luigi and the Princess because they both kind of floated. Luigi did a different sort of thing but he was really effective. He can jump higher than anyone and that power jump can really skip entire sections of the game. Let's see Tech 2030 talking about Awesome Games Done Quick saying my favorite thing I watched was the Fez speedrun. Very informative. I'm watching a lot more but not live. I've been binging them as they've been adding them to YouTube all this week. A lot more convenient. I love binging a bunch of them through my Apple TV so I can watch on the big screen. Yeah I used the Twitch app on PlayStation 4 and I watched a lot of it on the big screen. Shane was over last night. We were working on an unrelated thing on his computer and watching Awesome Games Done Quick a little bit and just watching some of the dupe. I don't know if you get a chance to watch a lot of that. Loki I know you with the kids and everything don't always get TV time but did you see anything else? I didn't really watch any. I do like watching them though. I kind of glanced over the schedule and I didn't know what I wanted to watch. Well there was some other stuff I watched too. A little bit of like the Velocity 2X. They had a whole Indie Games block which I thought was really cool because it's kind of bringing awareness to maybe games that people may not know about otherwise. I thought that was pretty cool. Okay here's the crazy part. So Orange Launch Radio started as a music game show which I'm sure you guys all know. We focused on things like Dance Dance Revolution was the big one at the time because that's how Loki, Dar Saka and I all met was at the arcade playing that game. And then we would do things like you know Parappa the Rappa and all this stuff. So over the years when we were more exclusively music games this program that allowed you to play DER on your computer showed up and it was called StepMania was this program. And for the longest time we were kind of sitting here going when StepMania going to get shut down by Konami because basically it's kind of better than DDR PC actually turned out. It does more than what DDR even on the PC did. And I'm thinking StepMania never really got the book thrown at it because I don't think they ever sold it. But if I'm not mistaken and I'm having to go old age memory here but wasn't in the groove adapted from StepMania. Yeah it's basically StepMania. And so that's when Konami got him and that was when In the Groove released on PlayStation 2 is when finally Konami was like throw the book at him basically. And you know we talked extensively about Kyle Ward about this almost a year ago now and talked about that whole thing. So the reason why I bring that up is that obviously what a lot of people were talking about from Awesome Games Done Quick was this guy that was playing actually was it two of them? That was playing I didn't get to see the whole thing but that was playing StepMania and was playing some just really crazy stuff in StepMania that's not meant for actual dancing. Let's be real it's not meant for DDR because you had stuff where it was like hitting all four arrows in between mines where you're not even supposed to be standing on the pad. Like there's stuff you're not going to be able to do with your feet. So it was kind of controversial. Like some people were very much like what the hell is this? This is really cool because this guy is you know banging on the keyboard so hard and so fast that the camera is actually shaking that's you know I guess on the table or whatever like it's just it's just so much it's intense right if you try to play. We always called it finger finger revolution and which leads to all the jokes you can imagine. But StepMania is basically finger finger revolution. And so it goes so fast that you know it's causing things to shake and other people were like what the hell is this doing in awesome games done quick? It's a game like this you don't really run quick there's nothing to do but play the song. And you know there's that technicality that I don't believe this was actually meant to be a speed run it was more of an exhibition what they were doing with Stepania. But still it was it was so weird to see like holy crap topic from 10 years ago is all of a sudden new again in awesome games done quick. But I suppose and there was a part of me that was like I don't know how I feel about that that's so weird but then I think you know they do a lot of obscure games during awesome games done quick. I watched them do this game on the Super Nintendo that was like I don't even know what it was it looked really really garbage and it was only like six levels long and it was really it was really not a great looking game but I was like alright I guess if they can run really obscure stuff like this is StepMania really out of place? Probably not. So I just thought that was that was interesting to observe that whole thing that it was more like it was trending on Facebook right StepMania is like I don't know if you saw on Facebook it was actually in the bar it says here's what's trending on Facebook and like it's like you know dude plays StepMania and it's crazy. And I was just like in a way I'm kind of like I just I don't want to sound hipster but I kind of knew about that six or seven years ago. Well it's a good thing he wasn't playing on the pad because you know as soon as someone starts playing on the pad there's going to be a little kid that runs across so they just that wouldn't have been good for the live stream. Oh my god Dark Tetsuya you you read my mind Lester the Unlikely that was the game I know there was an awful games done quick block yeah that was it and that was the game I saw wow I can't believe you guessed that based off what little I said. Let's see Dungeon Buster says the Crypt of the Necrodancer Coda run was insane. The Lester run was neat it was scheduled super late though not if you're west coast time. Let's see other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. TigerClaws say did you see the Super Metroid two players one controller run that was amazing. I didn't see that I actually missed all the Super Metroid stuff I just wasn't around when it was on I'm sure it'll be on YouTube later and I'll catch it there but two players one controller I know right like you know all those jokes write themselves about that that's pretty crazy but cool so props to Awesome Games Done Quick they raised what like 1.2 million dollars I think for charity and I'm told that it's not as much as they raised last year I think they did 1.5 last year but you know A it's still money for a good cause and B you know the economy is just going to vary year after year and what people can give and just there's so many factors that play into it I still think you know it's only a million dollars I mean that's still an impressive amount of money for and I'm using my quotey fingers here a bunch of gamers to be collecting for a great charity so you know what that's that's 1.2 million dollars well spent fuck cancer right so yeah good on you guys with Awesome Games Done Quick and everybody who donated and all that stuff one more thing before I move on on the step mania Awesome Games Done Quick stuff somebody else is bringing up in the Awesome Games Done Quick there was also the Super Nintendo game Lagoon which is really funny to me that that was in the awful games done quick statement because Lagoon I remember that game vividly from when I was younger and the Super Nintendo was out and that was I really think Lagoon was the first video game I ever rented and it was a game that I rented more than once I actually really enjoyed it but again I was what 12 years old so you forgive a lot of the things that you look back on and are really dopey now you know video games have come a long way and bad translations were just it's something that was part of the charm in the Super Nintendo era you know like Final Fantasy 4 and you spoonie bard you know just some of the some of the funny little things that happen in translation I think were always you know kind of epic and so obviously Lagoon has a lot of those issues but I got to admit as a 12 year old I didn't really notice them as much as people do now so it's kind of I don't know it's the whole thing's funny to me for some reason so alright before we get into our gaming week I actually had a second topic to bring up here because I just thought you know it's the beginning of the year here we are 2016 we're past our predictions and all that stuff but there's a lot of gaming anniversaries to be celebrated this year you know we saw as we saw a lot of them last year right Super Mario Brothers turned 30 and we had Super Mario Maker as a result of that right so I would like to present for you right now some anniversaries coming up this year and I'm gonna listen carefully for the pain it's gonna cause you when you go oh my god I'm old oh god I'm so old so let's take a moment to write really feel old everybody you ready and I want all caps in chat as you guys feel old so here we go on January 29th Duke Nukem 3D turns 20 that's awesome Duke Nukem 3D not the original but the 3D one that was you know the multiplayer and all that probably still better than Duke Nukem Forever the best game they probably ever did in that series 20 years old this month I remember playing that game in college in the dorms I'm feeling really old right now February 21st the Legend of Zelda turns 30 30 years old for Zelda which makes sense cause Super Mario turned 30 last year but do you know what turns 20 in February 20 years old you ready Pokemon red and green or as it was here in the states blue Pokemon red and blue turn 20 years old in February that broke somebody guess what else turns 20 in March Resident Evil Resident Evil came out 20 years ago this year it does feel that old too going from the chat I think Resident Evil out of any of the game series it really needs a tomb raider-esque reboot like something Tech 2030 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Rob why stop it no because this is what I have to go through every day when somebody tells me about how old they were when something comes out and it's just for fun come on let's see also Tiger Claw in chat says you know what turns 43 in February me well happy early birthday Tiger Claw and the Bobby Black Wolf keeps saying oh that came out when I was 9 that came out when I was 9 because you know the 29 joke yes I understand all right let's see oh also celebrating 30 years in May Dragon Quest turns 30 in May which again a game of the NES era makes sense for some reason I was sick thinking Dragon Age I'm like that isn't that old yes I'm a little slow today all right and in June Quake turns 20 20 years old is the original Quake with the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack which made it so cool for kids my age at the teenagers my age when that first came out let's see and then turning 25 of course talk about this last week on the show and this no surprise Sonic the Hedgehog is 25 in June I can't wait to see what awesome game they put out to celebrate the 25th anniversary here's one that surprised me do you know what else turns 20 in June 20 years ago the Nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64 20 years old in June and then let's see in September 30 years of Castlevania and I don't care anymore about that in October and September 30 years of Castlevania and I don't care anymore about that in October 20 years of Tomb Raider doesn't feel 20 years old probably because the new one it almost it feels just like a new series like you don't even remember the old series at least I don't I'd still vaguely I just remember topless Lara mods that's all I remember from the old games slush colored triangles and pyramids in December civilization turns 25 that's one of my favorite civilizations they ever did was the original and I remember going to the computer store that's not even there I think that I think it's like a hairdressing place now not even there that plays or that game is 25 years old all right only a couple more don't turn the show off don't turn show off I've got three more three more here's one for Loki in October command and conquer red alert turns 20 yeah I probably I remember picking that up when it first came all right and two more for you in December the end of the year 20 years of Diablo Diablo gonna be 20 years old it it doesn't feel that way it doesn't feel that old until you look at a screenshot of Diablo and then remember oh wow this game really is super old all right one more you ready for this 35 years old 35 the oldest one of the list 35 years of Donkey Kong this year the original oh god does that mean we're in another Donkey Kong game maybe yeah that could be something in store for the Nintendo NX who knows thank god it's a Frogger anniversary year well Konami is not really making games anymore maybe a mobile thing who knows there it is there you go there's I'm sorry to make you guys break down in tears I think tech 2030 has said he will be boycotting next year this week this the episode this week but there you go a little trip down memory lane and we'll probably be bringing up a little more memories of those franchises as we get closer to those anniversaries throughout the year the stuff that gets me and I'm glad none of it was on the list the stuff that gets me is 10 years old or and pretty soon it's gonna be 15 years old because especially next year when we start looking back at games that are 15 years old you know what that's gonna mean those are games they're as old as this show because 2017 will be 15 years of Orange Lounge Radio if we make it if I am not killed by an angry mob for the segment we just did on the show so we'll we'll have to hope for that dark tatsuyu in chat suggesting a Frogger pachinko machine for Frogger's anniversary you never know anything anything's possible there let's see also going to a chat over at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says so what you're saying is that everything in the world came out in 1995 no it's uh it's uh 1996 it's 20 years from this year and yeah actually that was a really big year for games I remember that was the year I went off to college and those those are pretty big year for games so not surprised all a lot of this stuff is is coming up on that anniversary so all right um let's get into how was your gaming week every week here on the show we like to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week sort of to establish our frame of reference that we come to the show with tonight Loki would you care to start us off how was your gaming week yeah I mainly just played Fallout 4 so that's god I don't even know how many days into that game I am but basically played every day so you know for a few hours every day I think last I remember because I only see that when I actually save my game and I think it's like four or five days worth of game so somewhere in there and then let's see what else have I been playing I played a little bit Disney 3.0 because you know my son wants me to level up his characters and stuff and I'm trying to convince him like to actually fight something or you know to play the game so instead of just the toy box mode I'm like dude you've got like we bought you the spider-man set so they have the spider-man levels and we have the Avenger levels still that you haven't played through it all we have almost all of the characters now for those you maybe should play the levels but no no he still wants to play in his toy box mode that he set up and that's fine that's what he wants to do it's so I leveled up I've Sam Flynn that was like level 18 out of 20 now so it's you know pretty much I can't be killed with him anymore and I don't know so I played that and then aside from those two and there's one other thing I'm you know playing a little bit Ingress today I drove out into the middle of nowhere for no reason the freaking things that game makes you do you know I drove this finally I was like I've got like time like I don't know what I'm going to really do right now I'm like I'll drive out there that's fine it's kind of cool in a way that you get to see things you'd never go see otherwise and actually I drove to I own a couple weeks ago like I was surprised I'm also not that far away is no it's really not so who knew you know so they have a good restaurant there too so drove out there and like it was funny this is like a drove way out there and they're like yeah they're trying to get me to go up the street a little bit to knock out another one I'm like but it's just like a little bit over there I'm just gonna go I drove all this way I'm not gonna drive the show for Ingress is an excuse that wouldn't even work with me Loki so whatever it's fine and I haven't really been playing that much lately because I'm on my new work schedule now which means I have weekends off now thank God I don't work Saturdays anymore that's good but that also means that I start earlier and I get off during like I did pick up the kids after work so I don't have that few hours before work that I used to do stuff and actually farm and all that now so like I have like no gear at all there's something else they played this week also I'm trying to think it was what was it I think I played a little bit more of laser life and I just I'm not really getting into that game it's okay but there's like I don't really there's like no story to it it seems like so I don't know it's alright I think that's it that's all I played all right that's it for your gaming week my gaming week I actually played a couple new games this week PlayStation 4 wise I downloaded at Shane's recommendation and the fact that it was on sale and Shane told me that him and Flaco Jones and and mrs. Flaco Jones were all playing this game roundabout on the PlayStation oh yes yes and we're laughing their asses off hysterically at it and so I was like alright funny I was I it's a lot of like cheesy and I remember talking about the game on the show and I was like oh yeah yeah I remember that came upon OLR and I wanted to get that and I just kind of blinked and missed its PlayStation 4 release so oh it's on sale sure I'll get it now so I I paid five bucks and download a roundabout and I played it a little bit I have to admit I didn't get the hilarity factor as much as no I'm kind of where it wasn't super hilarious for me either it was just kind of like silly or I should say I shouldn't I shouldn't falsely say that Flaco was so it was all via Shane via Shane but I can imagine if I had had a few glasses of wine at the Jones's household then this game would probably be a lot funnier but I still thought I mean it definitely had like that cheese factor I'm not sitting here like completely humorous like nothing was funny pout no there were some like humorous things in it but you know I didn't I didn't laugh out loud but the game itself it's about the game anyway and the game itself is a really kind of silly mechanic but it's it is it is fun it's I actually kind of think of it more like a puzzle game than an action game here's the deal is that you're driving a limo and you're trying to get from place to place in the city but your limo consistently spins round and round and round so why it spins I have no fucking idea that's just the game okay that's why it's called roundabout is that this limo just spins round and round and round so you can't hit walls and trees and stuff because each time you do you're gonna hear this note that goes and on the fifth note your limo explodes although I would have thought there'd be a hilarious cutscene where the people inside explode but that never happens so it's it's trickier than it sounds because you're trying to like navigate around walls and navigate around actual roundabouts which is actually kind of tricky to do while your limo is consistently spinning around so in a way I kind of think it's a puzzler because you have to think about how to get through certain parts but of course the game rewards you if you can go faster and if you can collect these coins in sequence so there is a more in-depth complexity to it so it's it's one of those indie games that's like kind of really simple in concept but it has a lot of depth to it and then they threw these really cheesy full motion videos at it for I'm not sure the reason but it was it was humorous I'll use that word I found it to be humorous but I didn't find it to be like oh my god it's so funny maybe I just didn't get far enough but I played a lot with Shane last night and he said the date thing was the funniest thing and I was like it's it's humorous but it's not it's not strangers I want to say it's the same company that made gun stringer they did like a lot of really cheesy motion video stuff as well so yeah so anyway that I let's see Dungeon Buster and chat over at live.com says spinning car smashing into trees exploding sounds like a typical day in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row for me yeah but this game is all like it's more like a classic arcade kind of setup because it's more to those like top down maybe classic Grand Theft Auto but that's that's what it is anyway I do think especially when the game cost only five dollars I think that was really well worth it I got mine for like 374 or something like that really what is it normally 10 10 I don't have a price to I would say even 15 is pretty darn good if it's 1999 that might start to be pushing it a little bit but I still think for some people you know if you like those old arcade type of things or if you have a box of wine and I'm going to say a box of wine it will make for a fun little party game to play with friends if none of you have played it before I would say that'd be good use your money then the other game I played this week which I did spend 1999 on amplitude came out this week on PlayStation 4 and you might remember a while ago I talked about that I wasn't going to kickstart the game but I ended up it seemed a lot of my friends were really enjoying it and I was hearing a lot of good feedback on it so I went ahead and bought the game and it's amplitude it's definitely the game that I remember from you know the PlayStation 2 days especially in the way it's set up the controls obviously very similar and so on I'm going to say something that is not going to make me popular though it's it's not as good it's not the ship kind of sailed on the PlayStation 2 version and the frequency and amplitude and either for me the reason why it's not as good is the music isn't as great as it was in the PlayStation 2 version it's not as varied I am all for supporting indie bands and I think the game is at its strongest when it's relying on some of the guest contributors for example the freeze pop song actually that song in a way is so fucking good it's probably the best freeze pop song they've ever put in a game and that probably like carries the song list almost on its back that freeze pop song is so good and then like I like the crypto the necro dancer song and amplitude and so forth otherwise I found a lot of it to be generic and I know I'm going I'm going to so get torn anyone by amplitude fans but this is my opinion take it or leave it and you're welcome to leave it I think part of what made the amplitude on PlayStation 2 and frequency fun is that they were songs you kind of knew so you kind of knew the beats to them so like when you would play things like cherry lips by garbage or what was it by blink-182 the rock show some of the songs rented it was like you know okay I kind of I kind of know how this goes a little bit and you know it's all cool I'm playing the song that I've actually heard before and then I think one of the places where the formula worked at its absolute best was rock band blitz that game was awesome and the fact that it also used your rock band dlc I would actually have rather they ported rock band blitz to PlayStation 4 and Xbox one sorry but that's how I kind of wish that's the game they brought back for this era was that but you know what again taste when it comes to things like music is kind of subjective and you may completely disagree with me and that's totally okay if you are looking for strictly gameplay mechanics of what you remember from amplitude on PlayStation 2 and frequency then this game will deliver that absolutely and you never know what might come through with dlc so I would not give this game like a bad rating because it's still a good music game I just think I I would be really excited if the old PlayStation 2 game would show up on as a PlayStation 2 classic on PlayStation 4 I realized due to licensing etc that's not going to happen but that doesn't mean I don't think that would have been something I'd prefer so anyway okay now I'm going to turn around and look at chat and see see if I'm getting yelled at over at live dot vog network dot com let's see let's see our fifth dream and chat says rock band song should carry over to amplitude or maybe dlc let's see why why are in chat says yeah thrown together is what I think when I look at the amplitude song list and that's geo 100 matt says I'm not surprised by this why why are in chat says it's like they forgot that a music game lives or dies by its music I wonder if dlc is coming wow I'm kind of surprised that there's a lot of chatters that sort of get it wow okay so I guess I'm not alone I was fully expecting to get toward a new one by some of the music longtime music game fans but you know again I think you just I think you just really have to weigh I mean if you are a longtime music game fan then just think it amplitude because it is going to be enough of what you remember of the past games I'm just saying the song list you're going to kind of go I want to play the freeze pop song the freeze pop song is so good and then I'm going to play the freeze pop song again because that's kind of what I did I played the freeze pop song like 20 times and the crypt of the necrodancer song is good too and there's a there's a couple other good ones too I don't want to I don't want to disrespect the artists but it's just a lot of it is very in house band to do something like a spin off of that kind of like how about rock band blitz on PlayStation cross between like amplitude and like a DJ hero type game I'll be great you know they kind of make that and again I I just want to make sure this is clear I'm not against indie music or discovering like new music and games because Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 2 which was the best version best home version they ever made and I stand by that to this day and part of the reason why was the variety of independent catchy songs that were in it and these like bands that I had never heard of that I grew to really love like echo image that was in Ultra Mix 2 is like one of my favorite why I only put out one album even if they only put out one fucking album but it's a fucking great album I think it's on Spotify at this point so let's see also in chat SJ100 Matt saying I don't think that it getting more funding during the campaign would have helped this why we are saying actual dance music that helps yes that's part of the reason why we should totally play skulk during break I can make that happen I think you should teach the kids today sadly the podcast listeners don't get that that's right that's why you're here live when we break that's what YouTube's for Spotify all that stuff we'll do that okay so that was that was my gaming week especially in a nutshell those those are the two new games I picked up otherwise I've been continuing on with stuff I've already played before like Final Fantasy 14 continuing to get my tomes and oddly enough minecraft this week I just sometimes you just want to you just want minecraft and chill so would you play minecraft on ps4 thank the only reason I ask because I have like on every platform now so it's like ridiculous yeah no and then I started playing and I started to build my little hut because you know you kind of have to especially if you're playing in survival mode you kind of have to build at least a rudimentary house really quick to kind of keep you safe at night at least in the beginning I do and then so I built the whole thing but then I didn't have enough wool for a bed I forgot I needed to kill more sheep and so what is standing right outside my house a creeper who then sees me promptly walks in my house blows up my house what's behind my house after he blew it up one of the endermen and I'm like wasn't I on easy but endermen will hurt you unless you stare at them you can walk right up to them poke well don't poke them but you can walk right up to them they won't hurt you unless you stare at their eyes interesting yeah I just I don't know that just irritated me that happened right away so it kind of put me in a foul mood then I then I wasn't in such a chill mood after that but I will give it another go I still think minecraft is a very zen game so that's that's how I feel about that I think minecraft is a very lazy game yyr in chat says how do you kind of play a game oh wait that's not response something I said that's a response to a fifth dream saying I'm kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 right now not putting as much effort into it like lazily playing it yes I think when I think kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 is like if you're really playing 14 you're logging in and you're doing your dungeon every day to get your tomes and you're grinding you're crafting to get all your scripts and you're doing your dailies with the vanu vanu you're doing all that stuff kind of playing is like I'm gonna log in and I'll do like a bot I'll see if anybody from the free company's on we'll pretend this is a chat room and I'll just chat with my friends while I run around the housing district and jump I'll check the market boards and I'll log off that's kind of playing Final Fantasy 14 when it when it when an MMO is just chat room with swords and spells then that's your kind of playing the MMO I think Bobby Blackwolf in chat says that was me in Final Fantasy 14 in the end which is why I stopped paying and playing yeah I mean if you know you're not getting enough of the game out of it I can I can understand why if fifth dream says I've got it in the background and I go back and forth I I definitely will have Final Fantasy in one window while I do stuff that's what two monitors are for MMO in one window and then sometimes I listen to a podcast especially if somebody I know is live which tangentially I just want to give a quick shout out to my buddies Captain Spike and Slidekick over at gamebuoy.org they hit 100 episodes today and you know what they did to celebrate 100 episodes they finally did a live show so I did a live show today I'm very nice very proud of my base over at gamebuoy.org and the fact that they they did a live show so I just want to make sure that shout out got there and happy 100 episodes to those guys so yeah and I'll oftentimes there's a live show on in the evening I'll definitely do MMOs while I listen to live shows so all right that's it for our gaming week housekeeping tonight I don't have a lot of new information I will just remind you all I'm gonna be at magfest not in any sort of official capacity it's not like we have a booth or anything but I'll just kind of be there maybe I'll start a topic on the forums over at vognetwork.com get a feeling if there's going to be other people there and maybe we can do like an unofficial official vog meetup maybe do like a dinner thing like we did at PAX East one year even if that's just you know just getting some pizzas and chilling in a particular room or hallway or something I don't know what the atmosphere is like at magfest yet but I get the impression it's just one giant party so we'll do some type of little unofficial vog meetup and that's really what we'll do for that I'm just excited to get to the con and check it out that's gonna be a lot of fun and there is going to be quite a representation from what I understand Bobby Blackwolf still making plans to go I don't know if that's been a hundred percent confirmed but I have plane tickets and hotels so I'm going absolutely and meeting up with some of my buddies who podcast on Koopa Club another show that I enjoy and they will be out there at magfest with me so it's gonna be a lot of podcast stuff Bobby Blackwolf confirmed I have hotel I'll be driving so there you go so there there's gonna be at least two vog hosts there and I don't know who else I don't know if Rama might be actually be going fifth dream in chat asking about conventions is sky going to Final Fantasy fan fest 2016 difficult to say until tickets go on sale and I make sure it's reasonable and that I can get there but my plan is to be there if I can get to Final Fantasy fan fest the plan is to be there just you know it's a little far out and too many factors for me to a hundred percent commit to that I can tell you I will not be trying for BlizzCon this year I'm just there's just so many other conventions I want to do I've decided to I cut PAX PAX East last year and this year I'm this year I cut PAX East I'm also gonna cut BlizzCon out of the rotation just because unfortunately you know now that Horde house is kind of sunsetted I don't really have a lot the only Blizzard game I actively play a lot of is Diablo 3 and although I really think this is going to be Diablo 3's big year I just don't think there's going to be a lot a lot of BlizzCon for me if I could swing the time off of work I might do DizCon and check out some of the parties but I just the reality is I don't think BlizzCon is going to make the rotation this year I will be opting to do hopefully there'll be a gamer x4 this year and doing magfest as well and some other stuff here locally in April Sac Indie Arcade is coming back and VoG Network's been asked to participate again which surprise Loki no no that's I'm not surprised I already knew that okay yeah I've been trying to work on my game I got I got no games gonna pressure you that would be a good day to do it though if you're gonna do any day do that that day in April I want to get it I really try not to like it's hard because my wife watches TV and I find TV fascinating so I watch TV as well and it's it's very distracting I get like two lines of code done and Bobby Blackwolf in chat reminding us VoG jam submissions were due one year ago also so anniversary celebrating an anniversary this year the VoG jam one year old let's see why we are saying that he's been waitlisted sadly that right now he's on the waitlist to try to get in multitasking to show off at magfest but he's hopeful that some folks he knew that were waitlisted last year eventually got in and he said if I do wind up with a space I will plug OLR and or VoG appreciate that buddy I'll bring I'm gonna bring flyers I don't know what magfest fliering policy is but if they're at your booth I don't think they can get mad at me for that so I will bring that and Rama sadly saying I'm probably backing out that's a bummer doesn't matter but Rama does a lot of cons so I understand he has to be picky choosy because money don't grow on trees and you might not have the money for a convention ticket and you might not have the money to buy an oculus riff this year right Loki I would like to have the money especially since my wife is insisting on new claim that was it the Powerball that's gonna be up to 1.3 billion dollars on Wednesday oh yeah oh that's the other thing you guys I had a Powerball ticket that was a winner and not only was it a win I mean obviously I didn't win the 900 million I had two numbers and the Powerball and I'm not type words like okay I bought the ticket and I just kind of kept it away and then when I heard on the news nobody in California won I was just like whatever I didn't win and you know I'll check the ticket when I get around to it so finally in the car today I was like oh yeah I should check the ticket and see if I won anything and then I realized holy shit we match two numbers and the Powerball on one of these now granted I'm not expecting to win thousands of dollars but I was like that might be like like a hundred bucks to do because you get four bucks for just matching the Powerball if you just match the Powerball which would lucky 13 a lot of people did this last drawing you won like four bucks so to get two numbers out of the five and the Powerball I was like holy shit this tickets gonna be like $250 that's awesome like you know it's not gonna change my life but it's gonna hey exactly it's something to buy some booze with right okay it was $8 I got $8 that's still not bad I mean it's something but I poured it of course I poured it right back into as what my mom calls it's a stupid tax Rob if you play the lottery you're just paying the stupid tax well let's go there and you give them your $10 I can't wait you can kiss it goodbye because only stupid people play well someone's gonna get a stupid tax return and it's gonna be you know whatever you know why it's fun and it yes and you have like a you know a very minimal chance of winning so does everybody else so who cares so I put that $8 prize right back into the stupid tax that's like when you win on a slot machine in Vegas you win like a small prize or in Reno for me you win a small prize like five but it just goes right back in the machine or Dolly Parton gave me $60 and yes she did last time I was in Reno on one of her machines there's a Dolly Parton machine and you know my gay ass played the Dolly Parton machine so I played that and I won like 60 70 bucks off that which is like a nickel slot and I was like woohoo and so what did I do I took the $60 to dollar slots and just watched it all piss away but oh well it's it's just for fun set your limits before you go don't take your bank card down to the gambling room with you and you're fine so let's see going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com YYR in chat says so here's the thing you may have only won seven bucks excuse me eight bucks don't short me any more than they are in the cost of the the ticket maybe the tickets are two bucks oh that's even worse but the odds of matching two numbers plus the Powerball are one in 701.33 so you should feel awesome YYR says Powerball.com says it was seven bucks no I assure you I got eight dollars today I wonder if the money's different in each state I wonder if maybe the state has to pay things out certain because you know when it's under like 50 bucks you just take it to where you bought it and they pull the money out of the register like I just everybody like all the liquor stores and gas stations in town swarmed with people grocery store has a kiosk you can just walk right up any time of day and buy a lottery ticket there's never a line so I just went to the grocery store and they just here's eight bucks what would you like I don't even know like I would have to like hand walk that winning ticket somewhere it's like oh I'm gonna trust the US Postal Service with this no no are you kidding that's the benefit of living in Sacramento I would march down to the lottery office it's powerful though I don't think that's California you still you still redeem it with the California Lottery oh yeah I'd be like I with my newly obtained lawyer would go and redeem that prize I don't know Tiger Clon chat says the sky wins the Powerball he'll quit his job and probably retire from any everything yeah I don't know I haven't really thought about how I would spend the money and I like the people at my job I wouldn't want to just screw them over but yeah obviously sure I'd love to say all around the world in a yacht but you hear about so many people dying in yacht accidents I know no that just pissed the money away they win the lottery and then they pissed money 1.3 billion dollars you can piss a lot of that but you can fill the ocean with piss for that kind of money I mean it doesn't really matter and that's that's what I'm gonna do you know what if I win the Powerball first first on the agenda take care of my parents that's number one on the agenda second on the agenda dig a pool in Loki's backyard and fill it with pee that it's gonna be second luck there's a nice little drainage pipe going through the backyard you're gonna get about six inches down before you hit the storm line with a billion dollars they can rear out that fucking line damn straight all right another as a sky would you buy a mansion let's not this is these stupid thoughts are how they get a mansion a mansion stupid thoughts are how they get you to buy the tickets in the first place exactly it's half the fun if I win my goal is to be responsible and a little irresponsible where appropriate that's that's why controlling shares and Konami burn it to the ground if I win Powerball I'm fucking buying Konami I am fucking buying Konami that's it if I win Powerball I'm buying hostile takeover hostile takeover Rob and we're gonna change the name to Rob Roberts on to me and I'm gonna fucking own Metal Gear wait for it that's what I'm doing with the Powerball and you know what the first thing I'm gonna do is PT is fucking coming back and I don't care if we have to like you know get Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima hand jobs in order to make that happen I'll have 1.3 billion dollars it'll happen anyways let's get enough Powerball wank let's get into the news and talk about something that maybe I could afford with 1.3 billion dollars right Logan exactly so the Oculus Rift they announced the price they announced when it's coming out so now all you have to do is go order it it's $600 supposed to be launching in March and $600 that's quite a bit of money of course you're also gonna need to have a PC to run that which will probably run you in about at least another $1,200 $1,300 and what do you get with that well you also get of course a couple games that's gonna be launching with Eve Valkyrie also Lucky's Tale and then of course you get you know the Xbox one controller and everything so I don't know that's a little too rich for my blood for right now just because I don't have a PC to run it and you know really it comes down to like how much am I really going to use this because right now I don't use the DK 2 very much but then again my PC doesn't run it very well so maybe if it ran it like it's supposed to I might use it a little bit more a lot of people are screaming the sky is falling about the price I don't it the problem is like the price is not a big deal if you have the marketing behind it to convince people that they need to purchase it the problem is when you have a price like that you're gonna get people that are already excited about it to maybe buy it but that's it it's like yeah you want you want as many people to buy it so there's more support behind it so there's you know it just kind of a big cycle so you get more people excited because there's more software out there for it which means that the price is a little bit more worth it and so on but I think a factor that played into this as well is that you know they said at one point whether it was an offhanded comment or not people as expectation was it was going to be what 350 that was the expectation at one point whether it was an offhanded comment or not so when it kind of was a little higher than that I think some people were kind of irritated because they felt like wait a minute I was budgeting this amount of money or I expected it at this and now it's this and even though you know 599 that's how much a PlayStation 3 cost when it first came out but we also kind of hazed the shit out of that press conference when the PlayStation 3 was first announced 599 US dollars 599 you know I don't know I think I think I made a prediction on the show a couple weeks ago where I said Oculus is going to do all right but it's going to be kind of limited to that I need to go back because you know maybe I'm giving myself more credit than I deserve but I still remember saying it's still going to be a niche thing but it'll it'll be a thing and it's not going to necessarily be just a flash in the pan and I think this price kind of cements it as a niche thing at least for now who knows what happens a year from now you know the great thing about the price technology it falls PlayStation 3's are now not even what 149 for a place well yeah but the thing for me it's like it it reminds me a lot of 3D TV like 3D TV is like this amazing technology that it was super expensive and there's people that got on board with it but they didn't really do a great job of explaining why you needed it you know what made it so great why you need to spend that and now it's kind of just like well it's been taken a backseat they don't really have a lot of 3D TVs out there at least it's not something that they're selling people on it now it's all about 4k and that type of stuff but I don't know one other thing too is if you did back the original Kickstarter you're going to be and that's at the development kit level so $300 or higher you'll be getting a consumer rift as well and at no additional charge which is kind of nice it's hard to hate on that that's pretty rad that you know you don't hear about that with a lot of kickstarters that kind of go beyond the rewards that were promised for their investors and I have a hard time expressing anything but congratulations for those people that believed in it enough that now they're gonna get this thing that you know for many people they felt they've been priced out of so props to them I can't be mad at that yep and then of course you know basically there's an AMA that can't it kind of happened right after the announcement which you know lucky basically said you know apologize that you know the communication of the price wasn't exactly the messaging wasn't handled well I guess a lot of people's expectation was a supposed to be a lot lower but it is what it is so I don't know I think I hope it does well but I'm just worried with the price if they're the market behind it to like get people hyped up about it as much as like anything else that Apple releases that's ridiculously overpriced then I think that this has a pretty good chance but it's just the problem is it's not just six hundred dollars out it's not like an iPhone where it's just six hundred dollars you know out the gate and that's it you also need a computer to run it and like for the average consumer they're not gonna have that you know your mom and pop or whatever it's not gonna have like a gaming PC that can run this shit. Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwell pointing out they don't need the marketing they sold out of all their first shipments you know I don't I don't know how many that was but that you know at least I guess looks promising but I think again you know when you consider in a niche thing that's not I'm not a niche isn't negative either I think yeah the hardcore audience and the people that really I think there's enough people they really kind of believe in this I want to see it happen that are going to be early adopters it's like the early iPhones that were so expensive you know there are people that buy the early technology how appropriate this being the week of Consumer Electronics Show which I know we didn't really bring up in our kickoff topic because there wasn't really a lot of gaming news that came out of the show but there's a lot of gadgets that are really high dollar there that people will pay a lot of money for electric cars too not even just Tesla's but Prius and you know Leaf and all that stuff those are pretty expensive cars but I really think the price of those things is I think the Prius already was one of those things that was a lot a lot a lot of money when it first came out and it's coming down year after year so you know and there's no reason to believe that the others won't follow suit similarly especially you know it'll be interesting to see what happens with the whole Tesla thing as they start to expand where those charging stations are and all of that and they can you know kind of get more of them out there but anyway I'm getting a bit off track you know there's early tech adopters and then there's everybody else I'm excited for it I do want to eventually get one but it's just I've got to build a new PC for that and I do want to do that maybe that's more of a motivation for me to finish a game so that I can you know have the money coming in to hopefully purchase a PC to be able to run this in Now Facebook you know obviously Facebook bought Oculus a couple years ago and that was a whole other controversy but you know speaking about marketing I kind of think Facebook is doing the right thing right now is that Facebook doesn't need to be running commercials on TV and during the Super Bowl right now like Bobby said they sold out of the first shipment the geek crowd is going to carry it right now they know there's enough people interested in it based on Kickstarter etc it's going fine right now but what's interesting about Facebook being involved is that if you look at your friends list feed right now on Facebook which many slightly tech savvy people almost all of them have a Facebook unless you're one of those anti-Facebook people but as you scroll through your Facebook feed you'll see that there's 3D videos already there in your Facebook feed especially if you do it on mobile phone and you'll notice you can take your phone and move it around and it actually shows you like a 3D video I went there like a podrace from Star Wars it was on there not that long ago which I know there was no podrace in the new movie but they were still showing some type of like sample thing I don't know I feel like that's something I saw but they're already starting to condition you that 3D videos are a normal thing you see in your feed you see where this is going Facebook is planting the seeds they might not be doing heavy marketing with commercials and everything they don't need to right now but they're starting to get you used to the idea that 3D video is a thing that we share just like we share selfies and gifts on the internet so I kind of think Facebook is starting to lay the seeds for that now going to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com some folks are talking about there's a little debate going on in there about the PlayStation VR and how that's going to play a role and I guess the fact that Amazon Canada had a posting that was quickly taken down that PlayStation said you know was nothing has been announced basically they didn't deny the price of $800 I don't think they have to deny the price they didn't say they just didn't say they have an announcement they never really like even if they're they have a price out there they're not gonna say that's not the price they're just gonna say we don't have anything to announce that's how they always handle it you know what though I still there's still a huge grain of salt I'm taking with this and part of the reason why is that you know assuming everything was accidental which I have no reason to believe it wasn't completely accidental and shit happens and that maybe they had some type of placeholder in their system as Amazon often does when I ordered Kingdom Hearts 3 for yeah Kingdom Hearts 3 for what was like 40 bucks they had it on sale at one point you know these things happen in the system I think it's possible that maybe Sony is totally okay with people thinking it's $800 so that way when they come in and they announce the price is $699 it doesn't seem so bad so I don't know there's still a grain of salt they take with that like there's still a part of me that's like well $800 means system and VR right because that's a lot to pay for just the VR headset I mean we do know that the Playstation VR is gonna be not just the headset but the little processor box as well so you know the Oculus doesn't have that little processor box so I mean $800 wouldn't be unheard of but that's gonna really I mean that's gonna be what the rich kids have at home at least this year and there's gonna really have to be the software that substantiates it you know what's that game that's worth $800 I hope that it just works as a second monitor so I can play Fallout 4 while my wife is watching TV because I seriously okay so seriously like this is what I did this week as well as part of the time I had built or bought parts to build this thing it was gonna be a second screen device that was gonna basically be like the Wii U gamepad but gonna be used for any system and so I have the parts for it I have a wireless HDMI extender basically for everything and I hooked it up and didn't fucking work with the Playstation 4 it just got no image whatsoever it worked with the 360 but I attempted to do something like that but it would be nice to have that second headset to be able to view everything plus the VR stuff I just think without the $800 game it's going to be sunk as much as I love Rez and I heard Shane's enthusiasm for Rez VR and all that I don't think that's an $800 game so you know if and it's a huge if bolded underlined italicized if the price of that thing really is $800 then there's got to be the $800 game that goes with it and I'm not sure anything we've seen so far is that game but we'll see we'll see what happens I imagine at this point GDC I mean if it is kind of an expensive techie thing I think they'll roll it out on the stage of GDC as opposed to E3 because E3 is where all your newspaper around the country and all those people are tied into if Sony announces a huge price like that it'll be in USA Today they announce something at GDC that's going to be a little more at the tech crowd level so we'll see I mean GDC isn't usually the place to roll out those sorts of announcements but it wouldn't be out of character for Sony Sony did announce the move there I believe at GDC I know they did Home one year so it's not out of character for them I would like another Home especially tied in with VR would be pretty cool That would be interesting especially if it ends up being part of the package could help at least justify the price if it's you know better than Home as it was anyway there's a lot of what ifs to be discovered with PlayStation VR and hopefully we'll have the answers in the coming weeks we'll see but I just I really don't I think $800 is just too far out there and I really think PlayStation I just my gut says Sony knows they cannot get on a stage in a massive form and say the word $599 again they're going to have to get it under that price I just think I'm just kind of convinced that's what they got to do whether that's a practical idea or not and I've said this before and it's been a while but man a new Ridge Racer launching a system that would be pretty badass alright let's move on I got to move on to something that's actually kind of really sad in nature but actually it was as far as the video games itself there was a lot a lot in this early week of the year but we did have a real tragedy that happened in the video game world this week and regretfully I have to report on this is that one of the voice actresses from Final Fantasy 14 unfortunately was found murdered this past week and there's no really easy way to say that but Sian Blake who actually played Yugiri in Final Fantasy 14 now if you don't know Yugiri, Yugiri was a character that was not in the original Realm Reborn but Yugiri showed up in one of the later patches and was revealed to be an Al-Ra which was the new race so she was a character that tied together the two expansions tied together Realm Reborn into Heavensward and of course she carries on into Heavensward her part isn't, it's not a main character level part but still a very important part of the story so Sian Blake who played Yugiri was actually found dead and I apologize this is gruesome but her two children were also murdered and her partner Arthur Kent Arthur Simpson Kent, excuse me, is missing and the police are looking for him in connection to the deaths and obviously that's just very, very sick now that we're talking about children many of you overseas probably heard about this but you didn't hear, you didn't know there necessarily was a video game connection Sian Blake was actually one of the stars of EastEnders which people here in the States don't really know about that but over in Britain it's, you know, a long, long running soap opera there so a lot of the British reports are mentioning that it was an EastEnders actress that died but that's the same person if you didn't know of course a lot of vigils and memoriums going on inside Final Fantasy XIV in remembrance of Sian Blake and I'm sure there's some people wondering what's going to happen to the character, what's going to happen to the voice actor I have a feeling, A, if you're curious to show up in more patches a lot of the dialogue has probably already been recorded I would imagine all of the 3.0 Heaven's Word storyline, all of it was already written a long time ago and it's probably already all been acted also changing voice actors isn't completely out of character for Square Enix In this game, Final Fantasy XIV, a lot of notable voice actors actually changed between Realm Reborn and Heaven's Word like Gideon Emery who does Balthier in Final Fantasy XII plays Oranger in Final Fantasy XIV and they totally changed the voice actor going into Heaven's Word so that was a little bit, some of those voice actor changes were surprising so unfortunately this is a tragedy but the reality is we have to talk about what's going to happen with the game so if Ugiri continues on they'll probably change the voice actor or voice actress I could see where maybe they would write the character out, out of respect to this actress perhaps but one thing to also consider is that there are voice actors in other languages as well Sian did the English voice, there's still a Japanese voice actor and I think they do voice in French and German? but hoping that Square Enix in some sort of official capacity does do some sort of memorial for Sian Blake I think it would be great if maybe they could sell a pet and maybe donate it to some type of children's charity since unfortunately children were involved in this tragedy, I think it would be a very great gesture for Square Enix maybe a memory of Sian Blake, maybe a special holiday event in the game where there might be a pet and maybe they can raise funds and donate it to a children's shelter or a women's shelter of domestic abuse or something something to, at least we can get some positive ending to this tragic, tragic story and I really don't know what else to say about it, I'm sorry to be such a downer but it happened and sometimes they're going to affect the games that we play, especially a game like Final Fantasy XIV that is still unfolding there's not a beginning and an end for that game yet, so we'll see anyhow, let's try to lighten the tone a little bit more and go back to Loki with some other news so there's rumors or news about the NX, basically saying that they're going to be announcing some sort of concept version of it kind of like what it is, letting people know about that, between March and May and then the actual unveil of the console is going to be in June and it's going to be launching somewhere between October and November, probably during the holiday and because of this it's probably going to eat into some of the sales of the Wii U and 3DS this is coming from Nomura Securities, so I don't know, I guess that makes sense would that time frame mean like a GDC type announcement? no, I think E3 or bust, but I think there's an assumption from a lot of people that it necessarily means it's going to be winter this year and I understand that's what a lot of analysts are saying, is that it's 2016, but what if it's still the fiscal year? they could do a spring launch next year and that would not be out of character for Nintendo, they did the 3DS right? and they could do it in the spring at the end of the financial quarter I could see them doing that, but maybe, I'm assuming maybe at this point Zelda is probably going to be for the new console I'm wondering if maybe they just don't, they're going to run out of things to release because they've got, all we know so far is we've got Star Fox coming out this year there's those other two concept games that were being worked on, and Zelda Zelda could carry the holiday, if Zelda is the only thing they've got this holiday, it could carry it, it really could I think that's a big enough game for that, but it might be very easy for them to crank out, I still think it would be very easy for them to crank out a sequel we know Pikmin 4 is a thing, and I don't think that would be an extraordinary amount of effort to make that happen I mean, I understand that they like Pikmin, but come on, it's like 2 in this console cycle already or this would be the second one in the console cycle, and we haven't even seen games for Metroid or some of their other properties that they normally have something for the cannibalization of sales though really strikes me as a non-headline, I think there's a big assumption there or a general assumption out there amongst gamers, if rumors are to be believed anyway, that NX is going to involve handheld and console and the 3DS and Wii U are starting to wind down their life cycles, I think Zelda will be a last hurrah for Wii U if it is not on the new console but we'll see, I think there's so many factors right now, but when Wii U first came out it didn't really cannibalize the Wii they were still selling the Wii for that particular first holiday, they still sold a lot of Wiis and then the Wii was still a bargain-basement price, they took out the DVD and the Gamecube stuff and they had a bargain-basement Wii that they were basically pitching as a Netflix device that year that was extraordinarily cheap I don't know if I believe the whole cannibalization of sales of the old system because whatever NX is, is going to be expensive as well and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, if it is a handheld and a console, you can expect you're going to buy those two things separately and that's how Nintendo's going to sell you a $599 product, because they're going to split it into $299 and $299 but we'll see, we'll see, there's so many factors yeah, I think a lot of it, people are still in pretty tight budgets, I don't know, that's a lot of money to spend on stuff whether it be an Oculus Rift, the Sony VR, or like another console that's going to be that kind of price, that's a lot of money in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says Nintendo needs to take their damn time with this yeah, I've seen some counterpoints that maybe Nintendo shouldn't release it this year, because they should build up a library of games that maybe, I don't know, Wii U, Wii U kind of had a strong launch lineup, but its biggest problem was a lot of the releases had already been done and Wii U to me kind of feels a little bit rushed as it is, because it was just like, I kind of thought it should have been to the spec of these modern consoles I understand that they couldn't do that for the price point, but maybe they should have, because then that way you wouldn't have had the problem with oh, these companies not being able to develop games for your console, because their new engines won't run on it YYR in chat says too early for who though, what other major products are coming from Nintendo besides the mobile games? Amiibo, to be fair, let's not factor out Amiibo, those things are still selling like crazy, they will be a part of the NX experience one way or the other this is a whole money farm for Nintendo, and it's been profitable for them but when is going to be enough is enough with that stuff? I mean, how many are going to be too many? I mean, eventually Beanie Babies weren't popular, so when is it going to be enough? When are people going to realize that maybe I'm not getting the functionality with these things that I was hoping for yeah, they look cool on my shelf, but that's it I have to be honest Loki, if Skylanders is still a thing now, with characters that are not as well notable as Nintendo's suite of characters and still taking up as much shelf space, and they only work with one very specific game if that's still a thing, I kind of see that Amiibo could last just as long I mean, I think the bubble will burst eventually as it does with most peripheral things, but I think there's still a good couple of years left in it and I wouldn't factor it out of the NX at all Well, and I do give credit to Skylanders where I think there's more gameplay with their figures than there is with Amiibo I mean, so, I don't know, if they had something cool like that, like a grindy RPG thing hey, Nintendo RPG or something like that, where you use Amiibo figures like you do, like Disney Infinity or something like that that could be pretty cool Let me read one more comment then we'll move on YYR in chat says, my opinion also differs from Rob's on what it is I don't think it will be a console with a portable module I think it will be a portable that can dock and become a console Well, that could be very interesting I think it is certainly feasible that there could be a portable now with almost as much oomph as you see in the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, and certainly if they sell an additional dock which the dock could have something like a little more oomph in the chips that maybe allow it to play on a TV as opposed to whatever the fixed resolution on the handheld is I could definitely see where, I mean it might be an expensive dock but they might make it worth it with some of the stuff that they pitch for you I think that's a pretty clever way to imagine it but we are just dreaming right now, we have no idea But that doesn't really work as far as having multiple members of the family or are they going to have multiple console systems and how are they going to talk to each other, I don't know We'll see, we'll just wait and see what they say We'll see, I know, it's just too much to be, we get tinfoil hat all day but we just need to wait for Nintendo to make an official announcement Okay, so moving on to another lawsuit but this one has to do with a company called Lumosity and I have to admit, I had not really heard of this company until this article but apparently they had all these brain games that were out there and think about brain training for Nintendo but these games actually claimed that it could make you smarter and now Lumos Labs who created the game is being ordered to pay the Federal Trade Commission 2 million dollars for deceptive trade practices In the report, FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich said in a statement Lumosity preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer's disease but Lumosity simply did not have the science to back up its ads If you sign up for the auto-renewal program featured by Lumosity between January 1st of 2009 and December 31st of 2014 you will be notified about the action and given an easy way to cancel So, yeah, and some folks in chat, Dungeon Buster, saying, wow, I remember their ads Yeah, I remember seeing their ads too around the time that brain training was popular but brain training on DS sold itself differently It didn't flat out claim to make you smarter I think they were a little more clever about it where they said this Japanese doctor said this is good for you type of thing where they didn't say the game makes you smarter but this doctor said about the game it's gonna do this which is completely different It's all in how you phrase it because you can't be shut down for saying this doctor said this thing because, I mean, come on, they put quotes on movie posters all the time That's how they sell things So and so said this So, Rob Roberts of Orange Launch Radio said about the new Amplitude game The freeze-pop song is great, I played it 20 times Put that on the box Anyway Let's see, and Dar Titsuye bringing up the brain training run that Tazbot did during Awesome Games Done Quick I missed that whole segment and I need to go back to YouTube and see it because I heard it was pretty funny So, sadly, I didn't see any of that I just saw some pictures and it looked really funny so I gotta go back and look at that Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates although I'm thinking we are looking at yet another light week Right, Loki, or what are we looking at this week in release dates? There's nothing Nothing in the US this week? No No? When do we get back into releases? In a couple weeks here because I know we've got the Lego Avengers game is going to be coming out on the 21st? No, it's the 25th So, yeah, we've got some stuff coming out I think the following week But, yeah, unfortunately not anything until then This is usually a pretty light month and it's been even worse so this year Alright, well, in the UK, and yeah, I'm going a little out of order here but with Dark Soccer Night here I'm going to do the UK next We at least have a handful of games this week It sounds like this is mostly digital stuff though Assassin's Creed Chronicles India is released for the PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4 this week on the 12th You also have Gone Home making its debut on Playstation 4 and Xbox One I forgot they were putting that on those systems I wonder if I'll want to check that out again I don't know if they're doing anything new to it but I'll be curious about it And then Tharsis comes out on Playstation 4 and PC as well If you're more of a mobile person you can look for Pocket Mortis on Android and the iDevices Going over to Japan and checking out the releases over there I think we are finally getting back into some releases Yeah, the 14th on the Playstation 4 this week You have Evolve Ultimate Edition making its debut in Japan As well as Odin Sphere, Leif Drasir comes out this week in a regular and a 3D Crystal Famitsu Deluxe Pack That is a new release from Atlus on the Playstation 4 this week On the Playstation 3 that Odin Sphere is also getting a release on Playstation 3 The Wii U has nothing to note until the end of the month when Mario Tennis comes out But on the Vita we do have Odin Sphere also out on the Vita There's also an accessory set I guess that comes with that as well on the Vita And then Darius Burst Chronicle Saviors also out in Japan this week on the Playstation Vita And lastly looking at the 3DS to see if there's any releases Just one, Card Fight Vanguard G Stride to Victory coming out in Japan this week Yeah, and like I was double checking the first releases of this month are actually on the 19th So next week there will be some releases Hooray! We get release dates again next week Yeah, next week Finally out of that holiday And 26th for LEGO Marvel Avengers which I am totally picking up day one Awesome Alright, let's go through a few more stories here We'll go a little quickly and then we'll get to Classic Game of the Week Alright, so there's apparently this latest round of DRM is being more difficult or stubborn to be cracked This includes this brand new Denovu anti-temper technology It's being used in such games from EA like FIFA 16 and they also have I guess Just Cause 3 It's being used on as well Apparently they're saying that it's remained, they haven't cracked it yet And this is coming from I guess some Chinese cracking group 3DM But then again though there's other hacking groups out there so I wouldn't necessarily take it Are they really trying hard enough? Are you really trying hard enough or are you slacking off because it's the holidays? No, I'm joking Honestly with Just Cause 3, I mean it hasn't been out that long and maybe it is because it's so buggy Maybe that I don't know if they have tried that hard, I don't know Who knows, we'll see Let's be real though, we're not really supposed to be rooting for the cracking teams Well no, let's put it this way though That's what keeps games off PC I understand that but at the same time though the people are concerned that maybe because their thought is that in two years time There's not going to be any pirated games because it's going to be impossible to hack through the DRM Which I just don't buy that at all Hackers gonna hack right? There is no possible way that that is going to be uncrackable All it is, is time Especially making a comment saying that, oh it's impossible, that's just going to get more people trying I do find it interesting that for a change instead of the company putting out the game saying it's impossible You actually have the crackers themselves saying it's impossible I think giving it a month's time is not saying it's impossible It's harder than it was but I don't think it's impossible That's still a win, a big win though for the publishers if it's going to take them a month to crack games Because most of the game sales happen when? The first month Yeah So it's still a huge win But it's a horribly fucked up buggy ass game A lot of these games that are coming out from these publishers, EA especially And Just Cause 3 was just as bad, they were fucking buggy as shit when they came out And I think maybe waiting some time for all of that to be fixed is not such a bad thing Especially when these companies are just willing to, oh well it's good enough Batman Arkham City, yeah Batman Arkham Knight, good enough Do you think that maybe the crackers instead of taking the time to try and get these games to be free for their people or whatever Do you think that instead of putting the resources there they should just put the resources in to maybe help them fix the games Fuck them, why should they have to help them fix the games But look at it this way, we're talking two or three games out of how many games that come out all the time There's so many indie games, there's so many other games, there's plenty of games out there And if you don't want to spend $60 on a brand new game like Just Cause 3 Go spend $7 on a Humble Bundle Yeah, go wait a few years or buy somewhere else or buy it on sale I don't know, I haven't pirated PC gaming in a very long time Like it's years, decades probably But there was a time when it was super available and super easy to do It was different in the 90s, it was different a long time ago But now it's like, nah, it's just like I don't really see a reason to do it I mean, I don't know There's so much out there that you can play And it's funny that the quote is about there's not going to be any free games to play Of course there's going to be free games to play, there's lots of Go play Clicker Heroes, that's free But seriously, there's so much out there that you can play There's a lot of free to play MMOs actually, now that I think about it And here's the thing too, it's like There's so much you can play out there, there's just no time If it's literally going to get to the point where there's no free things out there Well guess what, you know what, it's pretty easy to make your own shit So make your own game that's free to play Alright, well moving on We mentioned earlier in the show about some anniversaries And Sonic is turning 25 this year And we did have the whole rumor last week because of the musical group that said something on the Facebook Well apparently there are more details and more rumors this week in addition to that Apparently a former Sega Quality Assurance employee leaked this Get your salt licks, tinfoil hats, take it as rumor But apparently Sega is working on two Sonic games for this year One of them is Sonic Adventure 3 So Sonic Adventure 3, possibly seeing release this year The second game is supposed to be a 2D game called Sonic Genesis Get it? Get it? Sonic Genesis The Origin of Chaos And it will be the same team that made Sonic Colors and Sonic Lost World Again, rumor? So I see YYR in chat going, what, what? I will buy, just don't, put the car in park because we don't have any official words yet But yeah, that is what is rumored to come out later this year for the 25th anniversary I'd be down with a Sonic Adventure 3, I think that would be pretty cool And I do love the tongue in cheek name, although that could just as easily be a fanboy name Sonic Genesis The Origin of Chaos, like I kind of think that's a hilarious name If true, we'll see what Sega might announce in the coming months Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, lowkey Alright, so this is kind of funny because we actually talked about this I think last week or so Regarding that there was a Mario Maker costume that someone had hacked into the actual data files And found out, hey guess what, the Skypop plane is going to be a costume And sure enough, they have this new tie in thing that's the Southwest Air Adventure That you can unlock the plane So, go play it and unlock that costume So, well I actually played it and I'm a big fan of costumes Nintendo does provide a shit ton of free content for Mario Maker So it's hard to be upset The tie in for the advertisement is a little weird But at the same time, wasn't some of the old Old at this point, it's not that old But wasn't some of the first costumes that came out like tie in with Game Center And some of the Japanese stuff like Famitsu had a mascot That sounds cool, people don't really like, damn Southwest Airlines, fuck yeah that's awesome Yeah right, it's a little weird admittedly but Like I would take a Burger King costume, can we get the Burger King Sneak King, the Sneak King level Hell yes I did not find the advertisement levels to be like in your face offensive But that's the thing, even the Mercedes Benz one, it's almost kind of just like a silly It's not going to get me to think Mercedes Benz, it's been like, okay I don't know We were talking about this a little bit last week with the whole Lightning doing the Was it Prada, no Louis Vuitton, I can't remember Exactly, whoa look at that, effective marketing You can't even fucker remember which fucking clothing line We have an email on that, I think we have an email on this, we'll get to that later That's so amazing, so effective, great job spending that advertising money It was one of those, was it Coach? I don't know, it was one of those Alright anyhow, the memes that came out of it are priceless Anyhow, one more for you guys then we'll get to the classic game of the week And that has to do with the term Let's Play You know Let's Play is a term you usually hear on YouTube like Let's play such and such game for, let's play Minecraft for an hour Let's play whatever Well at one point apparently Sony Computer Entertainment America Tried to trademark Let's Play and that happened in October That Sony actually applied for a trademark on the phrase Saying quote, electronic transmission and streaming of video games via global and local computer networks Streaming of audio, visual and audio-visual material via global and local computer networks Now interesting because Let's Play, that term wasn't really invented by Sony at all That's been around on YouTube for a very long time So I'm not sure what Sony's trying to do with this except maybe keep it away from Microsoft You know I thought when I first heard this I was like Oh, well okay, usually video game consoles have their little slogans that come with it Like there's, I don't know, there was get in or get out Or you know Genesis does what Nintendon't I'm trying to think what some of the new ones are Is it jump in for Xbox? When Playstation had It just does everything Oh yeah that's their thing, it just does everything right? So I thought okay well if Let's Play is like their little slogan, Playstation, Let's Play Like I was like oh okay, I get that, that doesn't seem seedy at all Well then if that was the case then yeah they should trademark Playstation Let's Play That makes sense But when you hear that the definition says electronic transmission and streaming of video games That's not what they were going for No that's just them being fucking assholes is what it is Or maybe they wanted to brand their Twitch area Let's Play I don't know, I kind of think part of it was to keep the term away from Microsoft maybe Especially as a lot of it's open Where is it their fucking right to keep that term away from It's not theirs to fucking keep away from anybody You know what Loki, here's the good news It was denied The United States Patent and Trademark Office refused Sony's application But not for the reason you think Because of the likelihood of confusion with LP Let's Play Which I have never fucking heard of this I don't know what it is I don't think it has anything to do with video games But for whatever reason the patent office said it was a conflict And now Sony has six months to make a case for itself and argue against the decision But now that this is out there you're probably going to see people file briefs Probably YouTube or Google is going to get involved saying nope I don't understand how you can trademark something that's not your fucking Trademarks are really stupid especially when you work in that sense What are they using this for is what I want to know If it's a tagline for their brand then fine Then allow them to trademark PlayStation Let's Play or something like that But not just Let's Play It's too vague I mean it's even like the whole candy and crush shit Or saga or all that is too vague I don't understand especially when the general community Knows that this has been used before they even had streaming on that console I don't even understand how But of course the trademark office being fucking retarded doesn't know any better So they were just like okay sure Dungeon Buster says in chat the trademark office is so broken I get the feeling some companies think they can get away with anything You know what's funny I googled the LP Let's Play thing Trying to see what it was and all that I get are results that are with this story About the Sony trademark But I did get I guess the actual trademark website has it And it's some company Let's Play of America out of I'm probably mispronouncing this horribly It's in Georgia It's Smirna, Georgia And it's entertainment services Namely to provide online and offline opportunities for video game enthusiasts To meet and participate in live video game tournaments And on demand console gaming So I wonder if it's some type of store It might be a video game store And do we have these people fucking harassing you Harassing YouTubers or anything like that No because they're decent I mean I assume it's a decent company But then you have like these big Well plus LP Let's Play is like way different You're not going to confuse that with a YouTuber Especially if this is what I think it is and it's some type of store Anyway I'm sure there is someone We should be thanking them right now because it's because of them That little company in Smirna that Sony got denied No I don't think it's because of them at all It's because the trademark office is just kind of stupid And so they're like people are going to confuse that No one even knows what that fucking company is No one's going to confuse that at all I mean like let's see here I'm just curious I'm going to type in Let's Play into Google Let's see if we get a nice Wikipedia article or something like that Oh hey look here's a Wikipedia article about Let's Play And let's see if we have like the history If like it figured out where that came from I'm sure that they know who Let's see here I was just wondering if they had an idea of who coined the phrase I have this weird feeling Sony is going to very like out of left field And very like discreetly just kind of say We were only getting it to protect the term Oh fuck them I think that's what's going to happen They're going to come out and say We were only getting it so that nobody else could have it Into which I say oh fuck you No one asks you to fucking do this I don't fucking believe you for a second Alright There's many people in the chat tonight that are saying I've missed Loki rants I killed your dog so no one else could kill your dog Stop it I protected him He won't die anymore He's already dead You're awful Alright we have got to go back to a simpler time Let's go back to a simpler time When you couldn't look up trademarks online We're going to get to the classic game of the week But before I get to the cutesy little music that goes with that I have to introduce a special guest to the show tonight Filling in for the one and only Dark Soccer tonight Say hello everybody in studio again is Alan Hi Hi Alan how you doing? Good Thanks for being on the show I'm sorry you couldn't be here from the beginning tonight But I know you had work and you got to pay the bills and all that So it's important Yeah But you're here now Yes Thanks for being here You're welcome Ingress and Skyrim Yeah And I logged into 14 a couple nights ago for like 10 minutes You didn't see I did it behind your back because you would have lost your mind Run a dungeon with me You've been playing a lot of Skyrim and I kind of tease you about it What's your MO for playing so much Skyrim these days? Well I hadn't touched it in two years And I sort of looked up the mods for it Because you know Fallout 4 came out And basically all of the Bethesda mod community is now modding for that Even though the creator dev kit hasn't been released for it yet There's still like dozens and hundreds of mods So I was like what has been put out for Skyrim In the two plus years that I have literally been on media blackout for it And there's like hundreds of stuff Like there's campaigns, quests, NPCs, armory skins, texture reskins, lighting And this is much more than just the Steam workshop right? Oh yeah no no no this is Oh that's child's play Select all Add Yeah He has this whole little thing and I always confuse it for his work Because it looks so similar I use a mod manager because I run so many mods that you really Like if you just unzip stuff and dump it into the Skyrim install directory by the 30th mod It's like oh I don't like this or it crashes my game You're not removing that shit by yourself By picking out random ass texture files you need an application to sort of figure out what you're overriding But this Skyrim train has been holding you for a good long while now Like I feel like you got back into Skyrim like all the way back in October or November and you're still going Yeah I think yeah it was around November Before Thanksgiving So do you think you'll ever get on the Fallout 4 bandwagon? I'm waiting for some of the official Bethesda patches to come out just because the physics engine is amazing It's an incredible open world and it's broken as shit and there's like quest breaking bugs everywhere and some people never see them It's just Bethesda though that's how their games are Like there's this unofficial Maybe Bethesda should try to get the trademark for let's break or let's patch What are you guys thinking? There's this unofficial Skyrim patch that was done by the modding community that doesn't need like a script extender Or any of the weird stuff that you have to get the more advanced mods to run And it fixes like hundreds of legitimate Bethesda bugs that they never got to Like if you accidentally Like if you forget to take an optional treasure item from a thief's quest thing and you finish the quest Then you go back in and it'll disappear the unofficial Skyrim patch puts it there so that oh yeah I forgot to steal this Just weird stuff that would break or disappear that Bethesda themselves never got to So even if you have no interest in modding and you're playing on PC just getting that unofficial Skyrim patch fixes like hundreds of tiny little issues I would still love them to bring Skyrim to Playstation 4 and Xbox One I was so disappointed was it like the last E3 when they had like you know their show the screenshots and everything And then one of it was Skyrim like fuck yes Skyrim HD And then nope Alright well before we get to the classic game which you're here to fill in for Dark Soccer tonight Yes Quickly like 30 second opinions on some of the stories we talked about already Oculus Rift for $599 will you let your boyfriend Rob Roberts buy that Yes $600 You can have one Really? Yeah with the Powerball Bunny you're gonna win Would you get one for $600? I'd share yours I wouldn't get one You'd push me to buy it and then reap the benefits of that I get it Yes That's fine Since you do a lot of PC gaming I'm sure you are experienced with the crack I mean not that you pirate games but the cracking community I mean you know I'm sure you've been into it a lot of them Saying now that games are too hard to crack do you think that finally pirates may be beaten Well I mean I know that companies have caught shit for it in the past but Ubisoft and Sony and some other PC things would do the whole weird rootkit Stuff where you have to go into your hosts file and redirect the IP address that sniffs if you have a license or not and point it to you know a dead IP All this weird or just like unplug the internet and play this game without the internet Which is funny that people will do that like they're willing to forego their entire internet connection to play a game but then when Diablo 3 for PC says you need an internet connection to play this people lose their mind But you'll turn it off to pirate it but you don't want it on when you pay for it like okay Alright and lastly on a scale of 1 to 10 how excited would you be for a Sonic Adventure 3 I don't care about Sonic So 1 Yeah I mean if it's good great but even what's the Sonic one that came out in the last 3 or 4 years that actually was really good Generations What's the one that came out last year that was kind of bad colors or no I think that was the Wii U one last year there was Sonic 4 episode 1 and 2 was kind of crap Yeah The Sonic game that was really good was the Sonic Transformed Racing was a good Sonic game You actually played that It was a kart racer but Sonic Lost World as well Was it Sonic Boom? What was the one that has the cartoon that goes with it? Isn't that it? That's Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric More shitty friends Let's go back to a more classic time when Sonic didn't have any friends In fact I don't think Sonic was even out yet I think this game predates Sonic or it's around the same time Around the same time This time Alan is going to step into not the gaming vault but his deep PC gaming archive And find a game that he thinks hey you guys should check this game out And I believe you can because it's on a lot of different modern platforms It's the classic game of the week Alan what is tonight's classic game of the week? In the states in its initial release it was called Out of This World But most of us now know it as Another World And this game has a lot of ambient sound to it So there's a little bit of intro music here in the beginning But that's about all you're going to get that's just going to be ambient music So take it away Alan So this game came out I believe the first systems The systems that were actually made for originally were the Amiga and Atari ST Which came out in 1991 Since then this game has been released on Amiga, Android, Apple IIGS, Atari Jaguar, Atari ST, Blackberry 10, Game Boy Advance iOS, Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, Nintendo 3DS, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 Whoa sorry those beeps were really loud I apologize It was very loud in contrast to the music I'll turn that down a little bit sorry guys PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Sega CD, Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, Symbian, Tapwave Zodiac We're getting into platforms I've never even heard of these before The Wii U, Windows Mobile, Xbox One, and the 3DO So much like Myst and Half Life This game is both iconic and prolific It was released everywhere It was developed and released by Delphine Software Did the development and Interplay Entertainment did the console ports Publishers were Delphine Software, US Gold, Interplay Entertainment, and Virgin Interactive did the bulk of them This game was considered revolutionary Because in 1991 games were entirely sprite based 3D wasn't really a tangible thing yet We still had a few years to go before we got to Star Fox and the FX chip and all that And this was also before the big adventure and RPG craze of the mid and late 90s Of the full motion video with the live actor But they interacted with sprites, but there were real people like Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest, all that stuff So the thing that was really ahead of its time about Another World was the developer Last name is French, I think it's Chihai Eric Chihai, what he did is he used motion capture and the cool 3D polygons that were possible on the Amiga system And he did 2D cell sprites over it, so he did a rotoscoping effect So the motion capture, even though it's flat 2D and looks very crude, it looks life like For anyone that remembers the Lord of the Ring movies that came out I think the Baskin one that came out in the 80s that had rotoscoping It's very much that effect where you can see that it's something that's drawn over a 3D model Very cinematic, the game is about a physicist or whatever working on his particle accelerator It gets struck by lightning and he is teleported to another world This game is very frantic, when you are teleported to the alien world You are underwater and you are actively drowning So if you do not press up on the D-pad first thing, you will die straight up Just the game, good luck and then you die As soon as you climb out of the pool, a monster chases you, you get captured by an alien race It's kind of the adventure game equivalent of that movie Run Lola Run which takes place in real time That movie is so badass Yeah, so Run Lola Run, the first five minutes is her basically finding out that a drug dealer is going to kill her boyfriend unless she goes and gets money So the movie takes place in real time where she's just running and this game is kind of like that If you stand still, you're probably going to die and you will die a lot One of the great things about Another World is that you're transported to this alien planet No one speaks English, you have no idea what's happening to you, why these guards are after you Aside from the fact that you're a weird pink human looking dude There's really no story aside from just run, run, run and live And the resolution or the ending is actually very bittersweet, it's not even clear This is a bit of a spoiler, you're not dead but you get injured very badly and the game ends on that note So it's kind of a downer It has lots of platforming and timing elements The controls are a bit weird, they're hard to get used to at first And then there's a ray gun that you get where you press hold to, press second level charge is to do a shield which is very important And then third level is to break through walls And there's a sequence where you have to like break a dam where all this water flows through and you have to make sure you don't drown And it'll take you like 20 or 30 attempts to get through that part For people who have it completely memorized and can one shot the entire game from start to finish It's about 15 minutes long, maybe upwards of 20 So the full experience is learning how to get through everything If you can just blitz through the game easily 30 minutes or less It's going to be an intense 30 minutes or 20 minutes where you're convinced at any moment you're going to die and have to start over from the start of that action sequence But yeah, very short game once you learn the ins and outs of it Kind of an appropriate game to follow up a week of awesome games done quick Because that was kind of part of the charm of it was learning how to speed run it basically Some comments from our chat, also Alan if I could I don't have access to chat right now so thank you Dungeon Buster in Chat says if people thought the new Tomb Raider had gruesome death scenes another world beat them to it Yes Tigerclaw says there was a sequel out of this world that came out on the Sega CD and you played as the alien Yes, the developer Because one of the things when you get captured is you have this alien friend who is in the cell with you And you break out and you sort of help him in the background and he helps you You don't really know what his deal is because again there's no explanation You just have to run to survive So there's this alien dude who ultimately carries you away from this horrible city that you've been trying not to get shot up in He puts you on a pterodactyl and flies you away and you're like critically possibly mortally injured His name according to Interplay who I think developed the sequel called Heart of the Alien Is unofficially or officially named Buddy but my friend Rob and I used to call him Marchubo Because when you wake up in the cell and you break out of the cell and you kill the guard he puts his hand on his shoulder And this very weird sort of highly compressed audio of him goes Marchubo That's his like greeting to you so that was what we called him The sequel Originally Eric the developer Chihai said that the same exact scenario of the first game just from Buddy's point of view Is what he wanted the sequel to be but ultimately it takes place right after Another World ends Where you take the scientist guy and you lay him down and then you start going through like your tribe or your village or whatever And then it's the same basically more of the same lots of running to live and survive Way more rotoscoped motion capture in the sequel as well some of it is done very well and looks great A lot of it is kind of bad Only released for the Sega CD but if you Google Heart of the Alien Sourceforge it's been ported to PC I think for free Like it's not even on good old games I think you can just download and play it and I didn't know that until I looked up the information for this So yeah if you want to check out the sequel just to see how good or bad it was and you have a PC you can just get it And Tiger class saying the sequel explains what happens to the human so Yes and there is a big spoiler there which I will not say Alright So this is one of those things where I've only been able to pick the classic game of the week four or five times I know I did the Oracle of Ages and Seasons for the Gameboy Advance the Zelda thing that I think Capcom or a branch of Capcom developed those And lots of King's Quest games but when I saw that a game that was this ahead of its time and really kind of showed you know as far as Cinematic like you know visual narratives without expository you know there is no speech really no text But you are definitely invested in these characters because you want dude to live It was really ahead of its time and when I saw on the wiki that that was not represented yet on classic game of the week so I figured it was a no brainer No I think that's a great choice so there it is your classic game of the week another world You can get it on Steam I think they did a 20 or 25 year no it was 2008 so I think it would have been a 15 year remake where they did like HD backgrounds And they you know better higher sampling of audio so you can get it on Steam I think it's one of those games that goes on sale for like a buck 97 So if you've never played this and you have a controller I would not play this with a keyboard definitely check out another world Alright thank you Alan great choice and again very landmark because it was in that era of sprite games but really started It really showed what 3D was going to look like and polygons Excellent you're being commended by the chat room there for your choice there tonight even if you didn't pick Halo But we'll just have to do that another time when Jamie's not here and then nobody can tell her about it because we will all die Alright anyway all kidding aside let's take a quick break we have plenty more show to come Alan are you going to join us for the second half of the show since you're all done now are you going to answer emails take calls with us or No I can do that I just wanted to do something work related really quickly during the break Okay sounds good so Alan will be back for part B Loki and myself here with you to talk some more news We're going to talk about potentially a Watch Dogs 2 next year and then we're going to talk about you know what it's a Half Life 3 story But Half Life 3 not confirmed in fact it's a very interesting story you'll just have to stay tuned we'll talk about it when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with our 627th episode for this January the 10th of 2016 Myself and Loki here in studio with special guest Alan who I think he ran out to respond to some chat room comments from his own computer He'll be back in studio here in a moment not with us tonight Dark Sakura but you know you can't feel too bad for her because she's at Disneyland right now Having a blast probably riding Hyperspace Mountain over and over again she'll be back next week I'm sure to tell us all about it Although actually she's probably doing her bucket of meat dinner right now because I'm sure they made reservations and Victoria she goes to Disneyland so much Yeah she knows all the employees there it's the restaurant's last hurrah today because they're bulldozing it to make Which one? It's called Bucket I don't it's the Big Thunder Ranch I think is what it's called but everybody calls it Bucket of Meat because you know what you order there? Buckets full of meat I know right Loki see and you didn't want to go to Disneyland oh if all I had to do is be like well yeah Loki there's teacups but there's also endless buckets of meat But now they have been bulldozed or will be bulldozed to make room for charger It's so hard to find like food there because like all the other places serve the same crap it's just like garbage Disney has some pretty awesome dining but you do have to be willing to pay the higher dollar for it but I'm telling you that Karthay Circle that's a California adventure seriously one of the best restaurants I've eaten at period and Alan and I will splurge once in a while and eat at fine dining restaurants You know especially for events like anniversary and so forth and that Karthay Circle is one of the very very best we've ever been to and it was worth it In fact funny enough I guess transition Alan and I actually celebrated our six year anniversary this week Congratulations Thank you very much And you know not to be too embarrassing on my little podcast but Alan has been a huge supporter of this show and like not a lot of partners would understand the commitment something like this takes But Alan not only understands that but here he is participating in that He can't shut me up That's part of it but I'm just he loves to come on here and point out when I'm wrong that's really the flip of it But no I'm extremely lucky to have a support like that so I'm not going to get too gushy but a little bit and so there you go But this week we went to for the very first time you want to tell the listeners about this real quick? We went to a restaurant that does at your table fondue for every course It's kind of scary because the main like they give you meat that's seasoned and marinated and prepared and you have like the big kettle or fondue pot as it will that's on a heat thing And it's boiling oil basically so you put the meat there's like dipping batter like tempura so you take your skewer and you take your piece of like what you had duck and you swirl it in the thing and you have to We had our phones out for stopwatch because you want to cook it for like two minutes but you don't want to overdo it and burn it but you don't want to eat raw meat and get sick So there's like a spatter risk element to it so it's kind of low key stressful maybe more stressful but the food once you put it like you can't eat it off the skewer because you'll burn your mouth and look like you have herpes But you take it off the skewer and then you pop the filet mignon or the sirloin or the whatever and it is so good it's one of the best meals I've ever had it's just weird I was dealing with like a pot of scalding disfiguring oil That dinner was Friday night and I'm still full like I had we went to another restaurant today with my just honest aside with my parents my sister my sister was just coincidentally in town today so we all went out for like brunch today And I ordered a soup and salad how often does that happen where Rob gets a soup and salad but I was still I'm like still full for I was like Benihana's That's like you have to prepare for that but like not eating for a day Anyway so the melting pot was funny but yes boiling oil and in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com YYR says weren't there Disney villains or cartoon villains who threatened to boil someone in oil Yes I think that's a common threat and that's of serious business like they have all these contraptions to take the boiling oil away safety's huge over there obviously Eventually you know you've got bits of batter and spice and food grease and the oil so it gets dirty It's like a deep fryer anyone who's worked in fast food knows the deep fryer gets nasty And then also the oil itself will scald past a certain point it starts to stink and smoke but you can't have a waiter with like you know oven mitt Take it off your table and tra la la back to the kitchen because all I have to do is roll their ankle and oh my god just like death everywhere so they have this Vice that goes under the pot and then there's a thing that they then has a big crank or a handle that like goes kachunk and it like screws into the opening of the pot and like secures it and they take this whole apparatus away So it's like hot grease containment control like in Monsters Inc. It's this big ritual Alright we gotta get back to games we can talk about food all night believe me we could we gotta get back to games what That dessert right Oh my god chocolate fondue yeah oh my god marshmallow and broken oreos oh my god I'm gonna I'm gonna shit just thinking about it alright No seriously though we gotta get back to some gaming news rapid fire news time Loki Alright so Shovel Knight is gonna be getting the amiibo soon and also they're saying though that what's kind of unique about this is you can actually read it through the packaging So if you don't want to take that out you can just leave it in its box and play the game based on that They really should do that with all the amiibos I guess they're worried that people are gonna like copy them or something I don't know I had no idea about that but I guess and Shane was telling me about this I did get my Shovel Knight amiibo because I know you all care But I guess another company made those that particular amiibo was made by the people that did the infinity figures it was not the usual amiibo makers So that's why some things are a little different and even the figure itself looks a little different from the other amiibo so just interesting Does it unlock a character in Mario Maker? I don't know about Mario Maker I don't think so I just know about the co-op mode in actual Shovel Knight itself although I haven't used it yet Because Alan won't play those games with me because he's too busy in Skyrim Speaking of Skyrim one of the I think more popular mods or funny mods that I've seen was the mod that turned all the dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage Oh yeah! Oh yeah! So now that we have Fallout 4 it is only fit that we have a sequel to that said mod now with the mod that will turn or they call it the Macho Claws mod it will turn the death claws into Macho Man Randy Savage Oh yeah! And it's as hilarious as the previous mod so you can check that out Do you run on Skyrim? I do have a dragon mod but no I don't there are some Yours just makes the dragon naked or something right? No It does reskin them so they're all purpley and look different but it also adds a new So they look like Spyro? No well there is a My Little Pony dragon mod where it looks like Or Thomas the Tank Engine that's like Yeah Thomas the Tank Engine is yeah That's the kind of stuff I would play Skyrim with That's what I wanted like I wanted to have like a play through of Skyrim that was just random mods like just like you take a bunch of mods and how somehow randomize everything into it The swearing crabs that have the cigar and the top hat and they say fuck you when you get close to them That's the kind of shit I want in Skyrim can we maybe for like a future like let's play before Sony trademarks that term maybe you could help me load up Skyrim with a bunch of like dipshit mods and then I could play that as a let's play Oh like the rainbow gun or something that makes people blow up The dubstep gun from Saints Row that's always awesome Alright back to news Alright anyways speaking of mods there is yet another mod coming out this time for Grand Theft Auto 5 and what's kind of cool about this one is it's basically kind of creating it's almost like Watch Dogs So they have the Watch Dogs hacking system and they put it into Grand Theft Auto 4 So you can use your cell phone to you know mess with the different like stop lights they had cars you can make cars like accelerate uncontrollably You can explode fire hydrants a bunch of different hacking features and it looks pretty awesome from like the screenshots I've seen in the video So definitely something worth checking out if you have Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC it's the Watch Dogs hack script they call it But definitely something I would love to check out if it would run on my PC and if I had Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PC which I don't Alright well for those of you that were really hoping and praying that maybe there would be more coming to Smash Brothers on 3DS and Wii U Nope Bayonetta really is going to be the end of it and we know this because Masahiro Sakurai has confirmed he's moving on to another project That was confirmed in the latest edition of Weekly Famitsu and of course he's not going to tell you what that project is He just says I want to enjoy every day like it's Sunday however that doesn't mean the next job hasn't been decided So that was what the in response to a question about 2016 ambitions and plans so who knows that could be Super Smash Brothers NX But also keep in mind he has done more than that there was the Kid Icarus reboot so you never know I think when you're Masahiro Sakurai and you're responsible for a huge franchise like that you get to make other games you want to make I think he gets to do other stuff and SHO 100 Matt in chat over at live.vlognetwork.com says let the man do something else And I agree I think you could safely turn over Smash Brothers to maybe another team that's maybe worked under Sakurai and let him go do something else Alright if you would like to experience some classic Virtual Console games on the Wii U It's pretty cool a little twist on the usual Wii U Virtual Console fare These are all Zapper games that came out now we already had Duck Hunt available on the Virtual Console But this last week gave us a better light gun game in the form of Hogan's Alley is now available for the Wii U Virtual Console So are these like using the Wii Zapper still or are they using just like you tap the screen or something like that? You just use the regular Wiimote That's what I meant like you use the Wii Remote Yep that's how you do it you use the Wii Remote to do it And I thought there was a way you can actually use the Wii Remote with the gamepad because I've seen that happen on Metroid Prime And that gamepad actually has a little infrared sensor built into it And you don't look totally stupid doing that Yeah so you can do that Let's see also yeah and it says that they have off TV play so I would think you'd just be able to use the stylus But maybe that makes it too easy I don't know But anyway also available Wild Gunman which is kind of super basic that's just a quick draw game there's really nothing to that game But then also you might remember the Adventures of Bayou Billy this was a game that was pretty difficult that was like half platformer Then half like light gun game it had certain light gun stages in it And if you didn't have the light gun you had to use the good old moving the cursor around the screen and hitting the trigger And it was pretty much impossible if you didn't have the light gun in order to beat Bayou Billy So you can try for yourself on Virtual Console Last week we talked a bit about Final Fantasy 9 coming out for the PC And now the game's official Steam page is available and there are some bells and whistles that you can expect in the Final Fantasy 9 remake And that is you'll be able to turn off random encounters That's pretty cool you could actually just turn off the random encounters and you could just play through the game for the story And then I suppose you could take on the bosses you might have to get really creative to beat them without the experience from the trash mobs But I know there are some people that are playing through Final Fantasy 7 with the whole no encounter thing in place And then using the other cheats to come with the game to push through it just to experience the story And I'm sure some people will be doing that as well with Final Fantasy 9 which is currently imminent basically on Steam You see the page there for it Alright let's take a chance on FOOGLE We're gonna take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together you get FOOGLE And every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we do like to ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio And then also on Google Plus which is still around for you non-facebook people that's google.com slash plus orange lounge radio And the question we asked tonight has to do with the story that we had earlier about the Mario Maker DLC Because remember we talked about that Southwest had actually sponsored that so we wanted to ask our listeners this week What costume would you put in Super Mario Maker and for fun who do you think should sponsor the costume? Alan I'd be very curious to hear your answer in a minute But in the meantime let's get to some of the chatters answers over on Facebook Andy R says I don't know what costume but clearly Red Bull has to sponsor something right? That's all they do these days yet somehow they still sell that disgusting drink Hey That Loki lives on Degenerate Johnny says for obvious reasons I would want to see Mario in N7 armor from Mass Effect As for sponsors as much as I would love to see the N7 armor sponsored by Jagermeister it'll most likely be sponsored by EA Not to be a buzzkill Degenerate Johnny because I love that idea but EA and Wii U they don't really get along anymore That was a bad breakup How about Redertainment is up next on Facebook saying a red star power up brought to you by Heineken Because there's a red star in the Heineken logo Okay, maybe not how about wood Mario brought to you by Viagra Because never mind I won't explain it As Joe and Hunter Matt says I'm gonna rehash that ridiculous Apple is buying Nintendo rumor and say Apple Mario's costume would feature a black turtleneck and jeans to resemble Steve Jobs Luigi would also have a Tim Cook costume Hopefully the costume pack won't bend the game or brick when you update the OS And that's what the little sassy colon P face so Dark Tetsuya last on Facebook saying spam Hormel foods the level would just be a bunch of enemy stars and items spam Because obviously and the costume of course would be a little blue spam can These ideas are so silly I love it Let's try going over to Google Plus and check out some of the answers on Google Plus if I can actually make The only problem is man after I start to install some of these new things I got to do on the computer Some of my stuff is running slower Alan need you to scrub down this computer for me do your fix it magic Because that's what you do you fix computers right and install shoutcast and install one amp No all right a couple answers on Google Plus tonight tech 2030 saying a power up that turns you into baby Mario Brought to you by Pampers That's funny I like that one that's a good one And then lastly from Prince Peach Fuzz presenting Ron Jeremy Mario from the guys at Pornhub There it is Google question of the week Alan did you think one what's a costume you'd like to see and who would it be sponsored by I have two Captain Falcon spin sponsored by Kleenex to wipe your tears because there's never going to be an F-Zero game again Ass And then the slime drop from Dragon's Quest the iconic little slime and that would be brought to you by Sudafed to stop post nasal drip Those are some good answers see you're funny he's funny you guys he's really funny all right SSG100 Matt in chat says low blow Alan on the F-Zero reference low blow I think they should have Kool-Aid man sponsored by Kool-Aid because you can just bash right through walls Just run straight through the walls there's nothing You guys are far more creative than I would be that's for sure thank you guys for answering the Fugu question of the week Be sure to follow us on Facebook and Google Plus so you can answer the question next week I usually post it the day of the show just because the way those algorithms work I'm likely to keep that post I'm just disappointed that any of the costumes that they have don't change the gameplay like the you know that Super Mario crossover thing did You know that was a little bit more interesting I might be asking a lot of Nintendo Oh god forbid you put some fucking effort into your game Now hold up hold up Super Mario maker in my opinion was the best game they released last year so they took a lot of effort Logan Well and okay it's the best game that they released last year that's not saying much they could have put more effort into it PC people put more effort into it I just don't understand why they couldn't do that That PC thing is a little embarrassing Alright anyhow did that get shut down yet we didn't follow up on that Actually no you got to do the next story Logie It's on the internet so it's you know it's probably not going anywhere Alan did you want to throw something out there before we move on I did have a question so I know that you make sure that you scan all of your amiibos into Mario maker But don't you have like 30 now at this point that still need to be scanned into a Yoshi yarn party or whatever Yeah I probably need to catch up on Yoshi yarn but I did scan them all into Mario maker The only one I haven't even tried is Shovel Knight but I really don't think he's there Yeah But I'm caught up like when I got Dedede and all those other newer ones that I got Actually I don't know if I did Palutena Cuz I just got that Cuz you get through your four a week and then you'll be like okay I'm all caught up and then I'll be like did you scan in these four Shut up Until now I really am in it for the figures more than I am the scanning in the games Cuz I mean when was the last time I made a Mario level it's been a while I actually started working on one but I kinda I don't know I didn't make it My Mario levels still get played though I'm really impressed I'm gonna work with Dark Tetsuya and find the episode of you originally hearing about the amiibo and shitting all over him and I'm gonna make it my ringtone Please do Please that's how it's lasted six years You also get him to start his vog jam game as well Oh fuck off read the next story So anyways Let's talk a little bit about how there's not gonna be Assassin's Creed game next year Well geez That's disappointing I suppose Apparently though the next game they're gonna be doing is gonna be set in Egypt But it's not gonna be coming out next year Because they're taking some time to make the game better since I think the last one that came out was fucking a mess Maybe they decided that the yearly release wasn't really in their best interest Actually the last one was supposedly pretty decent It was the one to, Assassin's Creed Unity was the one that was a hot mess I thought syndicate was bad too but maybe not maybe it wasn't as bad but Unity was a mess So but taking more time to make your game better not a bad thing at all Not a bad thing at all Take the time to make it right put it in the oven a little while longer let it cook in the boiling oil a little while longer Watch Dogs 2 apparently a real thing and apparently coming this year This time though it will be set in San Francisco Which good that'll be a city I know the layout of a lot better than Chicago So maybe I'll get to find Maybe I will play Watch Dogs 1 before that time Because I still have that from when I bought my Playstation 4 last year and I still have not played that game Well when the sequel is about to come out the original will be like bargain basement prices if you still haven't caught up So who knows what platforms it will be out on because you know Watch Dogs came out for Wii U But kind of didn't do so hot I mean the fact that it took so long after the other platforms Probably had something to do with that so we don't know if it'll be on the NX or if it'll be a PS4, Xbox One thing We will see and that might there might they're saying that could be what they do instead of Assassin's Creed That makes sense Yeah that could be their big push this year in lieu of no Assassin's Creed Hopefully it won't be as delayed as Watch Dogs 1 was We thought while we are joined by Alan tonight we'd let him do a story so Alan what do you have for us? I see you giving me this one story to report on hearts which I didn't even hear about because I don't go on Twitter So Half-Life is a game that I'm a huge fan of and we've been waiting nine eight or nine years for an announcement of Half-Life 3 Since Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was released and of course it does exist in some form in a binder of you know proof of concept art And little post-it notes of scripty bits in under Gabe Newell's bed It exists only in Gabe's dreams Yes so the main writer for that is a he had I think at least two or three novels published before he teamed up with Gabe Newell to do Half-Life way back in like 1996 Mark Laidlaw and there is a guy who works for BioWare under Dragon Age who I believe is Mike Laidlaw and I get them confused constantly They're not allowed to have such similar names but Mark Laidlaw was the co-creator and sole writer of Half-Life He knows who the G-Man is in relation to Gordon he knows who G-Man's employers are he knows what the combines are allegedly He knows where the fuck Half-Life 3 is Yeah he's probably written and rewritten a script five times over in the last ten years for that game and they haven't touched it So someone from Reddit emailed him or reached out to him in some way basically saying like oh my god can you tell us anything about Half-Life 3 since you're the writer And he announced that actually quite recently he had parted ways with Valve amicably as I understand ending an 18 year relationship with the company There's a really great quote here Laidlaw says that he quit for personal reasons mostly so that he can focus on self-directed writing projects As in I have content that I wish to release can I release it please? No? Okay I want to be able to say here's this thing that I made I have this trilogy I'm working on and I know that's not really part of your business model Yeah right It's called Game of Thrones a song of what's the actual book called for that? That's what he's been working on this whole time So that's interesting I mean obviously I'm sure he's been well compensated for the storyboarding and stuff that he's done on Half-Life 3 in whatever form it exists in But anything after that or any revisions that they want to make if Gabe wants to scrap the script for the 15th time or whatever the fuck his damage is Mark Laidlaw will no longer be a part of that I look forward to Half-Life 3 a song of crowbars and headcrabs There's the show title for tonight Maybe this will be the year guys I don't care anymore I've got my own little headcanon about what goes on It's not even about Half-Life 3 at this point it's about the announcement of Half-Life 3 More about the announcement than the game I'm not even really giving a shit about Half-Life 3 I would just like something new from them Like if that's Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Half-Life 3 something completely different from all of that They've been so hardware focused the last 5 years I really really you guys want Gabe to come out on stage at E3 Look at the audience, look in the mic and go Half-Life 3 sluts and then drop the mic and walk away It'll just have to be a crowbar with a 3 behind it behind it doesn't have to say anything and then he'll just like He could just drop trow and pee on the audience and wouldn't even He'll go up against a wall and just pop his pussy in a handstand I broke Rob is so great when I do that Explicit tag of the night goes to For a big guy that's hard to do you gotta put your legs up and you're on your hands Alright next story Loki Loki Anyways so there's a lot of stuff coming out this year and from Sony they've got about 20 exclusives or so So these are going to be the list of titles that are going to be touring I guess with the I don't know if they have like what they call it the Playstation 4 tour Not really sure what they're calling it this time but they've got Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted 4, Street Fighter 5, The Last Guardian Yeah I'll believe that when I see it Gran Turismo Sport, Firewatch which I don't believe is exclusive but it is something that's coming to the Playstation as an indie title What Remains of Edith Finch, Shadow of the Beast, Boundless Near Automata, Gravity Rush 2, Alienation, Hellblade, Paragon, The Witness Ratchet and Clank, The Tomorrow Children, Drawn to Death, Dreams, and No Man's Sky God No Man's Sky is going to be awesome What's It Finally Comes Out So that's going to be the full list of titles touring hopefully within the next 12 months And hopefully we'll see like a tour date close to us at some point Well I'm excited that Sony is kind of especially after coming last year where you know at the holidays they didn't really have a lot of big first person stuff They're really making an effort to be this year Okay guys this year it's going to be different it's going to be very different And that's not even counting things that are unannounced that may be a surprise until holiday Although I kind of I don't know if we have that from Sony this year I kind of think like we already know So it'll be like PlayStation VR and that's about it Yeah but VR you know this came up on our call with Bobby tonight VR supposedly still confirmed for the first half of the year so E3 would be too late to announce it Unless they're going to do that whole available today thing which I just I don't know that doesn't that doesn't seem like it would work in 2016 Not with something like that I mean if you think about the consumers or like those stores that have to stock that crap That's too risky of like something that's that high price and oh hey here's no announcement whatsoever I mean they People got to save up money for that Available today at sonyentertainment.com Order online or Amazon exclusive or something I don't know I'm just making shit up now you guys that's what happens on Video Game Podcast I was also going to say you know along with that you know apparently the Cas Horizon said that there's going to be over a hundred titles And they're in development right now for PlayStation VR so hopefully they say that we have more 200 developers signed up for the PlayStation VR program Who are working on probably a hundred or more titles that will play on PlayStation VR I hope that's the case I guess that's showing a real commitment to it I hope that plays out too But working on and when they're released is a whole different thing too so True We'll see I mean still it's good to know it's not just something they're going to support for a year and then drop off the face of the earth like I really do hope as a whole the whole thing works it I hope it does end up being the next big thing because I honestly would love to have like something like the HoloLens That actually works like they're showing it now and not actually how it actually works you know what I mean You know I would love to have that like oh you know virtual computer space and stuff where I'm doing like crazy shit you know applications on the walls and stuff like that I've already decided I'm waiting on HoloLens until Xbox 2 or whatever obviously that's not what they're going to call it but I'm going to wait on HoloLens until the next Xbox I've already made that decision unless there is that must have game I just have to leave the door open to crack because we all know I go back on the big claims I make Hello amiibo right Alan? Yes If there is that must have game on HoloLens then we'll see but I don't think some of these things that I'm hearing about so far must have But was it E3? E3 could be the time we'll see Anyhow you guys remember we talked about a Kickstarter it was a little while ago in fact it would have been last year talking about Descent Underground And Descent Underground was a game that had its Kickstarter up and then it's supposed to be launching this year and you had to pledge $25 Well apparently the game is now available on Early Access through IndieGala.com's Monday Bundle for $2 That's right so even though people Kickstarted this for $25 you could still buy it on Early Access for $2 as well as 5 other titles So some people who backed the game for $25 not too happy about that I'd buy that for $2 actually it's $2.49 if we want to Let's see if chat can guess this movie reference $2 you owe me $2 I know that Well anyhow the developer closed the thread and responded for saying the bundle was for charity And apparently though I guess the developer posted a snippet from the Wikipedia page that says Just like in Humble Bundle buyers can set the revenue split between the developers, charities, and organizers And some folks pointing out that if you actually bought it you didn't get any type of slider that said Do you want to give this to charity or what do you want to do? Descendants Studios? No that's bull- well I don't know let's see here I'm purchasing it right now You're like I can get it for $2 hell yeah Descendants Studios standing by that they believe the bundle would go to support charity and did not know that the bundle would be this cheap By the way it should be pointed out that back in November Descent Underground was selling 70% off on Steam's Black Friday sales event While still an Early Access game Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says I paid $40 for Amplitude and Sky bought it for $20 should I get a refund? Probably No but my serious answer is you know that when you get in on Kickstarter and you're putting in that kind of money you're helping to fund the game Terrorism Shut up I put in $60 I think on the Shadowgate remake which is like dirt fucking cheap now I'm not pissed I knew that Shadowgate needed X amount of money to come back and I wanted to see it really come back so I put in money that got my name in the credits Which not a lot of games are now at standard fare but at the time there wasn't a lot of games offering to do that and yeah I'm happy with the decision I made I'm fine with it I'm glad that game happened it was good the soundtrack was fun so yeah And Bobby Blackwolf says I'm not pissed either because I actually like Amplitude unlike people who are wrong You know what though that's good I'm glad you can stand by the purchase you made that's fine We talked about handbags last week and it still blows my mind how people spend $1000 on a fucking bag Yet I know plenty of ladies and some dudes who are all about that type of price and why it's worth it and how it's worth it and all that stuff And I'm like okay that's not something I'll understand but hey it's your money spend it how you like Anyway moving on to the mailbag I think it's time to open up the mailbag because every week we invite your emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com If you want to participate with the program we're going to open up that mailbag right now and dive in Except for the fact that I don't actually have it open on the screen because I'm not used to having to do this myself usually I have Dark Sakura I should have made Alan do this tonight while he's here but you've been spared email duty tonight Alan Yay Plus your phone probably wouldn't be very good for doing that We have some emails from some of our regular emails tonight we have two emails tonight and the first one is from Ray Genator And you guys if you think oh they keep reading emails from the same people maybe you should email us tell us your perspective Tell us why you paid 40 bucks for amplitude or you know anything on tonight's topics First one comes to us from Ray Genator Hi people it's Ray Genator I hope all is well as I type this I'm well on my way to getting a new gaming desktop I have roughly half the money saved up good job on saving I'm still on track for getting the computer in mid April I've been looking at Newegg's site off and on while at the local library And I'm leaning towards getting an AMD 6th gen desktop provided there's nothing better that I can afford coming out in the meantime Nor are there any awesome sales on any of the Nvidia PCs when I go to place my order Now I should mention that despite the aforementioned info there may be the possibility that I may take an extra month wait and having my home internet and whatnot restored I haven't made a concrete decision regarding this yet the reasoning behind the possibility is this should I go forward with this it'll net me an extra 250 or so to put towards computer accessories While I haven't picked out and bought a specific PC just yet more than likely and unlike my old laptop it won't come with a built in microphone and webcam While webcams from what I've seen are fairly cheap a good headset can be kind of pricey upwards of $200 or so I'm going to hold off on buying those especially the headset until I actually have my PC but those are on my radar nonetheless On a closing note did you three see the one sale on GOG or Good Old Games roughly a week ago from the time I'm typing this where their Duke Nukem games were 75-90% off The reason behind the sale was due to the games were to be delisted immediately after the sale and wanted to get in some last minute sales revenue I did not hear about that sale which is funny because I have Duke Nukem on Good Old Games because they gave it away for free some time ago I don't think I ever actually paid for that I think I got it for free that might have been like I spent $10 on something else and I got that thrown in I don't know But I had no idea that it was being delisted interesting I wonder if something's cooking for the anniversary I wonder why the delisting happened now I don't know Dr Tutsi in chat saying I remember that giveaway that's how I got Duke Nukem as well YYR giving some comments in chat saying nobody needs a $200 headset you can get a decent headset for under $100 William Ritterface saying you get a decent headset for under $50 S200 Matt says don't get a webcam unless you plan on using it often you can get a webcam for $20 seriously webcams are super cheap and some webcams have built in microphones YYR in chat says use the rock band microphone if I had nothing else again I don't know if Rage Nator has rock band but it's an idea So yeah you don't necessarily need to drop a lot of money on that stuff especially right away Hitstun in chat says I just bought a new desktop PC just waiting on the case to arrive so I can build it I took your advice and speced it out on PC part picker and he actually shared the link for his PC build that he did on PC part picker so I think that was something I don't know if that was Loki I feel like you brought that to the show Alan because you did that on my PC Yeah Alan did that on my PC that he built for me well I guess god that's two in 2014 now it was a while ago time to update the video card I got more games to play this year One more email tonight from YYR who says hello LR don't know if this is the first mailbag entry of 2016 it's tied with Rage Nators I suppose because we didn't have any last week right so it's tied But at the least it's my very first long winded email of 2016 to LR anyway and thanks to Kaijuto the game I played most in 2015 was a mobile game of all things King of Thieves I now play it on three different devices and have thrown at least $30 at it thanks Kaijuto I think yeah he got me playing that game too I remember that on a phone call a while ago Regarding the show computer Windows Update still works for Windows XP no new updates are being released but you can still download and install everything that's there I will say however that I'm a fan of the if it ain't broke don't fix it advice and if I were in your shoes I'd hang on to what you've got for the moment If you do want to go to Windows 7 or newer the most important thing is RAM 2 gig is the absolute minimum I'd say but if you're doing live streaming I won't try I wouldn't try less than 4 I'm going to do a quick side tangent because it's interesting the computer thing got some comments last week and I actually received a communication on Facebook so I won't say who it was It was a friend of mine who said dude you shouldn't have talked about that on the show and you should probably think about updating Windows 7 because Windows XP is vulnerable and so somebody could just get right in your computer Now I pointed out that we do use a third party to relay the show I'm not broadcasting directly from the computer but that certainly did have me thinking Anytime you're putting out media on the internet you take a little bit of a risk like that I suppose you know our website has been defaced before it's nothing you know it just comes with the territory being on the internet There's going to be little troll kids who want to you know put pictures of tub girl and stuff just to get a ruffle your feathers but that was the best argument I've heard yet for breaking my if it ain't broke don't fix it rule Honestly because after reading that I was like okay I may have the whole third party thing in place and I may be a little safer because of it but he makes a good point is that you know Windows XP does still have vulnerabilities And I got to make sure being on the internet we were minimized to that type of stuff right Even if there are like if you could go right now into XP and go Windows update and pull down whatever security like they're not supporting it anymore and that they're not coming out with new stuff Given what you went through with Skype right even if there is stuff that you could use to bring your XP more up to date would you even want to run it knowing what you'd be at what would be at risk as far as the computer working right Now let me say this as a side story that's also scared me off from upgrading I have a friend who's interested in starting a podcast so since it's not something announced yet I'm not going to tell you what it is But a friend of mine is working on potentially launching a podcast soon and wanted to get a sound card for their computer like mine and the question was how do you do OLR I kind of want to be able to mirror that sort of thing So I told him what type of sound card I had and we put it in his computer he's running Windows 10 and I can't get that fucking sound card to work And this person's computer is top of the line And I can't figure out for the life of me and maybe I'm going to crowd source this so the sound card is an Audigy 5RX and the deal is is that to tape from Sound Blaster the way I'm able to run music on like let's say Winamp like let's say hey it's time for the mailbag And I can do all that live instead of having to patch it in later the reason I can do that is because Sound Blasters have a thing built into it called what you the letter U here And that's a source that you can use to record just like you can microphone and line in but the reason why this all works is that we have our mixing board that goes to the line in and then that goes through what you hear Here's the problem I'm having with my friend's computer for some reason in Windows 10 I can have the microphone or the line in or the what you hear but I can't have them all I enable one the others get disabled and I can't figure out what the fuck is going on because and we tried receiving the sound card that was I went on the internet googled it that's what somebody said they did was that they moved the sound card and it fixed the problem Try doing that and it didn't fix the problem so I don't know what it is And it's using the mic jack in the front right in the front of the case that's hooked up for anyone who has a fairly recent PC case there's like the headphone and microphone jack up in the front where the power button is you don't have to climb behind your computer every time you want to like take off your headset We was using the mic from up front there right Yeah. Now, Tigerclaw by the way pointing out another solution is to use a program called virtual audio cable. Now, what I ended up doing, I set this person up with the Skype recorder and Skype so that they could podcast and they're enabled to do that and they can see if that's what they want to do. So, at least there's a workaround, but I feel really bad and kind of guilty Because they bought a sound card specifically for this. Exactly. I told them to buy the sound card because that's what OLR does and now it won't freaking work and I can see where this person is probably really frustrated with having spent the money on the sound card they can't get to work but it's like okay in my system it just works and I don't know if it's an XP versus 10 thing which is maybe possible. I don't know. Don't they make external USB sound cards now that have like a mic jack in it that's like the what you hear stuff? Yeah, they do, but I'm not going to tell this person to buy something else now. Yeah, I know. So, I don't know. So anyway, I don't know. Just so many motherboards now come with, especially if they're a gaming rig, come with on built-in audio stuff that isn't terrible that the idea of buying a Creative Labs sound card separately and using a PCI slot is super like 90s early 2000s to me. Like I have one of course, but it's so unnecessary now. The sound card in this computer is the oldest thing about it. This sound card is as old as OLR, if not older. I'm rocking a sound card from 2001. Make sure that there are drivers for it if you decide to upgrade from XP to 7 or 10. Right? Because you might lose it by way of software. Alright, let's see. Mr. Blackwolf in our chat room pointing out my Realtek and C-Audio sound devices have stereo mix, which is the same as Creative's what you hear. Yeah, I've heard that stereo mix is pretty much the equivalent of that on other sound cards. Realtek is what this person's onboard audio is, but we disabled it first. Yes. So, I don't, I don't know. And Tiger Class says I have a Sound Blaster Rec on 3D. A dedicated sound card is better than the onboard due to the audio quality being better. So, and then Bobby Blackwolf pointing out I bought a laptop that has stereo mix card in it. It was Realtek, but unfortunately it delays the audio half a second, so it's really hard to use live. So yeah, I'm hoping, praying somebody out there might have the answer to this question because I'm stumped and I feel so bad that I told this person to buy a card, but I said this is what we do at OLR and I expected it would work just as easy, but it doesn't, so I'm frustrated. So, I don't know. We'll see. Alright. I almost closed the email. I wasn't even close to being done. Sorry YYR. Tangent there, but it was relevant to what we were talking about. So, back to YYR's email. On the subject of Konami, you've talked about how a change at the top might be a good idea and about the possibility of their entertainment division getting sold, but have you considered the possibility that nobody in Japan thinks that there's a problem with what they're doing? That's my belief and I don't think it'll change unless and until they try releasing a Metal Gear Solid 6 in North America and find a big old American middle finger waiting for them. Then they'll be thoroughly perplexed as to what happened. Culture shock. Those are my guesses. What do you think? Yes, I think you're actually, you feel the same way I do, but just phrased a different way. I think Japan, I shouldn't phrase it that way, sorry. I think the Japanese end of Konami is so like in a bubble that I think they are completely clueless, but I think part of that is caused by stubbornness, which I said is the downfall of the company is that stubbornness and it's doing them in. But I think you're absolutely right. They'll finally realize it when they try to release shit here and we're not having it anymore. Unless they are having it and they're going to buy it anyways, even after they complained all this time. Let's hope not. Here's something that hasn't appeared on many news sites. Do you remember the Ask Me Anything that Kevin Bacchus, a senior VP at Dave & Buster's did on Reddit some months ago? At that time, he mentioned that he was interested in testing DDR 2014. Well, the test happened and as a direct result, approximately half of Dave & Buster's 73 nationwide locations will be getting DDR 2014 machines with full e-amusement support later this year. The exact locations are not yet known, but this information comes straight from Bacchus himself. I don't know about you guys, but I'm super excited about the official return of DDR to American arcades. Is Konami still involved, though? Aren't those stages not very good, though? I don't remember if they are or not. You know what? I will give it a shot and hey, if it did well in the test locations, that must lend itself well. Actually, I have seen the DDR 2014 machines. The new cabinets are pretty sweet looking, so we'll see. And YYR saying, I do hope that the Konami negativity does not affect the DDR 2014 rollout. They could put somebody else's logo on it. I'm just being a bitch at this point. I have an idea. How about they put just a Hideo Kojima game or something like that. And lastly, YYR saying, I'll leave it at that for now. Time to review the first draft of my provisional patent application that the lawyer just sent me an hour ago. Legalese is super fun, except that it isn't really fun at all. Have a fun week, everyone. Hugs and kisses, Aaron or YYR. Are you trademarking bungee ferret tossing? I just want to know. He said patent application, so that would be patenting something. Oh, I'm curious to see what this is. The plot thickens. Good luck, YYR. Looking forward to seeing you at MAGFest. And good luck with the patent and all that. I hope you talk to Kyle about that, because after that episode, we know that guy has been through a lot with that. So hopefully he had some insight for that. It is that time to get into the FUs of the week. A point to rant on the show, because we can. How about Loki? Loki. I guess I'm just a nephew to my new schedule. I mean, it's cool that I have Saturdays off, but I don't like not having the extra time in the morning. It makes it hard for me to get lunch for the week and stuff like that that I used to do in that free time that I had, and now I don't. It's just very constricting, I guess. And the fact that I'm unable to be motivated enough to work on my game. I really want to, but I'm just brain dead sometimes to do that. But I really just need to try harder. I can't really think of a lot of angst right now. FU to the sloppy Ingress battle I've been doing for the past two days. That's been a waste of gas, but kind of fun, so whatever. Otherwise, things are going pretty well. I really can't find anything serious to give an FU to. I guess FU to the weekend going by so fast. This weekend flew by. Flew by! Alan? FU, I guess, to like, this is the longest I've worn my hair in years and years and years, and I need a haircut. It's higher maintenance than I'm used to, and I somehow have motivation to go to my barber. Which is totally like a vain and really superficial FU, but hair in my face. At least you have hair. True. Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit. We're running kind of long tonight again. But we'll try opening it up for a little bit, see what calls get through just after a couple more stories here. So, Loki. Alright, so we're just a little bit away from the Game Development Choice Awards and the Game Developers Conference, but along with that, they're seeing some of the nominees that are kind of leading the pack. The Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid 5. So, that's pretty awesome. Also, Bloodborne, Fallout 4, and Splatoon. So, I guess we'll find out who's going to win that on March 16th. Kind of seeing a very common theme amongst a lot of the nominees seem to be, you know, you see here Witcher, I've heard Splatoon a lot, but they're all good games. I do need to check out the Witcher 3, I think. That might be cool. Yeah, I really need to spend more time with that, and what a good time this part of the year where there's really nothing else coming out right now. And lastly, speaking of award shows, I think this is great. Voting is now open for the second annual CW, as in the television network, the CW, World Dog Awards. And guess what? Video games are included. You can actually go to the CW's website, CWTV.com, and you can actually vote for your favorite, I guess, dog from a video game. Dogmeat from Fallout 4, D-Dog from Metal Gear Solid 5, and Chop from Grand Theft Auto 5. Top video game dog. There's also TV and movie dogs, best celebrity selfie with their dog, best rescue story, and more. So, I thought what better note to end the show on than puppies. So, there you go. And I just think it's funny that best video game dog now being included, but hey, it has been a big year for video game dogs. So, would you vote for Chop, the Grand Theft Auto dog? Loki? He's alright. I don't know. Probably not. Alright, the Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call. You can give your feedback on any topic we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we missed, or maybe some type of game you've been playing. Who knows? Ooh, it's lighting up, so let's get to it. Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on? It's Ron. Hey, buddy. How you doing? I'm pretty good. I'm kind of stuffed from dinner, though. I'm still stuffed from dinner I ate on Friday, so I feel your pain. But, like Jamie, I'm also having barbecue, so yeah. Yeah, rub it in, rub it in. Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy? Well, I call to give advice on the whole podcasting situation that you discussed earlier. Oh, really? Alright, because what I did is something along the lines of what I got from Travis Donovan. I run my entire podcast through a mix board, but what I do is I use a USB mixer. That way, I have the line in open, and no matter what I throw through there, it picks up without any issues. Huh. I think that would be the best way to go, because I do have a Sound Blaster card, but I use it more for audio, and I have a 5.1 speaker system that is amazing, but that's neither here nor there. But when I'm doing my podcast, I have my little Behringer USB mixer here. It handles my Skype calls when we're live, and when I set up my second computer for the Skype line, I have a line in for that, and it handles that as well. Yeah, but if his sound card won't do the line in and what you hear at the same time, I don't... Oh, I see what you're talking about, though. You run the Skype through another application. Yeah, because what was happening... I used to use a whole Skype recorder thing, but then when you gave the option and the opportunity to go live, I'm like, I have to figure out a better way to do this. So, a little bit of research. With this mixer, I can set the Skype for line in, so whoever calls in is picked up on any issues, and I actually have a secondary external sound device. You've heard of Astro, right? Yeah. I have their mixer to use to hook up to the television or surround sound for gaming. I use it as an external sound device, which controls the music in the background. You know, it's a process that sounds like it would work. I just would hate to tell them, oh, you've got to buy this other thing now, because what I told you wasn't enough. So, I'm being stubborn, and I feel like it should work what we've got. Yeah, and one thing about Sound Blaster, when I jumped to Windows 7 64-bit, I ran into some issues with their drivers, and I had to go dig in for third-party alternatives just to get them to work. Ooh, I wonder if it has to do with 64-bit, because he's got a top-of-the-line computer. Yeah, that's it, yes. Huh, I didn't think about that. You hearing that, Alan? Could do with the fact that it's 64-bit, and the OLR computer definitely isn't that. Interesting. We'll have to look into that. That's a darn good suggestion. I like the idea of third-party drivers who might have to do it. Hey, send me an email with some suggestions on where to get third-party drivers, because I have no idea where to go looking. Will do, and when you guys redo the computer for OLR, I would just recommend picking up a simple USB mixer. Then you can use your original Mix port in, but this thing handles everything coming in and out. Good suggestion. I appreciate it. Yeah, no problem, dude. All right, take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go to try and grab some more calls. You got it. All right, and by the way, Anime Jam Session, back this week, right? Yes, we're doing our best of 2015, because we feel, why do our best in 2015 at the end of the year? Let's just wait until 2016, then look back. All right, fair enough. Do it your way. You got it, bro. All right, take care. You got it. Bye. Bye. All right, we have another call coming in. Let's get to our next call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hello, it's YYR. Hey, buddy, how you doing? Not too bad, not too bad. I mean, I'm still a little disappointed about the whole being wait-listed for MAGFest thing, but you know what? The last time I didn't make it into the showcase, I walked around the indie area, and there were a lot of really impressed games there. So I'm sure I won't be disappointed this year if multitasking was wait-listed, so there's that. Fingers crossed for you, for what it's worth. Yeah. Well, I'll be crossing my fingers, my toes, and my eyes. So what's on your mind? Oh, well, I figured I'd let you in on a little more information. I know you guys know about 2DX Infinitas, the new home version released in Japan. It actually came out last month. It is, of course, Japan only. In fact, the only way you can pay for it is using Aselli, which is their Konami funny money used mostly for their arcade games. Right. In fact, now here's the pricing scheme. Now, I guarantee you, your reaction to this is going to be, ah, Konami. Lay it on me. You ready for this? So you don't buy it outright, of course. What you pay for is a basic subscription, which lasts one month, and this costs 15.98 Aselli, which is really the same as Yen, so you're talking about 13.5 bucks. All right? Okay. And what do you get for this? You get to play the game as it is right now. It is just standard mode, there's no free mode, there's no courses, there's no class mode, no beginner mode, nothing. It's about 40 songs. Oh, can you hear me? Yeah. Hello? Yep, we hear you. Skype just came up and said there's a problem. There's a little bit of a delay, but it's not the end of the world, but go ahead. All right, cool. So most of the songs are from Sirius, 2DX17, because that's the first home version that didn't come out. Makes sense. But not all of it. Most of it, but not all of it. So it's just 40 songs, just standard mode, and that's all you get for me. Now, here's the rub. I think this combines the worst of two worlds, an MMO and PlayStation Plus. They have added 10 songs to the game for January, right? But you don't actually get the songs added to your game permanently unless you are subscribing during January. If you're one of these people who's like, I'm going to wait until more songs are in the game, that doesn't work, because every month you are not subscribing, you don't get those songs. Yeah, I'm not having it. I'm not a fan of that. I mean, maybe they'll come back to some songs at some point, but that seems a little... I think that'll kind of backfire on them. I mean, I don't know, but the Japanese culture might forgive that more than we would over here. They did announce that they may come back to some songs in the future, but if you think about it, it's like, well, every song they repeat is a new song I'm not getting, so it works both ways. Now, there's also a championship mode that they added to the game, right, that has a chorus of four songs that will be added to the standard mode if you complete that course while it's being offered. But in order to play that, you have to buy an Infinitas ticket, which is sold for 108 yen for one use. Oh my god, no. They're selling these one-use tickets, and there will be more modes added to the game that require them. So they're trying to make your PC an arcade machine that they directly take the money from. That's what it is. Essentially... Nah, I don't think so. Hence the whole discussion earlier on Konami being stubborn and this is going to blow up on them eventually. And you don't own anything, of course. You stop paying, that's it. You're done. You get nothing. Now, in fairness, before somebody else points it out that I'm not being fair, Guitar Hero has that whole thing where, you know, you can use a credit to play a song one time and all that. But my understanding as well with Guitar Hero is that there's a 24-7 feed of, you know, random songs, and you're not paying a monthly fee on top of it either with Guitar Hero. It's not there, so there's a big difference. You can put those songs in the feed for free, and, not to mention, you also, I mean, you paid $60 for it or, you know, $100 with the controller or whatever you paid when it was on sale, but you do still have an offline game that you own. So, there's that. Why do I have this weird feeling that, we were talking about crackers and hackers earlier, why do I have this weird feeling someone's going to reverse engineer Infinitoss and just kind of cut out Konami and put out whatever songs they want? I really feel like that's going to be a thing. You know what, I'm not so sure, only because you've already got the arcade rip of, you know, version 22 out there if you know where to go, and, well, that's got like 700 plus songs in it, so why would you waste your time with Infinitoss? Because I can. Now, here's the thing, too. Let's say you're not sure Infinitoss will run on your computer. The fuckery continues, it's amazing. Konami posted a trial version on their website that you can download. Sounds good, right? So, the trial version is, you start it and there's two buttons, start and exit. Start goes straight into a one song, it gives you 5-1-1 on normal, and it auto-plays it. So it's like a benchmark software, it's not really a demo, it's a benchmark. Exactly, and you can't even test the sync with your controller because you can't do anything. And then it's over, and it kicks you back to that menu. Start or exit. Yeah, I think there's a good reason why that game's not coming out outside Japan, and we'll see how well it does in Japan. I guess we will. Yeah, I hope we have a good week. Thank you. I don't know who's driving a Konami right now, but they're about to drive right into a wall, and it's so painful to watch. So painful. They're driving the desert bus. They are. They're driving the desert bus right off the road. YYR, I'm gonna let you go, we've got a delay going on here, but I'll see you at MagFest in about six weeks. I look very much forward to seeing you there. Alright, take care my friend. Take care, have a good one. You too. Alright, I think that's gonna do it for calls tonight, because we're well after nine o'clock, which is midnight on the East Coast. So we're gonna go ahead and move to wrap up tonight. But if you didn't get through, and you want to email the show, again, participate at orangeontrader.com, you can also tweet us. I do read all the tweets, even if I don't always get to them on air. I'm still waiting for a week where we're only at like two hours long, and we're like desperate for more information. But I do read all the tweets, and I do read all the stuff on Facebook and all that stuff, so thank you guys who continue to put that out there. Checking in with Loki real quick to see if there's any last minute stories. I kind of doubt it, but I'll check in. Not really, no. I think we hit most of it. It was relatively a slow news week. I can't believe we filled all that time, but that's what happens sometimes. So we managed to have enough rants to fill up an entire hour of show. So anyway, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange On Radio. Hey, I want to thank Alan real quick for being on the show tonight and doing the classic game and filling in with some stories there. I appreciate having him on. Alan, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? No, not really. No? I'm sure we'll see you again soon. Yes. Alright, sounds good. And hey, I do want to remind you guys, if you enjoyed Orange On Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread word of mouth about the show. You know, we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't participating, then we can't share them. So help us grow our family. You know, we don't ask for your money. We just ask for your recommendation. And if you can't really think of anyone to tell online, or even if you can, we still do appreciate five star reviews on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it is that you found this show. Because those reviews, they really do go a long way, and I really deeply appreciate each one of them where you take the 15 seconds to leave that review. I would appreciate it. I'm charging you less than 2DX Difinitas, okay? It could be a lot worse, people. It could be a lot worse. Alright, that's it. We'll be back in seven days. Star Soccer will be back. We'll talk about her trip to Disney now. We'll talk about what's coming up in gaming news. But of course, I have to close out with everybody's final thought. My final thought tonight is I think I'm finally, after all these weeks, gonna finally get around to playing Undertale this week. See what all the hype is about. You also need to play... it's like some pony game. Happy Pony? I don't know that one. It's similar to Undertale. Alright, I'll check that out. It's weird. Alright, and last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight? My final thought is hopefully I'm gonna work some more on my game this week, but probably will end up just playing Fallout 4. Alright, that's fair then. That's gonna do it. Have a good night everybody. Thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio. We'll see you again next week. Happy gaming. We'll see ya. See you next week.
