00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

This week, GOG.COM makes a play for more of your video game library by offering the ability to import select Steam titles into GOG, giving you not only the game, but any bonus items that GOG also provides.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Lace up your new Nintendo Vans and join us for all this and more on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:48.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, June the 5th of 2016, with episode number 644 of our show, broadcasting live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.

00:48.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, by my side as she is every week for the past 644 weeks.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Hi.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hi, how are you?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm okay. I look awful in this picture though.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, I don't like the way I look in my picture either.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So DarkSakura and I went clubbing Friday night, just so you guys know.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
We went out to a bar because you know DarkSakura and I love drag queens.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And I'm not trying to push a drag queen agenda on this show, but it's going to happen sometimes.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
And you really should always walk into a club purse first, if you're not already doing so.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
But anyway, so we went to see one of the big drag queen stars, Bob the Drag Queen, who was here on Friday.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
And we paid to get our picture taken with Bob, and of course we're looking at the pictures going, God we look awful.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
I think Jamie looks fine, and she says I look fine, but of course, you know how that is.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
You see pictures of yourself, and you're like, oh God.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, DarkSakura and I are having that moment right now.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
But you look good, DarkSakura, and your face was beat for the gods.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yes, ma.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, if it took an hour to wash off, one would hope so.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
But oh my God, at least my makeup got me a free drink.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Did it really?

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Because that guy, there was this guy, I was walking around with my fan, I broke my shade fan.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Fanning everyone, letting everyone fan themselves.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
And this one guy's like, oh, I can do one better, and he holds this ice cube over my head.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, God.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Dripped water onto my mug.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And I'm like, ah!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And his girlfriend's like, no, stop!

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Or whoever was with him.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
A, try not to scream into the mic, please.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And B, the things that drunk people do.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
He was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And I'm sitting here with my foundation going pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
And he's like, oh my God, can I make it up?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Let me buy you a drink.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
It reminds me of the nastiest drink ever, but I don't care because it was free vodka.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
It was like well vodka and crap ginger ale, but whatever.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
It was free.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, but we had a good time.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That's what's important.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
We did.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Except, uh, Dar Sacher and I got, well, I did.

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
I got very, very, very, very toasty drunk, which I haven't done since I was like, well, now that Alan drives, I have a designated driver when I go out.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, Alan just commented.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, did he? Yeah, there it is.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And doppy, I will tell you this.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
I don't care if people think I'm a drag queen because just wait until gamer X.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Drag cosplay.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
You heard it here first.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
It's happening.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
All right.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm sure we all look forward to it.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Meanwhile, we got to also say hello over there to somebody.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Unfortunately, who doesn't join us on our Friday night adventures, but we still love to have him here.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Say hi to tech master Loki.

03:29.000 --> 03:40.000
I would love to go, but you know, kids, uh, someday there'll be 18 Loki and we're going to get you all caught up on everything you missed.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
All right.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
We'll only be about what, 50, 50 years old by the time.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Hey, purse first.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
Uh, how have you been doing? I know you were having some drama with your air conditioner, which the heat here in Sacramento, we're in that lovely part of the year where it's triple degree heat.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
I know we have listeners in Arizona who are like, fucking fuck you, but it's bad for us.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Whatever you chose to live there. Okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Well enough how, how hot it is here.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And we chose to live here, Loki.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Uh, but, uh, your AC was broken for God's sake. That's a horrible, horrible thing, but you're all better now, right?

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, we got a new AC, new first. So we had them replace everything and it was nice the day that they replaced it because you know, I had no, it was pretty hot during the week.

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
It got up to 90 in the house. So while I was sitting there playing games, um, so I had a fan on, I'm like, this is not doing anything.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
I had like three fans on. I have a ceiling fan. I had a box fan and as small fan, they brought from work.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
So it's just like all on me at the same time. Like this is just drying me out cause it's just hot air being blown onto me.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Staying hydrated is the most important thing.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't even matter at that point. I mean, like I was drinking tons of water. It's just, it's not, it's just unbearable.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
This heat wave is everywhere right now. Um, in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network, vognetwork.com

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show and William murder face and chat saying it's a hundred in Portland, which is, is not common for them.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
So there's, you know, heat waves everywhere right now. So it's kind of gross. Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:25.000
And it wasn't so bad. I mean, cause like the last, like the last few days before the day I took off to actually have them install it, um, it was, it was hot in the house, but we would go out other places.

05:25.000 --> 05:39.000
And then I like had rigged up a air conditioner radiator thing using a box fan and some copper pipe. And so I actually did that and it worked somewhat, but you know, basically you select the box fans in the windows, sucked in the cool air.

05:39.000 --> 05:50.000
Once it cooled down a little bit and it was pretty bearable. It's just, it's, you know, hot, but yeah, 90 degrees when they finally, Oh, then on top of that, you know, Hey, yeah.

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
You know, you're going to hate hearing this, but we got to test the heater. So we got to turn the heater on for like five minutes. I'm like, bangs. Oh boy.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
Well, at least you can get, get out of the way when it's working. Now it's working great. So, uh, I want to tell one other quick story that's non gaming related.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
And then I promise we'll get into all the good video gaming content for, for the next three hours ish. Um, but I do want to mention, uh, the funny followup to dark soccer and I go into the club.

06:18.000 --> 06:30.000
So we're up until 2 AM because that's what people who have been drinking do. We find ourselves at Denny's. That's how, you know, we're drunk cause we allowed ourselves to eat at Denny's eating food that is incredibly crap for you.

06:30.000 --> 06:43.000
Um, and then I kind of realized at some point, Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be up at seven in the morning cause I'm doing a five K on Saturday. So in the heat on Saturday, thank God it was a little more overcast yesterday, but I, I actually walked.

06:44.000 --> 06:54.000
I didn't run it, but, uh, with coworkers, I walked a five K and it was, it was interesting because the whole, you know how like every, every marathon they do has some type of theme to it.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
That's, that's the big thing, right? Themed runs. I don't know if you guys have coworkers in this or seen this, but like,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
This marathon's theme is we're making you run even though you don't want to.

07:02.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay. Well, I know a big famous one is the beat the blurch thing. That's by the oatmeal guy, right? Where they actually have the blurches chase you around. Uh, Disneyland does one all the time. They do, Oh, they do night runs, right?

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
They do the color run where you throw the colored powder on. They totally just stole that from that holiday in India. They just, you know, you throw the color packets on each other.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I still want to do the, um, the mud run one day.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
They have that. Okay.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Which is a military obstacle course.

07:28.000 --> 07:43.000
So the twist on this one was that it was bubbles everywhere. And as you were running, you would, and you would think they would be like literally everywhere, but because we're in a drought, they, they had to, um, they had to, I guess, ration out the bubbles.

07:43.000 --> 07:54.000
So every kilometer you would run right through, it's like going through a fricking carwash or something. This just bubble overload everywhere. And it's just ridiculous.

07:54.000 --> 08:06.000
But nobody told me the bubble would have dye in it. So if I showed you the socks I wore yesterday, they are ruined. They're like red, green, blue, all the stupid bubble colors all over.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Save them for next year's pride.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
And yeah, the ironic thing was this was the same day as, as pride in Sacramento, which I didn't go to because the heat I knew it was going to be killer.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
So anyway, uh, act deft and chat says, fucking bubbles. Yeah. That's what I was saying at the end of it.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Uh, dark Tetsuya says way to adult Rob. Yep. Uh, let's see.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
SG100 Matt says I've ran two five K's in the past year. It's a great experience and I'm happy I did them.

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes, I understand. And I think that's great if you're trying to get fit and all that stuff, but my God, the people running these things have to be making a killing.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
I mean, cause they what? They charge you 20 bucks to do it and they get thousands of people to sign up for these things.

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
I can't imagine it costs that much money to put, you know, these little silly things at the stations and stuff. It's $10 for parking.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
They charge for shirts at the end. If you want shirts, they charge you to register the day of whoever's running these things is making a killing.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
That's why there's so many of these damn things. Like every month over it, over at the County fairgrounds, there's some type of fricking five K run going on.

09:11.000 --> 09:20.000
But anyway, Alan alchemy is in chat saying the socks look like they were soaked in cherry Kool-Aid. I want to just throw them away.

09:20.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah, that's probably what will be happening. All right. And act deaf says VOG five K. Uh, sure. I don't, I don't think we could get thousands and thousands of people to show up for that, but we could, we could do a five K lap around the dragon con hotels.

09:33.000 --> 09:46.000
Maybe that's something just dragon con do a five K I'm kind of surprised they don't VOG five K in the, in the VOG five K you have to play 5,000 video games and walk five meters.

09:46.000 --> 09:57.000
They're all video games that dark soccer has selected to personally torture you with. Wait, wait, what? The VOG five K you're going to pick 5,000 video games for people to play 5,000.

09:57.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes. All right. First thing I actually have that many first game everybody has to play. Well, how much do I hate everybody? A lot. Clue Clue land.

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
Please look forward to it. The VOG five K featuring clue clue land.

10:16.000 --> 10:24.000
No, no, no. Better yet. Cheetah man. All right. That'll be the second game. That'd be the second game is cheetah man. All right. Anyway, Bible adventures.

10:24.000 --> 10:33.000
Um, well, let's get into some gaming talk. So before we get to our gaming weeks, the type of games we've been playing this week that didn't involve running and bubbles and all this stuff.

10:33.000 --> 10:43.000
Let's talk a little bit about, um, gaming and what's going on in the news. Um, next week is going to be a really big show because next week is E3 week.

10:43.000 --> 10:54.000
And, um, even though, you know, we here at a VOG have decided to opt out of E3 this year, because we personally feel we can get as much out of it, following it online as we can being there at the show.

10:54.000 --> 11:06.000
That's the long and short of it. The reality is we are going to get a data dump from a lot of publishers starting next Sunday. I remember when E3 week, didn't E3 week start on Tuesday at one point.

11:06.000 --> 11:18.000
And it was because the expo was like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Wasn't that a thing along a few years ago. I feel like that was the thing. Now E3 week. Now the expo is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now E3 week starts on Sunday.

11:19.000 --> 11:33.000
So I was talking with dark Sakura before the show. And I was saying, you know what, with the, with the way the E3 schedule is next week, by this time on the next episode, we are going to know the details for Mass Effect Andromeda game.

11:33.000 --> 11:42.000
The dark soccer and I have been very much looking forward to Loki. Not so much. Why would we know when's the ether conference one o'clock on Sunday Pacific time.

11:42.000 --> 11:54.000
So EA will go before OLR. So you can already, so Loki brace yourself because that's going to be the start of next show, but there'll be some other stuff too. I'm sure. And you'll be screaming about some celebrities that showed up. I'm sure.

11:54.000 --> 12:03.000
Why would I scream at celebrities? I don't give a shit about celebrity. Exactly. Exactly. That will be Loki. And then Aisha Tyler showed up and I didn't care.

12:03.000 --> 12:29.000
That's Ubisoft. And I don't care. I still don't. I like Aisha Tyler. I've met her. She's awesome. I don't care. You can put any celebrity in front of you. You don't need celebrities. Just skip, skip the like formalities of like, ha ha ha. Here's our gameplay. Ha ha ha joke. It's not funny. Ha ha ha. You know, like I don't care. Just cut that shit out. Make your thing like 30 minutes shorter.

12:29.000 --> 12:51.000
To be fair, I actually think Aisha Tyler is great. It's just, when I thought of E3 and celebrities, she's the first one I thought of. I guess that's a compliment. Um, so. And for the love of God, no fucking musical performances for Just Dance or Rock Band if they're going to still do that. But like. There's no, Ubisoft is not Sunday, Loki. You don't have to worry about that. There's no Ubisoft. This is in general.

12:51.000 --> 13:05.000
So then, so next week we're going to have to do a show. So next week's show is going to be very interesting. We're going to have to do a show like we did last year because Bethesda has rudely decided to do their press conference right smack in the middle of our show.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Hoping for that Skyrim HD.

13:08.000 --> 13:21.000
So at seven o'clock, we are going to take an extended break. And then while we all watch the Bethesda thing, because I know what y'all are gamers. I'm not going to expect that you're going to be listening to Orange Laundry instead of watching the conference.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Honestly, I don't know what their plate is for.

13:24.000 --> 13:37.000
Well, I'm, I'm glad you asked that because I wanted to go around quickly since this is our last opportunity, really. I wanted to check in. What do you guys think is going to happen with EA and Bethesda? And I opened this up to the chatters as well.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
What do you guys think is going to happen with EA and Bethesda next week? So Loki, you're hoping for a Skyrim?

13:43.000 --> 14:00.000
I think it'd be cool. Like a Skyrim HD or something like that would be nice because I like Skyrim and I don't follow. That was good. And it would be nice to see something like that. I don't really know what else they would have planned. I think I thought there was maybe a new Wolfenstein game coming or something.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Well, the last one was pretty well received, right?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Apparently, yeah. I bought it. I still haven't played it yet, but I bought it.

14:05.000 --> 14:25.000
I think a sure thing is going to be Doom DLC because I think Doom is, I kind of feel like it's doing better than even Bethesda expected. I don't know. Maybe they expected it, but even the critical reviews have been very good. And it is, I mean, I played some more Doom this week. It is a great game. It really, I mean, it's a little gross, but I can look past that.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm waiting for it to go on sale just because I don't know how much of it I'd play right now, but it looks good.

14:32.000 --> 14:47.000
And of course we're getting some questions from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. Stoppy says, very good idea for that break. Makes it easier on me. I don't have to choose. Look, we're just being realistic. We know. It's E3 week. You're going to choose the press conference.

14:47.000 --> 14:58.000
Even I, and here's the thing, some folks have asked, why don't you guys run a commentary stream so we can listen to you guys commentate while the Bethesda thing's going on in my honest to God answer.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
And you're not going to like it, but I'm all about the truth here at Orange Springs Radio is because I think those things are stupid.

15:05.000 --> 15:21.000
Because I, I have tried to find a previous E3s. I'll be like Nintendo live stream and I'll look it up on Twitch and it's like angry dude commenting on Nintendo conference. It's like, I don't care. I just want the information right now. So that's so because of personal bias.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't remember doing any streams.

15:26.000 --> 15:37.000
Now. Yes. Snarky with text is different. Bobby says, I have no problem snarky with text. That's very different. So we probably still will in the chat room provide that because that's something optional. You can kind of look away to and stuff like that.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
I don't know. I think it's fun, but the problem is though is like you have video and you're watching the video, so there's a lot of silence.

15:44.000 --> 16:04.000
I'll tell you what, what we could do, we could record something and make it like a special thing that is like an option. I won't even put it on the feed. It'll be like an optional download somewhere. Like an extra, this is what, if we had a Patreon, it's one of those things I put on the Patreon, like a bonus thing that you can go download and just hear Loki scream about everything, which I know some of you love.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Scream about everything last year.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Actually yeah, Bethesda had one of the better conferences last year.

16:08.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, I thought they knocked it out of the park last year. I mean, so I have high expectations. Well, I have no expectations because I don't know what the hell they're coming out with because as long as they don't talk about all their roles online because no one gives a shit about that anymore. I don't know. A new Elder Schools game would be nice.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
Tiger Claw in chat says, giant bomb does it. They do commentary over the press conferences.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I stand by what I said.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
And also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, somebody said, oh, Kajuda said Bethesda has nothing to show.

16:41.000 --> 16:55.000
Well, I have a conference. And I feel like they did have surprises last year. In fact, they dropped a pretty big one last year with the whole Fallout Shelter. That ended up being a huge thing.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
And I know some of you guys are going to roll your eyes to the back of your head with the phones.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
And console mode for Fallout 4, which is just starting to roll out.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
And Fallout 4 in general. I mean, people knew it was coming, but we got a ton of information last year.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Oh yeah, it's Dishonored 2. That's right. That is their thing this year.

17:13.000 --> 17:21.000
So, what do you think Bethesda will have this year? Do you think Elder Scrolls will get the reveal of the next game in the franchise?

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't know if they'll have another game, because that takes a while. I mean, maybe it's possible.

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
I think maybe more DLC for Fallout 4, because we're kind of at the end of what they've announced for the season pass already.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
So, there may be more stuff coming, which I think they did say that that was going to be the case.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Actually, no, I know that they've said that that's going to be the case.

17:42.000 --> 17:52.000
And then there's, you know, it'd be nice, even just an HD collection of Skyrim and Oblivion would be nice, or just Skyrim.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
Darsakra, I know you don't play as many Bethesda games, but any thoughts on what they might bring to the table next Sunday?

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
Skyblivion. They'll probably pick another continent in their world and name a game after it.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Why not?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
I would be cool with another property, like something brand new.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Well, actually, that's something I think is...

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Another Star Trek game, how about that?

18:15.000 --> 18:28.000
You laugh, but we have the new series coming in 2017, and we have the Star Trek Beyond movie, so I don't think it's beyond all possibility that Star Trek's named.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
I realize those games haven't been very good, but maybe they're going to do something to really, you know, make us drool over them.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Although, you know, temper your expectations, people. The video games don't usually end up being very good.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
I kind of wish that they'd do a revisit back to that Call of Cthulhu game. Remember that one that we saw years ago at E3?

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
I would love to see something like that come out. If they still own the rights, they should totally do a new Call of Cthulhu game.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Okay.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
You know.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
You just like Cthulhu.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Blurgh.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
It's the tentacles, you know, they're kind of a turn on.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm down for the original IP. I think Bethesda does, you know, we had the Evil Within just a couple of years ago.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
We had their Team Fortress-y game that I don't remember in the moment what it was called. I don't even know if that ever came out.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Umm...

19:17.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't remember, dammit, I don't remember what it was called. Somebody in chat will save me here, but you know, they have original IPs sometimes.

19:26.000 --> 19:36.000
So I think that's, that is probably what we'll see is something completely new. So I know that's such a safe prediction, but in this day and age, is that a safe prediction?

19:36.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, we haven't really heard too much about them. I mean, I know what they've got coming, so anything that they've got as a surprise is actually pretty much a surprise right now.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
So I'm looking forward to it, I guess.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
And Act Deft is saying Dishonored 2, and you know, I'm sure that is going to be a huge, huge thing.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, they'll probably have like a nice gameplay portion for that.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
But they talked about at least four or five games last year, so I'm expecting to see something similar this year.

20:00.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, I was, I remember Doom was a big part of it. Fallout 4, they showed off gameplay for that.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
Didn't they talk about Elder Scrolls Online at the very beginning, like an expansion or something for that? I seem to recall.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I'd completely filter out anything Elder Scrolls Online.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
I know, I don't, I wonder if they're still going to keep that going or if they're kind of done with that. We'll see.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
Alright, Doom Plague in chat says Hexen Reboot.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
That'd be cool.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Actually, I'm fucking here for that.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh, you know what, I hear something that we haven't heard of in a while. What about a new Quake game?

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
What about a new Quake game? It would seem a little weird though, my only concern is that Doom just came out.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Like, is it really time to talk about another shooter right now?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yes.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm asking the wrong crowd.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And how about more Unreal Tournament while we're at it?

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm all for more Unreal. Anyway, let's talk about the other one real quick that's going to be on Sunday.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
So, before OLR, here's the day to make predictions. EA, what's going to happen with EA?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
What do you guys think?

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
I'm going to be bored with all their sports coverage, which is going to be the majority of it.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Mirror's Edge is awesome, but isn't that already out?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, it's like they've already had the beta.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
It's coming out, I think, next week or something.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah, it's like weeks away from coming out, so that's a good question.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Are they going to emphasize Mirror's Edge because they know they have a captive audience,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
or are they going to kind of de-emphasize a little bit?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I would assume they have to talk about it.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, Mass Effect, Titanfall 2 are going to be big.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I think Titanfall 2 is going to be huge.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Mass Effect, obviously, is going to be big.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
I would like to see, I mean, it's a pipe dream. I'd love to see that new Criterion game that they're working on right now.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I kind of wish it wasn't the game that they're working on, it was a new Burnout game.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Like, so much. That would be fantastic.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I would be very happy.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
A brand new Burnout.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I would be very happy to see Eraser.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
It's so amazing.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah, I would be very happy.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Even like, I was watching a trailer today, a launch trailer for that.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
It was a golf game I talked about last week.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Extreme Golf, Dangerous Golf, I don't remember what it was called.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I think it was Dangerous Golf or something like that.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Came out on Thursday.

22:04.000 --> 22:12.000
And they have this thing that's like a Smash Breaker, which is a total fucking rip-off of the Crash Breaker from Burnout.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
But then it's like, man, I really want another Burnout game.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And I think they have a new E for Speed game coming out, but I don't know if that's this year or not.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
I think it might be next year.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, Battlefield 1 is pretty much a definite for EA.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Of course, yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Oh yeah, Battlefield 1, duh, completely forgot about that.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
How did you, you play that more than us?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't play Battlefield that much.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Actually, I have Battlefield 4.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
We have Mass Effect, you have Battlefield.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I don't play Battlefield, though.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Battlefield's more sim.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
I stick to the Call of Duty, which is, you know, very arcade-y.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
It's good, I like Battlefield 4 a little.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
I haven't played it too much.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
I really thought about buying Hardline and stuff because it was down to like 10 bucks.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
I'm like, eh, but am I really going to play this?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Battlefield 1 looks good, though.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Let me ask this very random question.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Do we think maybe anything on the PC front?

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
You know, we haven't talked a lot about Origin for a long time.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
You know, EA's PC platform has been, I guess, a little bit dormant.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Is it too early for another Sims game?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
You know, Sims 4 is in the news this week.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
We'll get to that a little later in the show, but is it too early to talk about Sims 5?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Are they going to attempt to do a SimCity?

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
Well, didn't Maxis get, it could be awkward, I don't know.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
It would be interesting to see if they try, though, to do a Sim something.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
How about SimAnt Revisited?

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
But I would like to see like a PC exclusive type of thing coming from EA, you know?

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
As much crap as SimCity got and, you know, as tepid as the response to Spore was,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
I think that's a universe that's still worth visiting, but...

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Now, Tigerclaw is saying there's a new Star Wars game.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah, I remember hearing about that, but there's just going to be like either another Battlefront game, which...

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Come on, I mean, that was an incomplete game that they put out with DLC that was way too expensive,

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
and now you're telling me I have to buy another game for more content?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Fuck you, seriously.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
Well, with Rogue One being in theater, I mean, we live in a day and age now

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
where there's going to be a new Star Wars movie every year.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
It's a little weird, but awesome.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
So, you know, maybe there'll be a tie-in game for Rogue One.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Who knows?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
We'll see.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
All right.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Okay, so we will find out...

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Oh, by the way, Act F says Mirror's Edge is out on the 7th.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, I thought it was this week, because it's on EA Access, which is usually about a week early, so...

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
I still think they'll bring it up, if nothing else, DLC talk.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That's always a given.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That's how they push their current stuff, is...

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Well, there's supposed to be a TV show they're making too, I think.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Well, that is true. That is very true.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It should be boring as shit.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And Dungeon... Or, excuse me, sorry.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Doomplague in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
City Skylines is on sale on Steam at the moment. Forget SimCity.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
Exactly, yeah. If there was a new SimCity to come out, it would have to really do much better than it did last time.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Like, it'd have to set that bar way higher.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
As much as I don't really give a shit about this game, I'm thinking maybe another Plants vs. Zombies thing.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
I don't know about Garden Warfare 3.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Maybe something in that casual space, the PopCap space, you know what I mean?

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Peggle 2 is alright, I guess.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Why not Peggle 3?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Why not? Let's do it.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Something new. Like, they have some new IPs that come out every now and then.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I mean, I'd be happy with that.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
Or, hey, EA, let's just totally pipe dream. Let's throw out a DJ game of some sort.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
You know, hey, did Rock Band do well enough for you?

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
EA had nothing to do with Rock Band 4.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Oh, okay, well.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
And fuck, I don't... Can you make a DJ game anyways?

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Alright, we're gonna move on and talk about our gaming week.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
We'll see what comes through next week at E3, when E3 starts on Sunday.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
So weird. Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
going into more current stuff.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Dark Sakura, starting with you. How was your gaming week?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Um, I played World of Warcraft.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
You've been on hiatus for that for a long time, so...

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Like, two years.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So how is it going back?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I forget how to pet battle, and I kinda don't care.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I really like it. I like the story.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
I was really interested in the whole Warlords of Draenor thing,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
because that's actually one of my favorite things out of the lore.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
Or, you know, the Draenei and all that business they went through.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
And, um...

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
It's a sort of interesting kind of, I guess, time traveling a little bit in the game.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Um, it's also, uh...

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I love the art style for it. I think it's pretty...

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
It's definitely looking a lot better than it did when I quit.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Um, the graphic updates are nice.

26:56.000 --> 27:05.000
Um, and it's just, it doesn't force me to have to do instances when I don't want to.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
To level.

27:07.000 --> 27:15.000
The level progression feels a lot more solid than Final Fantasy XIV does.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
And I like being able to separate my characters and their jobs.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I just like it. It's easier for me.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Plus, I have something, you know...

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I can dedicate the time on one thing and not have to switch and change gear classes,

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
and have everything stored in my storage, and it's just much better managed.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
I mean, I think that XIV is prettier in general.

27:37.000 --> 27:45.000
But I think that there's a greater air of magic, of fantasy, in World of Warcraft.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
And so, I'm glad to be back.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
I'm still solidly Team XIV, but I am curious what the new expansion's gonna do.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
You know, new expansions are always an exciting time for an MMO, so...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
That's another part of the lore that I like.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
I think I read all of the...

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Oh, what were the books?

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
It was about Malfurion and Illidan and all them,

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
where folks go back in time and see everything firsthand.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
I liked that trilogy, and so I'm actually hoping to see more fallout from it.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Let me ask this very random question,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
because this is something else that's happening right now that's kind of a big deal.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
You know, in the UK, it's happening right now, and we're gonna get it.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I believe next Friday, and that is the Warcraft movie.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
That's kind of a big deal in gaming.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
I understand the reviews have been pretty tepid so far, what we're seeing,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
but do you have interest in the Warcraft movie?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, I'll see it. I don't care how bad it is.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I kind of feel like I have to.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Like, that part of me that played World of Warcraft,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
even though I haven't in years,

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
well, besides just the random flirting with WoW here and there,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
but I haven't really played Warcraft seriously, like raiding and stuff, in a long time.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
And I kind of feel like that part of me that did take it seriously for a while,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
like I kind of owe it to that part of myself to see the Warcraft movie,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
but I'm going in with real low expectations.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
I'm going in preparing to take a nap.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
Well, you know, me, I have a particular love of bad movies with a good story.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
And you know what I mean by bad movies with a good story.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Yeah, Showgirls.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
That movie was a shit show, but I love it.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
You don't know shit.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
I did the hand thing. You guys didn't see it.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
But, oh, by the way, I finally got to do that in Miitomo.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
What's your favorite scary movie? Showgirls.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Oh, is that a question in Miitomo?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah, what's your favorite horror movie?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
So I did Showgirls.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Love it.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
So anyway, I have been doing Miitomo.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
Right now, I'm dressed like an Azalea trail maid in the game,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
which only people from the deep south know what that is.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Also, a little bit of Heroes of Dragon Age.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
I'm starting to lose steam on it until I can get Cullen,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
and then I'll play it a whole lot more.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
I got Ocarina of Time 3D for my 3DS.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
It was 20 bucks. I was like, why not? I want to play it.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
So I can actually take it at work, because I freaking love Ocarina.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
So I'll enjoy getting to play that again.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
What else did I play?

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh, I did buy something that we will be talking about on the show

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
until the Windows emulation just was like, ugh, ugh, ugh.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
It's like old-ass Windows emulation on top of it.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Oh, okay.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
And no ability that I could find so far to play it windowed.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
So if I can figure out how to play it windowed, I will enjoy it a lot better,

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
because then I can shrink it and have at least the resolution look right.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
But I'm not going to play it so I can figure that shit out.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So I guess we'll come back to that in a little bit,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
but if you were listening last week, you might already know what it is.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
It was all right. I played a shit ton of Final Fantasy XI.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
On a private server, of course.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Oh, shame. I kind of want to go shame on you, but at the same time it's like,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
all right, Final Fantasy XI is how old at this point?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Exactly.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Square really needs to get free.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Here's why it's awesome, before you judge.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
So I'm playing on a fun server, is what they call it,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
and they have a lot of things tweaked in there.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Like the experience rate is ungodly.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I think it's like 30 times the normal experience rate.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
And then your guild rate is really high as well,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
even though you really don't need to buy anything,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
because everything on the auction house is 100 gil.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
It doesn't matter what it is, and they constantly stock it.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
And then of course the drop rate is ridiculous as well.

31:50.000 --> 31:59.000
You get this auto regen, refresh, TP increase, and all this other stuff automatically.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
And on top of all that, all your spells are unlocked completely,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
so you don't have to do that in all your jobs,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
and all the limit breaks for your jobs are all unlocked.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
So it's nice, so you don't have to do all that hassle stuff.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
I soloed a black mage to 67 in about less than eight hours.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Wow.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Yeah, exactly.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
You know, if Shane's out there listening,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and I doubt he is because he's probably working,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
but you're going to get a text message from him shortly.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Where, how, when.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The only thing that kind of sucks is they have something,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
because it is on a private server,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
some things don't work correctly.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
So you can't do the Abyssia stuff, you can't do Corsair.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
What? That's like my favorite job in the whole game.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah, Corsair Puppet Master, and Rune something or other.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Oh, the stuff that came with that expansion.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah, because it's basically a little buggy,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
and it could cause a server to crash.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
So if you do that stuff, so they've locked those out,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
but everything else is fair game.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
So I'm basically running, I think at one time I had the plus int gear,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
which now that I did some research into it,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
actually plus magic attack is what I want,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
so I'm going back and doing it.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
But my plus int gear was so ridiculous,

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
it was like plus 36 int on my black mage,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
and so apparently it doesn't do a whole ton,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
so I actually have to go re-buy everything now.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But yeah, it's been fun.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
There are some other people playing,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I never run into anybody ever,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
so I've been soloing everything,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
and with the refresh regen stuff,

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
I mean, there's really no healing in between anything,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
it's just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
And with the rate of experience,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
you can level up to like 15 in one of the starter areas

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
in about less than 30 minutes.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I mean, really the most time is like,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
oh crap, I gotta upgrade my gear,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
because it's been about 15 levels since I did that.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So that's really the big thing.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And running also item management,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
because the drops are so much,

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
you're just like constantly auto-sort, auto-sort, auto-sort.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
And oh crap, I gotta dump all these stacks

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
of rabbit furs and stuff that I have.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
So it's just extremely fun.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm liking it a lot,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
because it's just took all the grind out of it.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
There's still grind, and you're not invincible,

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
because now I'm soloing down in Crawler's Nest

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
or in, god, the tree with the spiders and stuff,

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
I don't remember what it was called.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Oh, the Boyata tree or whatever it's called, yeah.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Boyata tree, yeah.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Trying to solo there, and it's extremely dangerous,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
to the point now where, crap,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
this stuff is actually put up a fight,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
this regen stuff's not really working out,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
or like, oh crap, I gotta kill this thing,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
but it's next to all these other things,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
and it's just gonna chain them together.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Do they let you do the trust people,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
like the NPCs that play with you?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I think you can do the trust.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
You should get on that if you haven't already,

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
because those things help a lot.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
The other thing too that you can do as well

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
is you can teleport, basically.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
You can give yourself a chocobo at any time,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
so they have little command line things you can put in,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
so you can do the chocobos,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
you can teleport to different areas,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
so it just saves on, there's no ship travel,

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
there's no chocobo crap that you have to do to get that,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
just go, go, go, go, go.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I mean, that's what I love about it,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
is just take all the crap out of it,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
and it's just the game.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
All right, cool.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
And then aside from that,

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
I played a little bit of Ingress,

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
more Pokemon Go, and yeah.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
I mean, I hate level five in Pokemon Go.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
I got a Magikarp, so that was kind of fun.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I was like, woo, Magikarp.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I heard you need something like 99 to evolve one of those.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
You have to catch 99 Magikarp to evolve.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah, I have to look at it now,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
because they've changed how they do everything.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
So now they have these candies and dust,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
and I don't know, it's just,

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
I'm like, what the fuck is all this stuff?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
They have to snort stuff, and then they believe they're-

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Well, they have it now, though, that you can use it to,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
you can increase the stats of your characters,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
because before it was just like,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
okay, you have to catch so many,

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
then you evolve it to the next thing,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
and then catch so many of that,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
and you evolve it to the next thing.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Now you can kind of recycle your Pokemon,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
and get these things to evolve them,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
or change their stats or something.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
So I just love the mess of that,

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
but yeah, it's all right, I guess.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
And then Ingress, I need to play more of it,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
because I'm out of everything, and yeah.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, actually, I'm out of level six resonators now.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
It's just crazy.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Gotta go hack more.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
It would be nice if there were actually things I could hack

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
that aren't all level eight now.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
All right, yeah, I'll show you some places to go.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Anyway, let's move on.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Talking about my gaming week,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and the things I've been playing this week.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
So not Pokemon Go, but Pokemon Alpha Sapphire,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
I've still been playing a little bit of that.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I was talking about that last week,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
where I just suddenly got interested in Pokemon again.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
So I was playing just a little bit of that on 3DS this week,

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
but not a lot.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
So finally, Loki, you'll get a kick out of this,

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
on the Xbox One, I finally, finally, after all this time,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
loaded up Saints Row 04.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Oh, I thought you were going to say Grand Theft Auto 5,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
but I'll take Saints Row 04.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
That's not backwards compatible yet.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
But Saints Row 04, they gave away, right?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So I finally fired that up and played it,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
and I played through the first three chapters, probably.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
So I played the opening,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and I don't want to give too much away,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
but the big scene with the music

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
that's supposed to make you laugh,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
but I didn't think it was as funny

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
as the opening to the third game,

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
which I've never laughed harder at a video game in my life.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
But it was still fun.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
And then there's this really weird flashback,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
where you're in a 50s sitcom type of thing,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
and the way your character walks around.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
I was dying.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Everything's so over the top.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
So there's still a lot of that funny stuff.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Just because the opening wasn't as good

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
doesn't mean the game isn't still fucking funny.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
But here's the interesting thing,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
and the part where I ended up stopping.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So you finally, after going through those sequences,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
you end up basically in the same world

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
from Saints Row 03, right?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Yep.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
So you're driving around in the car.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Well, as I'm driving around,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
all of a sudden the car disappears,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the game freezes,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
and my character is just sitting there

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
like she's driving the car, but there's no car.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And I can't move anything.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Where's my fucking car?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Exactly.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Where's my sweet ass wheels?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
It's just, and the game froze.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And I'm like, is this an emulation thing?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
What happened?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
It's a Saints Row thing.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Is it a Saints Row thing?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
It's a Saints Row thing.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
They have the whole buggy Saints Row thing.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
That was in that.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Oh, okay.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Well, there you go.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
I just didn't really,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and for you really don't need to be driving cars anyways.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Well, you do at one point just,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
well, the story tells you two to go get a gun, basically.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
This is where I was at.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
And then it froze, and I was like,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
all right, I guess I'm gonna move on

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
and play other things.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
But here's what I've been playing the most of this week.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
So if you listen to the entire episode of Orange Lawns Radio,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
and I know not all of you do,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
because it's a long show,

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
but the very, very end of last week's show,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I think my final thought was something like,

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
I really hope I can resist the temptation to buy Overwatch

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
because it's getting really difficult to not buy Overwatch.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Well, guess what I did after last week's show?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I bought Overwatch.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And so I've been playing a lot of Overwatch.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
And I gotta tell you,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I was really skeptical about Overwatch

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
for a variety of reasons.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
A, are any of my friends gonna be playing

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
because, you know, a lot of these big multiplayer games,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
like, you go and everybody's playing for a week

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
and then everybody's gone, right?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
B, the lack of a single-player mode

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
still kind of kills me a little bit.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
You know, so there were still some reservations I had,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
but everybody online is just talking about

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
how great it is, how great it is.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I remember playing the beta and thinking,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
well, it's not that bad.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
And then I realized on PC,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
and this is really tricky, so just a heads up,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
although you can buy the console editions for 60 bucks,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
the Origins edition,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
and that's the one that shows up in the launcher for PC

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
as a $60 edition,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
look very carefully and read the screen carefully

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
because underneath the purchase $60 Overwatch Origins editions link,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
there is a little link that says,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
just, or, buy just Overwatch,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
or buy regular Overwatch or plain Overwatch.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And if you click that link

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
through the Battle.net store on PC only,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
you can get Overwatch for 40 bucks.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
You just miss all that extra shit.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
You don't get the extra skins, who cares?

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
You don't get the wow pet, I don't fucking care,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
the Diablo wings, okay, that would have been cool,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
but not $20 cool.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So once I found that, I was like, okay,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
now it's only 40 bucks, all right, fuck it,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm just going to buy it.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
And I've got to say, I'm not disappointed,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and it's a really weird place for me

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
because I'm not usually into first person shooters,

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
but I should have listened to what I say all the time

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
about Blizzard because it's holding itself true again.

40:47.000 --> 40:53.000
Blizzard excels at making genres accessible to everybody.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
They did it with the MMO with World of Warcraft

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
because you look at that compared to a game like EverQuest

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
or Final Fantasy XI, it's like, wow, it's super accessible.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
They did it with Heroes of the Storm and the MOBA.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
They've done it with Hearthstone and the trading card game.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And now they've fucking done it with Overwatch

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
and the first person shooter.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
It's extremely just accessible and easy to pick up and play,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
and it's really, really fun.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
And the part that is surprising me greatly

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
is that I can play with strangers

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
and actually be totally okay with it.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm not really finding myself in a toxic environment.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Why? I just disabled voice chat, easy as pie.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
And there's still enough to do

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
where you don't really feel like you're working against your team.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
I have a lot of fun with it,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
but I have way more fun when I do have friends.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I was playing with some friends.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
For those of you that listen to Starboard Power Coupling,

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
which, by the way, shout out, they're going to be 100 years old.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
No, they're having their episode 100 in, I think it's on June 18th.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Is there a 100th episode?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
So, yeah, that's very cool, so congrats to them.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
But I was playing with Dr. Ken from that show

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
and some of his WoW rating buddies that I had met at BlizzCon a couple years ago.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
We all played Overwatch the other night, and I had a great time.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And it was cool because I got to experiment with some characters

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
I don't usually get to play around with, and nobody cared.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
So I got to do a couple matches as Winston

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
when I'm really used to doing support.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
One other thing I'm going to say about Overwatch

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
that I think is very important as to why this game is so successful.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
I think Overwatch, this is going to be a big statement I'm about to make,

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
I think Overwatch has the best art direction

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
and cinematic presence of any video game ever.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I really believe it.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
I think Overwatch has the best art direction

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
and cinematic presence of any video game I have ever played, ever.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
And I think that goes a long way as to why this game is so fun

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
because it feels like you're playing a frickin' movie.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
A lot of that has to do with the way the sound is designed

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
and how you get climatic music during certain points of the game

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
and it just has this big epic feel to it.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Part of it is just the way the plays of the game are designed, how that plays out,

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
because it kind of gives you something to hope for and look forward to

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and kind of see at the end of the game

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
and it kind of just bookends to a really cool story

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
when a game only runs for like ten minutes or less.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
And so it's a very great thing to approach in short bursts.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
The heroes are fantastically well designed.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Look at all the fan art out there

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
and other stuff we were talking about last week,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
the CD'er stuff, so to speak,

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
but the characters are extraordinarily well done.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
I don't think that type of stuff can be ignored about Overwatch

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
and why it's doing so well.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
What did they say? Seven million people were playing it the first week?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
I refuse. I still suck at FPSs unless it auto-aims for me.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
I do notice the aiming mechanism is much more forgivable

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
than it is in other games.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
It seems like the hitboxes are much larger

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
or there's a little bit of an assist going on.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
But I will say this, Bobby.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Depending on which character you play, you may not need to aim.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
For example, Mercy.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
If you're going to heal, you don't need to aim

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
because it's like the medic in Team Fortress 2.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
You just run behind them and you use either the heal gun

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
or you use the support gun

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and it automatically attaches a line to them.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
So there's that.

44:34.000 --> 44:40.000
Or with Symmetra, you're very rarely in the fold attacking people.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
I mean, you kind of can, but again, her weapon,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and I think Winston's weapon is like this too,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
you just have to be kind of near the target

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
and the weapon will, it's more like an area of effect weapon

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
than it is like a gun that you aim.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
So there's that.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
And I was going to say, there was another character too

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
that's like this where you don't necessarily have to be able to aim.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Oh, Soldier 76.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
His ultimate ability is that you just shoot anywhere you want

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
and the bullets will automatically hit any opponent that's in range.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
The ultimates are very interesting.

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
So, I mean, that is how Blizzard made a first person shooter more accessible,

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
is that not everybody necessarily needs to first person shoot.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
It's crazy, but it works.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Let's see.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Bobby says, isn't it a team game so you would need voice chat?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Not necessarily.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
The objectives are usually pretty clear.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Everybody knows their role.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
I think it can be enhanced with voice chat, but it's not needed.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Let's see.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
Also looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
ActDef says, so basically it's just Team Fortress 3

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
with more likeable characters.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
And I'm not shading Team Fortress 2.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
Team Fortress 2 has very likeable characters, incredible characters.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
Overwatch somehow pushes it further and it's pretty amazing.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Let's see.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
And VidPower in chat says, Overwatch's characters are so likeable.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah, I agree.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
And lastly, Tigerclaw in chat says, so you can play the game in third person

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
and still get hits if your aiming is off.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Can you play in third person?

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
I know you can spectate in third person, but if you can play in third person,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
I haven't seen that yet, but it seems like the engine can render it.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
I haven't looked for it, so I don't want to say it's not there.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
But again, it would depend on your characters.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So there you go.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
All right.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
And then Kaijuto says, this guy is caught up in the hype.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Let's see what he says in December.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
I don't know if that's totally a fair statement

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
because a good game is a good game, and yeah, it's a lot of fun right now.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Will it still go in December?

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
I kind of think Blizzard, based on their track record,

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
have a pretty good way of keeping their games relevant.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
And I think they will do, I mean, if they make good on their promise

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
of new maps, new characters, things like that,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
to make you want to revisit the game,

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
I think they will sustain it through December.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
We'll see.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
So how about that DLC or the in-game microtransactions?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I just ignore it.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
It's skins, it's sprays, and you get some for leveling up,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
like tagging the walls and stuff,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
and you can change the quotes and the characters and stuff like that.

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
I still kind of don't like it, but I just don't support it.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
So I don't buy from the store because I don't need that stuff.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Fair enough.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
All right.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
But that's enough.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
I have talked plenty and plenty about Overwatch.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
I want to get into...

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
If someone will get it for me, that would be great

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
because I actually do want the WoW stuff.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I might start playing Diablo again.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Diablo is really fun.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I got it for free.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
By the way, that's an example of the whole

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
is Overwatch still going to be relevant six months from now type of thing.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I'm still playing Diablo 3.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
How long ago did that game come out?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
That game was a fucking mess when it came out.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I quit playing it soon after I hit level 10.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
But yet you're tempted to...

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Does anybody remember the server issues?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Does anybody still focus on that?

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
No.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Exactly why a SimCity 2 could possibly be a thing.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Perhaps.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Very much so.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Okay.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
We got to get into some housekeeping.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I want to get into gaming news for the week as well.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
So housekeeping for the week.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Next week's show is going to be a little bit different

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
as we mentioned earlier with the whole E3 stuff going on.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
But we will be here in studio.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
I do want to give one more shout out for what is going on in Atlanta

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
this upcoming weekend, the Southern Fried Gaming Room Expo.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I've been talking about this on the show.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
If you are in the Atlanta area, I urge you to check it out.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
It's going to be running June 10th through 12th.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
It's old school arcade games.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Panels.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
Just kind of like celebrating that gaming culture.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Especially if you love the video games of the 80s and 90s.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I really think you're going to enjoy it.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I'm really bummed I can't be out there in person.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
I wanted to go.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
I explored going.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
But just with my job transition late last year,

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
I just wasn't going to be able to make it work.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I had to choose this or Dragon Con.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I chose Dragon Con.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
But our very own Bobby Blackwolf will be there.

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
He told me he's doing three panels on Saturday and one panel on Sunday.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
This is the Bobby Blackwolf Expo, I think.

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
He's not moderating the ball, but he's participating in four different panels throughout the weekend.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
You will have ample opportunities to say hello to Mr. Blackwolf.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
If you are a VOG listener, he will be there.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I'm sure some of our other listeners will be.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
Be sure to let us know in chat or on Twitter if you're going to be at Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Maybe next year I'll be able to join you guys.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Hopefully I'm able to make that work.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Check that out this upcoming weekend.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I also want to give a shout out.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Speaking of Bobby, our YouTube channel, if you haven't checked in on that lately,

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
be sure to visit our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
It's our username on YouTube.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
If you missed the Mass Effect ride review that I did with Shane from Ranger Pridecast,

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
you should check that out.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
That's still there on the feed.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Bobby has uploaded a couple interviews this week.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
Bobby showed this week very, very, very much about AR and the Hololands and his experiences with that.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
If you want to take that one step further, Bobby's done a few interviews.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
My understanding is there's more and more video.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Bobby's been very busy these past couple weeks.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
That is coming soon to the YouTube channel.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
Check that out as our YouTube presence is expanding this year.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
Be sure to like, subscribe, and all that fun stuff.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I noticed some stuff in chat.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
I just want to add to this on the whole Overwatch talk real quick before we get into gaming news

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
because this was something I thought about myself.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
ActDeftInChat says, if Splatoon is still going...

50:59.000 --> 51:06.000
Actually, I think one of the things that makes Overwatch so likable is a lot of the same things

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
that are making Splatoon very likable right now.

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
There's a lot of commonality right there.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
I know we went back and forth a lot about Splatoon voice chat.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
I still kind of wish it was there if I wanted it.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
But to go back to that comment that came in earlier,

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
how do you know what to do if you can't communicate with your other teammates?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
You'd asked about with Overwatch.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Well, look at Splatoon as well. You can kind of get away with it.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
Splatoon also has great art direction.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
Very vibrant, very cinematic, very colorful in the way it's presented.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
I think Splatoon is a lot of fun for the same reasons.

51:45.000 --> 51:52.000
My point being, I think Overwatch has way more in common with Splatoon

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
than it does with Battlefield.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
That's my comment on all that.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for now, though.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
We're going to start off with Loki.

52:04.000 --> 52:11.000
Alright, so like they did the last few years, Sony is bringing E3 to you

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
if you happen to go to one of the 80 movie theaters that they are going to be broadcasting it to.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
You can watch the conference on Monday, June 13th.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
It'll be running from, I want to say, 6 to 830.

52:25.000 --> 52:31.000
And you can get tickets, I guess, right away, or try to get tickets.

52:31.000 --> 52:38.000
And yeah, with that, if you do attend, you will get a commemorative Coca-Cola cup,

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
a PlayStation card, and a digital gift basket.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
And they have a bunch of locations that are doing it. You can go to their website.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
But none here.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Yes, unfortunately none here.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
I just happened to notice there are none here. We'd have to go to the Bay Area.

52:52.000 --> 52:58.000
If you want to check it out, PlayStation.com slash E3 Experience, if you want to see if there's one nearby.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Yeah, nothing, unfortunately, unless I'm in the Bay Area or LA.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
If I'm in LA, then I'm going to just go to it.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
Yeah, right. I know our pals from Game Buoy, also here on the VOG Network.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
I know our pals from Game Buoy went to this last year, so I can't see why they won't be going this year.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
I didn't ask Captain Spike if they got tickets, but they'll probably go.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
They had a good time last year.

53:19.000 --> 53:25.000
If they had it here, I'd go, just because I think it would be a fun way to watch it with a bunch of other gamers.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
With all the cheers and stuff, it would be kind of like being there live,

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
which I'm very thankful I got to do at least one time in my life, was be at the event live.

53:33.000 --> 53:42.000
But, hey, at least this way I'm going to be watching it at home, so the good news is, pants optional.

53:42.000 --> 53:49.000
And that is also a great way to experience E3, just so we're all clear.

53:49.000 --> 53:56.000
Well, it is a packed theater. I mean, it's dark. Pants could be optional.

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
Alright, pants should always be optional, but only American meaning of pants.

54:06.000 --> 54:13.000
Let's move on with some more news about E3 and talk about Nintendo, which some of you also may be watching without pants.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
I don't know, but there's going to be a long time to watch.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
Here's the interesting thing about Nintendo, if you didn't already know.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
They're not going to do a Nintendo Direct this year, because they've pretty much already said,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
we're just showing Zelda at E3, that's it.

54:26.000 --> 54:33.000
However, what they're going to be doing instead is they're going to be doing two full days of Treehouse coverage.

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
So the Treehouse gang, they did this last year, they broadcast live from the E3 show floor.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
They're going to be doing it again this year.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
9 a.m. Pacific on June 14th is when they're going to be streaming.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
But here's the thing, what's kind of developed as this week has gone on.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Treehouse is not going to only show Zelda.

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
It seems like that's what they're certainly going to focus on in the beginning, because I think that's what a lot of people want to know about.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
But they have announced there is going to be some other things shown on the feed as well.

55:02.000 --> 55:09.000
They will have the first live gameplay of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon, which actually is going to kick off the streams.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
That's pretty cool.

55:10.000 --> 55:20.000
The second day, they're going to talk about Monster Hunter's Generation, Dragon Quest 7, Pokemon Go will be a part of that as well, Tokyo Mirage Sessions.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
So there's a lot to see on the feed.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
So I guess that's a bit of a relief to some people, is that there is going to be more than Zelda.

55:29.000 --> 55:35.000
Don't get me wrong, Zelda footage is great, and I'm still not understanding why they have a 90-minute demo for it.

55:35.000 --> 55:41.000
I guess that's cool. I don't think they need it because it's Zelda, but whatever.

55:41.000 --> 55:47.000
After a while, how many repeats of the Zelda footage could you watch?

55:47.000 --> 55:54.000
It would get kind of repetitive and not necessarily boring, but it's like, okay, I'm ready for something different.

55:54.000 --> 56:04.000
So yeah, they've got all the third parties, some third party stuff that show off as well, so I'm assuming that's what they'll cover because that's what they kind of did last year.

56:04.000 --> 56:13.000
I mean, last year, I think, how many directs did they have? Multiple directs, and even still, they had stuff that they were announcing on Treehouse because they couldn't fit it all in.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
And this year, it's like...

56:16.000 --> 56:23.000
Well, but it also goes to show that Treehouse may have some kind of bonus stuff in it, so maybe...

56:23.000 --> 56:31.000
I'm still very disappointed this year with them. I mean, I get it, it's all about Zelda, but you've got more than...

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
I literally just said it's not all about Zelda. There may be some more things that show up for Treehouse.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
I'm saying they're talking about E3, it's all about Zelda, but they've got more games coming. They've got that Paper Mario game that I'd like to know.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
I think that's more interesting because that's actually coming out this year.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
I think they'll show that on Treehouse. I think they will.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
And how long is it before we get to this? I mean, is this... Let's think about this.

56:53.000 --> 57:02.000
If this system is greatly more powerful than the Wii U, are we gonna really want it on the Wii U?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Or is this gonna be something we get down to the end and it's like,

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
Oh yeah, we just decided that it's just gonna be an NX game instead of a Wii U game?

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
No, because they promised it on Wii U, they will still say...

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
It's gonna be just like the GameCube Zelda. I'm using my quote-y fingers that ended up on Wii. Same thing.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
Well, granted, but the Wii was pretty much just as powerful as the GameCube, so that was basically the same thing.

57:23.000 --> 57:31.000
This potentially could be something different. Granted, I would hope that their system is more powerful than the Wii U.

57:31.000 --> 57:37.000
Alright, well Nintendo has an awful lot of space on the E3 show floor for the one game.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
I don't know if you've heard this rumor as well, is that the demo is supposedly 90 minutes.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
I guess there's two demos and combined it is 90 minutes worth of gameplay.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
That'll be very, very interesting. But Nintendo has reserved a lot of space for it.

57:51.000 --> 57:58.000
Which, when I say a lot of space, honestly, looking at the map, it looks to me like the same amount of space they reserve every year.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
I just, I don't... I get it. I mean, I'm all excited for a longer demo. I mean, that's what people want.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
But like, if you're thinking about, do you really need that long of a demo to sell this game?

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
I mean, I'm excited for the game right now. I don't think I need 90 minutes of the game.

58:14.000 --> 58:20.000
I mean, granted, yeah, I'll take 90 minutes of the game, but it's like, I'm just thinking like the five hour lines that they normally have.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
You know, shrink that demo down. I mean, come on.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
Well, the entire booth is nothing but Zelda kiosks, though. It's gonna be interesting. I don't know.

58:27.000 --> 58:39.000
Like, I'm curious to see how it plays out. But, you know, a 90 minute demo is kind of a throwback to the days of the PlayStation discs that came with the magazine that gave you a really robust demo of the game.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
So, I think it's exciting. I hope it doesn't cause...

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
That is pretty exciting. No, it doesn't even matter.

58:44.000 --> 58:50.000
Is fucking stream the goddamn demo. You have a fucking eShop. Download the fucking demo.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I was like, they're gonna stream it on Treehouse. What are you talking about?

58:52.000 --> 59:01.000
No. I understand. Yes, it could be running on dev hardware, whatever. But you could make a smaller demo that could be ready to play so that everybody tries it out.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I don't think they'll do it.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Of course not. That's effort.

59:05.000 --> 59:11.000
I think in this day and age of the fact that they could stream that 90 minute demo on Twitch, that's what they're gonna do.

59:11.000 --> 59:23.000
Well, they could have done that, too, back in the 2006, you know, E3. But instead, you know, hey, guess what? On Microsoft's, you know, the storefront, they had three demos you could download and try.

59:23.000 --> 59:30.000
Interesting point from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. How long is the Final Fantasy XV demo, the first one?

59:30.000 --> 59:42.000
Oh, that was a good probably two-hour demo, right? But that wasn't on the E3 show floor. But, you know, I think that's what Loki wants. Something that you can download and experience yourself, right? And that whole thing.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Exactly. I mean, that's more exciting than watching a stream of a 90-minute demo.

59:46.000 --> 59:56.000
Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'm still awfully curious to see what happens at E3. Moving on. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Not E3.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Well, really good news. And I think that the folks behind The Sims have always been really good about diversity and making sure that people are represented. You know, you've been able to have gay couples from the get-go. You could have alien and vampire babies in E3.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Well, now in Sims 4, they're removing the gender restrictions on clothes, hairstyles, and some of the other characterizations. Like, the custom gender settings they have now is that you can pick the gender, but you can also customize it a bit more.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Sections include physical frame, if it's masculine or feminine, clothing preference, if the Sim can get others knocked up or neither. And the last question, can the Sim use the toilet standing?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Interesting.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:17.000
They do make things that help women stand up and pee, just saying. Sure. You know. But, um, they, uh, I think it's a really, really good thing for them to do, especially with all this, you know, people getting their panties in a twist over, you know, genitals and bullshit.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So, I think that, um, it's a really good thing to see them actually taking that next step. And if it's supposed to be simulating life, quote, even video gamey life, then why not add in that customization, make it a bit more gray area, like, you know, things in real life are.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I'm all about choice. If I don't like it, I won't choose it. Ta-da! But I do love in Miitomo that I can wear a princess dress, because it makes for some fun pictures.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Or green lamé undies in a top hat, Rob.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I do what I want in Miitomo, and I think anybody should be able to do what they want. Now, I realize I have a more tongue-in-cheek style with it. And for other people, this is real life. But again, I portray my Miitomo in fun, zany ways. I realize some other people are gonna take the Sim stuff very seriously, and that's, that's cool. Like I said, I'm all about choice.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:29.000
If I don't want to do it, I won't choose it. Done! But Sims has always been about, you know, kinda, I guess, it's kinda funny, I can't help but get my head out of this story that was going around this week. Did you see this on Facebook?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That the Tesla guy, Elon Musk, right? Had this whole theory that we are simply people living in a greater, uh, uh, and I'm totally gonna mess this up.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Like avatars in a, like, intergalactic video game. Something like that, in an intergalactic video game simulation or something like that. And I was like, kinda like, how apropro with this Sims news is that, you know, for the, uh, greater civilization that's playing a game of The Sims right now with us, uh, you know, just interesting.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Anyway, uh, very cool though. I'm all about options and, and more stuff, and if you, uh, wanna wear whatever clothes you want. I mean, how many women do I know that wear guys' clothes, cause a lot of times they're com- I don't wanna say they're always comfier, but for some women they are.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And for me, shoot, sometimes I've seen like a button-up shirt or something that is a woman's shirt, but whatever.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000
You know what? Gendering clothes to me is as stupid as gendering pens.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Especially t-shirts, although I get some need the boobage. Some need to be cut a little differently for the boobage. That's, but I mean, usually it doesn't-

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Call them titty shirts then.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Well, to some extent I think that the girl cut shirts are meant to take into account the different torso length on average.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But for me, like for example, if I wanna buy a men's t-shirt and I want it to fit girly but accommodate my shoulders, cause I've got some big shoulders.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I'll buy a medium or a small, a men's medium or small. When I had pneumonia and lost all that weight, I could get away with wearing a boys' XL shirt.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I have a few boys' XL shirts in my closet still, that I can still wear. But yeah, it doesn't matter. I buy men's jeans, you know why? Pockets.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:39.000
You know why else? Better made. It's just women's clothes are meant to be, I'm just gonna stop cause I will get on a rant.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Is that products that are made for women are usually more expensive because they are put with some sort of, oh this is special for you.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Or disposable fashion, you know.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Made for a man but pH balanced for a woman.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Oh, fuck that shit. You know what? I like the smell of my husband's deodorant. I buy it for him because that's how I want him to smell.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Which is a wife's prerogative. And I will use that shit because it smells like sandalwood and freakin' oranges. And it smells amazing.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I gotta read some of these comments from chat and then we'll move on. Stoppy in chat at live.voguenetwork.com says, burn that bra, DarkSakura. You go girl.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Oh no, I can't burn my bra. I'm a double D. No, I take that back. I'm a triple D.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I need the support. She's keeping her bra. But she's burning the women's pants. Listen, she is a Diners Drivin' in Dives, okay?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Well now the entire internet knows my chest size. Thank you.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Alan Alchemy says, women's jeans are given fake pockets so they have to buy a purse.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And SSG100Matt says, my girlfriend hates girls jeans because of the pockets. She doesn't want to have a purse. She just wants men's pockets. There it is.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Alright, let's move on. We got other stuff to talk about than just clothes. Although, funny enough, clothes will come up later in the show, I promise.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
But it'll be a little different. For now, let's get back to some other games. Loki.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Alright, I know everybody's excited about this, but hey, that Allison Road game. The one that was supposed to be like kind of the continuation of P.T.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Because, you know, Silent Hills isn't gonna be a thing. Yeah, that got cancelled too. So, sorry.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Bastards. Well, but we don't know the reasons yet, right?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
We don't know. They just said sadly.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Well, you know where all the tinfoil hats are going? Is that they got a C&D from our pals at Konami. Again, this is alleged and rumor mill, we don't know.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:46.000
They say that there will be a statement soon, but because they're not saying right away, everybody's assuming worst case scenario, everybody's already got a hate boner for Konami.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And, let's be real, rightfully so, after the past couple years. So, this is instantly where everybody's going.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Hey, Melger Solid 3. It's got a pachinko slot machine.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Hey, don't be ruining the news that's coming up later.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Spoiler.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
But yes, they're basically from their official Twitter page.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Hi all. Sadly, Allison Road had to be cancelled. Statement to come in the next few days. Thanks for all your support. Very sad to see it had to come to this.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I was gonna say, wasn't this another Kickstarter project? And it was, but then the Kickstarter was stopped because they got the publishing deal.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Interesting.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So, I don't understand how it can be, you know, it's not really a continuation of it. I mean, it's just similar setting, I guess. I mean, I don't understand how they can get cease and desist from Konami.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm not sure how that works either, unless there was something, did they use-

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Unless they've patented or copyrighted the gameplay for the trailer.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Eh, no. You can't really patent gameplay, though.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Or the events that happen. I don't know.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Well, here's the thing. Did they use Konami's name or Silent Hill's name in their Kickstarter?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Or did they use their assets for the engine?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Yeah, because if any of those things came into play, that's gonna be what got them. But again, we are tinfoil-hatting with everybody else right now. We don't know that that's the case. There could be something else.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The publishing could have fell through. Somebody may have left or decided it wasn't working. We don't know. So, we're gonna find out hopefully in the next couple days.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
They're gonna probably bury it under all the E3 news that's about to be released upon the world.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Yeah, I'm just kind of skimming everything on this. I don't see anything mentioning Silent Hill or even P.T. for that matter.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, and DungeonBuster in chat says the screens looked very, very similar to P.T.'s aesthetics, but that's like saying P.T. has a patent on scary modern house interiors.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000
To me, isn't that saying that Silent Hill, in my opinion, isn't that saying that Silent Hill and Frigens are Resident Evil?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I mean, that's basically the same logic there. Yeah, I mean, there's just... I don't see anything like that. I mean, if it is a cease and desist from Konami, on what grounds, I'd be interested to see that.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh my god. If it does end up being that, can people hate them anymore right now? I don't think it's possible, but if that ends up being the case, we might find out.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Let's just hope it's not.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Alright, moving on. Some big news for this week. I think this is a pretty big deal anyway because I got some free games this week. Sorta.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Here's the deal. If you weren't aware, if you are using GOG.com, which, you know, is good old games, but I think now their branding is they're really just trying to be GOG.com.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And it's somewhat of a competitor to Steam, but they really started out and still deal with old video games. That really was their bread and butter for the first few years.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I've bought things on there like Sid Meier's Covert Action, which is one of my favorite games growing up.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
You can get things like Sid Meier's Colonization, the original, you know, things like that. You can get old school games on good old games.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Oh, I bought a game called Castles 2 that I used to play a lot on PC. But anyway, now they do a lot of the newer games too because it is the same company that made the Witcher 3.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So they sell newer games as well, so they've been growing a bit more to be more of a Steam competitor.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
They put out that front end, the GOG Galaxy. Is that what it's called? GOG Galaxy, I think it's called?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
It's like their storefront, their client, it was something they put out I think last year, a little bit of a response to Steam.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And now this is another pretty big step to try to get people to get that GOG account up and running and check out the GOG Galaxy front end.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Is that now you can link your Steam account with your GOG library and once you do so, you can import your Steam games into GOG at no extra charge.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000
But, there's a big but here, if you run this it's not going to just suddenly import all those 500 games you have on Steam that you collected in Humble Bundles.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It does have to be something that's approved by the publisher for this import.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000
So for that reason, this list is limited to what, about 20 or so games right now? I'm guesstimating here.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Some of the selections, VVVVVV, The Witcher Enhanced Edition, Galactic Civilizations 3, Braid, Saints Row 2, but not 3, Bit.Trip Runner, and so on and so on.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
So when GOG recognizes that these games are in your Steam library, they will now show up in your GOG library for no extra charge.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And some people might think, well what's the big deal? Well, A, to try to put everything into one warehouse because if you know that you have more games in your GOG launcher, what are you likely to fire up to play your games?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
GOG or Steam? There's that whole thing into it.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
The big, big thing for some people is the fact that GOG games are completely DRM-free.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And Steam does have their Steam DRM and we all know about the big button that if Steam ever goes out of business someday, their games will become DRM-free, but for now that's not the case.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So for some people that's a very big deal.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Also the GOG games sometimes come with little extras, like a PDF manual or a soundtrack, just kind of depending on the game.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That will show up in your GOG library on a game-by-game basis as well if it's found in your Steam library.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So not a ton of extra frills, but still kind of a nice feeling that, oh, if I buy it here, I'm also going to have it here.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It's a little bit like trying to homogenize the PC platform in a little bit of a way. It certainly makes GOG more competitive, if nothing else.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So, I don't know, Loki, do you ever use GOG? Do you think you could try this at all?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I have some free games on there. That's about it, though. I haven't really used it much.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
So I think I have GOG Galaxy installed, so I'll try it.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And actdeftinchat says, I'm supposed to be saying G-O-G. I don't know, I just... G-O-G, I don't know, I think GOG, whatever.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Maybe it's not correct, but it just rolls off the tongue in a different way. GOG.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Sounds like googly eyes, kind of like Bobby Blackwell would put on his Oculus Rift, or his HoloLens as the case may be.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So I don't know, I keep just saying GOG.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Must be hard to put those on the HoloLens, because you actually have to look through it.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I think he talked about it in tonight's show, that there is a safe place he can put them on there, but you'll have to download the show to hear it.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:28.000
So, anyway. That's true. Thank you. Tigerclaw has a very good point as well. Tigerclaw says, well we call this place VOG, so we should be able to say GOG.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
You know what, that's a damn obvious point that probably is coming into play more than anything else, to be honest.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Sorry, it's the V-O-G.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Alright, anyway. I will say I did run this process myself earlier on GOG, and I got like nine extra games in my GOG library out of it.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
So, you know, that's kind of cool. Something for nothing. I'm a fan.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Most of these games I got out of humble bundles and stuff anyway, so.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Alright, let's move on. DarkSakura, you've got old games to talk about too. You love to talk about old games on this show.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Yeah, and I need to tell everyone in chat not to spoil for me, but it was funny, last week's classic game was D.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And it looks like that I must be psycho and have the SPN, because D is now on GOG, which is the game that I was trying to run in emulated DOS, and it was not happy.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I paid six bucks for it, which is great, because I like paying less money for decent games.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:58.000
So, yeah. I mean, I think that it's good that it's out so now more people can experience the cracked out weirdness.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:09.000
But, yeah. Act deft. It was a joke. Psycho. And have ESPN.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Mean Girls reference. That's okay, not everybody's gonna get the Mean Girls reference.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I haven't even seen Mean Girls, but I know that.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
You can quote it without seeing it, it's fine.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I know, because of everybody. Actually, I have the movie now and someone needs to come over and watch it with me.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
So anyway, I already told y'all what it was about last week, so just go buy it.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I didn't realize that that's what Ken Gino died of, though. That he died of heart failure.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I thought he was gonna die of ESPN, but yeah.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Well, whatever.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Boo.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So apparently, though, he had another game idea that is now under crowdsourcing to cover.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
His colleagues are trying to develop this idea that he had into a game.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Um. So, called Kakexun. K-A-K-E-X-U-N. So, cool. If it's crazy, I'll play it.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I think that's really cool, though, that you had that classic game of the week last week and then all of a sudden it's back in the news.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It's almost like someone out there listens to this show, Dark Sakura. Someone out there with influence is listening.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And they got the license and everything all put together in a week.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Well, nobody else is using it.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Technically, like, three days.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
It was an easy one to get. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
It did, well, it's original release had an MS-DOS version, so what ifs.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
What ifs. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000
We may not be able to foresee the virtual releases all the time, but we definitely know what's gonna hit the store shelves at least.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And some of the virtual releases.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Well, one thing we know that's coming out this week is gonna be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, which is on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Also, we have Odin Sphere Left Fraser. I think that's how you pronounce that.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
That's on PlayStation 3. Basically all the PlayStation platforms. PS3, PS4, and Vita.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
SteamWorld Heist HD on PC, Mac, and Linux. PS4 and Vita.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000
The Solus Project on PC and Xbox One.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And then also Hearts of Iron 4 on PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And, let's see, later on this week, on Friday, we're gonna have Kirby Planet Robobot.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
That's on 3DS.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
It's a big deal for some people.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Yep. And then there's a new Sherlock Holmes game coming out, apparently, The Devil's Daughter.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Some people eat those games up.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Yes.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
That's why they keep making them.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And then, of course, Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. That's on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And Outlier Sophie, the Alchemist of the Mystery Book on Vita and PlayStation 4.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That's it.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there for this week.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
On June 9th, Project CARS Perfect Edition hits the PlayStation 4.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Mirror's Edge Catalyst also gets released in Japan on June 9th.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And Grand Ages Midi-Val comes out. Not medieval, but Midi-Val comes out on the PlayStation 4 this week as well.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And I think there's also a motocross video game, MXGP 2, comes out in Japan this week.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That is all on the PlayStation 4.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:42.000
On the Wii U, unfortunately, nothing really to report until we get closer to, like, the 23rd when Minecraft Wii U comes out in Japan.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.000
But there's nothing on the Vita this week either, which is kind of surprising, because the Vita is much different in Japan than it is here in the US.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
They still get a lot of releases over there.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But there is some stuff to look forward to on the 3DS.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
In fact, there are some new LL systems, their version of the XL.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000
They have a lime cross black and a pink cross white system coming out.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And on June 9th for the 3DS, Gaya Kuten Saiban 6.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That is the Ace Attorney series.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's a new game this week, so I'm pretty sure some folks who are into those law games and Objection and Phoenix Wright and all his characters are going to be excited about that release on the 3DS this week.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Alright, let's move over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Very little. On the 9th, Mirror's Edge Catalyst. On the 10th, Kirby Planet Robobot.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Done. There it is.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to go to Dark Sakura with this week's Classic Game of the Week and see what future digital release she'll be predicting this week. Loki.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I'm actually surprised by this number, but apparently Valve has sold 500,000 units of the Steam Controller.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Wow, that is pretty good.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
That is pretty good.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
That's worldwide, right?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yes.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.000
You have to remember, Steam is very, very, very, very, very big in other countries as well, more so even than console gaming.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So it's a little less surprising when you consider the worldwide element.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I don't know, I have never tried that controller, but it's different, so I don't like it.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Not really my appeal, or it doesn't appeal to me, but that's cool that they've sold so many.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I don't like things that are different, signed Loki.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I'm just kidding.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But I saw a sale on Steam, that was the big Steam sale this weekend, was buy a controller or a Steam Link.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And I have to admit, I was a little bit tempted, but I didn't do it.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I'm not using the Steam Link enough, sadly, to justify that.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I like the Xbox 360 controller. It works well.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I mean, I don't really think I need this controller.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I mean, yeah, I don't, so I'm not going to pick it up.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Maybe if they have one on a really cheap, cheap sale or something, like ten bucks or something.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
But no, I'm not going to pick it up for full price.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Alright, well congrats anyway on the sales milestone for Valve.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
It'll be interesting to see if they decide to do a second version, or they soup it up with something else later on, who knows.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I bet some of y'all went to the mall this weekend.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And the reason why is because of a partnership between Vans and Nintendo.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Now we had already talked about on a previous episode how this partnership was happening, but the release actually came out.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And it is more than just shoes.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.000
We thought in the beginning, because Vans is probably most famous for their shoes, and originally they were showing shoes, well guess what?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:55.000
There's a hell of a lot more that's out there, including backpacks, hats, socks, sandal-type shoes, shirts.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I mean there's a lot of stuff that's out there, so you can actually check a lot of that out on Vans' store.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
There's actually some cute stuff that I want, like this hat that has all the Donkey Kong stuff on it I think is really cool.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
You can just get a hat that says Game Over.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
You get a backpack that says Game Over.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:20.000
You can get a t-shirt that has the princess on it, and with a little logo around it that says your princess is another castle, something like that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
So you can check that out.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And Vans has this all online on their website, so you can check that out at the Vans website, but it's also available in stores.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
So some folks have been going to the stores to check some of this out.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
They are saying though that this is a limited time.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:45.000
We don't know what the limited time is, if it's a couple years, if it's through the holiday or what, but don't expect these things to be around forever.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
But that's actually very typical of licensing agreements.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
They're not usually indefinite. They usually have a type of limit on it.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So there you go.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And Bobby Blackwolf says, do those shoes cost $300, Rob?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Great question, but no, I believe they're more in the what, like $40 to $60 range.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Oh, there you go.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Actev says $60 to $80.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's still kind of pricey for shoes, but you know what?

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
You know what I say to that, Dark Sakura?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Let's get them.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
All right, let's travel back.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:24.000
You know, I remember when Nintendo clothes were something you had to order out of Nintendo Power when they had a catalog in the magazine.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You could just walk into the mall.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week where every week on the show,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Dark Sakura picks a game out of the archive that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this with E3 on the horizon to hell with Mirror's Edge and Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Just kidding. She didn't say that.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
To hell with all these new games. Play this classic.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I was like, hey, you remember this one?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Well, the game of the week is Pandemonium, which was also known as Magical Hoppers in Japan.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And I will tell you this, even-

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Also known as some reviews I've seen for this show.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Girl.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
So anyway, what's funny is that I actually played Magical Hoppers first.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000
If I remember right, I think Pandemonium was released in the US first and then Magical Hoppers came out in Japan and then Pandemonium got the UK release.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So they were actually kind of different versions of different things.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So it was pretty, pretty interesting that way.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So with this game, I mean, of course, the Japanese version is completely just reskinned and all of that.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.000
So I'm sorry, I'm getting messages in the chatroom while I'm trying to do my segment. Stop it.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Anyway, so Pandemonium stars two characters.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000
One of them is a jester named Fargus, and he has a staff named Sid.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And then there's the Nikki, who is a circus performer who then decides to become a wizard and she steals some book of magic and Pandemonium happens.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And it's one of those 2.5D games.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000
It actually plays not too differently in the way it scrolls and moves from Planoa.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It's just that little platforming in the round kind of thing.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And it's really you play through the game, you bop things on the head, you jump on things, you bounce on watermelons, you get gems and you beat the game.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:52.000
So versions of this game, there's the PlayStation, the PC and the Saturn version, and it had an N-Gage version.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000
The N-Gage version had 11 levels where the other ones had 18.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And the saves for this game actually use a password system. They don't use the memory card.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Now, the story for the Japanese one is actually a bit different.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So with this game for Pandemonium, it starts off already in like a magical land and everything in the Japanese one.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And it actually has a fully animated opening instead of the 3D CGI opening that the U.S. one had.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:37.000
But the animated one for Japan in Magical Hoppers is that these two normal people get summoned to another world and the girl becomes a bunny girl.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And the boy gets some weird outfit and a magical talking stick.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And they have to, I guess, get back to their own world. It's different.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And so my memory first of this game is Magical Hoppers, including seeing all of the freaking commercials for it on some of the early anime that I would just watch taped off of my friend's TV in Japan.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So Pandemonium did have a sequel. It came out in 1997 for PlayStation and PC called Pandemonium 2.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And the Japanese sequel was called Miracle Jumpers.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:29.000
But I forgot to mention that Pandemonium came out in 1996 and was developed by Toys for Bob, which is great because we just saw a Bob last night and it was published by...

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And I just retweeted the picture, by the way, of me because Alan posted it. So I was like, all right, even though I look hideously fat...

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I'm not posting the picture of me.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
You look fine, but...

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
No, I'm not doing it.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I was so drunk that clearly I just like, I didn't just suck in my gut. I stuck it out because I was like, hey girl, I'm drunk.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I had some Pandemonium of my own going on in the lower hemisphere, but whatever. It's done now.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Yeah. I broke my fan. That's all I said. Oh, I didn't realize this, but it also came out on iOS. Pandemonium did.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
But it was published by Crystal Dynamics. There you go.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Pandemonium, also known as Magical Hoppers.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:22.000
There it is, your classic game of the week. Pandemonium on the PlayStation 1, but as Dar Sakra mentioned, ports, lots of them.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000
We're going to take a quick break for now though, but don't go anywhere. There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I failed on asking a Fugu question of the week again. God, I'm so sorry you guys, but I kind of did show roll at a way different time than I used to.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Why don't we just like ask a random question now for the folks in chat?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000
We could do that or we could open it up to ask Orange Lounge. But then again, last time we did that, we didn't get a lot of questions.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
No, we didn't.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
So maybe we will ask a question of chat. We'll think about it and let you guys know when we come back with part B.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And we will do that. But we will also take your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And of course, we are going to do your emails as well that you've sent to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.000
When we come back, right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with our 644th episode for this June the 5th of 2016.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:35.000
By the way, I did put out in chat, just so you know, there is a chat question of the week since I failed on getting a FUGL question up.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
You should still follow us on Facebook and Google Plus just because we like friends.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio for you, you, Google faithful.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
But we do have a chat question up. If you want to see it though, you need to be in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And please read that carefully because I want you to private message those answers to me.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
So while we are collecting those, we're going to get some rapid fire news.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I turn around. We have a little workstation. My workstation during the show is in the corner.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So I'm not always able to look directly at Dark Soccer and Loki because I'm sometimes fixated on chat.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000
But it's funny because I turn around from my corner and I see both Loki and Dark Soccer playing on their phones.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I'm not playing on my phone. I'm trying to get my text message forwarding set up.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I am playing on my phone.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
It just looked like you were playing on your phone. It's just a funny thing to turn around and look.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Well, if you could put the phones down for a minute and we're going to do some rapid fire news.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Loki, starting us off.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Sure. If this will accommodate my catching the Raticate here.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I don't think you're supposed to be talking about that.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Whatever. No one's going to send a police after me or anything.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I don't give a shit.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about what was coming to Xbox Live Marketplace for the month of June.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Now let's talk about PlayStation Plus.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
We're getting NBA 2K16, which I really don't give a shit about because sports.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And then Gone Home, which is alright.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So those are going to be your free games on PlayStation 4.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
PlayStation 3 is getting Echo Chrome and Siren the Blood Curse, episodes 1 through 12.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
That's kind of cool.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And Vita, God of War Chains of Olympus, and Little Deviants.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And yeah. So pick those up starting May 7th.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Or I'm sorry, June 7th.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.000
The May games are actually, tomorrow is going to be the last day to download the May stuff.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So make sure you mark it.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I'm running late.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I'll still put NBA 2K16 in my library because it's a free game.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And why not.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:45.000
So Minecraft, it seems like each week they're catching up more and more with the Pocket Edition.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And Windows 10 version and all that.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Now this week they're going to be getting a brand new update.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Including pistons as well as, looks like, some other features.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Mainly the Redstone piston stuff was up there.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
1.5 they called the friendly update.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And it includes like, let's see, pig riding, horse armor.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And yeah, the pistons are the main kind of draw there.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Gamers love their horse armor.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
But yeah, it's kind of cool.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And I'm looking forward to checking that out on Windows 10 and the Android version as well.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Especially now that I have that VR version, so yeah.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Gotta check that out.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And then last but not least, Chrono Trigger.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Wants, you know, the director of the game, Takashi Takeda.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
He wants the game remade.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
You know what, I say if they're going to remake it, can we remake it like in the style of the actual drawn artwork?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Because that'd be pretty badass.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Could they remake it in five episodic statements like they're doing Final Fantasy VII remade?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Well if Square is going to...

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
The style of the artwork.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It was all Toriyama.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
But now it could actually be all hand drawn.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
It would have to be pixel art.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Well that's true, but I see what you mean.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000
But I mean, the pixels are still based off of the artwork too.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I would kind of rather see them do a sequel type of thing.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I mean yes, I know about Chrono Cross, but I kind of don't.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I don't know, I don't see that game as a sequel. I know not everybody agrees with me.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
But I'd like to see them do something like more of a direct successor to Chrono Trigger.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But let me just hold my breath.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Except the whole thing is that Cross was the direct successor?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Yes, I know.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Because it had the characters returning for the...

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But the gameplay was awful.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
That's just my opinion.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Well this day and age I guess it's going to be called Chrono Triggered.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
So it will be a whole different storyline along with that.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Moving right along.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Let's get into, hey Pokemon!

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
More information on Pokemon Sun and Moon.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So not only do we have the Treehouse event coming up,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
but we also had some Pokemon announcements this week.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000
They did like another sort of direct thing, more like a Q&A type of thing this week.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And they actually showed some more information,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
including some more information about the legendaries that are on the box art for Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
For example, Solgalo is the Pokemon from Pokemon Sun.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And I'm sorry if I mispronounced these things.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
It is a Psychic or Steel type.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Not a Fire type.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Even though it is Pokemon Sun.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
But okay, whatever.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And then Lunala is from Pokemon Moon.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And Lunala is a Psychic Ghost type.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
There you go.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Also, more information about some of the gameplay mechanics itself,

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
including the fact that it will be on the Aloa region,

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
which is four tropical islands and an artificial island.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
So a lot of people comparing it to Hawaii.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Usually the locations in the Pokemon games are inspired by something in the real world.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
The professor, the topless professor in the game,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
which is getting a lot of fan art.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I don't know if you've seen that,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
but there's a lot of stuff on Twitter and Tumblr about Professor Kukui

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
is the Pokemon professor.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And there's also a girl who assists the professor named Lily.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
There's also Hau, which is a boy with a big appetite

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
who is the same age as the player's character.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And then also the Pokedex is a little different now.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
The Pokedex is a Pokemon, and it's Rotom.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
It's a Rotom Pokedex, and it will do much more than simply record Pokemon.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
There is a personality.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
It will now show your current location and the next destination on the map,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
on the second screen.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So that'll be kind of nice for those that lose their place in the Pokemon games.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Also, one other quick thing.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
There's going to be a QR scanner,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000
and it will allow you to see information about Pokemon when you scan QR code patterns.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And you can register Pokemon of the Aloa region in their Pokedex

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
and figure out where they live by scanning in QR codes.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
This sounds sort of like something they did in Yo-kai Watch,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
although in Yo-kai Watch, when you scan a QR code, you got a little in-game bonus.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
But I'm wondering if instead these QR codes that you scan in

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
are going to sort of help you find maybe some harder-to-find Pokemon in the game.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I'll be very curious about that.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
We were talking a little earlier in the show about Splatoon.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Even though they said there was going to be no more major updates to Splatoon,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
there still is updates happening.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
In fact, one is scheduled to happen on June 8th,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
including nine new weapons in the weapons shop.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Also, two new kinds of gear will be added also in the shop.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
There are some adjustments to main weapons, sub-weapons, and abilities.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
There's also going to be some stage adjustments.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
For example, you will no longer be able to take some shortcuts in the Arowana Mall.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000
You also will not be able to take shortcuts in the Piranha Pit.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
So they're just kind of tweaking some maps and so forth.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So there you go.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And then they also say, of course,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
several enhancements to improve the user's experience and enjoyment.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
The ever-so-vague reference there.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:26.000
And lastly, from Nintendo, could there be more Mario Kart 8 DLC on the way?

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
This would be the type of thing that would be perfect to announce during Treehouse.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It's kind of a bit of a surprise.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Well, Nintendo of Europe actually tweeted out saying,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Good things come to those who wait. Hashtag MK8.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
A lot of people are reading this to say,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
could this mean that there's going to be more DLC for Mario Kart 8?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Finally, Mortal Kombat 8's going to be coming to the Wii U.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000
But there's a screenshot with it that is from a different Mario Kart game.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So is it maybe a virtual console thing?

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Who knows?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
But I don't think anybody would be too upset if they would put out some more maps,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
maybe a few more characters.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Why not? Another reason to go visit Mario Kart 8 after all this time.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Why the heck not? I'm for it.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Dark Sakura!

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Well, for folks in Tokyo, Sega is having a 25th anniversary Sonic celebration.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
It's happening on June 25th, and you could possibly get into it.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
It will also be streaming through different channels,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
and will have some different developers there.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And yeah, you can play the new Sonic Boom, but no one cares.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And this is not replacing the event that's happening in San Diego on July 22nd here in the US.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And what Joyopolis is, is basically like an arcade theme park type place.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Next up, in more Sega news,

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap has been teased for a possible smartphone release.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:19.000
It looks like it got teased by Dotemu, and also got another tag on there for Lizard Cube.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And it looks very strongly hinted. I think it's going to be on some mobile device.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
But it could also possibly be on the 3DS or Wii U.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And that was the game that was the sequel to the first Wonder Boy game.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I think in the US we got it as Monster Boy, or one of them.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And also, and this is great, great, wonderful news,

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.000
is that Capcom has bound Noel Brown from the 2016 Pro Tour events,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
and Evo supports them 100%.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
If someone doesn't know what this complete waste of humanity did,

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I'm sorry, I should be reporting the news. What this person allegedly did.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:25.000
He basically was going around harassing both verbally and physically female attendees,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
and he was caught on camera doing it.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I was going to say, was it? I mean, I know you're supposed to say allegedly,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
but when it's right there on a live stream, it's...

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
So basically, he's a dumb shit and an asshole shit.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:47.000
So I have no respect for any human being that does not respect the consent of another person.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
So it's disgusting. He's disgusting.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
So as a first defense, he is banned from the entire tour for this year,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
and if it happens again, he will be banned for life.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And since this is the first time they've had to make a judgment like that,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
they're holding this for everybody.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
First offense, you're banned for the year. Second offense, you're banned forever.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So I like this statement.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
We do not condone any acts of harassment, and we want all of our players and fans to know

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
we will continue to work to ensure that all Capcom Pro Tour events

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:33.000
provide safe, inviting environments where the focus is on healthy competition and exciting rivalries.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
So, yeah. Gone.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Bye.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Yep. Oh, and one last thing is that EVO said that they'd completely stand behind Capcom's decision,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
and he won't be allowed to attend EVO 2016.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
So, he's not even gonna get lit in the building.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Well, let us move on to a much more pleasant topic,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
and that is one where we get to interact with our listeners in a segment

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
we would usually do as the Fugu Question of the Week,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
but because of my failure, it is the Chatters Question of the Week.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:26.000
You know what, though? Hey, even though it's my failure and Facebook and Google lost out,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
the chatters won, so, hey, things work out sometimes.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Anyway, we wanted to know of our chatters this week.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
We asked, what is your favorite E3 memory?

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Which, by the way, would have been the question I asked on Fugu if I hadn't remembered.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
So, what is your favorite E3 memory?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000
And this could be a game that was announced, maybe a demo that you played during those years

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
where you could kind of beam the demos down or maybe you went to a Best Buy or something.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Maybe you got to go to the show and you have a memory being at the show itself.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So, let's see what our chatters thought.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Bobby Blackwolf starting us off with a message that says,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
My first in 1997.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Well, you know what they say, you never forget your first.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I know my first E3 was a trip.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It was such a trip, and I'm sure my co-hosts feel very similar.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.000
So, yeah, the first E3 is always kind of a big one.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Moving on to some other answers here from our chat room.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Back in E3 2014, I was watching the initial reveal of Zelda Wii U.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Enuma was talking about how the new game was going to work,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
but then when he said,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And here's your first look at the world of the new Legend of Zelda,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and he snapped his fingers,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I screamed so loud it scared the other dogs in my mom's bedroom.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Good times.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Yes, I think we've all had that gasp moment.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Stopy says,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
My favorite has to be The Last Guardian and Shenmue 3 announced.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I went into E3 last year so cocksure of myself

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
that we wouldn't hear a peep about either.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Then I tell you what, Alice bangs Zoom straight to the moon.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Yeah, nothing can come close to Sony 2015.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Yeah, that was a pretty big deal.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Act Def says,

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
My favorite E3 memory.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I can't recall a special one,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
but one of the most recent ones

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
is probably when Mirror's Edge Catalyst was first announced.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I got really excited for there being a sequel

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
to one of my most favorite games of the last generations.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Vidpower says,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Memorable E3 moment.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Free Xboxes for everyone in the audience at E3 2010.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Lucky you.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Did you get one of those, Vidpower?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Lucky you.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Because I guess I was happy for the people in the audience.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yeah, I was looking at the redesign.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
But also a little bitter.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
That's all right.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Anyway,

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Reginator says,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
My favorite E3 memory was watching coverage of it on G4.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Sigh, sniff.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And participating in E3 events via PlayStation Home.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Oh yeah, that was kind of a neat little thing they did.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Too bad they pulled the plug on that.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
SSG100Matt says,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
When Sony dropped the mic during their PlayStation 4 conference

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
by saying they would allow used games

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and not require an always online connection.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
That conference sent shockwaves around the industry

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000
and actually caused Microsoft to reverse their Xbox One policies

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
a few days later.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
That was pretty awesome.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I'm surprised we didn't get more answers so far that said that.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Because that really...

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
That was just like, damn.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
That was a moment for the ages.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
That was just...

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
That was a public beating is what that was.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And hey, the kind of moment that fanboys live for.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Orange Wright says,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I don't think anything can match

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.000
watching Konami's 2010 press conference for the first time.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Watching that best worst conference without knowing what to expect

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
left me bewildered the entire time.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Sony 2015's one-two punch of Last Guardian and Shenmue 3 is a close second.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Kind of makes you wonder.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Sony's raised their bar pretty stinkin' high.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Kind of wonder what they're going to show this year.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I mean, after what they've done the past couple years,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
they're going to have to...

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I don't know.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
They're going to have to give free money to people or something.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
We'll see.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Dungeon Buster says,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Best memory of E3?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Probably going to the first one and running into Howard Lincoln.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Like, almost literally running into him and the ring of cameras around him.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Thanks for the answers in chat, you guys.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Those are some really good answers.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
How about you guys here in studio?

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Your best E3 memory?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And that could be one you went to or one you...

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I know we've all been to at least one.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
But that could be one you went to or one you didn't go to.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I'll do mine because I kind of already told this story a couple weeks ago on the show,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
so I'll keep it short.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
But I think Will Wright actually doing the demo with Spore

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
was a very surreal moment for me as a gamer and a developer I really respect.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So, yeah, that's my personal favorite memory.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Dark Sakura?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Probably all the times I bumped into Kojima every year.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
It just happened and he recognized me the third year.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I don't even know how it happened.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
It was just like this fake magnet.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And then in the magical sound vibrating floor at the Xbox announcement.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
It was really uncomfortable to sit on that diagonal floor.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I do remember that very first year getting to meet Akira Yamaoka.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And that was very, you know, we all love him because of Silent Hill

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
and the stuff he did for DDR and 2DX.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
So getting to meet him was a huge highlight, too.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And I got my photo with Igarashi.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
That was cool.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Loki, how about you?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I don't know.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I mean, I guess the PlayStation 4 thing was pretty awesome.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Even though I look back at it now, it wasn't as awesome as I think I originally thought it was.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Asking Jason Enos at the time about In the Groove was pretty funny.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Too bad we didn't get the recording of it.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Yeah, it was kind of my bad, but...

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Whatever, it's fine.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
His response was very politically correct, for the record.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Yeah. He's a cool guy.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I don't know. That's about it.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Yeah, I can't really think of anything too huge.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Some folks in chat are lighting up...

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
These are some great responses in chat.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
S2100Matt says,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
What about the ferret being put on the Katamari?

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
How about hashtag space ponchos?

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Reijinator says,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Remember Sony's presser from E3 2006?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
$599 US dollars.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
$599 US dollars.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Reij Racer!

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Attack the enemy crab. Historically accurate.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Stoppy says,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
They can only top themselves one way.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
PlayStation 4 now plays everything PlayStation.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
PS1, 2, 3, and 4.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I kind of don't think that'll happen.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And Vita. Why not do Vita?

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I kind of don't think that'll happen, Stoppy,

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
but if it does, I'll do a YouTube reaction video of myself crying.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
How's that?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
That'd be awesome.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
At least PlayStation 1. I mean, come on, man.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Like, the PSP plays PlayStation 1 games.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
That console is more powerful than the PSP.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Yeah.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
No YouTube if it's just PS1.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I'll maybe shed a single tear if it's PS1,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
but it has to be all of that.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Because I have a lot of PlayStation 1 games,

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
or even PlayStation 2 games,

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
like, I had purchased, like, you know,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Katamari and also Twisted Metal Black,

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and I saw that Twisted Metal Black's on sale again

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
for the PlayStation 4 for $5.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I'm like, eh, it's only $5. I'm like, fuck that.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
No, I already bought it once. I am not paying for this again.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Granted, it was only a dollar that I paid for it originally.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I still won't pay them for it again.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Not necessarily directly related to the show itself,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
but I just, I have to throw this out there as a favorite memory,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
and it's kind of a throwback to our old home and our old network,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
but, and I think it was the last year all three of us all got to go,

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
and that was the Paris Hilton year E3, right?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
2006, the year of the Wii.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
That was when we did the All Games thing in Santa Monica.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Remember, we were at the hotel, like, right down the street from that?

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
That wasn't the last year I was able to go.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Was it?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Oh, you went one of the years I didn't go.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
You went after the Santa Monica years one more time,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
because you went as a distributor.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Yeah, I went 2009.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
But I think it was the last year all three of us went.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Yeah, maybe.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
And they were, I feel like they were broadcasting the entire time

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
from that arena lounge, and they had their own little mini event

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
going on there, and it was just a lot of fun,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
because we were with other indie podcasters,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
kind of like our little niche audience, and that was a lot of fun,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and I do remember the whole time thinking,

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
boy, somebody spent a lot of money on this,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000
but thank you, thank you.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
That was probably some of the most fun I've ever had at E3,

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
like, outside the show itself, so it was a great, great experience, so.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
All right, any other moments to share before we move on

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
with the rest of our show?

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Okay, then let's get into some more news.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Loki.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.000
All right, this is pretty awesome, as I kind of alluded to before.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
The console mods that were promised, you know, last,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:05.000
was it last year during E3, for Fallout 4, finally are coming out.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
So May, the end of May, they launched for Xbox One,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
and were very popular.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
In fact, they've received 50 times more traffic

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
than when it launched on the PC.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
And it's pretty awesome, you can actually go to,

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
they have a special website that you go to for these,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
and then you can basically tag which ones you want,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
and then you go to your game, and there they are.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
So there's quite a few mods that are available now,

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
and I think it's going to be launching for PlayStation 4

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
at the end of this month, so.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Very much looking forward to that, that is pretty awesome,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
and something that they've been trying to do for,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.000
they said for 15 years now, so.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I can't wait to see, especially with this,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
and then, let's assume that they're doing a new,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
like, Elder Scrolls game, that would be pretty awesome as well.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
All right, well, as spoiled by Loki earlier on the show,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
but no, I know you guys, you guys read blogs and Twitter,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
so I'm sure you guys have already seen,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
there is a new Metal Gear Solid 3 that was announced by Konami,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
but it is a pachinko machine.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Oh my god, all those things we said, please don't, please stop.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Konami, don't, like the slow motion stone.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
No.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Here it is.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yep, Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is now a pachinko machine.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
It will feature-

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Oh, I need her.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
It will-

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:37.000
It's not just snakes anymore.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Rob literally cannot right now.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Next story.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Kidding.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I don't know why that's so funny, because it's so stupid.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Yeah, I guess it would be Ball Eater, yeah.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Ball Eater.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I expect nothing less from Loki on this program anymore.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Coin Eater.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yeah, they should just play that song, you know.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Characters from Snake Eater, including the pain, the end, the fear, and the fury,

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
which are emotions you're all feeling after hearing this announcement, I'm sure.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
So there you go.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
You can also check out the trailer if you want,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000
but you're probably just going to be really upset.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater pachinko comes out in the fall in Japan.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Oh, I'm totally looking forward to not ever playing that, because it's in Japan.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
And not even round one's going to import it.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
At least not the one here.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I didn't see any pachinko machines at the round one I went to in San Jose.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
I don't know if the one in SoCal, like if they bring in that kind of stuff.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I didn't see any of that up here.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
But you know what?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000
If I'm going to do something Konami, it's going to be those music games

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
that were actually pretty cool that I did get to play in San Jose.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
So as much as we love to have a hate circle jerk for Konami,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000
and we all do on the internet right now, and with damn good reason,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
at least there's some cool stuff.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I never thought I'd be saying this in 2016,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
but at least there's some cool stuff happening in the Bomani world.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
At least there's that, if nothing else.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
All right.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Well, it's not exactly video game related, except it's Pokémon.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
So that's why I did it.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But there was, it's nice to hear stories about good cops, you know.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
So this kid, nine year old kid named Bryce,

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
he was walking along with his Pokémon collection,

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
and some kid just stole it out from under him and ran off with it.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
What a dick.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
What a dick.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Who would steal a kid's binder full of Pokémon cards

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
that he's been collecting since he was six?

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I'm really sorry about it, and it's a really big misunderstanding.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
No.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
So anyway, they called the police,

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
and the police did actually catch the kid,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000
and gave Bryce back his binder, but it was missing some cards out of it.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000
So what this guy did is he donated his Pokémon card collection

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
from when he was a kid.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And a lot of Japanese cards actually,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
including like this Mew card that there's like one of ten of in the world.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
And so, hey, I guess there are some good cops out there, right?

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
So that's it.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
All right.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Yay.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Pokémon.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Saving the day.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
He won't care in five years.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Yeah, you never know.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
The story might make him care a little more.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
The story might make him care.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andraday with vognetwork.com,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
use the passphrase, surprise.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
All right.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Okumojp in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Pokey cops.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And Kaijudo says in chat,

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Did the police catch them all?

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Yes, they caught him all.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
All right.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
And his prison sentence evolved into six more years.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
All right, moving on.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Loki.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000
So, Vin Vindy has finished its hostile takeover of Gameloft.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.000
And according with that, they sent a letter to all of the employees,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
basically telling them,

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Hey, you work for us now.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
So that's kind of interesting.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.000
And, of course, none of the higher-ups want them to take over the company.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
And it's just, I guess that's why it's a hostile takeover.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Along with that, though, of course, it's suggested, I guess, that the CEO is considering resigning as well.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Basically, I guess it was saying that, yeah, the CEO, Michael Gilmont, is likely to resign.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000
The family will likely consolidate its efforts on protecting Ubisoft from Vindy now.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
So, yeah, that kind of sucks.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
But, oh well, we're going to have to see what happens with Ubisoft now.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Very interesting.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Do you think E3 will get any type of, I mean, I guess it's not really the place for it.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
It's not really the place, yeah, for it.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And it's kind of hard because there's not a lot that they can do.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
What they're doing is it's not like they're, you know, they're buying the shares from third parties.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
So people that already have shares in the company, they're basically buying them from them.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
And so that's how they kind of get around it.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.000
But, yeah, it's kind of hard when your company is being told, you know, being run by somebody else.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And, yes, Vindy did such a bang-up job with Activision.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
So, eh, we'll see.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
All right.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Well, this is a very interesting throwback, one that seems a little archaic to me.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000
But they're talking about that could the password, remember when video games had passwords?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Like the Guardian legend, right?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
TGL, Kid Icarus, right?

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Icarus fights Medusa angels, wasn't that it?

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Terror, danger, horror.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Yeah, Metroid, Justin Bailey, right?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
We all know these codes.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
So password, but usually the passwords were not so easy.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Like it was just like...

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Narpus sword.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Is that a zero or an O?

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Or you filled out a grid, you had to have draft paper if you were playing Mega Man.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:29.000
So could passwords be making a comeback in Dragon Quest XI?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I kind of think we the internet are reading too much into this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Yuji Ohori actually said that passwords could make a return in the next installment of Dragon Quest.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
He said he's looking forward to bringing back the spell of restoration in Dragon Quest XI.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
That's the password system that was found in previous games.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:54.000
The password system will allow you to resume your game and obviously we have regular saving now.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Now, I hear something like that and I kind of go,

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I don't know about that because people aren't going to want to write down passwords.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
But, here's what people do nowadays.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.000
What if the game gave you, this is what it would do, it would give you a QR code.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And you could take a picture of the QR code and then you could take that anywhere.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Although I guess now that I think about it...

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Fuck them!

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
The game can't really scan QR codes.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
There's a reason why we don't use the password system anymore.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
It's because we have fucking saves.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And also because there's more data to save as well that with a password system you can't really do that.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:31.000
So, why? Why are you making it so fucking annoying to save my game?

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Just save my fucking game.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000
My thought is maybe, and Dartisious says I agree with Rob, that's what they're probably going to do.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I don't think the passwords are being used the way we're jumping to conclusions here.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Yeah, it's probably going to be, woohoo, you unlocked costumes, woohoo, it's items.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Yeah, you put in a password, you get a free item, you get a bonus, a costume, a monster, you know, something.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
That's probably what it's going to be.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I think if you're thinking you've got to get out the notebook to write down your complicated passwords, I really don't think that's going to happen.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Yeah, just save. Why are you doing this?

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:11.000
So, there you go. Bobby Blackwolf says, why can't we just pay 99 cents to get them unlocked?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Why do you need a password for it? Well, maybe you'll have to pay to get the password.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Maybe only subscribers to Square Enix's newsletter will get the password.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Well, they're only getting that payment once because once they have the password, it's going up on the fucking internet.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Alright, we'll see what comes of it. I don't know, that story, I'm like, is that a translation error?

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
But I don't know, everybody's running with it anyway, so we'll see, but I kind of think people are reading too much into it.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Let's get to something we love to read too much into, our emails.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Sorry, I love these comments in chat.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Ragenator says, the password is Ermagerd.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Ermagerd.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Just a reminder, if you haven't noticed from listening to this show before, somewhere in the show, there is a password.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:18.000
We use passwords at VoG, because there's actually a game going on, and you can actually put in a password, and you get points.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And what do you do at points? You collect them, like they're Pokemon. Why? Because that's the game.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
It makes you feel better about yourself.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That's right.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
In some intangible way.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
So listen for the password in the show, unless you're listening live.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
If you're listening live, you just go to live.vognore.com, you just check right in, you get the exact same reward.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Sorry, you can't double dip. You can't listen live, and, well you can, but you won't get anything extra.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Besides a pat on the ass and a job well done.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Alright, anyway, let's get to, speaking of a pat on the ass and a job well done.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Our one email.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Let's get to our emails for this week. One email.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Hello from the Lone Star State. Hold on. Hello from the Lone Star State.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
That's Texas, right?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Hello from the Lone Star State.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
That's Texas, right?

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I've been a new silent listener for about two months.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Answer my goddamn question. It's Texas, right?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
No shit.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Alright, well then I have to say this. You have to prove that you're from Texas. You ready?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:18.000
The stars at night shine big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000
And if you didn't finish that, then I don't believe this email. Alright, go ahead.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I've been a listener for about two months, and it actually says, I've been.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Alright.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
No, no. I'm just saying, because that's how we talk in this album.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
I guess I do believe you. Alright, move on.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I've been a new silent listener for about two months, and the show you have is just great.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Oh, please use punctuation though. I really would appreciate it.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I listen to this show normally the day after, and it's just great to listen to during work to get my mind out of work.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I've been dying to listen live, but I just seem to remember after Game of Thrones is over.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Goddamn that show.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Chair of Swords. And man, I beat myself up afterwards.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:07.000
But anywho, my point is, it's an awesome show, and good job to you all.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I'm sorry, it's really difficult to read without punctuation, sorry.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
You know what, give the guy a break. He probably typed it on his cell phone.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I almost, you know what, mine actually puts in punctuation.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I remember punctuation, usually.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I remember the Alamo.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I almost feel like I'm in the studio, haha.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
This comes from Spokesman101.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
PS, look into text alerts.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
I never thought of that.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Okay, here's the thing with text alerts. I don't use any of them, because I kind of find them to be annoying.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I hate them.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Okay, but if people are going to request them...

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
We've had one request.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Alright, is that a thing people want? How much does that cost to do?

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I don't know, but I think they're annoying as fuck.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
But if somebody wants them, I'll annoy you if you want.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
You know what, I'll text you.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I like the part where he stops moving.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000
I'm going to just text you at 2 in the morning.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
You have a text from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And then you'll get a text at like 4, 12 in the morning.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Don't put me in charge of this shit.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000
The stars at night, right?

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Now, here's the thing. Here's what I would do.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
And I think this would be a great idea.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000
And I'm volunteering Bobby, because I don't know anything about this stuff.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
But someday, we've talked about this for a while.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Lessons in telephony.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Having a VoG app.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000
And the VoG app could do the push notification that would bother you if you enable it.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Because, you know, you can turn that on or off.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
And then VoG would remind you,

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Yo, fuck Game of Thrones tonight.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Bobby and OLR are on.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
And everybody going to die. That's what happens on Game of Thrones every week.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Don't bother with the chair of swords. We're more comfortable.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
That's what happens on Game of Thrones every week.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Everybody going to die.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000
And something about doors. I don't know.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Or we could push a message earlier in the day saying,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Hey, just a courtesy announcement.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Game of Thrones is on all the piracy websites.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
So go watch it now so you're available for OLR tonight.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
That's something else we could do.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Hold the door for a moment. We got an announcement.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
DVR.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:28.000
You can stay off of Facebook for however long it takes for you to get caught up on chair of swords.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
And then bam, you got us.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Bobby is pointing out, create a text alert in your Twitter app for the VoG network account.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
It tweets whenever a show goes live.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Well, there you go. I guess that's true. I forgot.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I forgot we have that nice little convenient thing built in there.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Thank you for the lovely letter.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Yes.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I totally heard it in my head in my accent, which doesn't really come out that often unless it has an E2.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
But it would greatly, greatly look into actually using punctuation.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
No, I'm going to say I'm going to explain something.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I have a very difficult time reading something that does not have punctuation.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
To show me where a sentence ends, because it will just sound stupid when I read it out loud.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Because I just can't not read it the way it's written, you know.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:25.000
So put in a mark where the end of your sentences are and I won't be confused.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Before everything went online, I used to grade papers, so I'm used to it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Yeah, but people should know how to, you know.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
But we're very, very thankful for the email, especially for the new listener.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Thank you.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Don't ruin the moment.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I'm not trying to ruin it. It just really does make it difficult to read aloud. That's all.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
All right.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Let's, well, thank you. If you want to send an email, participate at orangeloundtrader.com is the place to send that.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
And while you're using the at and the dot, don't forget to use them elsewhere.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Right, Darsyra?

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Yes.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
I made a point. I made a point.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
You didn't let me answer.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Oh.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Yes, God.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000
All right, let's move on. What an appropriate time to get into the FUs of the week.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:42.000
FU to not being paid for doing nothing and for me for not writing my book.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I'm going to write my book. It'll be written. You'll see.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:55.000
I'm going to comb that thing with a fine tooth comb for all your punctuation.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Girl.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Do you want to know how many times any of those papers I wrote in high school and college had punctuation errors?

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
The only time were when I'm not the one that wrote them.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Like when other people are doing typing for me.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Write your book already. You've been talking about for 10 years.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I know you just get a hold of it before it's published.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I don't want to kill the poor girl.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Act up. You shut your form out.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I love this. No, we have to read. You don't just response.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Respond to people in chat without reading it. Act up.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Says Dark Soccer's book will be done with Loki's.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Loki's game is done. I love it.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
She's got time then.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
No, seriously.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Are you done?

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
No.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
FU to people who say that I can't get my book done.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I will write it out of spite.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It'll be called a tale of spite.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
We're just motivating you.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Well, I'm not motivated by spite. So there you go.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And also FU to having to still not have any caffeine.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Because now in another half a week I have to give up my coffee altogether. No decaf.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And my throat still hurts. It still hurts to talk.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I have a voice. But it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000
So I have to make it to the end of the month.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
All the saints in heaven help me.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
If they exist. They're dead anyway.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
But may their memory help me.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I will remember.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
And I will persevere.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Are you alright? Are you finished?

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I'm having a moment. Okay, I'm done.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
I'm also reading about funeral homes.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Loki.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Yeah, I guess I have FU to myself for not working on my game.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
A lot of... I... I don't know.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I keep having the excuse that I'm tired.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
And it is the case because I'm literally falling asleep as I'm at my computer.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000
And the last few nights it's been like, okay, I can play Final Fantasy XI.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Or I can work on my game.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
And I'm just tired. Like, I'm tired as it is.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I really want to try.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.000
And I start trying to work on just research and stuff that I want to do for that.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And then I'm just fucking tired. I'm like, fuck it.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I'm just going to play Final Fantasy XI because it requires no brainpower whatsoever.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
And so I do.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And that's been the problem with...

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Not necessarily Final Fantasy XI, but just like...

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Okay, I can work on my game. I'm going to go on YouTube and research some stuff I want to find out about voxel engines.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Because that's my main thing is I've been trying to...

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I've been stuck trying to find a way to optimize my voxel engine.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Because they have solutions that people have voxel engines all throughout Unity and stuff that people have made.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
But it doesn't...

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
It's not optimized enough for what I want to do.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
And so I'm trying to figure out how...

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Now I'm probably going to research how Minecraft does it.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.000
I think it has to do with how they load their chunks and everything.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
And that's kind of...

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
And really this is all just for the editor. It has nothing to do with the actual game.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Because the game is just going to be all...

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
It's all pre-done. It's just...

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
You know, I need...

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
The editor for everything needs to have voxels.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
So whatever.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
So FU to myself for that.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
And also FU for the weather being so damn hot.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Thankfully now I have air conditioning.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
My FU of the Week also goes to just the hot weather.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
My god, it just makes me want to do nothing but be indoors all day long.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Although that's not such a bad thing.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.000
But I do have to be outdoorsy once in a while.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Once in a while.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I mean, where else am I going to find Pokémon?

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
So there you go.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Allegedly.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Alright.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
That's it for the FUs of the Week.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Let's move on.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Yippee!

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
1877 GameOLR.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000
But our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
All one word.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Loki.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Yes.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
So, to be honest, I don't know how this is going to be possible.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:54.000
But apparently there is a Star Wars Battlefront 3 fan game that's coming to Steam.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.000
And not only is it coming to Steam, not like through Greenlight or anything, it's being

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
published by Valve.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
This story is a lie.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Valve doesn't do anything involving the number 3.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Come on.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Exactly.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I think that's right.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
They said, you know what?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:15.000
People have been fucking saying, you know, publish something with the number 3 in it.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Done.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:23.280
I just, I fail to see and they keep, I mean, they're saying that, you know, Valve is definitely,

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:26.640
they're confident that there's not going to be like a cease and desist on this.

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:27.640
But how?

02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:32.780
I just don't see how that's going to happen.

02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:34.160
I don't know how they're going to do that.

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.400
Is it completely a mod?

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:37.400
It's a fan game.

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:42.400
So it's, I guess, I don't know if it's based off of what they had like previously done,

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:48.880
because I know there was kind of a leaked, you know, Battlefront 3 that was done in Unity

02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.880
that was partially, I mean, partially completed.

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:58.040
I don't know if that's going to be what they're doing now, but I don't know.

02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:01.440
I don't know how it's going to be accomplished, especially with, granted they're not calling

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:07.560
it Star Wars, but it is Star Wars and it has all the Star Wars things in it.

02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.400
So, I mean, I just don't know how that's.

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.320
When you say it has the Star Wars things in it though.

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:19.880
Like the Star Wars, like the AT, the AT-ATs and the characters, like the droids, they're,

02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:20.960
they're just there.

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.200
They're like, it's, it's, it's definitely that.

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:29.200
I mean, it's not like, I don't even know how it's going to be possible.

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.200
That's the thing.

02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:35.680
I don't know how they're going to manage to pull this off, but I guess they're confident

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.320
it's going to be something that they can't fight.

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.520
And then their, their defense is like, well, so far no one's, you know, done a cease and

02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:43.520
desist for anything.

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:44.760
Because they're waiting for you to make money off it.

02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.160
But they're not making any money.

02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:47.160
It's going to be free.

02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.080
So it is something that is putting out for free.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:52.280
It's from Frontwire called Galaxy in Turmoil.

02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:55.520
Bobby's figured it all out in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:58.820
Bobby Blackwolf says it's Frog Fractions 2.

02:13:58.820 --> 02:13:59.820
That's it.

02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:00.820
That's what happened.

02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:01.820
So laugh.

02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:08.100
It would be so awesome if that was it.

02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:11.060
That's that is my, that's my favorite E3 announcement by the way.

02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:12.540
It would be the biggest troll ever.

02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:13.540
What?

02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:14.620
It's Half Life 3.

02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:17.580
Or it's just Frog Fractions 3.

02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:22.100
There never was a Frog Fractions 2 or the Frog Fractions 2 was the buildup for Frog

02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:23.260
Fractions 3.

02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:27.140
But I was going to say my favorite E3 announcement is when they finally told us where the fuck

02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:29.560
we can play Frog Fractions 2.

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:34.200
It's just, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm hoping for this year, Frog Fractions 2.

02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:39.280
I'm hoping for Gabe to actually come out on stage and say, I'm sorry, I'm not here to

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:45.240
talk about Half Life, but I got Frog Fractions 2 y'all, deuces!

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:47.920
And then drop some mic.

02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:56.480
He just, he can't get anywhere near a stage because people are like panting, heavy breathing,

02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.480
breathing intensifies.

02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:00.480
You know, it's just like nothing.

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.280
Our expectations are way too high.

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:04.980
Gabe is not allowed to touch a stage cause it's just going to be a disappointment no

02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:05.980
matter what.

02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:10.480
No matter what, it's going to be a disappointment because he didn't do it unless he's backed

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.480
by a full choir.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:12.480
Oh my God.

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.280
Can you imagine just like, just the ridiculousness.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.000
So I mean, since this is a, you know, our dream scenario here and everything, they give

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.160
back like the, the full like Gaben meme thing, you know, where it's fucking, you know, just

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:28.840
like, you know, the whole background and everything and just, you know, then eventually the mics

02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.320
drop in from the ceiling and the choir, it's all of that.

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:33.320
Everything.

02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:34.320
It'll be the greatest show on earth.

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:35.320
It will be.

02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:36.880
Have a circus while we're at it.

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:37.880
Why not?

02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:38.880
All right.

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:45.520
Akuma JP wants to point out, it is 2016, June 6th here.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:50.560
If you cut it in half, you get three, therefore it's time to announce Half Life 3.

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:55.960
You know, it sounds to me, Akuma, that you're doing fractions.

02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:59.160
And if you divide by three, you get frog fractions too.

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:09.960
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, hey, someday, someday now, you know what, I know we made

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:15.840
a decision to not do E3 this year, but now I'm a little disappointed after something

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:19.600
I heard about what's going to be shown at E3 this year.

02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:24.720
And that is, there's actually going to be a company showing some games at E3 this year.

02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:30.000
Naughty America will be attending the E3 Expo in LA, and they are going to be demoing and

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.480
showcasing the latest in adult VR content.

02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:35.480
That's right.

02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.680
Naughty America has been on the forefront of technological advancements from HD to 4K

02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:46.440
and now VR adoption as the first major adult studio to produce VR content.

02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:51.560
By the way, reps will be on hand to discuss the expanding role that immersive, mortal

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:56.040
content, mortal, Mortal Kombat.

02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:59.040
That's not the game I want to play in this experience.

02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:03.840
Reps will be there to discuss the expanding role that immersive mobile content plays in

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:09.440
adult entertainment, how gamers utilize VR headsets for adult content and explain the

02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:10.840
technological horizon.

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:15.360
It's going to be like that scene in the freaking lawnmower, man.

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:19.800
But this goes to show that VR will survive.

02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:20.800
Of course.

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.240
I've already, I mean, you've already tried it out.

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:25.320
I mean, so this is like an actual thing.

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.120
And I mean, what was it?

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:29.520
They've been doing this already, like a lot of different sites.

02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:32.960
How nice of Naughty America to claim that they're the first, which is not fucking true

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:33.960
at all.

02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:34.960
But whatever.

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.960
I mean, who gives a shit?

02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:39.400
I mean, there's a lot of different content providers now, and I guess they're the most

02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:41.960
name brand worthy of it.

02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:44.720
But yeah, it's pretty much everywhere.

02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:50.280
I'm mobile since it's basically just a video with head tracking.

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:56.600
Now this article that I'm looking at on this website, VG247.com, which I do like this website

02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:59.640
by the way, I'm going to be a little critical here in a minute, but I do really enjoy this

02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:05.560
website, just to be clear, actually asks, does VR porn have a place at E3, a show that

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:08.760
is primarily about the video game and interactive entertainment business?

02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:10.160
Oh, these kids today.

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:13.160
Oh, these kids doing their reporting today.

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:16.800
They seem to have forgotten about Kensha Hall back in the day.

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:20.600
And I think some things that actually, I don't, the one that comes to mind, do you guys remember

02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:23.040
Feel 3, I think was the name of the game.

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.480
It wasn't even in Kensha Hall, if I remember right.

02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:26.480
Yeah.

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.480
Yeah.

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:33.200
It was like, it was like, it was like the second life thing that was all adult.

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:34.680
That shit was at E3.

02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:37.400
So does VR porn have a place at E3?

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.400
Yes.

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.880
It's not out of character for E3.

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.000
It's not Game Expo, it's interactive entertainment.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000
That's right.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.600
And porn is very entertaining.

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:53.320
RageNator in chat in response to my word mix up there says, kind of gives new meaning to

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.280
finish him.

02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.440
I will be leaving the chat room for the night.

02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:01.480
Goodbye.

02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:02.480
Just kidding.

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:09.360
I will be opening up the Skype line, however, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, orangeloungeradio,

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:10.360
all one word.

02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.520
Give us a call on Skype to talk about anything we've talked about so far on the show tonight

02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:16.200
or porn, if you want, I guess.

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:20.520
Hey, if you got a modern heads, if you got a modern phone in Google Cardboard, you might

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:21.520
as well give it a try.

02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:24.040
They have VR trailers you can check out.

02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.040
There you go.

02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:27.160
So you can get an idea.

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.840
For what it is, it's pretty impressive.

02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:33.000
Experience it first hand or with both hands, whatever you're into.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.280
Hey, but we're getting a call.

02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:35.280
Let's get to it.

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.280
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.280
Who's this?

02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:38.280
Uh, hi.

02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:39.280
It's YYR.

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.720
I feel like I just saw you.

02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:43.720
I'm sorry, what?

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:45.600
I said, I feel like I just saw you.

02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:46.600
Oh, yeah.

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.600
You know what?

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.440
I can't even believe that it was only a week ago.

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:52.560
It like doesn't make sense to me at all.

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.560
You know what?

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:58.200
I can't believe this bullshit that Skype is trying to show me an ad right now.

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:03.020
God, I thought you were going to say you couldn't believe it's not butter.

02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:04.320
Well thank you, Bing.

02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:05.600
I know, right?

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:07.520
Anyway, how do I ad block on Skype?

02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:08.560
Alright, anyway.

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:10.560
What's in your mind tonight, my friend?

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:15.200
Well you know, really, one reason I called was just to say I just want to thank you guys

02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:19.480
again for allowing me the opportunity to be on the lovely program.

02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:23.680
I want to thank you and curse you simultaneously for introducing me to donut muffins.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:28.880
Although I guess your wife plays a role in that, so you can shift that to her if you

02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:29.880
want.

02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:32.880
Oh, they're wonderful, but you know this.

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:40.840
But yeah, if anyone wants to taste this wonder and greatness, it's Devil's Teeth Baking

02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:44.760
Company in the outer sunset neighborhood of San Francisco.

02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:48.600
Hey, they didn't pay for that ad.

02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:52.760
But yeah, and I've been hard at work on multitasking, plane flights are wonderful.

02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:57.120
I actually just added a tournament mode to the game yesterday.

02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:03.480
It basically gives any number of players you designate the same sequence, so everybody

02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:08.000
can play the same thing and see who's best.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:14.040
And supposedly, they're going to be running a midnight tournament of this game as long

02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:15.040
as they can get it to work.

02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:17.920
I'm sending them a build, I'm not going to be there.

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:23.000
If anyone is going to be at the Anime Next convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey next

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.640
weekend, I have some friends of mine, longtime friends, who are helping to run the game room

02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:33.840
there, and well, they asked me if they could run a midnight tournament on it, so hopefully

02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:35.600
that will be there Saturday night.

02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:38.720
The cast of Anime Jam Sessions got to be represented there.

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.400
I can't imagine they're not there at that con.

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:43.680
Fantastic.

02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:48.240
And there was one other thing I wanted to thank you for, Rob.

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.360
Well here's the thing.

02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:54.520
I was thinking about it for days before I appeared on the show last week.

02:21:54.520 --> 02:22:00.720
I have been playing a lot of video games over the last 30 plus years.

02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:05.440
Lots of different genres, they can't be compared to each other, and I just wanted to thank

02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:10.560
you for not asking me that question that you often ask of guests in the studio.

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.880
What's your favorite video game ever made?

02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:16.840
Yeah, that one.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:33.480
Well now that you bring it up, I didn't ask him because usually I do that.

02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:38.400
I ask that question for people that are new to the show, but I didn't really consider

02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.360
YYR new to the show.

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:48.680
So just amongst all his appearance of appearances over the years, I've just never gotten around

02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:50.440
asking YYR that question.

02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:53.480
Or I just assume it's DDR, BeatMania, I don't know.

02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:54.480
So anyway, there you go.

02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:56.240
He hung up and dodged the question.

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:59.800
Wow, I didn't get to figure out what else he was going to say.

02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:00.800
Alright, whatever.

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:06.920
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:10.760
Any last minute stories to report on LOKI or Darksharkar if anybody has a last minute

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:11.760
story?

02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:12.760
No.

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:19.480
I was going to say the Tamps Offs Senran Kagura and Oni Chambara are now on Steam.

02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:20.480
Oh really?

02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:26.480
So you can pick up Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos and Senran Kagura Shinobi Versus.

02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:30.600
I'm going to have to check those out.

02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:31.600
I'm going to get right on that.

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.040
Just think of all the nudie mods those are going to get.

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:34.040
Will they import into GOG?

02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.040
Lots of nudie mods.

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:36.040
I guess not.

02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:37.160
Alright.

02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:38.160
Let's move on.

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:39.160
Take another call.

02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:40.160
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:41.160
Who's this?

02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:42.160
Hey.

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:43.160
This is Ragingator.

02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:44.160
Hey Ragingator.

02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.160
What's on your mind?

02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:46.160
Two quick questions.

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:52.100
Well, the first one is well, a little long winded but I'll try to keep it short and

02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:53.100
free if possible.

02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.880
Hey Ragingator, do you need any help finding mortgage rates?

02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.240
Your local mortgage rates?

02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:59.000
Oh god, no.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.720
Because Skype seems to think we do.

02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:01.840
I'm just saying.

02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:03.000
What the fuck is this?

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Fuck these ads.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Alright, anyway.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Go ahead.

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:17.360
Now, you guys were mentioning that the whole GOG Connect earlier in the show, in fact,

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.280
Kazen was telling me about that a couple days ago.

02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:28.800
Now Mike, my question for you regarding that is do you know if there's like a set schedule

02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:38.360
or like set rate where they'll be introducing new gains for GOG Connect like let's say

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:44.120
for a second conversation, let's say it's going to be two gains per week or something

02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:45.120
like that?

02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:49.480
Eh, I don't know if they'll do it on a weekly basis but maybe a monthly basis but realistically

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:53.680
it's as fast as they can get the agreement signed with publishers and if you want that

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:58.280
to happen more often, I think you really have to kind of, you know, and I don't know how

02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:02.760
I feel about this whole like social buzz or whatever but the reality is that's the

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.920
day and age we live in, I think if there's a lot of very positive buzz around this feature

02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:09.600
out there, more people will want to get in on that.

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.440
Oh, that's the thing that people like.

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:14.800
Oh, the internet will say good things about us if we get in on that.

02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.320
It's going to encourage more publishers to put their older games in on this.

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.920
So that's really what it comes down to, Rage Nator.

02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:25.360
It's as fast as they can sign the agreements but I think people need to be prepared for

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:30.640
the fact that, you know, this feature might be around for fifty games or so and then it

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.240
mysteriously disappears.

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:37.520
Not saying those games are going to disappear from your library but then suddenly people

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.120
get really quiet about it.

02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:42.280
You have to be prepared for that end game too.

02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:44.800
Yeah, well I hope that's not the case.

02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:48.640
Hopefully I'll stick around for a while and they continue to support it but you never

02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:49.640
know.

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:52.840
Well, I mean, on the bright side, for what it's worth, I guess not really the bright

02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:59.720
side but for what it's worth, it would be no different than what we had last week.

02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.440
If it were to go away.

02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.880
We'd just be back to where we were last week, right?

02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:04.880
Yeah, true.

02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:12.520
Well, now, moving forward, a few more second questions so you can take in more calls.

02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:13.520
Yep.

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:22.440
Now, with E3 being next week, is there anything that you're possibly looking forward to or

02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:29.400
hoping that would occur, at least, not so much in terms of console space but in terms

02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.720
of possible announcements with PC gaming?

02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:42.200
Now, we're not talking about, you know, the very unlikely, like, FY3 being out so, I mean,

02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:43.200
come on.

02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:47.160
It's just not going to happen but anything that would be realistic.

02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:51.720
Well, RageNator, you couldn't have asked this question in a better year because I have the

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:56.200
easiest answer I've ever been able to give for this question and the answer is everything

02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:00.800
regarding Civilization VI because we know that's a thing that's happening and I fully

02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.440
expect that we're going to get the details at E3 and I'm all over that.

02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:07.600
I'm very, very...and that's not something we're going to see on console, at least I

02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:11.600
don't think it would be something...I can't see how they would make it on consoles.

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.560
I guess anything is possible but I'm not expecting that.

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:18.040
I'm expecting that to be a very PC-centric thing.

02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:22.280
So yeah, Civilization VI, that's my easy answer but truth.

02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:23.280
Oh, cool.

02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:24.280
Yeah, yeah.

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:30.560
In fact, honestly, I really haven't played a whole lot of the older games especially

02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:38.480
as of late now because I've got a lot of games to play but, you know, at least C4 and C5

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.480
are pretty fun.

02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:45.400
Yeah, they're a little bit of a complicated side but still fun nonetheless so...

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:51.080
Alright, well, I'll let you go so you can take more calls but thanks for taking my call.

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:52.080
You got it, buddy.

02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.080
Have a good one.

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:54.080
Thanks for calling.

02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.080
See you next time.

02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:56.080
Alright, bye-bye.

02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:57.080
Bye.

02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:00.760
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word but we have another call already

02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:02.240
coming in so let's get to it.

02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:03.240
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:04.240
Who's this?

02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.240
Hey, what's up?

02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:06.240
This is Kajudo.

02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:07.240
Hey, what's on your mind, Kajudo?

02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:08.240
Nothing much.

02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:13.280
I just want to ask you, can you honestly say that you think Overwatch has legs?

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:14.560
I mean, think about it.

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:17.200
It doesn't have any private servers, right?

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:18.200
Right.

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:22.680
Also, you can mod the game because Blizzard won't allow you to mod it.

02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:27.560
It's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One but we all know that if your first person shooter

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:32.480
is in Call of Duty, it's gonna die on those systems because that's what happens to every

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:36.240
first person shooter that ends up on those systems and it doesn't have cross-platform

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:40.480
play so I think people are gonna get tired of this game really fast.

02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:45.200
I mean, they're gonna probably have to pop up these new characters and new maps on a

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:47.880
week-by-week basis if they want to keep this thing going.

02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:53.440
90% of everything you just said also applies to Diablo 3, which is still going strong on

02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:54.440
PC.

02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.040
No, actually not really because Diablo 3 has a single player.

02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:01.040
One thing I forgot to mention is this is all online.

02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:06.560
They have that tutorial or whatever in Overwatch or whatever it is and you can play bots but

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:08.280
that's still not considered single player to me.

02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:10.760
I mean, Diablo you can play pretty much by yourself.

02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:12.760
Have you ever been to Blizzcon?

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.560
No, I don't go to any of those things.

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:22.160
And see, I kind of think you're underestimating in some ways the power of Blizzard.

02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:23.240
And I'm serious.

02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:26.980
If you look at some of these people that are playing Overwatch now, it's a lot of the same

02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:34.040
people that support World of Warcraft and Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone.

02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:36.040
Why can't I even think of the name of that game at the moment?

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:42.760
Anyway, these games have a very, very, very loyal audience and I defer to the fact that

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:47.920
those tickets sell out within seconds and that wow being the fact that in my opinion

02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:51.280
Jamie would disagree but in my opinion World of Warcraft is not the best MMO on the block

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:58.720
anymore yet it is still the most popular and by far Blizzard still has legions and legions

02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:03.320
of fans behind it that are going to play a game like Overwatch simply because it's Blizzard

02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.180
and Blizzard does what?

02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:09.300
They make games extremely accessible.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:12.540
This is their first person shooter.

02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:14.260
You're talking about an MMO.

02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:17.540
You're talking about whatever the heck Diablo is.

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:20.180
I don't even know what you can consider that game.

02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:26.860
This is a totally different ball game for them and I mean when you think about PC players

02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:31.380
I mean the main reason why Team Fortress 2 is still around and Counter-Strike, the reason

02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:35.220
why those games are still around is because people have their own servers, they put their

02:30:35.220 --> 02:30:38.780
mods on there and that's what keeps those types of games running.

02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:42.460
I can't picture a first person shooter running that long without those things especially

02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.460
on the PC.

02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:47.420
I mean they could probably get away with it on like a PS4 or Xbox One because they don't

02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:50.940
do that anyway but no way they can get away with that on a PC.

02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:51.940
Blizzard.

02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:52.940
There's just no way.

02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:58.740
Blizzard also has two other games which is Hearthstone a card game and Heroes of the Storm

02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:04.700
which is a MOBA game and that is literally all of Blizzard's titles.

02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:06.620
So far they're batting at 100.

02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:09.220
But those are still different from a first person shooter.

02:31:09.220 --> 02:31:11.180
First person shooter is a totally different ball game.

02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:16.080
I understand that but now Blizzard's throwing their wiener into the first person shooter

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:17.700
game and I think it's...

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:19.860
And their wiener is going to get chopped off by December.

02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:21.860
I'm going to ask you one more question.

02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:22.860
Have you played Overwatch?

02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:25.140
Yes, I played the beta and I hated it.

02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:27.240
What did you hate about it?

02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:30.240
I hated the fact that there wasn't many maps.

02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.240
There wasn't much you can do.

02:31:31.240 --> 02:31:34.280
There weren't that many game modes.

02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:37.680
Also another thing that I hated was I love to play like the stealth class and I know

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:40.960
they had that ninja guy but he seemed like a waste to me.

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:44.880
I mean he basically did pretty much everything that all the other characters did.

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:47.160
His weapon, his ninja stars pretty much sucked.

02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:48.400
I mean you couldn't do much with them.

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:52.360
I mean the only character that I had fun with was the other girl that can like create ice

02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:53.360
walls.

02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:54.360
I was having fun with that.

02:31:54.360 --> 02:32:03.040
I mean I lost interest really quickly and I have a couple of friends who also played

02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:06.760
it and they lost interest and they were like well I might pick it up on the PC just because

02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:08.760
it's 40 bucks on the PC.

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:12.440
But they were like no I'm not getting this on the PS4 because they know the community

02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:16.480
is going to pretty much die out on the PS4 even though it says again it there.

02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:19.960
So if you really want to play it your best bet is the PC and I don't know how long it's

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:20.960
going to last there.

02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:23.360
I'm going to leave you with two more thoughts.

02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:25.760
One at least you played it and I'll give you credit for that.

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.320
I mean even though yes it was a beta I'll admit not a lot changed from beta to release

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:33.360
so I'll give you at least credit that you at least tried it when you're making these

02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:34.360
statements.

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:37.440
And you know sometimes things are not going to be for everybody and that's just the way

02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:38.600
it's going to be.

02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:43.160
But B one thing I think that Overwatch will have going for it and we'll see in a year

02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:46.800
you know I mean who knows maybe it won't be still a thing in a year.

02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:51.980
But I think one thing that Blizzard is going to show from their track record is that will

02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:57.060
there be an expansion at some point to Overwatch probably but that'll be a good three to four

02:32:57.060 --> 02:33:02.220
years down the line and in the meantime the game is going to be supported.

02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:05.380
And again I'm just going off track record I've got nothing else but you know what's

02:33:05.380 --> 02:33:09.860
happened with Diablo what's happened with Warcraft and all their other games is that

02:33:09.860 --> 02:33:14.260
Blizzard is is pretty darn good about doing regular patches and content updates.

02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:18.220
That is not something that happens in a lot of the console first person shooters today

02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:21.660
because things like the call of duties and the battlefronts they get a refresh every

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:25.700
year even destiny had an expansion that you had to buy after a year.

02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:28.900
I don't see that happening with Overwatch.

02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:33.420
I could end up being wrong they might do an expansion in a year but again if track record

02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:38.820
is anything go off of I think Blizzard is going to support the base game a lot.

02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:43.220
They're going to take that more Nintendo approach Mario Kart 8 style where they're still supporting

02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:46.620
it three years down the line but we'll see.

02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:53.740
One other thing I just want to point out about Overwatch is you were mentioning about them

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:57.660
keeping up with updates and all that type of stuff they're going to have to ease up

02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:00.260
with their with their ban hammer.

02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:03.100
So far they've been ban hammering people for the right reasons I mean they have people

02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:08.580
cheating you don't want to cheat online you know like I never condone that but Blizzard

02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:12.640
is really known for just like I don't know we're banning somebody who did they weren't

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.140
cheating or they might have did something that I don't know appeared to be cheating

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:21.420
and they're really quick to ban somebody so if they want this game to stay alive chill

02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:25.340
out with the ban hammer and make sure that you know someone's cheating before you ban

02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:26.340
them.

02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:27.340
Yeah.

02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:31.020
All right well thank you for your input I appreciate it.

02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:34.420
Have a good day Judo.

02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:35.980
See ya.

02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:40.300
Okay so there you go the show where every gamer has a voice you know what I know some

02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:46.900
of you guys in chat or you know but not every game is for everybody and some people aren't

02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:50.340
going to necessarily like a particular game I know there's been very popular video games

02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:55.100
that I don't always necessarily like in fact I wasn't sure I was going to like Overwatch

02:34:55.100 --> 02:34:59.380
you guys might remember and I've been critical of some elements of Overwatch that there's

02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:04.820
no single player mode in this other stuff and I'm still I'm still kinda wishing it was

02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:10.700
there but so far in my experiences with Overwatch I've had a lot of fun and I suppose at the

02:35:10.700 --> 02:35:14.880
end of the day that is what it's all about but I get it is a valid concern will I still

02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.660
be having fun in December but I'm just really hoping with Blizzard's track record I do so

02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:26.340
anyway 1-877-GAMO-LR username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word if you want to give

02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:27.580
us a call.

02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:31.780
Tigerclaw in chat says you know Blizzard fans are pretty hardcore and the Warcraft movie

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.100
comes out in five days if the fans don't end up liking that movie you know Blizzard

02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:41.620
is going to face a lot of heat because Blizzard was involved in the making of that movie.

02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:46.340
Yeah I bet the gals from Girls Gone Wow I saw them posting on Facebook that they were

02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:50.220
going to go see it so I'm almost positive if they taped a new show today which they

02:35:50.220 --> 02:35:53.440
probably did I'm pretty sure we'll hear about that because remember in the UK the movie's

02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:58.220
already out so I'm sure we'll hear about that come Wednesday when their show airs here on

02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:03.180
the voice of geeks network but bummer because the time difference but I would love to pick

02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:06.660
their brain a little bit about this whole Overwatch thing I'm curious if they have jumped

02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:12.380
in and tried it at length or what have you because that would be a great example of you

02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:16.340
know players that don't necessarily play a lot of other games are they coming over to

02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:19.220
this simply because Blizzard's name is on it.

02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:25.100
Alright one last call for calls 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype orange lounge radio

02:36:25.100 --> 02:36:30.520
all one word checking in one more time for last minute stories if you have any no running

02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:37.660
out alright just a quick teaser for next week while we give it just a few more seconds here

02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:42.500
to see if any other calls come in I do want to mention again next week's show for you

02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:47.700
podcast folk it'll be a little bit shorter that's because live we're going to be experiencing

02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:54.500
the Blizzard the Bethesda press conference live essentially so we'll be taking an extended

02:36:54.500 --> 02:37:00.260
break next week while we all listen in on the Bethesda press conference and then we'll

02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:04.420
come back and give our immediate reactions to what's going on and so forth we'll also

02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:10.780
be talking about EA and we're going to have plenty of other predictions as well and then

02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:17.660
after E3 is all said and done the weekend after what we have June 18th and 19th so what

02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:22.600
the 19th I think is that show we're going to be joined in studio here by Misty long

02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:29.000
time OLR fan going to be here on June 19th that's her second or third trip on the show

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:35.520
so she'll be here on that day joining us for some E3 reactions and follow-ups and then

02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.200
we're going to go I mean this is a big month because we roll right from June 19th into

02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:48.280
the next show June 26th with it which is a double event it is my birthday my actual birthday

02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:56.760

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:09.440
dark soccer I don't it blows my mind it really does I can't believe it so anyhow all right it

02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.640

02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:46.720
until I moved to California I can't wait yeah we're gonna see I I think if we can get to 15

02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:51.240
years which I don't see why we wouldn't at this point but you know you never know but if we can

02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:58.540
get to 15 years I think it's just high time we just put the money in rent a space so rent a

02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:04.680
ballroom at a motel somewhere around here and just say if you want to be there live just be here we

02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:10.040
move our show for the night to a live space and just invite any fucking person that wants to cut

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:14.640
well within reason we don't want like you know trolls showing up but you know maybe they have

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:19.480
to maybe have to answer a few simple questions about OLR to get through the door but we'll invite

02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.160
