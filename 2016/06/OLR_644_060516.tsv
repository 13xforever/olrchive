27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	48000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, June the 5th of 2016, with episode number 644 of our show, broadcasting live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.
48000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, by my side as she is every week for the past 644 weeks.
58000	60000	Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
60000	61000	Hi.
61000	62000	Hi, how are you?
62000	64000	I'm okay. I look awful in this picture though.
64000	67000	Yeah, I don't like the way I look in my picture either.
67000	70000	So DarkSakura and I went clubbing Friday night, just so you guys know.
70000	75000	We went out to a bar because you know DarkSakura and I love drag queens.
75000	78000	And I'm not trying to push a drag queen agenda on this show, but it's going to happen sometimes.
78000	83000	And you really should always walk into a club purse first, if you're not already doing so.
83000	89000	But anyway, so we went to see one of the big drag queen stars, Bob the Drag Queen, who was here on Friday.
89000	95000	And we paid to get our picture taken with Bob, and of course we're looking at the pictures going, God we look awful.
95000	99000	I think Jamie looks fine, and she says I look fine, but of course, you know how that is.
99000	102000	You see pictures of yourself, and you're like, oh God.
102000	105000	Yeah, DarkSakura and I are having that moment right now.
105000	109000	But you look good, DarkSakura, and your face was beat for the gods.
109000	110000	Yes, ma.
110000	113000	Well, if it took an hour to wash off, one would hope so.
113000	116000	But oh my God, at least my makeup got me a free drink.
116000	117000	Did it really?
117000	122000	Because that guy, there was this guy, I was walking around with my fan, I broke my shade fan.
122000	125000	Fanning everyone, letting everyone fan themselves.
125000	129000	And this one guy's like, oh, I can do one better, and he holds this ice cube over my head.
129000	130000	Oh, God.
130000	132000	Dripped water onto my mug.
132000	134000	And I'm like, ah!
134000	136000	And his girlfriend's like, no, stop!
136000	138000	Or whoever was with him.
138000	139000	A, try not to scream into the mic, please.
139000	142000	And B, the things that drunk people do.
142000	144000	He was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.
144000	149000	And I'm sitting here with my foundation going pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.
149000	151000	And he's like, oh my God, can I make it up?
151000	152000	Let me buy you a drink.
152000	156000	It reminds me of the nastiest drink ever, but I don't care because it was free vodka.
156000	161000	It was like well vodka and crap ginger ale, but whatever.
161000	163000	It was free.
163000	164000	Yeah, but we had a good time.
164000	165000	That's what's important.
165000	166000	We did.
166000	168000	Except, uh, Dar Sacher and I got, well, I did.
168000	178000	I got very, very, very, very toasty drunk, which I haven't done since I was like, well, now that Alan drives, I have a designated driver when I go out.
178000	180000	Oh, Alan just commented.
180000	182000	Oh, did he? Yeah, there it is.
182000	184000	And doppy, I will tell you this.
184000	190000	I don't care if people think I'm a drag queen because just wait until gamer X.
190000	193000	Drag cosplay.
193000	195000	You heard it here first.
195000	196000	It's happening.
196000	197000	All right.
197000	199000	I'm sure we all look forward to it.
199000	202000	Meanwhile, we got to also say hello over there to somebody.
202000	207000	Unfortunately, who doesn't join us on our Friday night adventures, but we still love to have him here.
207000	209000	Say hi to tech master Loki.
209000	220000	I would love to go, but you know, kids, uh, someday there'll be 18 Loki and we're going to get you all caught up on everything you missed.
220000	223000	All right.
223000	226000	We'll only be about what, 50, 50 years old by the time.
226000	230000	Hey, purse first.
230000	239000	Uh, how have you been doing? I know you were having some drama with your air conditioner, which the heat here in Sacramento, we're in that lovely part of the year where it's triple degree heat.
239000	245000	I know we have listeners in Arizona who are like, fucking fuck you, but it's bad for us.
245000	247000	Whatever you chose to live there. Okay.
247000	249000	Well enough how, how hot it is here.
249000	251000	And we chose to live here, Loki.
251000	256000	Uh, but, uh, your AC was broken for God's sake. That's a horrible, horrible thing, but you're all better now, right?
256000	266000	Yeah, we got a new AC, new first. So we had them replace everything and it was nice the day that they replaced it because you know, I had no, it was pretty hot during the week.
266000	274000	It got up to 90 in the house. So while I was sitting there playing games, um, so I had a fan on, I'm like, this is not doing anything.
274000	279000	I had like three fans on. I have a ceiling fan. I had a box fan and as small fan, they brought from work.
279000	287000	So it's just like all on me at the same time. Like this is just drying me out cause it's just hot air being blown onto me.
287000	289000	Staying hydrated is the most important thing.
289000	295000	It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't even matter at that point. I mean, like I was drinking tons of water. It's just, it's not, it's just unbearable.
295000	303000	This heat wave is everywhere right now. Um, in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network, vognetwork.com
303000	311000	six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show and William murder face and chat saying it's a hundred in Portland, which is, is not common for them.
311000	314000	So there's, you know, heat waves everywhere right now. So it's kind of gross. Yeah.
314000	325000	And it wasn't so bad. I mean, cause like the last, like the last few days before the day I took off to actually have them install it, um, it was, it was hot in the house, but we would go out other places.
325000	339000	And then I like had rigged up a air conditioner radiator thing using a box fan and some copper pipe. And so I actually did that and it worked somewhat, but you know, basically you select the box fans in the windows, sucked in the cool air.
339000	350000	Once it cooled down a little bit and it was pretty bearable. It's just, it's, you know, hot, but yeah, 90 degrees when they finally, Oh, then on top of that, you know, Hey, yeah.
351000	360000	You know, you're going to hate hearing this, but we got to test the heater. So we got to turn the heater on for like five minutes. I'm like, bangs. Oh boy.
360000	368000	Well, at least you can get, get out of the way when it's working. Now it's working great. So, uh, I want to tell one other quick story that's non gaming related.
368000	378000	And then I promise we'll get into all the good video gaming content for, for the next three hours ish. Um, but I do want to mention, uh, the funny followup to dark soccer and I go into the club.
378000	390000	So we're up until 2 AM because that's what people who have been drinking do. We find ourselves at Denny's. That's how, you know, we're drunk cause we allowed ourselves to eat at Denny's eating food that is incredibly crap for you.
390000	403000	Um, and then I kind of realized at some point, Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be up at seven in the morning cause I'm doing a five K on Saturday. So in the heat on Saturday, thank God it was a little more overcast yesterday, but I, I actually walked.
404000	414000	I didn't run it, but, uh, with coworkers, I walked a five K and it was, it was interesting because the whole, you know how like every, every marathon they do has some type of theme to it.
414000	418000	That's, that's the big thing, right? Themed runs. I don't know if you guys have coworkers in this or seen this, but like,
418000	422000	This marathon's theme is we're making you run even though you don't want to.
422000	434000	Okay. Well, I know a big famous one is the beat the blurch thing. That's by the oatmeal guy, right? Where they actually have the blurches chase you around. Uh, Disneyland does one all the time. They do, Oh, they do night runs, right?
434000	442000	They do the color run where you throw the colored powder on. They totally just stole that from that holiday in India. They just, you know, you throw the color packets on each other.
442000	445000	I still want to do the, um, the mud run one day.
445000	446000	They have that. Okay.
446000	448000	Which is a military obstacle course.
448000	463000	So the twist on this one was that it was bubbles everywhere. And as you were running, you would, and you would think they would be like literally everywhere, but because we're in a drought, they, they had to, um, they had to, I guess, ration out the bubbles.
463000	474000	So every kilometer you would run right through, it's like going through a fricking carwash or something. This just bubble overload everywhere. And it's just ridiculous.
474000	486000	But nobody told me the bubble would have dye in it. So if I showed you the socks I wore yesterday, they are ruined. They're like red, green, blue, all the stupid bubble colors all over.
486000	488000	Save them for next year's pride.
489000	497000	And yeah, the ironic thing was this was the same day as, as pride in Sacramento, which I didn't go to because the heat I knew it was going to be killer.
497000	504000	So anyway, uh, act deft and chat says, fucking bubbles. Yeah. That's what I was saying at the end of it.
504000	508000	Uh, dark Tetsuya says way to adult Rob. Yep. Uh, let's see.
508000	513000	SG100 Matt says I've ran two five K's in the past year. It's a great experience and I'm happy I did them.
513000	522000	Yes, I understand. And I think that's great if you're trying to get fit and all that stuff, but my God, the people running these things have to be making a killing.
522000	528000	I mean, cause they what? They charge you 20 bucks to do it and they get thousands of people to sign up for these things.
528000	536000	I can't imagine it costs that much money to put, you know, these little silly things at the stations and stuff. It's $10 for parking.
536000	543000	They charge for shirts at the end. If you want shirts, they charge you to register the day of whoever's running these things is making a killing.
543000	551000	That's why there's so many of these damn things. Like every month over it, over at the County fairgrounds, there's some type of fricking five K run going on.
551000	560000	But anyway, Alan alchemy is in chat saying the socks look like they were soaked in cherry Kool-Aid. I want to just throw them away.
560000	573000	Yeah, that's probably what will be happening. All right. And act deaf says VOG five K. Uh, sure. I don't, I don't think we could get thousands and thousands of people to show up for that, but we could, we could do a five K lap around the dragon con hotels.
573000	586000	Maybe that's something just dragon con do a five K I'm kind of surprised they don't VOG five K in the, in the VOG five K you have to play 5,000 video games and walk five meters.
586000	597000	They're all video games that dark soccer has selected to personally torture you with. Wait, wait, what? The VOG five K you're going to pick 5,000 video games for people to play 5,000.
597000	608000	Yes. All right. First thing I actually have that many first game everybody has to play. Well, how much do I hate everybody? A lot. Clue Clue land.
609000	616000	Please look forward to it. The VOG five K featuring clue clue land.
616000	624000	No, no, no. Better yet. Cheetah man. All right. That'll be the second game. That'd be the second game is cheetah man. All right. Anyway, Bible adventures.
624000	633000	Um, well, let's get into some gaming talk. So before we get to our gaming weeks, the type of games we've been playing this week that didn't involve running and bubbles and all this stuff.
633000	643000	Let's talk a little bit about, um, gaming and what's going on in the news. Um, next week is going to be a really big show because next week is E3 week.
643000	654000	And, um, even though, you know, we here at a VOG have decided to opt out of E3 this year, because we personally feel we can get as much out of it, following it online as we can being there at the show.
654000	666000	That's the long and short of it. The reality is we are going to get a data dump from a lot of publishers starting next Sunday. I remember when E3 week, didn't E3 week start on Tuesday at one point.
666000	678000	And it was because the expo was like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Wasn't that a thing along a few years ago. I feel like that was the thing. Now E3 week. Now the expo is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now E3 week starts on Sunday.
679000	693000	So I was talking with dark Sakura before the show. And I was saying, you know what, with the, with the way the E3 schedule is next week, by this time on the next episode, we are going to know the details for Mass Effect Andromeda game.
693000	702000	The dark soccer and I have been very much looking forward to Loki. Not so much. Why would we know when's the ether conference one o'clock on Sunday Pacific time.
702000	714000	So EA will go before OLR. So you can already, so Loki brace yourself because that's going to be the start of next show, but there'll be some other stuff too. I'm sure. And you'll be screaming about some celebrities that showed up. I'm sure.
714000	723000	Why would I scream at celebrities? I don't give a shit about celebrity. Exactly. Exactly. That will be Loki. And then Aisha Tyler showed up and I didn't care.
723000	749000	That's Ubisoft. And I don't care. I still don't. I like Aisha Tyler. I've met her. She's awesome. I don't care. You can put any celebrity in front of you. You don't need celebrities. Just skip, skip the like formalities of like, ha ha ha. Here's our gameplay. Ha ha ha joke. It's not funny. Ha ha ha. You know, like I don't care. Just cut that shit out. Make your thing like 30 minutes shorter.
749000	771000	To be fair, I actually think Aisha Tyler is great. It's just, when I thought of E3 and celebrities, she's the first one I thought of. I guess that's a compliment. Um, so. And for the love of God, no fucking musical performances for Just Dance or Rock Band if they're going to still do that. But like. There's no, Ubisoft is not Sunday, Loki. You don't have to worry about that. There's no Ubisoft. This is in general.
771000	785000	So then, so next week we're going to have to do a show. So next week's show is going to be very interesting. We're going to have to do a show like we did last year because Bethesda has rudely decided to do their press conference right smack in the middle of our show.
785000	788000	Hoping for that Skyrim HD.
788000	801000	So at seven o'clock, we are going to take an extended break. And then while we all watch the Bethesda thing, because I know what y'all are gamers. I'm not going to expect that you're going to be listening to Orange Laundry instead of watching the conference.
801000	804000	Honestly, I don't know what their plate is for.
804000	817000	Well, I'm, I'm glad you asked that because I wanted to go around quickly since this is our last opportunity, really. I wanted to check in. What do you guys think is going to happen with EA and Bethesda? And I opened this up to the chatters as well.
817000	823000	What do you guys think is going to happen with EA and Bethesda next week? So Loki, you're hoping for a Skyrim?
823000	840000	I think it'd be cool. Like a Skyrim HD or something like that would be nice because I like Skyrim and I don't follow. That was good. And it would be nice to see something like that. I don't really know what else they would have planned. I think I thought there was maybe a new Wolfenstein game coming or something.
840000	842000	Well, the last one was pretty well received, right?
842000	845000	Apparently, yeah. I bought it. I still haven't played it yet, but I bought it.
845000	865000	I think a sure thing is going to be Doom DLC because I think Doom is, I kind of feel like it's doing better than even Bethesda expected. I don't know. Maybe they expected it, but even the critical reviews have been very good. And it is, I mean, I played some more Doom this week. It is a great game. It really, I mean, it's a little gross, but I can look past that.
865000	872000	I'm waiting for it to go on sale just because I don't know how much of it I'd play right now, but it looks good.
872000	887000	And of course we're getting some questions from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. Stoppy says, very good idea for that break. Makes it easier on me. I don't have to choose. Look, we're just being realistic. We know. It's E3 week. You're going to choose the press conference.
887000	898000	Even I, and here's the thing, some folks have asked, why don't you guys run a commentary stream so we can listen to you guys commentate while the Bethesda thing's going on in my honest to God answer.
898000	904000	And you're not going to like it, but I'm all about the truth here at Orange Springs Radio is because I think those things are stupid.
905000	921000	Because I, I have tried to find a previous E3s. I'll be like Nintendo live stream and I'll look it up on Twitch and it's like angry dude commenting on Nintendo conference. It's like, I don't care. I just want the information right now. So that's so because of personal bias.
921000	926000	I don't remember doing any streams.
926000	937000	Now. Yes. Snarky with text is different. Bobby says, I have no problem snarky with text. That's very different. So we probably still will in the chat room provide that because that's something optional. You can kind of look away to and stuff like that.
937000	944000	I don't know. I think it's fun, but the problem is though is like you have video and you're watching the video, so there's a lot of silence.
944000	964000	I'll tell you what, what we could do, we could record something and make it like a special thing that is like an option. I won't even put it on the feed. It'll be like an optional download somewhere. Like an extra, this is what, if we had a Patreon, it's one of those things I put on the Patreon, like a bonus thing that you can go download and just hear Loki scream about everything, which I know some of you love.
964000	966000	Scream about everything last year.
966000	968000	Actually yeah, Bethesda had one of the better conferences last year.
968000	985000	Yeah, I thought they knocked it out of the park last year. I mean, so I have high expectations. Well, I have no expectations because I don't know what the hell they're coming out with because as long as they don't talk about all their roles online because no one gives a shit about that anymore. I don't know. A new Elder Schools game would be nice.
985000	991000	Tiger Claw in chat says, giant bomb does it. They do commentary over the press conferences.
992000	994000	I stand by what I said.
994000	1001000	And also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, somebody said, oh, Kajuda said Bethesda has nothing to show.
1001000	1015000	Well, I have a conference. And I feel like they did have surprises last year. In fact, they dropped a pretty big one last year with the whole Fallout Shelter. That ended up being a huge thing.
1015000	1019000	And I know some of you guys are going to roll your eyes to the back of your head with the phones.
1019000	1023000	And console mode for Fallout 4, which is just starting to roll out.
1023000	1028000	And Fallout 4 in general. I mean, people knew it was coming, but we got a ton of information last year.
1028000	1031000	Oh yeah, it's Dishonored 2. That's right. That is their thing this year.
1033000	1041000	So, what do you think Bethesda will have this year? Do you think Elder Scrolls will get the reveal of the next game in the franchise?
1041000	1045000	I don't know if they'll have another game, because that takes a while. I mean, maybe it's possible.
1045000	1053000	I think maybe more DLC for Fallout 4, because we're kind of at the end of what they've announced for the season pass already.
1053000	1058000	So, there may be more stuff coming, which I think they did say that that was going to be the case.
1058000	1061000	Actually, no, I know that they've said that that's going to be the case.
1062000	1072000	And then there's, you know, it'd be nice, even just an HD collection of Skyrim and Oblivion would be nice, or just Skyrim.
1072000	1078000	Darsakra, I know you don't play as many Bethesda games, but any thoughts on what they might bring to the table next Sunday?
1078000	1086000	Skyblivion. They'll probably pick another continent in their world and name a game after it.
1086000	1087000	Why not?
1087000	1090000	I would be cool with another property, like something brand new.
1090000	1093000	Well, actually, that's something I think is...
1093000	1095000	Another Star Trek game, how about that?
1095000	1108000	You laugh, but we have the new series coming in 2017, and we have the Star Trek Beyond movie, so I don't think it's beyond all possibility that Star Trek's named.
1108000	1114000	I realize those games haven't been very good, but maybe they're going to do something to really, you know, make us drool over them.
1114000	1118000	Although, you know, temper your expectations, people. The video games don't usually end up being very good.
1118000	1125000	I kind of wish that they'd do a revisit back to that Call of Cthulhu game. Remember that one that we saw years ago at E3?
1125000	1132000	I would love to see something like that come out. If they still own the rights, they should totally do a new Call of Cthulhu game.
1132000	1133000	Okay.
1133000	1134000	You know.
1134000	1135000	You just like Cthulhu.
1135000	1137000	Blurgh.
1137000	1141000	It's the tentacles, you know, they're kind of a turn on.
1141000	1148000	I'm down for the original IP. I think Bethesda does, you know, we had the Evil Within just a couple of years ago.
1148000	1155000	We had their Team Fortress-y game that I don't remember in the moment what it was called. I don't even know if that ever came out.
1155000	1157000	Umm...
1157000	1166000	I don't remember, dammit, I don't remember what it was called. Somebody in chat will save me here, but you know, they have original IPs sometimes.
1166000	1176000	So I think that's, that is probably what we'll see is something completely new. So I know that's such a safe prediction, but in this day and age, is that a safe prediction?
1176000	1185000	Well, we haven't really heard too much about them. I mean, I know what they've got coming, so anything that they've got as a surprise is actually pretty much a surprise right now.
1185000	1187000	So I'm looking forward to it, I guess.
1187000	1193000	And Act Deft is saying Dishonored 2, and you know, I'm sure that is going to be a huge, huge thing.
1193000	1195000	Yeah, they'll probably have like a nice gameplay portion for that.
1195000	1200000	But they talked about at least four or five games last year, so I'm expecting to see something similar this year.
1200000	1209000	Yeah, I was, I remember Doom was a big part of it. Fallout 4, they showed off gameplay for that.
1209000	1214000	Didn't they talk about Elder Scrolls Online at the very beginning, like an expansion or something for that? I seem to recall.
1214000	1217000	I'd completely filter out anything Elder Scrolls Online.
1217000	1222000	I know, I don't, I wonder if they're still going to keep that going or if they're kind of done with that. We'll see.
1223000	1228000	Alright, Doom Plague in chat says Hexen Reboot.
1228000	1229000	That'd be cool.
1229000	1231000	Actually, I'm fucking here for that.
1231000	1236000	Oh, you know what, I hear something that we haven't heard of in a while. What about a new Quake game?
1236000	1241000	What about a new Quake game? It would seem a little weird though, my only concern is that Doom just came out.
1241000	1244000	Like, is it really time to talk about another shooter right now?
1244000	1245000	Yes.
1245000	1246000	I'm asking the wrong crowd.
1246000	1248000	And how about more Unreal Tournament while we're at it?
1249000	1253000	I'm all for more Unreal. Anyway, let's talk about the other one real quick that's going to be on Sunday.
1253000	1258000	So, before OLR, here's the day to make predictions. EA, what's going to happen with EA?
1258000	1259000	What do you guys think?
1259000	1263000	I'm going to be bored with all their sports coverage, which is going to be the majority of it.
1263000	1267000	Mirror's Edge is awesome, but isn't that already out?
1267000	1269000	Well, it's like they've already had the beta.
1269000	1272000	It's coming out, I think, next week or something.
1272000	1275000	Yeah, it's like weeks away from coming out, so that's a good question.
1275000	1279000	Are they going to emphasize Mirror's Edge because they know they have a captive audience,
1279000	1282000	or are they going to kind of de-emphasize a little bit?
1282000	1284000	I would assume they have to talk about it.
1284000	1286000	Well, Mass Effect, Titanfall 2 are going to be big.
1286000	1289000	I think Titanfall 2 is going to be huge.
1289000	1292000	Mass Effect, obviously, is going to be big.
1292000	1298000	I would like to see, I mean, it's a pipe dream. I'd love to see that new Criterion game that they're working on right now.
1298000	1301000	I kind of wish it wasn't the game that they're working on, it was a new Burnout game.
1301000	1305000	Like, so much. That would be fantastic.
1305000	1306000	I would be very happy.
1306000	1307000	A brand new Burnout.
1307000	1309000	I would be very happy to see Eraser.
1309000	1310000	It's so amazing.
1310000	1311000	Yeah, I would be very happy.
1311000	1315000	Even like, I was watching a trailer today, a launch trailer for that.
1315000	1318000	It was a golf game I talked about last week.
1318000	1321000	Extreme Golf, Dangerous Golf, I don't remember what it was called.
1321000	1323000	I think it was Dangerous Golf or something like that.
1323000	1324000	Came out on Thursday.
1324000	1332000	And they have this thing that's like a Smash Breaker, which is a total fucking rip-off of the Crash Breaker from Burnout.
1332000	1335000	But then it's like, man, I really want another Burnout game.
1335000	1340000	And I think they have a new E for Speed game coming out, but I don't know if that's this year or not.
1340000	1341000	I think it might be next year.
1341000	1348000	Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, Battlefield 1 is pretty much a definite for EA.
1348000	1350000	Of course, yeah.
1350000	1352000	Oh yeah, Battlefield 1, duh, completely forgot about that.
1353000	1355000	How did you, you play that more than us?
1355000	1357000	I don't play Battlefield that much.
1357000	1358000	Actually, I have Battlefield 4.
1358000	1360000	We have Mass Effect, you have Battlefield.
1360000	1361000	I don't play Battlefield, though.
1361000	1363000	Battlefield's more sim.
1363000	1367000	I stick to the Call of Duty, which is, you know, very arcade-y.
1367000	1371000	It's good, I like Battlefield 4 a little.
1371000	1372000	I haven't played it too much.
1372000	1376000	I really thought about buying Hardline and stuff because it was down to like 10 bucks.
1376000	1379000	I'm like, eh, but am I really going to play this?
1379000	1381000	Battlefield 1 looks good, though.
1381000	1384000	Let me ask this very random question.
1384000	1386000	Do we think maybe anything on the PC front?
1386000	1389000	You know, we haven't talked a lot about Origin for a long time.
1389000	1393000	You know, EA's PC platform has been, I guess, a little bit dormant.
1393000	1395000	Is it too early for another Sims game?
1395000	1397000	You know, Sims 4 is in the news this week.
1397000	1402000	We'll get to that a little later in the show, but is it too early to talk about Sims 5?
1402000	1404000	Are they going to attempt to do a SimCity?
1404000	1410000	Well, didn't Maxis get, it could be awkward, I don't know.
1410000	1413000	It would be interesting to see if they try, though, to do a Sim something.
1413000	1416000	How about SimAnt Revisited?
1416000	1421000	But I would like to see like a PC exclusive type of thing coming from EA, you know?
1421000	1426000	As much crap as SimCity got and, you know, as tepid as the response to Spore was,
1426000	1429000	I think that's a universe that's still worth visiting, but...
1429000	1431000	Now, Tigerclaw is saying there's a new Star Wars game.
1431000	1436000	Yeah, I remember hearing about that, but there's just going to be like either another Battlefront game, which...
1436000	1442000	Come on, I mean, that was an incomplete game that they put out with DLC that was way too expensive,
1442000	1445000	and now you're telling me I have to buy another game for more content?
1445000	1447000	Fuck you, seriously.
1447000	1451000	Well, with Rogue One being in theater, I mean, we live in a day and age now
1451000	1454000	where there's going to be a new Star Wars movie every year.
1454000	1457000	It's a little weird, but awesome.
1457000	1460000	So, you know, maybe there'll be a tie-in game for Rogue One.
1460000	1462000	Who knows?
1462000	1463000	We'll see.
1463000	1464000	All right.
1464000	1466000	Okay, so we will find out...
1466000	1468000	Oh, by the way, Act F says Mirror's Edge is out on the 7th.
1468000	1472000	Yeah, I thought it was this week, because it's on EA Access, which is usually about a week early, so...
1472000	1476000	I still think they'll bring it up, if nothing else, DLC talk.
1476000	1478000	That's always a given.
1478000	1480000	That's how they push their current stuff, is...
1480000	1482000	Well, there's supposed to be a TV show they're making too, I think.
1482000	1484000	Well, that is true. That is very true.
1484000	1486000	It should be boring as shit.
1486000	1488000	And Dungeon... Or, excuse me, sorry.
1488000	1491000	Doomplague in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,
1491000	1495000	City Skylines is on sale on Steam at the moment. Forget SimCity.
1495000	1501000	Exactly, yeah. If there was a new SimCity to come out, it would have to really do much better than it did last time.
1501000	1503000	Like, it'd have to set that bar way higher.
1503000	1511000	As much as I don't really give a shit about this game, I'm thinking maybe another Plants vs. Zombies thing.
1511000	1515000	I don't know about Garden Warfare 3.
1515000	1519000	Maybe something in that casual space, the PopCap space, you know what I mean?
1519000	1522000	Peggle 2 is alright, I guess.
1522000	1524000	Why not Peggle 3?
1524000	1526000	Why not? Let's do it.
1526000	1530000	Something new. Like, they have some new IPs that come out every now and then.
1530000	1532000	I mean, I'd be happy with that.
1532000	1537000	Or, hey, EA, let's just totally pipe dream. Let's throw out a DJ game of some sort.
1537000	1540000	You know, hey, did Rock Band do well enough for you?
1540000	1543000	EA had nothing to do with Rock Band 4.
1543000	1545000	Oh, okay, well.
1545000	1549000	And fuck, I don't... Can you make a DJ game anyways?
1551000	1555000	Alright, we're gonna move on and talk about our gaming week.
1555000	1560000	We'll see what comes through next week at E3, when E3 starts on Sunday.
1560000	1564000	So weird. Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing,
1564000	1566000	going into more current stuff.
1566000	1568000	Dark Sakura, starting with you. How was your gaming week?
1568000	1571000	Um, I played World of Warcraft.
1572000	1575000	You've been on hiatus for that for a long time, so...
1575000	1577000	Like, two years.
1577000	1579000	So how is it going back?
1579000	1581000	I forget how to pet battle, and I kinda don't care.
1581000	1585000	I really like it. I like the story.
1585000	1589000	I was really interested in the whole Warlords of Draenor thing,
1589000	1592000	because that's actually one of my favorite things out of the lore.
1592000	1597000	Or, you know, the Draenei and all that business they went through.
1597000	1599000	And, um...
1599000	1604000	It's a sort of interesting kind of, I guess, time traveling a little bit in the game.
1604000	1607000	Um, it's also, uh...
1607000	1610000	I love the art style for it. I think it's pretty...
1610000	1614000	It's definitely looking a lot better than it did when I quit.
1614000	1616000	Um, the graphic updates are nice.
1616000	1625000	Um, and it's just, it doesn't force me to have to do instances when I don't want to.
1625000	1627000	To level.
1627000	1635000	The level progression feels a lot more solid than Final Fantasy XIV does.
1635000	1640000	And I like being able to separate my characters and their jobs.
1640000	1642000	I just like it. It's easier for me.
1642000	1644000	Plus, I have something, you know...
1644000	1649000	I can dedicate the time on one thing and not have to switch and change gear classes,
1649000	1653000	and have everything stored in my storage, and it's just much better managed.
1653000	1657000	I mean, I think that XIV is prettier in general.
1657000	1665000	But I think that there's a greater air of magic, of fantasy, in World of Warcraft.
1665000	1667000	And so, I'm glad to be back.
1667000	1672000	I'm still solidly Team XIV, but I am curious what the new expansion's gonna do.
1672000	1675000	You know, new expansions are always an exciting time for an MMO, so...
1675000	1677000	That's another part of the lore that I like.
1677000	1682000	I think I read all of the...
1682000	1684000	Oh, what were the books?
1684000	1688000	It was about Malfurion and Illidan and all them,
1688000	1692000	where folks go back in time and see everything firsthand.
1692000	1698000	I liked that trilogy, and so I'm actually hoping to see more fallout from it.
1698000	1700000	Let me ask this very random question,
1700000	1703000	because this is something else that's happening right now that's kind of a big deal.
1703000	1706000	You know, in the UK, it's happening right now, and we're gonna get it.
1706000	1709000	I believe next Friday, and that is the Warcraft movie.
1709000	1712000	That's kind of a big deal in gaming.
1712000	1715000	I understand the reviews have been pretty tepid so far, what we're seeing,
1715000	1717000	but do you have interest in the Warcraft movie?
1717000	1719000	Yeah, I'll see it. I don't care how bad it is.
1719000	1721000	I kind of feel like I have to.
1721000	1723000	Like, that part of me that played World of Warcraft,
1723000	1725000	even though I haven't in years,
1725000	1728000	well, besides just the random flirting with WoW here and there,
1728000	1731000	but I haven't really played Warcraft seriously, like raiding and stuff, in a long time.
1731000	1735000	And I kind of feel like that part of me that did take it seriously for a while,
1735000	1738000	like I kind of owe it to that part of myself to see the Warcraft movie,
1738000	1741000	but I'm going in with real low expectations.
1741000	1744000	I'm going in preparing to take a nap.
1746000	1751000	Well, you know, me, I have a particular love of bad movies with a good story.
1751000	1754000	And you know what I mean by bad movies with a good story.
1754000	1756000	Yeah, Showgirls.
1757000	1759000	That movie was a shit show, but I love it.
1759000	1761000	You don't know shit.
1762000	1766000	I did the hand thing. You guys didn't see it.
1769000	1772000	But, oh, by the way, I finally got to do that in Miitomo.
1772000	1775000	What's your favorite scary movie? Showgirls.
1775000	1777000	Oh, is that a question in Miitomo?
1777000	1779000	Yeah, what's your favorite horror movie?
1779000	1780000	So I did Showgirls.
1780000	1781000	Love it.
1781000	1783000	So anyway, I have been doing Miitomo.
1783000	1788000	Right now, I'm dressed like an Azalea trail maid in the game,
1788000	1791000	which only people from the deep south know what that is.
1793000	1796000	Also, a little bit of Heroes of Dragon Age.
1796000	1799000	I'm starting to lose steam on it until I can get Cullen,
1799000	1801000	and then I'll play it a whole lot more.
1804000	1808000	I got Ocarina of Time 3D for my 3DS.
1808000	1811000	It was 20 bucks. I was like, why not? I want to play it.
1811000	1815000	So I can actually take it at work, because I freaking love Ocarina.
1815000	1818000	So I'll enjoy getting to play that again.
1820000	1822000	What else did I play?
1824000	1829000	Oh, I did buy something that we will be talking about on the show
1829000	1834000	until the Windows emulation just was like, ugh, ugh, ugh.
1834000	1838000	It's like old-ass Windows emulation on top of it.
1838000	1839000	Oh, okay.
1839000	1843000	And no ability that I could find so far to play it windowed.
1843000	1846000	So if I can figure out how to play it windowed, I will enjoy it a lot better,
1846000	1851000	because then I can shrink it and have at least the resolution look right.
1851000	1857000	But I'm not going to play it so I can figure that shit out.
1857000	1859000	So I guess we'll come back to that in a little bit,
1859000	1861000	but if you were listening last week, you might already know what it is.
1863000	1865000	Moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1865000	1870000	It was all right. I played a shit ton of Final Fantasy XI.
1870000	1872000	On a private server, of course.
1872000	1876000	Oh, shame. I kind of want to go shame on you, but at the same time it's like,
1876000	1878000	all right, Final Fantasy XI is how old at this point?
1878000	1879000	Exactly.
1879000	1881000	Square really needs to get free.
1881000	1884000	Here's why it's awesome, before you judge.
1884000	1887000	So I'm playing on a fun server, is what they call it,
1887000	1890000	and they have a lot of things tweaked in there.
1890000	1892000	Like the experience rate is ungodly.
1892000	1895000	I think it's like 30 times the normal experience rate.
1895000	1898000	And then your guild rate is really high as well,
1898000	1900000	even though you really don't need to buy anything,
1900000	1902000	because everything on the auction house is 100 gil.
1902000	1906000	It doesn't matter what it is, and they constantly stock it.
1906000	1910000	And then of course the drop rate is ridiculous as well.
1910000	1919000	You get this auto regen, refresh, TP increase, and all this other stuff automatically.
1919000	1925000	And on top of all that, all your spells are unlocked completely,
1925000	1927000	so you don't have to do that in all your jobs,
1927000	1931000	and all the limit breaks for your jobs are all unlocked.
1931000	1933000	So it's nice, so you don't have to do all that hassle stuff.
1933000	1939000	I soloed a black mage to 67 in about less than eight hours.
1939000	1940000	Wow.
1940000	1942000	Yeah, exactly.
1942000	1944000	You know, if Shane's out there listening,
1944000	1946000	and I doubt he is because he's probably working,
1946000	1948000	but you're going to get a text message from him shortly.
1948000	1951000	Where, how, when.
1951000	1952000	Yeah, it's awesome.
1952000	1954000	The only thing that kind of sucks is they have something,
1954000	1956000	because it is on a private server,
1956000	1958000	some things don't work correctly.
1958000	1963000	So you can't do the Abyssia stuff, you can't do Corsair.
1963000	1966000	What? That's like my favorite job in the whole game.
1966000	1972000	Yeah, Corsair Puppet Master, and Rune something or other.
1972000	1974000	Oh, the stuff that came with that expansion.
1974000	1977000	Yeah, because it's basically a little buggy,
1977000	1979000	and it could cause a server to crash.
1979000	1982000	So if you do that stuff, so they've locked those out,
1982000	1984000	but everything else is fair game.
1984000	1988000	So I'm basically running, I think at one time I had the plus int gear,
1988000	1990000	which now that I did some research into it,
1990000	1992000	actually plus magic attack is what I want,
1992000	1993000	so I'm going back and doing it.
1993000	1995000	But my plus int gear was so ridiculous,
1995000	2000000	it was like plus 36 int on my black mage,
2000000	2002000	and so apparently it doesn't do a whole ton,
2002000	2004000	so I actually have to go re-buy everything now.
2004000	2006000	But yeah, it's been fun.
2006000	2007000	There are some other people playing,
2007000	2009000	I never run into anybody ever,
2009000	2011000	so I've been soloing everything,
2011000	2013000	and with the refresh regen stuff,
2013000	2016000	I mean, there's really no healing in between anything,
2016000	2018000	it's just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
2018000	2020000	And with the rate of experience,
2020000	2024000	you can level up to like 15 in one of the starter areas
2024000	2027000	in about less than 30 minutes.
2027000	2029000	I mean, really the most time is like,
2029000	2030000	oh crap, I gotta upgrade my gear,
2030000	2032000	because it's been about 15 levels since I did that.
2032000	2034000	So that's really the big thing.
2034000	2036000	And running also item management,
2036000	2038000	because the drops are so much,
2038000	2041000	you're just like constantly auto-sort, auto-sort, auto-sort.
2042000	2044000	And oh crap, I gotta dump all these stacks
2044000	2048000	of rabbit furs and stuff that I have.
2048000	2050000	So it's just extremely fun.
2051000	2053000	Yeah, I mean, I'm liking it a lot,
2053000	2055000	because it's just took all the grind out of it.
2055000	2058000	There's still grind, and you're not invincible,
2058000	2062000	because now I'm soloing down in Crawler's Nest
2062000	2066000	or in, god, the tree with the spiders and stuff,
2066000	2067000	I don't remember what it was called.
2067000	2068000	Oh, the Boyata tree or whatever it's called, yeah.
2068000	2069000	Boyata tree, yeah.
2069000	2071000	Trying to solo there, and it's extremely dangerous,
2071000	2073000	to the point now where, crap,
2073000	2075000	this stuff is actually put up a fight,
2075000	2078000	this regen stuff's not really working out,
2078000	2081000	or like, oh crap, I gotta kill this thing,
2081000	2083000	but it's next to all these other things,
2083000	2084000	and it's just gonna chain them together.
2084000	2087000	Do they let you do the trust people,
2087000	2089000	like the NPCs that play with you?
2089000	2091000	I think you can do the trust.
2091000	2092000	You should get on that if you haven't already,
2092000	2093000	because those things help a lot.
2093000	2095000	The other thing too that you can do as well
2095000	2098000	is you can teleport, basically.
2098000	2100000	You can give yourself a chocobo at any time,
2100000	2102000	so they have little command line things you can put in,
2102000	2104000	so you can do the chocobos,
2104000	2106000	you can teleport to different areas,
2106000	2108000	so it just saves on, there's no ship travel,
2108000	2112000	there's no chocobo crap that you have to do to get that,
2112000	2114000	just go, go, go, go, go.
2114000	2115000	I mean, that's what I love about it,
2115000	2117000	is just take all the crap out of it,
2117000	2119000	and it's just the game.
2119000	2120000	All right, cool.
2120000	2121000	And then aside from that,
2121000	2125000	I played a little bit of Ingress,
2126000	2130000	more Pokemon Go, and yeah.
2130000	2134000	I mean, I hate level five in Pokemon Go.
2134000	2137000	I got a Magikarp, so that was kind of fun.
2137000	2139000	I was like, woo, Magikarp.
2139000	2141000	I heard you need something like 99 to evolve one of those.
2141000	2144000	You have to catch 99 Magikarp to evolve.
2144000	2145000	Yeah, I have to look at it now,
2145000	2147000	because they've changed how they do everything.
2147000	2150000	So now they have these candies and dust,
2150000	2151000	and I don't know, it's just,
2151000	2152000	I'm like, what the fuck is all this stuff?
2152000	2154000	They have to snort stuff, and then they believe they're-
2154000	2156000	Well, they have it now, though, that you can use it to,
2156000	2158000	you can increase the stats of your characters,
2158000	2159000	because before it was just like,
2159000	2160000	okay, you have to catch so many,
2160000	2161000	then you evolve it to the next thing,
2161000	2162000	and then catch so many of that,
2162000	2164000	and you evolve it to the next thing.
2164000	2166000	Now you can kind of recycle your Pokemon,
2166000	2169000	and get these things to evolve them,
2169000	2171000	or change their stats or something.
2171000	2173000	So I just love the mess of that,
2173000	2176000	but yeah, it's all right, I guess.
2176000	2178000	And then Ingress, I need to play more of it,
2178000	2181000	because I'm out of everything, and yeah.
2181000	2186000	Yeah, actually, I'm out of level six resonators now.
2186000	2188000	It's just crazy.
2188000	2189000	Gotta go hack more.
2189000	2192000	It would be nice if there were actually things I could hack
2192000	2194000	that aren't all level eight now.
2194000	2197000	All right, yeah, I'll show you some places to go.
2197000	2199000	Anyway, let's move on.
2199000	2201000	Talking about my gaming week,
2201000	2203000	and the things I've been playing this week.
2203000	2206000	So not Pokemon Go, but Pokemon Alpha Sapphire,
2206000	2207000	I've still been playing a little bit of that.
2207000	2209000	I was talking about that last week,
2209000	2212000	where I just suddenly got interested in Pokemon again.
2212000	2215000	So I was playing just a little bit of that on 3DS this week,
2215000	2216000	but not a lot.
2216000	2218000	So finally, Loki, you'll get a kick out of this,
2218000	2221000	on the Xbox One, I finally, finally, after all this time,
2221000	2223000	loaded up Saints Row 04.
2223000	2225000	Oh, I thought you were going to say Grand Theft Auto 5,
2225000	2227000	but I'll take Saints Row 04.
2227000	2228000	That's not backwards compatible yet.
2228000	2230000	But Saints Row 04, they gave away, right?
2230000	2232000	So I finally fired that up and played it,
2232000	2235000	and I played through the first three chapters, probably.
2235000	2236000	So I played the opening,
2236000	2238000	and I don't want to give too much away,
2238000	2241000	but the big scene with the music
2241000	2242000	that's supposed to make you laugh,
2242000	2244000	but I didn't think it was as funny
2244000	2245000	as the opening to the third game,
2245000	2249000	which I've never laughed harder at a video game in my life.
2249000	2252000	But it was still fun.
2252000	2254000	And then there's this really weird flashback,
2254000	2256000	where you're in a 50s sitcom type of thing,
2256000	2258000	and the way your character walks around.
2258000	2259000	I was dying.
2259000	2261000	Everything's so over the top.
2261000	2263000	So there's still a lot of that funny stuff.
2263000	2265000	Just because the opening wasn't as good
2265000	2267000	doesn't mean the game isn't still fucking funny.
2267000	2268000	But here's the interesting thing,
2268000	2269000	and the part where I ended up stopping.
2269000	2271000	So you finally, after going through those sequences,
2271000	2273000	you end up basically in the same world
2273000	2274000	from Saints Row 03, right?
2274000	2275000	Yep.
2275000	2277000	So you're driving around in the car.
2277000	2279000	Well, as I'm driving around,
2279000	2281000	all of a sudden the car disappears,
2281000	2283000	the game freezes,
2283000	2285000	and my character is just sitting there
2285000	2287000	like she's driving the car, but there's no car.
2287000	2289000	And I can't move anything.
2289000	2290000	Where's my fucking car?
2290000	2291000	Exactly.
2291000	2292000	Where's my sweet ass wheels?
2292000	2294000	It's just, and the game froze.
2294000	2296000	And I'm like, is this an emulation thing?
2297000	2298000	What happened?
2298000	2299000	It's a Saints Row thing.
2299000	2300000	Is it a Saints Row thing?
2300000	2301000	It's a Saints Row thing.
2301000	2302000	They have the whole buggy Saints Row thing.
2302000	2303000	That was in that.
2303000	2304000	Oh, okay.
2304000	2305000	Well, there you go.
2305000	2306000	I just didn't really,
2306000	2308000	and for you really don't need to be driving cars anyways.
2308000	2311000	Well, you do at one point just,
2311000	2314000	well, the story tells you two to go get a gun, basically.
2314000	2315000	This is where I was at.
2315000	2316000	And then it froze, and I was like,
2316000	2318000	all right, I guess I'm gonna move on
2318000	2319000	and play other things.
2319000	2322000	But here's what I've been playing the most of this week.
2322000	2327000	So if you listen to the entire episode of Orange Lawns Radio,
2327000	2328000	and I know not all of you do,
2328000	2329000	because it's a long show,
2329000	2332000	but the very, very end of last week's show,
2332000	2334000	I think my final thought was something like,
2334000	2338000	I really hope I can resist the temptation to buy Overwatch
2338000	2341000	because it's getting really difficult to not buy Overwatch.
2341000	2343000	Well, guess what I did after last week's show?
2343000	2345000	I bought Overwatch.
2345000	2347000	And so I've been playing a lot of Overwatch.
2347000	2348000	And I gotta tell you,
2348000	2350000	I was really skeptical about Overwatch
2350000	2351000	for a variety of reasons.
2351000	2353000	A, are any of my friends gonna be playing
2353000	2356000	because, you know, a lot of these big multiplayer games,
2356000	2359000	like, you go and everybody's playing for a week
2359000	2361000	and then everybody's gone, right?
2361000	2363000	B, the lack of a single-player mode
2363000	2365000	still kind of kills me a little bit.
2365000	2368000	You know, so there were still some reservations I had,
2368000	2370000	but everybody online is just talking about
2370000	2371000	how great it is, how great it is.
2371000	2373000	I remember playing the beta and thinking,
2373000	2375000	well, it's not that bad.
2375000	2377000	And then I realized on PC,
2377000	2380000	and this is really tricky, so just a heads up,
2380000	2384000	although you can buy the console editions for 60 bucks,
2384000	2385000	the Origins edition,
2385000	2388000	and that's the one that shows up in the launcher for PC
2388000	2390000	as a $60 edition,
2390000	2393000	look very carefully and read the screen carefully
2393000	2399000	because underneath the purchase $60 Overwatch Origins editions link,
2399000	2401000	there is a little link that says,
2401000	2404000	just, or, buy just Overwatch,
2404000	2406000	or buy regular Overwatch or plain Overwatch.
2406000	2408000	And if you click that link
2408000	2411000	through the Battle.net store on PC only,
2411000	2413000	you can get Overwatch for 40 bucks.
2413000	2416000	You just miss all that extra shit.
2416000	2418000	You don't get the extra skins, who cares?
2418000	2421000	You don't get the wow pet, I don't fucking care,
2421000	2424000	the Diablo wings, okay, that would have been cool,
2424000	2426000	but not $20 cool.
2426000	2428000	So once I found that, I was like, okay,
2428000	2430000	now it's only 40 bucks, all right, fuck it,
2430000	2431000	I'm just going to buy it.
2431000	2434000	And I've got to say, I'm not disappointed,
2434000	2436000	and it's a really weird place for me
2436000	2439000	because I'm not usually into first person shooters,
2439000	2444000	but I should have listened to what I say all the time
2444000	2447000	about Blizzard because it's holding itself true again.
2447000	2453000	Blizzard excels at making genres accessible to everybody.
2453000	2456000	They did it with the MMO with World of Warcraft
2456000	2458000	because you look at that compared to a game like EverQuest
2458000	2461000	or Final Fantasy XI, it's like, wow, it's super accessible.
2461000	2463000	They did it with Heroes of the Storm and the MOBA.
2463000	2465000	They've done it with Hearthstone and the trading card game.
2465000	2467000	And now they've fucking done it with Overwatch
2467000	2468000	and the first person shooter.
2468000	2472000	It's extremely just accessible and easy to pick up and play,
2472000	2475000	and it's really, really fun.
2475000	2479000	And the part that is surprising me greatly
2479000	2482000	is that I can play with strangers
2482000	2485000	and actually be totally okay with it.
2485000	2488000	I'm not really finding myself in a toxic environment.
2488000	2492000	Why? I just disabled voice chat, easy as pie.
2493000	2496000	And there's still enough to do
2496000	2499000	where you don't really feel like you're working against your team.
2499000	2502000	I have a lot of fun with it,
2502000	2504000	but I have way more fun when I do have friends.
2504000	2506000	I was playing with some friends.
2506000	2509000	For those of you that listen to Starboard Power Coupling,
2509000	2512000	which, by the way, shout out, they're going to be 100 years old.
2512000	2516000	No, they're having their episode 100 in, I think it's on June 18th.
2516000	2518000	Is there a 100th episode?
2518000	2520000	So, yeah, that's very cool, so congrats to them.
2520000	2523000	But I was playing with Dr. Ken from that show
2523000	2527000	and some of his WoW rating buddies that I had met at BlizzCon a couple years ago.
2527000	2530000	We all played Overwatch the other night, and I had a great time.
2530000	2532000	And it was cool because I got to experiment with some characters
2532000	2535000	I don't usually get to play around with, and nobody cared.
2535000	2537000	So I got to do a couple matches as Winston
2537000	2539000	when I'm really used to doing support.
2539000	2542000	One other thing I'm going to say about Overwatch
2542000	2547000	that I think is very important as to why this game is so successful.
2547000	2551000	I think Overwatch, this is going to be a big statement I'm about to make,
2551000	2556000	I think Overwatch has the best art direction
2556000	2561000	and cinematic presence of any video game ever.
2561000	2563000	I really believe it.
2563000	2566000	I think Overwatch has the best art direction
2566000	2571000	and cinematic presence of any video game I have ever played, ever.
2572000	2577000	And I think that goes a long way as to why this game is so fun
2577000	2579000	because it feels like you're playing a frickin' movie.
2579000	2583000	A lot of that has to do with the way the sound is designed
2583000	2587000	and how you get climatic music during certain points of the game
2587000	2590000	and it just has this big epic feel to it.
2590000	2594000	Part of it is just the way the plays of the game are designed, how that plays out,
2594000	2598000	because it kind of gives you something to hope for and look forward to
2598000	2600000	and kind of see at the end of the game
2600000	2605000	and it kind of just bookends to a really cool story
2605000	2608000	when a game only runs for like ten minutes or less.
2608000	2612000	And so it's a very great thing to approach in short bursts.
2612000	2616000	The heroes are fantastically well designed.
2616000	2618000	Look at all the fan art out there
2618000	2620000	and other stuff we were talking about last week,
2620000	2622000	the CD'er stuff, so to speak,
2622000	2625000	but the characters are extraordinarily well done.
2625000	2628000	I don't think that type of stuff can be ignored about Overwatch
2628000	2633000	and why it's doing so well.
2633000	2638000	What did they say? Seven million people were playing it the first week?
2638000	2640000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
2640000	2645000	I refuse. I still suck at FPSs unless it auto-aims for me.
2645000	2649000	I do notice the aiming mechanism is much more forgivable
2649000	2650000	than it is in other games.
2650000	2652000	It seems like the hitboxes are much larger
2652000	2654000	or there's a little bit of an assist going on.
2654000	2656000	But I will say this, Bobby.
2656000	2660000	Depending on which character you play, you may not need to aim.
2660000	2662000	For example, Mercy.
2662000	2664000	If you're going to heal, you don't need to aim
2664000	2666000	because it's like the medic in Team Fortress 2.
2666000	2669000	You just run behind them and you use either the heal gun
2669000	2670000	or you use the support gun
2670000	2672000	and it automatically attaches a line to them.
2672000	2674000	So there's that.
2674000	2680000	Or with Symmetra, you're very rarely in the fold attacking people.
2680000	2683000	I mean, you kind of can, but again, her weapon,
2683000	2685000	and I think Winston's weapon is like this too,
2685000	2687000	you just have to be kind of near the target
2687000	2691000	and the weapon will, it's more like an area of effect weapon
2691000	2693000	than it is like a gun that you aim.
2693000	2694000	So there's that.
2694000	2698000	And I was going to say, there was another character too
2698000	2701000	that's like this where you don't necessarily have to be able to aim.
2701000	2702000	Oh, Soldier 76.
2702000	2706000	His ultimate ability is that you just shoot anywhere you want
2706000	2711000	and the bullets will automatically hit any opponent that's in range.
2711000	2713000	The ultimates are very interesting.
2713000	2718000	So, I mean, that is how Blizzard made a first person shooter more accessible,
2718000	2722000	is that not everybody necessarily needs to first person shoot.
2722000	2725000	It's crazy, but it works.
2725000	2727000	Let's see.
2727000	2730000	Bobby says, isn't it a team game so you would need voice chat?
2730000	2732000	Not necessarily.
2732000	2733000	The objectives are usually pretty clear.
2733000	2735000	Everybody knows their role.
2735000	2739000	I think it can be enhanced with voice chat, but it's not needed.
2740000	2741000	Let's see.
2741000	2744000	Also looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2744000	2748000	ActDef says, so basically it's just Team Fortress 3
2748000	2751000	with more likeable characters.
2751000	2754000	And I'm not shading Team Fortress 2.
2754000	2757000	Team Fortress 2 has very likeable characters, incredible characters.
2757000	2762000	Overwatch somehow pushes it further and it's pretty amazing.
2764000	2765000	Let's see.
2765000	2768000	And VidPower in chat says, Overwatch's characters are so likeable.
2769000	2771000	Yeah, I agree.
2771000	2776000	And lastly, Tigerclaw in chat says, so you can play the game in third person
2776000	2778000	and still get hits if your aiming is off.
2778000	2780000	Can you play in third person?
2780000	2783000	I know you can spectate in third person, but if you can play in third person,
2783000	2786000	I haven't seen that yet, but it seems like the engine can render it.
2786000	2789000	I haven't looked for it, so I don't want to say it's not there.
2789000	2792000	But again, it would depend on your characters.
2792000	2794000	So there you go.
2794000	2796000	All right.
2796000	2799000	And then Kaijuto says, this guy is caught up in the hype.
2799000	2802000	Let's see what he says in December.
2802000	2805000	I don't know if that's totally a fair statement
2805000	2810000	because a good game is a good game, and yeah, it's a lot of fun right now.
2810000	2812000	Will it still go in December?
2812000	2816000	I kind of think Blizzard, based on their track record,
2816000	2819000	have a pretty good way of keeping their games relevant.
2819000	2823000	And I think they will do, I mean, if they make good on their promise
2823000	2826000	of new maps, new characters, things like that,
2826000	2829000	to make you want to revisit the game,
2829000	2832000	I think they will sustain it through December.
2832000	2834000	We'll see.
2834000	2838000	So how about that DLC or the in-game microtransactions?
2838000	2840000	I just ignore it.
2840000	2846000	It's skins, it's sprays, and you get some for leveling up,
2846000	2848000	like tagging the walls and stuff,
2848000	2851000	and you can change the quotes and the characters and stuff like that.
2851000	2857000	I still kind of don't like it, but I just don't support it.
2857000	2861000	So I don't buy from the store because I don't need that stuff.
2861000	2862000	Fair enough.
2862000	2864000	All right.
2864000	2866000	But that's enough.
2866000	2871000	I have talked plenty and plenty about Overwatch.
2871000	2872000	I want to get into...
2872000	2875000	If someone will get it for me, that would be great
2875000	2878000	because I actually do want the WoW stuff.
2878000	2880000	I might start playing Diablo again.
2880000	2881000	Diablo is really fun.
2881000	2883000	I got it for free.
2883000	2886000	By the way, that's an example of the whole
2886000	2889000	is Overwatch still going to be relevant six months from now type of thing.
2889000	2891000	I'm still playing Diablo 3.
2891000	2893000	How long ago did that game come out?
2893000	2895000	That game was a fucking mess when it came out.
2895000	2897000	I quit playing it soon after I hit level 10.
2897000	2898000	Yeah.
2898000	2900000	But yet you're tempted to...
2900000	2902000	Does anybody remember the server issues?
2902000	2904000	Does anybody still focus on that?
2904000	2905000	No.
2905000	2908000	Exactly why a SimCity 2 could possibly be a thing.
2908000	2909000	Perhaps.
2909000	2910000	Very much so.
2910000	2911000	Okay.
2911000	2912000	We got to get into some housekeeping.
2912000	2914000	I want to get into gaming news for the week as well.
2914000	2916000	So housekeeping for the week.
2916000	2918000	Next week's show is going to be a little bit different
2918000	2921000	as we mentioned earlier with the whole E3 stuff going on.
2921000	2923000	But we will be here in studio.
2923000	2926000	I do want to give one more shout out for what is going on in Atlanta
2926000	2929000	this upcoming weekend, the Southern Fried Gaming Room Expo.
2929000	2931000	I've been talking about this on the show.
2931000	2934000	If you are in the Atlanta area, I urge you to check it out.
2934000	2936000	It's going to be running June 10th through 12th.
2936000	2938000	It's old school arcade games.
2938000	2940000	Panels.
2940000	2943000	Just kind of like celebrating that gaming culture.
2943000	2946000	Especially if you love the video games of the 80s and 90s.
2946000	2948000	I really think you're going to enjoy it.
2948000	2950000	I'm really bummed I can't be out there in person.
2950000	2951000	I wanted to go.
2951000	2952000	I explored going.
2952000	2955000	But just with my job transition late last year,
2955000	2956000	I just wasn't going to be able to make it work.
2956000	2958000	I had to choose this or Dragon Con.
2958000	2960000	I chose Dragon Con.
2960000	2963000	But our very own Bobby Blackwolf will be there.
2964000	2970000	He told me he's doing three panels on Saturday and one panel on Sunday.
2970000	2972000	This is the Bobby Blackwolf Expo, I think.
2972000	2978000	He's not moderating the ball, but he's participating in four different panels throughout the weekend.
2978000	2982000	You will have ample opportunities to say hello to Mr. Blackwolf.
2982000	2985000	If you are a VOG listener, he will be there.
2985000	2987000	I'm sure some of our other listeners will be.
2987000	2992000	Be sure to let us know in chat or on Twitter if you're going to be at Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
2993000	2995000	Maybe next year I'll be able to join you guys.
2995000	2997000	Hopefully I'm able to make that work.
2997000	2999000	Check that out this upcoming weekend.
2999000	3001000	I also want to give a shout out.
3001000	3006000	Speaking of Bobby, our YouTube channel, if you haven't checked in on that lately,
3006000	3009000	be sure to visit our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.
3009000	3010000	It's our username on YouTube.
3010000	3015000	If you missed the Mass Effect ride review that I did with Shane from Ranger Pridecast,
3015000	3016000	you should check that out.
3016000	3018000	That's still there on the feed.
3018000	3020000	Bobby has uploaded a couple interviews this week.
3020000	3026000	Bobby showed this week very, very, very much about AR and the Hololands and his experiences with that.
3026000	3030000	If you want to take that one step further, Bobby's done a few interviews.
3030000	3032000	My understanding is there's more and more video.
3032000	3034000	Bobby's been very busy these past couple weeks.
3034000	3037000	That is coming soon to the YouTube channel.
3037000	3040000	Check that out as our YouTube presence is expanding this year.
3040000	3044000	Be sure to like, subscribe, and all that fun stuff.
3046000	3048000	I noticed some stuff in chat.
3048000	3053000	I just want to add to this on the whole Overwatch talk real quick before we get into gaming news
3053000	3055000	because this was something I thought about myself.
3055000	3059000	ActDeftInChat says, if Splatoon is still going...
3059000	3066000	Actually, I think one of the things that makes Overwatch so likable is a lot of the same things
3066000	3069000	that are making Splatoon very likable right now.
3069000	3073000	There's a lot of commonality right there.
3073000	3077000	I know we went back and forth a lot about Splatoon voice chat.
3077000	3080000	I still kind of wish it was there if I wanted it.
3080000	3084000	But to go back to that comment that came in earlier,
3084000	3087000	how do you know what to do if you can't communicate with your other teammates?
3087000	3089000	You'd asked about with Overwatch.
3089000	3092000	Well, look at Splatoon as well. You can kind of get away with it.
3092000	3096000	Splatoon also has great art direction.
3096000	3101000	Very vibrant, very cinematic, very colorful in the way it's presented.
3101000	3105000	I think Splatoon is a lot of fun for the same reasons.
3105000	3112000	My point being, I think Overwatch has way more in common with Splatoon
3112000	3114000	than it does with Battlefield.
3116000	3119000	That's my comment on all that.
3119000	3122000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news for now, though.
3122000	3124000	We're going to start off with Loki.
3124000	3131000	Alright, so like they did the last few years, Sony is bringing E3 to you
3131000	3136000	if you happen to go to one of the 80 movie theaters that they are going to be broadcasting it to.
3136000	3140000	You can watch the conference on Monday, June 13th.
3140000	3145000	It'll be running from, I want to say, 6 to 830.
3145000	3151000	And you can get tickets, I guess, right away, or try to get tickets.
3151000	3158000	And yeah, with that, if you do attend, you will get a commemorative Coca-Cola cup,
3158000	3162000	a PlayStation card, and a digital gift basket.
3162000	3167000	And they have a bunch of locations that are doing it. You can go to their website.
3167000	3168000	But none here.
3168000	3169000	Yes, unfortunately none here.
3169000	3172000	I just happened to notice there are none here. We'd have to go to the Bay Area.
3172000	3178000	If you want to check it out, PlayStation.com slash E3 Experience, if you want to see if there's one nearby.
3178000	3181000	Yeah, nothing, unfortunately, unless I'm in the Bay Area or LA.
3181000	3184000	If I'm in LA, then I'm going to just go to it.
3184000	3189000	Yeah, right. I know our pals from Game Buoy, also here on the VOG Network.
3189000	3194000	I know our pals from Game Buoy went to this last year, so I can't see why they won't be going this year.
3194000	3197000	I didn't ask Captain Spike if they got tickets, but they'll probably go.
3197000	3199000	They had a good time last year.
3199000	3205000	If they had it here, I'd go, just because I think it would be a fun way to watch it with a bunch of other gamers.
3205000	3208000	With all the cheers and stuff, it would be kind of like being there live,
3208000	3213000	which I'm very thankful I got to do at least one time in my life, was be at the event live.
3213000	3222000	But, hey, at least this way I'm going to be watching it at home, so the good news is, pants optional.
3222000	3229000	And that is also a great way to experience E3, just so we're all clear.
3229000	3236000	Well, it is a packed theater. I mean, it's dark. Pants could be optional.
3237000	3243000	Alright, pants should always be optional, but only American meaning of pants.
3246000	3253000	Let's move on with some more news about E3 and talk about Nintendo, which some of you also may be watching without pants.
3253000	3256000	I don't know, but there's going to be a long time to watch.
3256000	3259000	Here's the interesting thing about Nintendo, if you didn't already know.
3259000	3263000	They're not going to do a Nintendo Direct this year, because they've pretty much already said,
3263000	3266000	we're just showing Zelda at E3, that's it.
3266000	3273000	However, what they're going to be doing instead is they're going to be doing two full days of Treehouse coverage.
3273000	3278000	So the Treehouse gang, they did this last year, they broadcast live from the E3 show floor.
3278000	3280000	They're going to be doing it again this year.
3280000	3284000	9 a.m. Pacific on June 14th is when they're going to be streaming.
3284000	3288000	But here's the thing, what's kind of developed as this week has gone on.
3289000	3292000	Treehouse is not going to only show Zelda.
3292000	3297000	It seems like that's what they're certainly going to focus on in the beginning, because I think that's what a lot of people want to know about.
3297000	3302000	But they have announced there is going to be some other things shown on the feed as well.
3302000	3309000	They will have the first live gameplay of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon, which actually is going to kick off the streams.
3309000	3310000	That's pretty cool.
3310000	3320000	The second day, they're going to talk about Monster Hunter's Generation, Dragon Quest 7, Pokemon Go will be a part of that as well, Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
3320000	3324000	So there's a lot to see on the feed.
3324000	3329000	So I guess that's a bit of a relief to some people, is that there is going to be more than Zelda.
3329000	3335000	Don't get me wrong, Zelda footage is great, and I'm still not understanding why they have a 90-minute demo for it.
3335000	3341000	I guess that's cool. I don't think they need it because it's Zelda, but whatever.
3341000	3347000	After a while, how many repeats of the Zelda footage could you watch?
3347000	3354000	It would get kind of repetitive and not necessarily boring, but it's like, okay, I'm ready for something different.
3354000	3364000	So yeah, they've got all the third parties, some third party stuff that show off as well, so I'm assuming that's what they'll cover because that's what they kind of did last year.
3364000	3373000	I mean, last year, I think, how many directs did they have? Multiple directs, and even still, they had stuff that they were announcing on Treehouse because they couldn't fit it all in.
3373000	3376000	And this year, it's like...
3376000	3383000	Well, but it also goes to show that Treehouse may have some kind of bonus stuff in it, so maybe...
3383000	3391000	I'm still very disappointed this year with them. I mean, I get it, it's all about Zelda, but you've got more than...
3391000	3396000	I literally just said it's not all about Zelda. There may be some more things that show up for Treehouse.
3396000	3403000	I'm saying they're talking about E3, it's all about Zelda, but they've got more games coming. They've got that Paper Mario game that I'd like to know.
3403000	3406000	I think that's more interesting because that's actually coming out this year.
3406000	3409000	I think they'll show that on Treehouse. I think they will.
3409000	3413000	And how long is it before we get to this? I mean, is this... Let's think about this.
3413000	3422000	If this system is greatly more powerful than the Wii U, are we gonna really want it on the Wii U?
3422000	3424000	Or is this gonna be something we get down to the end and it's like,
3424000	3429000	Oh yeah, we just decided that it's just gonna be an NX game instead of a Wii U game?
3429000	3432000	No, because they promised it on Wii U, they will still say...
3432000	3438000	It's gonna be just like the GameCube Zelda. I'm using my quote-y fingers that ended up on Wii. Same thing.
3438000	3443000	Well, granted, but the Wii was pretty much just as powerful as the GameCube, so that was basically the same thing.
3443000	3451000	This potentially could be something different. Granted, I would hope that their system is more powerful than the Wii U.
3451000	3457000	Alright, well Nintendo has an awful lot of space on the E3 show floor for the one game.
3457000	3462000	I don't know if you've heard this rumor as well, is that the demo is supposedly 90 minutes.
3462000	3466000	I guess there's two demos and combined it is 90 minutes worth of gameplay.
3466000	3471000	That'll be very, very interesting. But Nintendo has reserved a lot of space for it.
3471000	3478000	Which, when I say a lot of space, honestly, looking at the map, it looks to me like the same amount of space they reserve every year.
3478000	3483000	I just, I don't... I get it. I mean, I'm all excited for a longer demo. I mean, that's what people want.
3483000	3488000	But like, if you're thinking about, do you really need that long of a demo to sell this game?
3488000	3494000	I mean, I'm excited for the game right now. I don't think I need 90 minutes of the game.
3494000	3500000	I mean, granted, yeah, I'll take 90 minutes of the game, but it's like, I'm just thinking like the five hour lines that they normally have.
3500000	3503000	You know, shrink that demo down. I mean, come on.
3503000	3507000	Well, the entire booth is nothing but Zelda kiosks, though. It's gonna be interesting. I don't know.
3507000	3519000	Like, I'm curious to see how it plays out. But, you know, a 90 minute demo is kind of a throwback to the days of the PlayStation discs that came with the magazine that gave you a really robust demo of the game.
3519000	3522000	So, I think it's exciting. I hope it doesn't cause...
3522000	3524000	That is pretty exciting. No, it doesn't even matter.
3524000	3530000	Is fucking stream the goddamn demo. You have a fucking eShop. Download the fucking demo.
3530000	3532000	I was like, they're gonna stream it on Treehouse. What are you talking about?
3532000	3541000	No. I understand. Yes, it could be running on dev hardware, whatever. But you could make a smaller demo that could be ready to play so that everybody tries it out.
3541000	3543000	I don't think they'll do it.
3543000	3545000	Of course not. That's effort.
3545000	3551000	I think in this day and age of the fact that they could stream that 90 minute demo on Twitch, that's what they're gonna do.
3551000	3563000	Well, they could have done that, too, back in the 2006, you know, E3. But instead, you know, hey, guess what? On Microsoft's, you know, the storefront, they had three demos you could download and try.
3563000	3570000	Interesting point from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. How long is the Final Fantasy XV demo, the first one?
3570000	3582000	Oh, that was a good probably two-hour demo, right? But that wasn't on the E3 show floor. But, you know, I think that's what Loki wants. Something that you can download and experience yourself, right? And that whole thing.
3582000	3586000	Exactly. I mean, that's more exciting than watching a stream of a 90-minute demo.
3586000	3596000	Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'm still awfully curious to see what happens at E3. Moving on. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Not E3.
3596000	3619000	Well, really good news. And I think that the folks behind The Sims have always been really good about diversity and making sure that people are represented. You know, you've been able to have gay couples from the get-go. You could have alien and vampire babies in E3.
3619000	3635000	Well, now in Sims 4, they're removing the gender restrictions on clothes, hairstyles, and some of the other characterizations. Like, the custom gender settings they have now is that you can pick the gender, but you can also customize it a bit more.
3635000	3652000	Sections include physical frame, if it's masculine or feminine, clothing preference, if the Sim can get others knocked up or neither. And the last question, can the Sim use the toilet standing?
3652000	3654000	Interesting.
3654000	3677000	They do make things that help women stand up and pee, just saying. Sure. You know. But, um, they, uh, I think it's a really, really good thing for them to do, especially with all this, you know, people getting their panties in a twist over, you know, genitals and bullshit.
3677000	3699000	So, I think that, um, it's a really good thing to see them actually taking that next step. And if it's supposed to be simulating life, quote, even video gamey life, then why not add in that customization, make it a bit more gray area, like, you know, things in real life are.
3700000	3714000	I'm all about choice. If I don't like it, I won't choose it. Ta-da! But I do love in Miitomo that I can wear a princess dress, because it makes for some fun pictures.
3714000	3717000	Or green lamé undies in a top hat, Rob.
3718000	3735000	I do what I want in Miitomo, and I think anybody should be able to do what they want. Now, I realize I have a more tongue-in-cheek style with it. And for other people, this is real life. But again, I portray my Miitomo in fun, zany ways. I realize some other people are gonna take the Sim stuff very seriously, and that's, that's cool. Like I said, I'm all about choice.
3735000	3749000	If I don't want to do it, I won't choose it. Done! But Sims has always been about, you know, kinda, I guess, it's kinda funny, I can't help but get my head out of this story that was going around this week. Did you see this on Facebook?
3749000	3760000	That the Tesla guy, Elon Musk, right? Had this whole theory that we are simply people living in a greater, uh, uh, and I'm totally gonna mess this up.
3760000	3778000	Like avatars in a, like, intergalactic video game. Something like that, in an intergalactic video game simulation or something like that. And I was like, kinda like, how apropro with this Sims news is that, you know, for the, uh, greater civilization that's playing a game of The Sims right now with us, uh, you know, just interesting.
3778000	3795000	Anyway, uh, very cool though. I'm all about options and, and more stuff, and if you, uh, wanna wear whatever clothes you want. I mean, how many women do I know that wear guys' clothes, cause a lot of times they're com- I don't wanna say they're always comfier, but for some women they are.
3795000	3803000	And for me, shoot, sometimes I've seen like a button-up shirt or something that is a woman's shirt, but whatever.
3803000	3812000	You know what? Gendering clothes to me is as stupid as gendering pens.
3812000	3823000	Especially t-shirts, although I get some need the boobage. Some need to be cut a little differently for the boobage. That's, but I mean, usually it doesn't-
3823000	3825000	Call them titty shirts then.
3825000	3835000	Well, to some extent I think that the girl cut shirts are meant to take into account the different torso length on average.
3835000	3845000	But for me, like for example, if I wanna buy a men's t-shirt and I want it to fit girly but accommodate my shoulders, cause I've got some big shoulders.
3845000	3857000	I'll buy a medium or a small, a men's medium or small. When I had pneumonia and lost all that weight, I could get away with wearing a boys' XL shirt.
3857000	3868000	I have a few boys' XL shirts in my closet still, that I can still wear. But yeah, it doesn't matter. I buy men's jeans, you know why? Pockets.
3868000	3879000	You know why else? Better made. It's just women's clothes are meant to be, I'm just gonna stop cause I will get on a rant.
3879000	3891000	Is that products that are made for women are usually more expensive because they are put with some sort of, oh this is special for you.
3891000	3894000	Or disposable fashion, you know.
3894000	3897000	Made for a man but pH balanced for a woman.
3897000	3906000	Oh, fuck that shit. You know what? I like the smell of my husband's deodorant. I buy it for him because that's how I want him to smell.
3906000	3914000	Which is a wife's prerogative. And I will use that shit because it smells like sandalwood and freakin' oranges. And it smells amazing.
3914000	3921000	I gotta read some of these comments from chat and then we'll move on. Stoppy in chat at live.voguenetwork.com says, burn that bra, DarkSakura. You go girl.
3921000	3928000	Oh no, I can't burn my bra. I'm a double D. No, I take that back. I'm a triple D.
3928000	3938000	I need the support. She's keeping her bra. But she's burning the women's pants. Listen, she is a Diners Drivin' in Dives, okay?
3938000	3941000	Well now the entire internet knows my chest size. Thank you.
3941000	3946000	Alan Alchemy says, women's jeans are given fake pockets so they have to buy a purse.
3946000	3953000	And SSG100Matt says, my girlfriend hates girls jeans because of the pockets. She doesn't want to have a purse. She just wants men's pockets. There it is.
3953000	3962000	Alright, let's move on. We got other stuff to talk about than just clothes. Although, funny enough, clothes will come up later in the show, I promise.
3962000	3966000	But it'll be a little different. For now, let's get back to some other games. Loki.
3966000	3973000	Alright, I know everybody's excited about this, but hey, that Allison Road game. The one that was supposed to be like kind of the continuation of P.T.
3973000	3981000	Because, you know, Silent Hills isn't gonna be a thing. Yeah, that got cancelled too. So, sorry.
3981000	3984000	Bastards. Well, but we don't know the reasons yet, right?
3984000	3986000	We don't know. They just said sadly.
3987000	3997000	Well, you know where all the tinfoil hats are going? Is that they got a C&D from our pals at Konami. Again, this is alleged and rumor mill, we don't know.
3997000	4006000	They say that there will be a statement soon, but because they're not saying right away, everybody's assuming worst case scenario, everybody's already got a hate boner for Konami.
4006000	4012000	And, let's be real, rightfully so, after the past couple years. So, this is instantly where everybody's going.
4013000	4016000	Hey, Melger Solid 3. It's got a pachinko slot machine.
4016000	4019000	Hey, don't be ruining the news that's coming up later.
4019000	4021000	Spoiler.
4021000	4024000	But yes, they're basically from their official Twitter page.
4024000	4031000	Hi all. Sadly, Allison Road had to be cancelled. Statement to come in the next few days. Thanks for all your support. Very sad to see it had to come to this.
4031000	4038000	I was gonna say, wasn't this another Kickstarter project? And it was, but then the Kickstarter was stopped because they got the publishing deal.
4039000	4040000	Interesting.
4040000	4054000	So, I don't understand how it can be, you know, it's not really a continuation of it. I mean, it's just similar setting, I guess. I mean, I don't understand how they can get cease and desist from Konami.
4054000	4059000	I'm not sure how that works either, unless there was something, did they use-
4059000	4063000	Unless they've patented or copyrighted the gameplay for the trailer.
4063000	4067000	Eh, no. You can't really patent gameplay, though.
4067000	4071000	Or the events that happen. I don't know.
4071000	4078000	Well, here's the thing. Did they use Konami's name or Silent Hill's name in their Kickstarter?
4078000	4080000	Or did they use their assets for the engine?
4080000	4089000	Yeah, because if any of those things came into play, that's gonna be what got them. But again, we are tinfoil-hatting with everybody else right now. We don't know that that's the case. There could be something else.
4090000	4098000	The publishing could have fell through. Somebody may have left or decided it wasn't working. We don't know. So, we're gonna find out hopefully in the next couple days.
4098000	4103000	They're gonna probably bury it under all the E3 news that's about to be released upon the world.
4103000	4112000	Yeah, I'm just kind of skimming everything on this. I don't see anything mentioning Silent Hill or even P.T. for that matter.
4112000	4120000	Yeah, and DungeonBuster in chat says the screens looked very, very similar to P.T.'s aesthetics, but that's like saying P.T. has a patent on scary modern house interiors.
4120000	4127000	To me, isn't that saying that Silent Hill, in my opinion, isn't that saying that Silent Hill and Frigens are Resident Evil?
4127000	4139000	I mean, that's basically the same logic there. Yeah, I mean, there's just... I don't see anything like that. I mean, if it is a cease and desist from Konami, on what grounds, I'd be interested to see that.
4139000	4151000	Oh my god. If it does end up being that, can people hate them anymore right now? I don't think it's possible, but if that ends up being the case, we might find out.
4154000	4155000	Let's just hope it's not.
4155000	4163000	Alright, moving on. Some big news for this week. I think this is a pretty big deal anyway because I got some free games this week. Sorta.
4163000	4172000	Here's the deal. If you weren't aware, if you are using GOG.com, which, you know, is good old games, but I think now their branding is they're really just trying to be GOG.com.
4172000	4182000	And it's somewhat of a competitor to Steam, but they really started out and still deal with old video games. That really was their bread and butter for the first few years.
4182000	4188000	I've bought things on there like Sid Meier's Covert Action, which is one of my favorite games growing up.
4188000	4195000	You can get things like Sid Meier's Colonization, the original, you know, things like that. You can get old school games on good old games.
4195000	4205000	Oh, I bought a game called Castles 2 that I used to play a lot on PC. But anyway, now they do a lot of the newer games too because it is the same company that made the Witcher 3.
4205000	4210000	So they sell newer games as well, so they've been growing a bit more to be more of a Steam competitor.
4210000	4215000	They put out that front end, the GOG Galaxy. Is that what it's called? GOG Galaxy, I think it's called?
4215000	4216000	Yeah, I think so.
4216000	4223000	It's like their storefront, their client, it was something they put out I think last year, a little bit of a response to Steam.
4223000	4234000	And now this is another pretty big step to try to get people to get that GOG account up and running and check out the GOG Galaxy front end.
4235000	4249000	Is that now you can link your Steam account with your GOG library and once you do so, you can import your Steam games into GOG at no extra charge.
4249000	4257000	But, there's a big but here, if you run this it's not going to just suddenly import all those 500 games you have on Steam that you collected in Humble Bundles.
4257000	4262000	It does have to be something that's approved by the publisher for this import.
4262000	4269000	So for that reason, this list is limited to what, about 20 or so games right now? I'm guesstimating here.
4269000	4283000	Some of the selections, VVVVVV, The Witcher Enhanced Edition, Galactic Civilizations 3, Braid, Saints Row 2, but not 3, Bit.Trip Runner, and so on and so on.
4283000	4291000	So when GOG recognizes that these games are in your Steam library, they will now show up in your GOG library for no extra charge.
4291000	4303000	And some people might think, well what's the big deal? Well, A, to try to put everything into one warehouse because if you know that you have more games in your GOG launcher, what are you likely to fire up to play your games?
4303000	4306000	GOG or Steam? There's that whole thing into it.
4306000	4311000	The big, big thing for some people is the fact that GOG games are completely DRM-free.
4311000	4320000	And Steam does have their Steam DRM and we all know about the big button that if Steam ever goes out of business someday, their games will become DRM-free, but for now that's not the case.
4320000	4322000	So for some people that's a very big deal.
4322000	4329000	Also the GOG games sometimes come with little extras, like a PDF manual or a soundtrack, just kind of depending on the game.
4329000	4335000	That will show up in your GOG library on a game-by-game basis as well if it's found in your Steam library.
4335000	4342000	So not a ton of extra frills, but still kind of a nice feeling that, oh, if I buy it here, I'm also going to have it here.
4342000	4350000	It's a little bit like trying to homogenize the PC platform in a little bit of a way. It certainly makes GOG more competitive, if nothing else.
4350000	4354000	So, I don't know, Loki, do you ever use GOG? Do you think you could try this at all?
4354000	4360000	I have some free games on there. That's about it, though. I haven't really used it much.
4361000	4366000	So I think I have GOG Galaxy installed, so I'll try it.
4366000	4375000	And actdeftinchat says, I'm supposed to be saying G-O-G. I don't know, I just... G-O-G, I don't know, I think GOG, whatever.
4375000	4380000	Maybe it's not correct, but it just rolls off the tongue in a different way. GOG.
4380000	4386000	Sounds like googly eyes, kind of like Bobby Blackwell would put on his Oculus Rift, or his HoloLens as the case may be.
4386000	4388000	So I don't know, I keep just saying GOG.
4388000	4391000	Must be hard to put those on the HoloLens, because you actually have to look through it.
4391000	4398000	I think he talked about it in tonight's show, that there is a safe place he can put them on there, but you'll have to download the show to hear it.
4398000	4408000	So, anyway. That's true. Thank you. Tigerclaw has a very good point as well. Tigerclaw says, well we call this place VOG, so we should be able to say GOG.
4408000	4413000	You know what, that's a damn obvious point that probably is coming into play more than anything else, to be honest.
4414000	4416000	Sorry, it's the V-O-G.
4419000	4431000	Alright, anyway. I will say I did run this process myself earlier on GOG, and I got like nine extra games in my GOG library out of it.
4431000	4435000	So, you know, that's kind of cool. Something for nothing. I'm a fan.
4437000	4440000	Most of these games I got out of humble bundles and stuff anyway, so.
4441000	4446000	Alright, let's move on. DarkSakura, you've got old games to talk about too. You love to talk about old games on this show.
4446000	4458000	Yeah, and I need to tell everyone in chat not to spoil for me, but it was funny, last week's classic game was D.
4459000	4476000	And it looks like that I must be psycho and have the SPN, because D is now on GOG, which is the game that I was trying to run in emulated DOS, and it was not happy.
4476000	4485000	I paid six bucks for it, which is great, because I like paying less money for decent games.
4485000	4498000	So, yeah. I mean, I think that it's good that it's out so now more people can experience the cracked out weirdness.
4498000	4509000	But, yeah. Act deft. It was a joke. Psycho. And have ESPN.
4509000	4512000	Mean Girls reference. That's okay, not everybody's gonna get the Mean Girls reference.
4512000	4514000	I haven't even seen Mean Girls, but I know that.
4514000	4516000	You can quote it without seeing it, it's fine.
4516000	4521000	I know, because of everybody. Actually, I have the movie now and someone needs to come over and watch it with me.
4521000	4526000	So anyway, I already told y'all what it was about last week, so just go buy it.
4528000	4532000	I didn't realize that that's what Ken Gino died of, though. That he died of heart failure.
4532000	4535000	I thought he was gonna die of ESPN, but yeah.
4535000	4536000	Well, whatever.
4536000	4537000	Boo.
4537000	4545000	So apparently, though, he had another game idea that is now under crowdsourcing to cover.
4545000	4551000	His colleagues are trying to develop this idea that he had into a game.
4551000	4564000	Um. So, called Kakexun. K-A-K-E-X-U-N. So, cool. If it's crazy, I'll play it.
4564000	4570000	I think that's really cool, though, that you had that classic game of the week last week and then all of a sudden it's back in the news.
4570000	4576000	It's almost like someone out there listens to this show, Dark Sakura. Someone out there with influence is listening.
4576000	4580000	And they got the license and everything all put together in a week.
4580000	4582000	Well, nobody else is using it.
4582000	4584000	Technically, like, three days.
4584000	4588000	It was an easy one to get. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4588000	4593000	It did, well, it's original release had an MS-DOS version, so what ifs.
4593000	4597000	What ifs. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4597000	4603000	We may not be able to foresee the virtual releases all the time, but we definitely know what's gonna hit the store shelves at least.
4603000	4604000	And some of the virtual releases.
4604000	4606000	Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?
4606000	4615000	Well, one thing we know that's coming out this week is gonna be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, which is on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
4615000	4621000	Also, we have Odin Sphere Left Fraser. I think that's how you pronounce that.
4621000	4626000	That's on PlayStation 3. Basically all the PlayStation platforms. PS3, PS4, and Vita.
4627000	4633000	SteamWorld Heist HD on PC, Mac, and Linux. PS4 and Vita.
4633000	4639000	The Solus Project on PC and Xbox One.
4639000	4645000	And then also Hearts of Iron 4 on PC, Mac, and Linux.
4645000	4654000	And, let's see, later on this week, on Friday, we're gonna have Kirby Planet Robobot.
4654000	4655000	That's on 3DS.
4655000	4657000	It's a big deal for some people.
4657000	4662000	Yep. And then there's a new Sherlock Holmes game coming out, apparently, The Devil's Daughter.
4662000	4664000	That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
4664000	4666000	Some people eat those games up.
4666000	4667000	Yes.
4667000	4669000	That's why they keep making them.
4669000	4676000	And then, of course, Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. That's on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
4677000	4682000	And Outlier Sophie, the Alchemist of the Mystery Book on Vita and PlayStation 4.
4682000	4684000	That's it.
4684000	4687000	Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there for this week.
4687000	4691000	On June 9th, Project CARS Perfect Edition hits the PlayStation 4.
4691000	4694000	Mirror's Edge Catalyst also gets released in Japan on June 9th.
4694000	4703000	And Grand Ages Midi-Val comes out. Not medieval, but Midi-Val comes out on the PlayStation 4 this week as well.
4703000	4710000	And I think there's also a motocross video game, MXGP 2, comes out in Japan this week.
4710000	4713000	That is all on the PlayStation 4.
4713000	4722000	On the Wii U, unfortunately, nothing really to report until we get closer to, like, the 23rd when Minecraft Wii U comes out in Japan.
4722000	4730000	But there's nothing on the Vita this week either, which is kind of surprising, because the Vita is much different in Japan than it is here in the US.
4730000	4732000	They still get a lot of releases over there.
4732000	4736000	But there is some stuff to look forward to on the 3DS.
4736000	4740000	In fact, there are some new LL systems, their version of the XL.
4740000	4745000	They have a lime cross black and a pink cross white system coming out.
4745000	4752000	And on June 9th for the 3DS, Gaya Kuten Saiban 6.
4752000	4754000	That is the Ace Attorney series.
4754000	4767000	It's a new game this week, so I'm pretty sure some folks who are into those law games and Objection and Phoenix Wright and all his characters are going to be excited about that release on the 3DS this week.
4767000	4771000	Alright, let's move over to the UK, Dark Sakura.
4771000	4779000	Very little. On the 9th, Mirror's Edge Catalyst. On the 10th, Kirby Planet Robobot.
4779000	4782000	Done. There it is.
4782000	4792000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to go to Dark Sakura with this week's Classic Game of the Week and see what future digital release she'll be predicting this week. Loki.
4792000	4801000	I'm actually surprised by this number, but apparently Valve has sold 500,000 units of the Steam Controller.
4801000	4803000	Wow, that is pretty good.
4803000	4804000	That is pretty good.
4804000	4806000	That's worldwide, right?
4806000	4807000	Yes.
4808000	4814000	You have to remember, Steam is very, very, very, very, very big in other countries as well, more so even than console gaming.
4814000	4817000	So it's a little less surprising when you consider the worldwide element.
4817000	4822000	I don't know, I have never tried that controller, but it's different, so I don't like it.
4825000	4830000	Not really my appeal, or it doesn't appeal to me, but that's cool that they've sold so many.
4830000	4833000	I don't like things that are different, signed Loki.
4835000	4836000	I'm just kidding.
4836000	4843000	But I saw a sale on Steam, that was the big Steam sale this weekend, was buy a controller or a Steam Link.
4843000	4847000	And I have to admit, I was a little bit tempted, but I didn't do it.
4848000	4850000	I'm not using the Steam Link enough, sadly, to justify that.
4850000	4853000	I like the Xbox 360 controller. It works well.
4853000	4856000	I mean, I don't really think I need this controller.
4858000	4862000	I mean, yeah, I don't, so I'm not going to pick it up.
4862000	4867000	Maybe if they have one on a really cheap, cheap sale or something, like ten bucks or something.
4867000	4870000	But no, I'm not going to pick it up for full price.
4871000	4875000	Alright, well congrats anyway on the sales milestone for Valve.
4875000	4881000	It'll be interesting to see if they decide to do a second version, or they soup it up with something else later on, who knows.
4883000	4886000	I bet some of y'all went to the mall this weekend.
4886000	4892000	And the reason why is because of a partnership between Vans and Nintendo.
4892000	4898000	Now we had already talked about on a previous episode how this partnership was happening, but the release actually came out.
4898000	4900000	And it is more than just shoes.
4900000	4906000	We thought in the beginning, because Vans is probably most famous for their shoes, and originally they were showing shoes, well guess what?
4906000	4915000	There's a hell of a lot more that's out there, including backpacks, hats, socks, sandal-type shoes, shirts.
4915000	4921000	I mean there's a lot of stuff that's out there, so you can actually check a lot of that out on Vans' store.
4921000	4926000	There's actually some cute stuff that I want, like this hat that has all the Donkey Kong stuff on it I think is really cool.
4926000	4928000	You can just get a hat that says Game Over.
4928000	4930000	You get a backpack that says Game Over.
4930000	4940000	You can get a t-shirt that has the princess on it, and with a little logo around it that says your princess is another castle, something like that.
4940000	4941000	So you can check that out.
4941000	4949000	And Vans has this all online on their website, so you can check that out at the Vans website, but it's also available in stores.
4949000	4953000	So some folks have been going to the stores to check some of this out.
4953000	4956000	They are saying though that this is a limited time.
4956000	4965000	We don't know what the limited time is, if it's a couple years, if it's through the holiday or what, but don't expect these things to be around forever.
4965000	4967000	But that's actually very typical of licensing agreements.
4967000	4971000	They're not usually indefinite. They usually have a type of limit on it.
4971000	4973000	So there you go.
4973000	4977000	And Bobby Blackwolf says, do those shoes cost $300, Rob?
4977000	4982000	Great question, but no, I believe they're more in the what, like $40 to $60 range.
4982000	4983000	Oh, there you go.
4983000	4984000	Actev says $60 to $80.
4984000	4987000	That's still kind of pricey for shoes, but you know what?
4987000	4989000	You know what I say to that, Dark Sakura?
4989000	4991000	Let's get them.
4991000	4994000	These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.
4995000	4997000	All right, let's travel back.
4997000	5004000	You know, I remember when Nintendo clothes were something you had to order out of Nintendo Power when they had a catalog in the magazine.
5004000	5006000	You could just walk into the mall.
5006000	5011000	We're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week where every week on the show,
5011000	5023000	Dark Sakura picks a game out of the archive that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this with E3 on the horizon to hell with Mirror's Edge and Mass Effect Andromeda.
5023000	5025000	Just kidding. She didn't say that.
5025000	5027000	To hell with all these new games. Play this classic.
5027000	5030000	I was like, hey, you remember this one?
5030000	5038000	Well, the game of the week is Pandemonium, which was also known as Magical Hoppers in Japan.
5038000	5040000	And I will tell you this, even-
5040000	5043000	Also known as some reviews I've seen for this show.
5043000	5045000	Girl.
5045000	5050000	So anyway, what's funny is that I actually played Magical Hoppers first.
5051000	5059000	If I remember right, I think Pandemonium was released in the US first and then Magical Hoppers came out in Japan and then Pandemonium got the UK release.
5059000	5064000	So they were actually kind of different versions of different things.
5064000	5067000	So it was pretty, pretty interesting that way.
5069000	5078000	So with this game, I mean, of course, the Japanese version is completely just reskinned and all of that.
5078000	5086000	So I'm sorry, I'm getting messages in the chatroom while I'm trying to do my segment. Stop it.
5086000	5094000	Anyway, so Pandemonium stars two characters.
5094000	5101000	One of them is a jester named Fargus, and he has a staff named Sid.
5101000	5114000	And then there's the Nikki, who is a circus performer who then decides to become a wizard and she steals some book of magic and Pandemonium happens.
5114000	5119000	And it's one of those 2.5D games.
5119000	5127000	It actually plays not too differently in the way it scrolls and moves from Planoa.
5127000	5131000	It's just that little platforming in the round kind of thing.
5131000	5143000	And it's really you play through the game, you bop things on the head, you jump on things, you bounce on watermelons, you get gems and you beat the game.
5143000	5152000	So versions of this game, there's the PlayStation, the PC and the Saturn version, and it had an N-Gage version.
5152000	5157000	The N-Gage version had 11 levels where the other ones had 18.
5157000	5165000	And the saves for this game actually use a password system. They don't use the memory card.
5166000	5173000	Now, the story for the Japanese one is actually a bit different.
5173000	5180000	So with this game for Pandemonium, it starts off already in like a magical land and everything in the Japanese one.
5180000	5188000	And it actually has a fully animated opening instead of the 3D CGI opening that the U.S. one had.
5188000	5197000	But the animated one for Japan in Magical Hoppers is that these two normal people get summoned to another world and the girl becomes a bunny girl.
5197000	5202000	And the boy gets some weird outfit and a magical talking stick.
5202000	5207000	And they have to, I guess, get back to their own world. It's different.
5207000	5223000	And so my memory first of this game is Magical Hoppers, including seeing all of the freaking commercials for it on some of the early anime that I would just watch taped off of my friend's TV in Japan.
5223000	5233000	So Pandemonium did have a sequel. It came out in 1997 for PlayStation and PC called Pandemonium 2.
5233000	5237000	And the Japanese sequel was called Miracle Jumpers.
5237000	5249000	But I forgot to mention that Pandemonium came out in 1996 and was developed by Toys for Bob, which is great because we just saw a Bob last night and it was published by...
5249000	5255000	And I just retweeted the picture, by the way, of me because Alan posted it. So I was like, all right, even though I look hideously fat...
5255000	5258000	I'm not posting the picture of me.
5258000	5259000	You look fine, but...
5259000	5260000	No, I'm not doing it.
5260000	5269000	I was so drunk that clearly I just like, I didn't just suck in my gut. I stuck it out because I was like, hey girl, I'm drunk.
5269000	5275000	I had some Pandemonium of my own going on in the lower hemisphere, but whatever. It's done now.
5275000	5282000	Yeah. I broke my fan. That's all I said. Oh, I didn't realize this, but it also came out on iOS. Pandemonium did.
5282000	5286000	But it was published by Crystal Dynamics. There you go.
5287000	5292000	Pandemonium, also known as Magical Hoppers.
5292000	5302000	There it is, your classic game of the week. Pandemonium on the PlayStation 1, but as Dar Sakra mentioned, ports, lots of them.
5302000	5308000	We're going to take a quick break for now though, but don't go anywhere. There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5308000	5314000	I failed on asking a Fugu question of the week again. God, I'm so sorry you guys, but I kind of did show roll at a way different time than I used to.
5314000	5318000	Why don't we just like ask a random question now for the folks in chat?
5318000	5324000	We could do that or we could open it up to ask Orange Lounge. But then again, last time we did that, we didn't get a lot of questions.
5324000	5325000	No, we didn't.
5325000	5331000	So maybe we will ask a question of chat. We'll think about it and let you guys know when we come back with part B.
5331000	5339000	And we will do that. But we will also take your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
5339000	5347000	And of course, we are going to do your emails as well that you've sent to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5347000	5352000	When we come back, right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5358000	5368000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with our 644th episode for this June the 5th of 2016.
5368000	5375000	By the way, I did put out in chat, just so you know, there is a chat question of the week since I failed on getting a FUGL question up.
5375000	5379000	You should still follow us on Facebook and Google Plus just because we like friends.
5379000	5387000	So Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio for you, you, Google faithful.
5387000	5392000	But we do have a chat question up. If you want to see it though, you need to be in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
5392000	5396000	And please read that carefully because I want you to private message those answers to me.
5397000	5401000	So while we are collecting those, we're going to get some rapid fire news.
5401000	5405000	I turn around. We have a little workstation. My workstation during the show is in the corner.
5405000	5409000	So I'm not always able to look directly at Dark Soccer and Loki because I'm sometimes fixated on chat.
5409000	5415000	But it's funny because I turn around from my corner and I see both Loki and Dark Soccer playing on their phones.
5415000	5419000	I'm not playing on my phone. I'm trying to get my text message forwarding set up.
5419000	5421000	I am playing on my phone.
5421000	5424000	It just looked like you were playing on your phone. It's just a funny thing to turn around and look.
5424000	5429000	Well, if you could put the phones down for a minute and we're going to do some rapid fire news.
5429000	5431000	Loki, starting us off.
5431000	5434000	Sure. If this will accommodate my catching the Raticate here.
5434000	5437000	I don't think you're supposed to be talking about that.
5437000	5441000	Whatever. No one's going to send a police after me or anything.
5441000	5443000	I don't give a shit.
5446000	5452000	Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about what was coming to Xbox Live Marketplace for the month of June.
5453000	5455000	Now let's talk about PlayStation Plus.
5455000	5460000	We're getting NBA 2K16, which I really don't give a shit about because sports.
5460000	5463000	And then Gone Home, which is alright.
5463000	5466000	So those are going to be your free games on PlayStation 4.
5466000	5471000	PlayStation 3 is getting Echo Chrome and Siren the Blood Curse, episodes 1 through 12.
5471000	5472000	That's kind of cool.
5472000	5476000	And Vita, God of War Chains of Olympus, and Little Deviants.
5477000	5481000	And yeah. So pick those up starting May 7th.
5481000	5483000	Or I'm sorry, June 7th.
5483000	5489000	The May games are actually, tomorrow is going to be the last day to download the May stuff.
5489000	5491000	So make sure you mark it.
5491000	5493000	I'm running late.
5493000	5496000	I'll still put NBA 2K16 in my library because it's a free game.
5496000	5498000	And why not.
5499000	5505000	So Minecraft, it seems like each week they're catching up more and more with the Pocket Edition.
5505000	5507000	And Windows 10 version and all that.
5507000	5512000	Now this week they're going to be getting a brand new update.
5512000	5518000	Including pistons as well as, looks like, some other features.
5518000	5522000	Mainly the Redstone piston stuff was up there.
5522000	5525000	1.5 they called the friendly update.
5525000	5531000	And it includes like, let's see, pig riding, horse armor.
5532000	5536000	And yeah, the pistons are the main kind of draw there.
5536000	5538000	Gamers love their horse armor.
5539000	5541000	But yeah, it's kind of cool.
5541000	5548000	And I'm looking forward to checking that out on Windows 10 and the Android version as well.
5548000	5551000	Especially now that I have that VR version, so yeah.
5551000	5553000	Gotta check that out.
5553000	5557000	And then last but not least, Chrono Trigger.
5558000	5564000	Wants, you know, the director of the game, Takashi Takeda.
5564000	5566000	He wants the game remade.
5567000	5572000	You know what, I say if they're going to remake it, can we remake it like in the style of the actual drawn artwork?
5572000	5574000	Because that'd be pretty badass.
5575000	5580000	Could they remake it in five episodic statements like they're doing Final Fantasy VII remade?
5580000	5582000	Well if Square is going to...
5582000	5587000	The style of the artwork.
5587000	5589000	It was all Toriyama.
5589000	5592000	But now it could actually be all hand drawn.
5592000	5594000	It would have to be pixel art.
5594000	5598000	Well that's true, but I see what you mean.
5598000	5603000	But I mean, the pixels are still based off of the artwork too.
5603000	5606000	I would kind of rather see them do a sequel type of thing.
5606000	5609000	I mean yes, I know about Chrono Cross, but I kind of don't.
5609000	5613000	I don't know, I don't see that game as a sequel. I know not everybody agrees with me.
5613000	5617000	But I'd like to see them do something like more of a direct successor to Chrono Trigger.
5617000	5619000	But let me just hold my breath.
5619000	5623000	Except the whole thing is that Cross was the direct successor?
5623000	5624000	Yes, I know.
5624000	5627000	Because it had the characters returning for the...
5627000	5629000	But the gameplay was awful.
5629000	5630000	That's just my opinion.
5630000	5633000	Well this day and age I guess it's going to be called Chrono Triggered.
5633000	5637000	So it will be a whole different storyline along with that.
5637000	5639000	Moving right along.
5639000	5641000	Let's get into, hey Pokemon!
5641000	5644000	More information on Pokemon Sun and Moon.
5644000	5648000	So not only do we have the Treehouse event coming up,
5648000	5652000	but we also had some Pokemon announcements this week.
5652000	5657000	They did like another sort of direct thing, more like a Q&A type of thing this week.
5657000	5659000	And they actually showed some more information,
5659000	5665000	including some more information about the legendaries that are on the box art for Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.
5665000	5670000	For example, Solgalo is the Pokemon from Pokemon Sun.
5670000	5672000	And I'm sorry if I mispronounced these things.
5672000	5675000	It is a Psychic or Steel type.
5675000	5676000	Not a Fire type.
5676000	5679000	Even though it is Pokemon Sun.
5679000	5680000	But okay, whatever.
5680000	5683000	And then Lunala is from Pokemon Moon.
5683000	5687000	And Lunala is a Psychic Ghost type.
5687000	5688000	There you go.
5688000	5692000	Also, more information about some of the gameplay mechanics itself,
5692000	5695000	including the fact that it will be on the Aloa region,
5695000	5698000	which is four tropical islands and an artificial island.
5698000	5701000	So a lot of people comparing it to Hawaii.
5701000	5705000	Usually the locations in the Pokemon games are inspired by something in the real world.
5705000	5710000	The professor, the topless professor in the game,
5710000	5711000	which is getting a lot of fan art.
5711000	5712000	I don't know if you've seen that,
5712000	5717000	but there's a lot of stuff on Twitter and Tumblr about Professor Kukui
5717000	5719000	is the Pokemon professor.
5719000	5726000	And there's also a girl who assists the professor named Lily.
5726000	5729000	There's also Hau, which is a boy with a big appetite
5729000	5732000	who is the same age as the player's character.
5732000	5736000	And then also the Pokedex is a little different now.
5736000	5740000	The Pokedex is a Pokemon, and it's Rotom.
5740000	5745000	It's a Rotom Pokedex, and it will do much more than simply record Pokemon.
5745000	5746000	There is a personality.
5746000	5751000	It will now show your current location and the next destination on the map,
5751000	5752000	on the second screen.
5752000	5756000	So that'll be kind of nice for those that lose their place in the Pokemon games.
5756000	5757000	So that's pretty cool.
5757000	5758000	Also, one other quick thing.
5758000	5760000	There's going to be a QR scanner,
5760000	5765000	and it will allow you to see information about Pokemon when you scan QR code patterns.
5765000	5769000	And you can register Pokemon of the Aloa region in their Pokedex
5769000	5773000	and figure out where they live by scanning in QR codes.
5773000	5776000	This sounds sort of like something they did in Yo-kai Watch,
5776000	5780000	although in Yo-kai Watch, when you scan a QR code, you got a little in-game bonus.
5780000	5784000	But I'm wondering if instead these QR codes that you scan in
5784000	5790000	are going to sort of help you find maybe some harder-to-find Pokemon in the game.
5790000	5792000	I'll be very curious about that.
5792000	5794000	We were talking a little earlier in the show about Splatoon.
5794000	5799000	Even though they said there was going to be no more major updates to Splatoon,
5799000	5800000	there still is updates happening.
5800000	5803000	In fact, one is scheduled to happen on June 8th,
5803000	5806000	including nine new weapons in the weapons shop.
5806000	5810000	Also, two new kinds of gear will be added also in the shop.
5810000	5814000	There are some adjustments to main weapons, sub-weapons, and abilities.
5814000	5816000	There's also going to be some stage adjustments.
5816000	5821000	For example, you will no longer be able to take some shortcuts in the Arowana Mall.
5821000	5827000	You also will not be able to take shortcuts in the Piranha Pit.
5827000	5830000	So they're just kind of tweaking some maps and so forth.
5830000	5831000	So there you go.
5831000	5832000	And then they also say, of course,
5832000	5836000	several enhancements to improve the user's experience and enjoyment.
5836000	5839000	The ever-so-vague reference there.
5839000	5846000	And lastly, from Nintendo, could there be more Mario Kart 8 DLC on the way?
5846000	5849000	This would be the type of thing that would be perfect to announce during Treehouse.
5849000	5851000	It's kind of a bit of a surprise.
5851000	5854000	Well, Nintendo of Europe actually tweeted out saying,
5854000	5859000	Good things come to those who wait. Hashtag MK8.
5859000	5862000	A lot of people are reading this to say,
5862000	5866000	could this mean that there's going to be more DLC for Mario Kart 8?
5866000	5870000	Finally, Mortal Kombat 8's going to be coming to the Wii U.
5870000	5876000	But there's a screenshot with it that is from a different Mario Kart game.
5876000	5878000	So is it maybe a virtual console thing?
5878000	5879000	Who knows?
5879000	5883000	But I don't think anybody would be too upset if they would put out some more maps,
5883000	5885000	maybe a few more characters.
5885000	5891000	Why not? Another reason to go visit Mario Kart 8 after all this time.
5891000	5892000	Why the heck not? I'm for it.
5892000	5894000	Dark Sakura!
5894000	5901000	Well, for folks in Tokyo, Sega is having a 25th anniversary Sonic celebration.
5901000	5905000	It's happening on June 25th, and you could possibly get into it.
5905000	5908000	It will also be streaming through different channels,
5908000	5912000	and will have some different developers there.
5912000	5915000	And yeah, you can play the new Sonic Boom, but no one cares.
5915000	5925000	And this is not replacing the event that's happening in San Diego on July 22nd here in the US.
5925000	5933000	And what Joyopolis is, is basically like an arcade theme park type place.
5933000	5937000	Next up, in more Sega news,
5937000	5948000	Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap has been teased for a possible smartphone release.
5948000	5959000	It looks like it got teased by Dotemu, and also got another tag on there for Lizard Cube.
5960000	5967000	And it looks very strongly hinted. I think it's going to be on some mobile device.
5967000	5971000	But it could also possibly be on the 3DS or Wii U.
5971000	5979000	And that was the game that was the sequel to the first Wonder Boy game.
5979000	5984000	I think in the US we got it as Monster Boy, or one of them.
5985000	5990000	And also, and this is great, great, wonderful news,
5990000	5996000	is that Capcom has bound Noel Brown from the 2016 Pro Tour events,
5996000	5999000	and Evo supports them 100%.
5999000	6005000	If someone doesn't know what this complete waste of humanity did,
6005000	6010000	I'm sorry, I should be reporting the news. What this person allegedly did.
6011000	6025000	He basically was going around harassing both verbally and physically female attendees,
6025000	6028000	and he was caught on camera doing it.
6028000	6031000	I was going to say, was it? I mean, I know you're supposed to say allegedly,
6031000	6034000	but when it's right there on a live stream, it's...
6034000	6038000	So basically, he's a dumb shit and an asshole shit.
6038000	6047000	So I have no respect for any human being that does not respect the consent of another person.
6047000	6051000	So it's disgusting. He's disgusting.
6051000	6059000	So as a first defense, he is banned from the entire tour for this year,
6059000	6064000	and if it happens again, he will be banned for life.
6064000	6068000	And since this is the first time they've had to make a judgment like that,
6068000	6070000	they're holding this for everybody.
6070000	6074000	First offense, you're banned for the year. Second offense, you're banned forever.
6074000	6078000	So I like this statement.
6078000	6082000	We do not condone any acts of harassment, and we want all of our players and fans to know
6082000	6086000	we will continue to work to ensure that all Capcom Pro Tour events
6086000	6093000	provide safe, inviting environments where the focus is on healthy competition and exciting rivalries.
6095000	6098000	So, yeah. Gone.
6098000	6099000	Bye.
6099000	6107000	Yep. Oh, and one last thing is that EVO said that they'd completely stand behind Capcom's decision,
6107000	6111000	and he won't be allowed to attend EVO 2016.
6111000	6116000	So, he's not even gonna get lit in the building.
6116000	6120000	Well, let us move on to a much more pleasant topic,
6120000	6124000	and that is one where we get to interact with our listeners in a segment
6124000	6127000	we would usually do as the Fugu Question of the Week,
6127000	6132000	but because of my failure, it is the Chatters Question of the Week.
6139000	6146000	You know what, though? Hey, even though it's my failure and Facebook and Google lost out,
6146000	6150000	the chatters won, so, hey, things work out sometimes.
6150000	6154000	Anyway, we wanted to know of our chatters this week.
6154000	6158000	We asked, what is your favorite E3 memory?
6158000	6161000	Which, by the way, would have been the question I asked on Fugu if I hadn't remembered.
6161000	6163000	So, what is your favorite E3 memory?
6163000	6169000	And this could be a game that was announced, maybe a demo that you played during those years
6169000	6172000	where you could kind of beam the demos down or maybe you went to a Best Buy or something.
6172000	6176000	Maybe you got to go to the show and you have a memory being at the show itself.
6176000	6179000	So, let's see what our chatters thought.
6179000	6182000	Bobby Blackwolf starting us off with a message that says,
6182000	6184000	My first in 1997.
6184000	6186000	Well, you know what they say, you never forget your first.
6186000	6190000	I know my first E3 was a trip.
6190000	6193000	It was such a trip, and I'm sure my co-hosts feel very similar.
6193000	6198000	So, yeah, the first E3 is always kind of a big one.
6199000	6202000	Moving on to some other answers here from our chat room.
6202000	6204000	Dark Tetsuya says,
6204000	6210000	Back in E3 2014, I was watching the initial reveal of Zelda Wii U.
6210000	6213000	Enuma was talking about how the new game was going to work,
6213000	6214000	but then when he said,
6214000	6217000	And here's your first look at the world of the new Legend of Zelda,
6217000	6219000	and he snapped his fingers,
6219000	6223000	I screamed so loud it scared the other dogs in my mom's bedroom.
6223000	6225000	Good times.
6225000	6229000	Yes, I think we've all had that gasp moment.
6229000	6230000	Stopy says,
6230000	6234000	My favorite has to be The Last Guardian and Shenmue 3 announced.
6234000	6237000	I went into E3 last year so cocksure of myself
6237000	6239000	that we wouldn't hear a peep about either.
6239000	6243000	Then I tell you what, Alice bangs Zoom straight to the moon.
6243000	6247000	Yeah, nothing can come close to Sony 2015.
6247000	6249000	Yeah, that was a pretty big deal.
6249000	6250000	Act Def says,
6250000	6251000	My favorite E3 memory.
6251000	6252000	I can't recall a special one,
6252000	6253000	but one of the most recent ones
6253000	6256000	is probably when Mirror's Edge Catalyst was first announced.
6256000	6258000	I got really excited for there being a sequel
6258000	6262000	to one of my most favorite games of the last generations.
6262000	6263000	Vidpower says,
6263000	6265000	Memorable E3 moment.
6265000	6269000	Free Xboxes for everyone in the audience at E3 2010.
6269000	6270000	Lucky you.
6270000	6271000	Did you get one of those, Vidpower?
6271000	6272000	Lucky you.
6272000	6275000	Because I guess I was happy for the people in the audience.
6275000	6276000	Yeah, I was looking at the redesign.
6276000	6277000	But also a little bitter.
6277000	6279000	That's all right.
6279000	6280000	Anyway,
6280000	6281000	Reginator says,
6281000	6284000	My favorite E3 memory was watching coverage of it on G4.
6284000	6285000	Sigh, sniff.
6285000	6289000	And participating in E3 events via PlayStation Home.
6289000	6292000	Oh yeah, that was kind of a neat little thing they did.
6292000	6294000	Too bad they pulled the plug on that.
6294000	6295000	SSG100Matt says,
6295000	6299000	When Sony dropped the mic during their PlayStation 4 conference
6299000	6301000	by saying they would allow used games
6301000	6304000	and not require an always online connection.
6304000	6307000	That conference sent shockwaves around the industry
6307000	6312000	and actually caused Microsoft to reverse their Xbox One policies
6312000	6313000	a few days later.
6313000	6314000	That was pretty awesome.
6314000	6317000	I'm surprised we didn't get more answers so far that said that.
6317000	6318000	Because that really...
6318000	6319000	That was just like, damn.
6319000	6321000	That was a moment for the ages.
6321000	6322000	That was just...
6322000	6325000	That was a public beating is what that was.
6325000	6330000	And hey, the kind of moment that fanboys live for.
6330000	6332000	Orange Wright says,
6332000	6334000	I don't think anything can match
6334000	6338000	watching Konami's 2010 press conference for the first time.
6338000	6343000	Watching that best worst conference without knowing what to expect
6343000	6346000	left me bewildered the entire time.
6346000	6351000	Sony 2015's one-two punch of Last Guardian and Shenmue 3 is a close second.
6351000	6353000	Kind of makes you wonder.
6353000	6355000	Sony's raised their bar pretty stinkin' high.
6355000	6358000	Kind of wonder what they're going to show this year.
6358000	6361000	I mean, after what they've done the past couple years,
6361000	6363000	they're going to have to...
6363000	6364000	I don't know.
6364000	6366000	They're going to have to give free money to people or something.
6366000	6367000	We'll see.
6368000	6369000	Dungeon Buster says,
6369000	6371000	Best memory of E3?
6371000	6375000	Probably going to the first one and running into Howard Lincoln.
6375000	6379000	Like, almost literally running into him and the ring of cameras around him.
6379000	6381000	Thanks for the answers in chat, you guys.
6381000	6383000	Those are some really good answers.
6383000	6384000	How about you guys here in studio?
6384000	6385000	Your best E3 memory?
6385000	6387000	And that could be one you went to or one you...
6387000	6389000	I know we've all been to at least one.
6389000	6391000	But that could be one you went to or one you didn't go to.
6391000	6394000	I'll do mine because I kind of already told this story a couple weeks ago on the show,
6394000	6395000	so I'll keep it short.
6395000	6399000	But I think Will Wright actually doing the demo with Spore
6399000	6403000	was a very surreal moment for me as a gamer and a developer I really respect.
6403000	6406000	So, yeah, that's my personal favorite memory.
6406000	6407000	Dark Sakura?
6407000	6412000	Probably all the times I bumped into Kojima every year.
6412000	6416000	It just happened and he recognized me the third year.
6418000	6420000	I don't even know how it happened.
6420000	6422000	It was just like this fake magnet.
6423000	6429000	And then in the magical sound vibrating floor at the Xbox announcement.
6430000	6431000	No, I'm kidding.
6431000	6434000	It was really uncomfortable to sit on that diagonal floor.
6435000	6439000	I do remember that very first year getting to meet Akira Yamaoka.
6439000	6442000	And that was very, you know, we all love him because of Silent Hill
6442000	6444000	and the stuff he did for DDR and 2DX.
6444000	6447000	So getting to meet him was a huge highlight, too.
6447000	6450000	And I got my photo with Igarashi.
6450000	6452000	That was cool.
6452000	6454000	Loki, how about you?
6454000	6455000	I don't know.
6455000	6458000	I mean, I guess the PlayStation 4 thing was pretty awesome.
6459000	6464000	Even though I look back at it now, it wasn't as awesome as I think I originally thought it was.
6464000	6467000	Asking Jason Enos at the time about In the Groove was pretty funny.
6467000	6470000	Too bad we didn't get the recording of it.
6470000	6472000	Yeah, it was kind of my bad, but...
6472000	6474000	Whatever, it's fine.
6474000	6477000	His response was very politically correct, for the record.
6477000	6479000	Yeah. He's a cool guy.
6479000	6481000	I don't know. That's about it.
6481000	6483000	Yeah, I can't really think of anything too huge.
6483000	6485000	Some folks in chat are lighting up...
6485000	6487000	Oh yeah, that's right.
6487000	6489000	These are some great responses in chat.
6489000	6490000	S2100Matt says,
6490000	6492000	What about the ferret being put on the Katamari?
6492000	6494000	Dark Tetsuya says,
6494000	6497000	How about hashtag space ponchos?
6497000	6499000	Reijinator says,
6499000	6502000	Remember Sony's presser from E3 2006?
6502000	6504000	$599 US dollars.
6504000	6506000	$599 US dollars.
6506000	6508000	Reij Racer!
6508000	6511000	Attack the enemy crab. Historically accurate.
6511000	6513000	Stoppy says,
6513000	6515000	They can only top themselves one way.
6515000	6518000	PlayStation 4 now plays everything PlayStation.
6518000	6520000	PS1, 2, 3, and 4.
6520000	6522000	I kind of don't think that'll happen.
6522000	6524000	And Vita. Why not do Vita?
6524000	6526000	I kind of don't think that'll happen, Stoppy,
6526000	6529000	but if it does, I'll do a YouTube reaction video of myself crying.
6529000	6531000	How's that?
6531000	6533000	That'd be awesome.
6533000	6535000	At least PlayStation 1. I mean, come on, man.
6535000	6538000	Like, the PSP plays PlayStation 1 games.
6538000	6540000	That console is more powerful than the PSP.
6540000	6542000	Yeah.
6542000	6545000	No YouTube if it's just PS1.
6545000	6547000	I'll maybe shed a single tear if it's PS1,
6547000	6549000	but it has to be all of that.
6549000	6551000	Because I have a lot of PlayStation 1 games,
6551000	6553000	or even PlayStation 2 games,
6553000	6556000	like, I had purchased, like, you know,
6556000	6559000	Katamari and also Twisted Metal Black,
6559000	6561000	and I saw that Twisted Metal Black's on sale again
6561000	6563000	for the PlayStation 4 for $5.
6563000	6565000	I'm like, eh, it's only $5. I'm like, fuck that.
6565000	6568000	No, I already bought it once. I am not paying for this again.
6568000	6571000	Granted, it was only a dollar that I paid for it originally.
6571000	6573000	I still won't pay them for it again.
6573000	6576000	Not necessarily directly related to the show itself,
6576000	6579000	but I just, I have to throw this out there as a favorite memory,
6579000	6582000	and it's kind of a throwback to our old home and our old network,
6582000	6586000	but, and I think it was the last year all three of us all got to go,
6586000	6589000	and that was the Paris Hilton year E3, right?
6589000	6591000	2006, the year of the Wii.
6591000	6596000	That was when we did the All Games thing in Santa Monica.
6596000	6598000	Remember, we were at the hotel, like, right down the street from that?
6598000	6600000	That wasn't the last year I was able to go.
6600000	6601000	Was it?
6601000	6605000	Oh, you went one of the years I didn't go.
6605000	6608000	You went after the Santa Monica years one more time,
6608000	6609000	because you went as a distributor.
6609000	6611000	Yeah, I went 2009.
6611000	6613000	But I think it was the last year all three of us went.
6613000	6614000	Yeah, maybe.
6614000	6617000	And they were, I feel like they were broadcasting the entire time
6617000	6621000	from that arena lounge, and they had their own little mini event
6621000	6623000	going on there, and it was just a lot of fun,
6623000	6625000	because we were with other indie podcasters,
6625000	6628000	kind of like our little niche audience, and that was a lot of fun,
6628000	6630000	and I do remember the whole time thinking,
6630000	6632000	boy, somebody spent a lot of money on this,
6632000	6635000	but thank you, thank you.
6635000	6638000	That was probably some of the most fun I've ever had at E3,
6638000	6643000	like, outside the show itself, so it was a great, great experience, so.
6643000	6645000	All right, any other moments to share before we move on
6645000	6648000	with the rest of our show?
6648000	6650000	Okay, then let's get into some more news.
6650000	6651000	Loki.
6651000	6655000	All right, this is pretty awesome, as I kind of alluded to before.
6655000	6658000	The console mods that were promised, you know, last,
6658000	6665000	was it last year during E3, for Fallout 4, finally are coming out.
6665000	6668000	So May, the end of May, they launched for Xbox One,
6668000	6671000	and were very popular.
6671000	6673000	In fact, they've received 50 times more traffic
6673000	6676000	than when it launched on the PC.
6676000	6678000	And it's pretty awesome, you can actually go to,
6678000	6681000	they have a special website that you go to for these,
6681000	6684000	and then you can basically tag which ones you want,
6684000	6687000	and then you go to your game, and there they are.
6687000	6690000	So there's quite a few mods that are available now,
6690000	6692000	and I think it's going to be launching for PlayStation 4
6692000	6694000	at the end of this month, so.
6694000	6696000	Very much looking forward to that, that is pretty awesome,
6696000	6698000	and something that they've been trying to do for,
6698000	6702000	they said for 15 years now, so.
6702000	6705000	I can't wait to see, especially with this,
6705000	6708000	and then, let's assume that they're doing a new,
6708000	6713000	like, Elder Scrolls game, that would be pretty awesome as well.
6713000	6717000	All right, well, as spoiled by Loki earlier on the show,
6717000	6720000	but no, I know you guys, you guys read blogs and Twitter,
6720000	6722000	so I'm sure you guys have already seen,
6722000	6726000	there is a new Metal Gear Solid 3 that was announced by Konami,
6726000	6729000	but it is a pachinko machine.
6729000	6735000	Oh my god, all those things we said, please don't, please stop.
6735000	6738000	Konami, don't, like the slow motion stone.
6738000	6740000	No.
6740000	6742000	Here it is.
6742000	6747000	Yep, Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is now a pachinko machine.
6747000	6748000	It will feature-
6748000	6749000	Oh, I need her.
6749000	6750000	It will-
6750000	6757000	It's not just snakes anymore.
6757000	6765000	Rob literally cannot right now.
6765000	6766000	Next story.
6766000	6768000	Kidding.
6768000	6772000	I don't know why that's so funny, because it's so stupid.
6772000	6774000	Yeah, I guess it would be Ball Eater, yeah.
6774000	6776000	Ball Eater.
6776000	6779000	I expect nothing less from Loki on this program anymore.
6779000	6781000	Coin Eater.
6781000	6788000	Yeah, they should just play that song, you know.
6788000	6794000	Characters from Snake Eater, including the pain, the end, the fear, and the fury,
6794000	6799000	which are emotions you're all feeling after hearing this announcement, I'm sure.
6799000	6800000	So there you go.
6800000	6802000	You can also check out the trailer if you want,
6802000	6805000	but you're probably just going to be really upset.
6805000	6811000	Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater pachinko comes out in the fall in Japan.
6811000	6816000	Oh, I'm totally looking forward to not ever playing that, because it's in Japan.
6816000	6820000	And not even round one's going to import it.
6820000	6821000	At least not the one here.
6821000	6824000	I didn't see any pachinko machines at the round one I went to in San Jose.
6824000	6828000	I don't know if the one in SoCal, like if they bring in that kind of stuff.
6828000	6829000	I didn't see any of that up here.
6829000	6830000	But you know what?
6830000	6835000	If I'm going to do something Konami, it's going to be those music games
6835000	6838000	that were actually pretty cool that I did get to play in San Jose.
6838000	6842000	So as much as we love to have a hate circle jerk for Konami,
6842000	6846000	and we all do on the internet right now, and with damn good reason,
6846000	6848000	at least there's some cool stuff.
6848000	6850000	I never thought I'd be saying this in 2016,
6850000	6853000	but at least there's some cool stuff happening in the Bomani world.
6853000	6856000	At least there's that, if nothing else.
6856000	6857000	All right.
6857000	6859000	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
6859000	6865000	Well, it's not exactly video game related, except it's Pokémon.
6865000	6867000	So that's why I did it.
6867000	6872000	But there was, it's nice to hear stories about good cops, you know.
6872000	6876000	So this kid, nine year old kid named Bryce,
6876000	6880000	he was walking along with his Pokémon collection,
6880000	6884000	and some kid just stole it out from under him and ran off with it.
6884000	6886000	What a dick.
6886000	6887000	What a dick.
6887000	6891000	Who would steal a kid's binder full of Pokémon cards
6891000	6893000	that he's been collecting since he was six?
6893000	6896000	I'm really sorry about it, and it's a really big misunderstanding.
6896000	6897000	No.
6897000	6898000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6898000	6902000	So anyway, they called the police,
6902000	6906000	and the police did actually catch the kid,
6906000	6911000	and gave Bryce back his binder, but it was missing some cards out of it.
6911000	6917000	So what this guy did is he donated his Pokémon card collection
6917000	6919000	from when he was a kid.
6919000	6921000	And a lot of Japanese cards actually,
6921000	6926000	including like this Mew card that there's like one of ten of in the world.
6926000	6931000	And so, hey, I guess there are some good cops out there, right?
6931000	6934000	So that's it.
6934000	6935000	All right.
6935000	6936000	Yay.
6936000	6937000	Pokémon.
6937000	6938000	Saving the day.
6938000	6940000	He won't care in five years.
6940000	6941000	Yeah, you never know.
6941000	6943000	The story might make him care a little more.
6943000	6945000	The story might make him care.
6947000	6951000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andraday with vognetwork.com,
6951000	6953000	use the passphrase, surprise.
6953000	6954000	All right.
6954000	6957000	Okumojp in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
6957000	6958000	Pokey cops.
6958000	6960000	And Kaijudo says in chat,
6960000	6962000	Did the police catch them all?
6962000	6964000	Yes, they caught him all.
6965000	6966000	All right.
6966000	6970000	And his prison sentence evolved into six more years.
6970000	6971000	All right, moving on.
6971000	6972000	Loki.
6972000	6978000	So, Vin Vindy has finished its hostile takeover of Gameloft.
6978000	6984000	And according with that, they sent a letter to all of the employees,
6984000	6985000	basically telling them,
6985000	6987000	Hey, you work for us now.
6987000	6990000	So that's kind of interesting.
6990000	6996000	And, of course, none of the higher-ups want them to take over the company.
6996000	7000000	And it's just, I guess that's why it's a hostile takeover.
7000000	7008000	Along with that, though, of course, it's suggested, I guess, that the CEO is considering resigning as well.
7008000	7016000	Basically, I guess it was saying that, yeah, the CEO, Michael Gilmont, is likely to resign.
7016000	7021000	The family will likely consolidate its efforts on protecting Ubisoft from Vindy now.
7021000	7026000	So, yeah, that kind of sucks.
7026000	7031000	But, oh well, we're going to have to see what happens with Ubisoft now.
7031000	7033000	Very interesting.
7033000	7038000	Do you think E3 will get any type of, I mean, I guess it's not really the place for it.
7038000	7039000	It's not really the place, yeah, for it.
7039000	7042000	And it's kind of hard because there's not a lot that they can do.
7042000	7046000	What they're doing is it's not like they're, you know, they're buying the shares from third parties.
7046000	7050000	So people that already have shares in the company, they're basically buying them from them.
7050000	7053000	And so that's how they kind of get around it.
7053000	7058000	But, yeah, it's kind of hard when your company is being told, you know, being run by somebody else.
7058000	7062000	And, yes, Vindy did such a bang-up job with Activision.
7062000	7066000	So, eh, we'll see.
7066000	7067000	All right.
7067000	7072000	Well, this is a very interesting throwback, one that seems a little archaic to me.
7072000	7078000	But they're talking about that could the password, remember when video games had passwords?
7078000	7080000	Like the Guardian legend, right?
7080000	7083000	TGL, Kid Icarus, right?
7083000	7087000	Icarus fights Medusa angels, wasn't that it?
7087000	7089000	Terror, danger, horror.
7089000	7091000	Yeah, Metroid, Justin Bailey, right?
7091000	7092000	We all know these codes.
7092000	7095000	So password, but usually the passwords were not so easy.
7095000	7096000	Like it was just like...
7096000	7097000	Narpus sword.
7097000	7099000	Is that a zero or an O?
7099000	7103000	Or you filled out a grid, you had to have draft paper if you were playing Mega Man.
7103000	7109000	So could passwords be making a comeback in Dragon Quest XI?
7109000	7113000	I kind of think we the internet are reading too much into this, but I'm going to say it anyway.
7113000	7120000	Yuji Ohori actually said that passwords could make a return in the next installment of Dragon Quest.
7120000	7125000	He said he's looking forward to bringing back the spell of restoration in Dragon Quest XI.
7125000	7128000	That's the password system that was found in previous games.
7128000	7134000	The password system will allow you to resume your game and obviously we have regular saving now.
7134000	7137000	Now, I hear something like that and I kind of go,
7137000	7140000	I don't know about that because people aren't going to want to write down passwords.
7140000	7142000	But, here's what people do nowadays.
7142000	7147000	What if the game gave you, this is what it would do, it would give you a QR code.
7147000	7152000	And you could take a picture of the QR code and then you could take that anywhere.
7152000	7154000	Although I guess now that I think about it...
7154000	7155000	Fuck them!
7155000	7156000	The game can't really scan QR codes.
7156000	7158000	There's a reason why we don't use the password system anymore.
7158000	7159000	It's because we have fucking saves.
7159000	7165000	And also because there's more data to save as well that with a password system you can't really do that.
7165000	7171000	So, why? Why are you making it so fucking annoying to save my game?
7171000	7173000	Just save my fucking game.
7173000	7178000	My thought is maybe, and Dartisious says I agree with Rob, that's what they're probably going to do.
7178000	7182000	I don't think the passwords are being used the way we're jumping to conclusions here.
7182000	7185000	Yeah, it's probably going to be, woohoo, you unlocked costumes, woohoo, it's items.
7185000	7191000	Yeah, you put in a password, you get a free item, you get a bonus, a costume, a monster, you know, something.
7191000	7193000	That's probably what it's going to be.
7193000	7199000	I think if you're thinking you've got to get out the notebook to write down your complicated passwords, I really don't think that's going to happen.
7199000	7203000	Yeah, just save. Why are you doing this?
7203000	7211000	So, there you go. Bobby Blackwolf says, why can't we just pay 99 cents to get them unlocked?
7211000	7216000	Why do you need a password for it? Well, maybe you'll have to pay to get the password.
7216000	7220000	Maybe only subscribers to Square Enix's newsletter will get the password.
7220000	7224000	Well, they're only getting that payment once because once they have the password, it's going up on the fucking internet.
7224000	7231000	Alright, we'll see what comes of it. I don't know, that story, I'm like, is that a translation error?
7231000	7237000	But I don't know, everybody's running with it anyway, so we'll see, but I kind of think people are reading too much into it.
7238000	7242000	Let's get to something we love to read too much into, our emails.
7248000	7256000	Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorites here on the show.
7256000	7258000	Sorry, I love these comments in chat.
7258000	7261000	Ragenator says, the password is Ermagerd.
7261000	7263000	Ermagerd.
7263000	7269000	Just a reminder, if you haven't noticed from listening to this show before, somewhere in the show, there is a password.
7269000	7278000	We use passwords at VoG, because there's actually a game going on, and you can actually put in a password, and you get points.
7278000	7284000	And what do you do at points? You collect them, like they're Pokemon. Why? Because that's the game.
7284000	7286000	It makes you feel better about yourself.
7286000	7287000	That's right.
7287000	7288000	In some intangible way.
7288000	7291000	So listen for the password in the show, unless you're listening live.
7291000	7295000	If you're listening live, you just go to live.vognore.com, you just check right in, you get the exact same reward.
7295000	7300000	Sorry, you can't double dip. You can't listen live, and, well you can, but you won't get anything extra.
7300000	7303000	Besides a pat on the ass and a job well done.
7303000	7307000	Alright, anyway, let's get to, speaking of a pat on the ass and a job well done.
7307000	7308000	Our one email.
7308000	7310000	Let's get to our emails for this week. One email.
7310000	7315000	Hello from the Lone Star State. Hold on. Hello from the Lone Star State.
7315000	7316000	That's Texas, right?
7316000	7318000	Hello from the Lone Star State.
7318000	7319000	That's Texas, right?
7319000	7322000	I've been a new silent listener for about two months.
7322000	7325000	Answer my goddamn question. It's Texas, right?
7325000	7326000	No shit.
7326000	7331000	Alright, well then I have to say this. You have to prove that you're from Texas. You ready?
7331000	7338000	The stars at night shine big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
7338000	7342000	And if you didn't finish that, then I don't believe this email. Alright, go ahead.
7342000	7346000	I've been a listener for about two months, and it actually says, I've been.
7346000	7348000	Alright.
7348000	7352000	No, no. I'm just saying, because that's how we talk in this album.
7352000	7354000	I guess I do believe you. Alright, move on.
7354000	7360000	I've been a new silent listener for about two months, and the show you have is just great.
7360000	7363000	Oh, please use punctuation though. I really would appreciate it.
7363000	7371000	I listen to this show normally the day after, and it's just great to listen to during work to get my mind out of work.
7371000	7376000	I've been dying to listen live, but I just seem to remember after Game of Thrones is over.
7376000	7378000	Goddamn that show.
7378000	7381000	Chair of Swords. And man, I beat myself up afterwards.
7381000	7387000	But anywho, my point is, it's an awesome show, and good job to you all.
7387000	7390000	I'm sorry, it's really difficult to read without punctuation, sorry.
7390000	7393000	You know what, give the guy a break. He probably typed it on his cell phone.
7393000	7397000	I almost, you know what, mine actually puts in punctuation.
7397000	7399000	I remember punctuation, usually.
7399000	7401000	I remember the Alamo.
7404000	7407000	I almost feel like I'm in the studio, haha.
7407000	7409000	This comes from Spokesman101.
7409000	7411000	PS, look into text alerts.
7413000	7415000	I never thought of that.
7416000	7421000	Okay, here's the thing with text alerts. I don't use any of them, because I kind of find them to be annoying.
7421000	7422000	I hate them.
7422000	7424000	Okay, but if people are going to request them...
7424000	7426000	We've had one request.
7426000	7429000	Alright, is that a thing people want? How much does that cost to do?
7429000	7432000	I don't know, but I think they're annoying as fuck.
7432000	7435000	But if somebody wants them, I'll annoy you if you want.
7435000	7438000	Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.
7438000	7440000	You know what, I'll text you.
7440000	7442000	I like the part where he stops moving.
7442000	7445000	I'm going to just text you at 2 in the morning.
7445000	7447000	You have a text from Orange Lounge Radio.
7447000	7450000	Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.
7450000	7453000	And then you'll get a text at like 4, 12 in the morning.
7453000	7455000	Don't put me in charge of this shit.
7455000	7458000	The stars at night, right?
7458000	7462000	Now, here's the thing. Here's what I would do.
7462000	7464000	And I think this would be a great idea.
7464000	7468000	And I'm volunteering Bobby, because I don't know anything about this stuff.
7468000	7470000	But someday, we've talked about this for a while.
7470000	7472000	Lessons in telephony.
7472000	7474000	Having a VoG app.
7474000	7480000	And the VoG app could do the push notification that would bother you if you enable it.
7480000	7483000	Because, you know, you can turn that on or off.
7483000	7485000	And then VoG would remind you,
7485000	7487000	Yo, fuck Game of Thrones tonight.
7487000	7489000	Bobby and OLR are on.
7489000	7492000	And everybody going to die. That's what happens on Game of Thrones every week.
7492000	7494000	Don't bother with the chair of swords. We're more comfortable.
7494000	7496000	That's what happens on Game of Thrones every week.
7496000	7498000	Everybody going to die.
7498000	7501000	And something about doors. I don't know.
7501000	7505000	Or we could push a message earlier in the day saying,
7505000	7507000	Hey, just a courtesy announcement.
7507000	7510000	Game of Thrones is on all the piracy websites.
7510000	7513000	So go watch it now so you're available for OLR tonight.
7513000	7515000	That's something else we could do.
7515000	7518000	Hold the door for a moment. We got an announcement.
7518000	7520000	DVR.
7522000	7528000	You can stay off of Facebook for however long it takes for you to get caught up on chair of swords.
7528000	7531000	And then bam, you got us.
7531000	7536000	Bobby is pointing out, create a text alert in your Twitter app for the VoG network account.
7536000	7538000	It tweets whenever a show goes live.
7538000	7540000	Well, there you go. I guess that's true. I forgot.
7540000	7543000	I forgot we have that nice little convenient thing built in there.
7543000	7545000	Thank you for the lovely letter.
7545000	7546000	Yes.
7546000	7552000	I totally heard it in my head in my accent, which doesn't really come out that often unless it has an E2.
7552000	7556000	But it would greatly, greatly look into actually using punctuation.
7556000	7560000	No, I'm going to say I'm going to explain something.
7560000	7567000	I have a very difficult time reading something that does not have punctuation.
7567000	7572000	To show me where a sentence ends, because it will just sound stupid when I read it out loud.
7572000	7578000	Because I just can't not read it the way it's written, you know.
7578000	7585000	So put in a mark where the end of your sentences are and I won't be confused.
7585000	7589000	Before everything went online, I used to grade papers, so I'm used to it.
7589000	7593000	Yeah, but people should know how to, you know.
7594000	7598000	But we're very, very thankful for the email, especially for the new listener.
7598000	7599000	Thank you.
7599000	7600000	Don't ruin the moment.
7600000	7604000	I'm not trying to ruin it. It just really does make it difficult to read aloud. That's all.
7604000	7606000	All right.
7606000	7613000	Let's, well, thank you. If you want to send an email, participate at orangeloundtrader.com is the place to send that.
7613000	7617000	And while you're using the at and the dot, don't forget to use them elsewhere.
7617000	7619000	Right, Darsyra?
7621000	7622000	Yes.
7622000	7623000	I made a point. I made a point.
7623000	7624000	You didn't let me answer.
7624000	7625000	Oh.
7625000	7627000	Yes, God.
7628000	7633000	All right, let's move on. What an appropriate time to get into the FUs of the week.
7633000	7662000	FU to not being paid for doing nothing and for me for not writing my book.
7662000	7669000	I'm going to write my book. It'll be written. You'll see.
7669000	7675000	I'm going to comb that thing with a fine tooth comb for all your punctuation.
7675000	7677000	Girl.
7677000	7683000	Do you want to know how many times any of those papers I wrote in high school and college had punctuation errors?
7683000	7687000	The only time were when I'm not the one that wrote them.
7687000	7690000	Like when other people are doing typing for me.
7690000	7692000	Write your book already. You've been talking about for 10 years.
7692000	7698000	I know you just get a hold of it before it's published.
7698000	7700000	I don't want to kill the poor girl.
7700000	7704000	Act up. You shut your form out.
7704000	7707000	I love this. No, we have to read. You don't just response.
7707000	7709000	Respond to people in chat without reading it. Act up.
7709000	7712000	Says Dark Soccer's book will be done with Loki's.
7713000	7715000	Loki's game is done. I love it.
7715000	7718000	She's got time then.
7718000	7720000	No, seriously.
7720000	7722000	Are you done?
7722000	7724000	No.
7724000	7727000	FU to people who say that I can't get my book done.
7727000	7729000	I will write it out of spite.
7729000	7731000	It'll be called a tale of spite.
7731000	7733000	We're just motivating you.
7733000	7736000	Well, I'm not motivated by spite. So there you go.
7736000	7740000	And also FU to having to still not have any caffeine.
7740000	7745000	Because now in another half a week I have to give up my coffee altogether. No decaf.
7745000	7749000	And my throat still hurts. It still hurts to talk.
7749000	7752000	I have a voice. But it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
7752000	7756000	So I have to make it to the end of the month.
7756000	7759000	All the saints in heaven help me.
7759000	7762000	If they exist. They're dead anyway.
7762000	7765000	But may their memory help me.
7766000	7769000	I will remember.
7769000	7771000	And I will persevere.
7771000	7773000	Are you alright? Are you finished?
7773000	7775000	I'm having a moment. Okay, I'm done.
7775000	7777000	I'm also reading about funeral homes.
7777000	7779000	Loki.
7779000	7783000	Yeah, I guess I have FU to myself for not working on my game.
7783000	7786000	A lot of... I... I don't know.
7786000	7788000	I keep having the excuse that I'm tired.
7788000	7793000	And it is the case because I'm literally falling asleep as I'm at my computer.
7793000	7797000	And the last few nights it's been like, okay, I can play Final Fantasy XI.
7797000	7799000	Or I can work on my game.
7799000	7802000	And I'm just tired. Like, I'm tired as it is.
7802000	7804000	I really want to try.
7804000	7809000	And I start trying to work on just research and stuff that I want to do for that.
7810000	7812000	And then I'm just fucking tired. I'm like, fuck it.
7812000	7816000	I'm just going to play Final Fantasy XI because it requires no brainpower whatsoever.
7816000	7817000	And so I do.
7817000	7819000	And that's been the problem with...
7819000	7821000	Not necessarily Final Fantasy XI, but just like...
7821000	7826000	Okay, I can work on my game. I'm going to go on YouTube and research some stuff I want to find out about voxel engines.
7826000	7828000	Because that's my main thing is I've been trying to...
7828000	7831000	I've been stuck trying to find a way to optimize my voxel engine.
7831000	7836000	Because they have solutions that people have voxel engines all throughout Unity and stuff that people have made.
7836000	7838000	But it doesn't...
7838000	7841000	It's not optimized enough for what I want to do.
7841000	7844000	And so I'm trying to figure out how...
7844000	7848000	Now I'm probably going to research how Minecraft does it.
7849000	7852000	I think it has to do with how they load their chunks and everything.
7852000	7853000	And that's kind of...
7853000	7856000	And really this is all just for the editor. It has nothing to do with the actual game.
7856000	7858000	Because the game is just going to be all...
7858000	7860000	It's all pre-done. It's just...
7860000	7861000	You know, I need...
7861000	7864000	The editor for everything needs to have voxels.
7864000	7865000	So whatever.
7865000	7867000	So FU to myself for that.
7867000	7869000	And also FU for the weather being so damn hot.
7869000	7871000	Thankfully now I have air conditioning.
7873000	7876000	My FU of the Week also goes to just the hot weather.
7876000	7879000	My god, it just makes me want to do nothing but be indoors all day long.
7879000	7880000	Although that's not such a bad thing.
7880000	7883000	But I do have to be outdoorsy once in a while.
7883000	7884000	Once in a while.
7884000	7886000	I mean, where else am I going to find Pokémon?
7886000	7888000	So there you go.
7888000	7889000	Allegedly.
7889000	7890000	Alright.
7890000	7891000	That's it for the FUs of the Week.
7891000	7892000	Let's move on.
7892000	7893000	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
7893000	7895000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7895000	7896000	Yippee!
7896000	7897000	1877 GameOLR.
7897000	7900000	But our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7900000	7901000	All one word.
7901000	7902000	Loki.
7902000	7903000	Yes.
7903000	7909000	So, to be honest, I don't know how this is going to be possible.
7909000	7914000	But apparently there is a Star Wars Battlefront 3 fan game that's coming to Steam.
7914000	7919000	And not only is it coming to Steam, not like through Greenlight or anything, it's being
7919000	7922000	published by Valve.
7922000	7923000	This story is a lie.
7923000	7925000	Valve doesn't do anything involving the number 3.
7925000	7926000	Come on.
7926000	7927000	Exactly.
7927000	7928000	I think that's right.
7928000	7929000	They said, you know what?
7929000	7935000	People have been fucking saying, you know, publish something with the number 3 in it.
7935000	7936000	Done.
7936000	7943280	I just, I fail to see and they keep, I mean, they're saying that, you know, Valve is definitely,
7943280	7946640	they're confident that there's not going to be like a cease and desist on this.
7946640	7947640	But how?
7947640	7952780	I just don't see how that's going to happen.
7952780	7954160	I don't know how they're going to do that.
7954160	7956400	Is it completely a mod?
7956400	7957400	It's a fan game.
7957400	7962400	So it's, I guess, I don't know if it's based off of what they had like previously done,
7962400	7968880	because I know there was kind of a leaked, you know, Battlefront 3 that was done in Unity
7968880	7972880	that was partially, I mean, partially completed.
7972880	7978040	I don't know if that's going to be what they're doing now, but I don't know.
7978040	7981440	I don't know how it's going to be accomplished, especially with, granted they're not calling
7981440	7987560	it Star Wars, but it is Star Wars and it has all the Star Wars things in it.
7987560	7991400	So, I mean, I just don't know how that's.
7991400	7993320	When you say it has the Star Wars things in it though.
7993320	7999880	Like the Star Wars, like the AT, the AT-ATs and the characters, like the droids, they're,
7999880	8000960	they're just there.
8000960	8004200	They're like, it's, it's, it's definitely that.
8004200	8009200	I mean, it's not like, I don't even know how it's going to be possible.
8009200	8010200	That's the thing.
8010200	8015680	I don't know how they're going to manage to pull this off, but I guess they're confident
8015680	8017320	it's going to be something that they can't fight.
8017320	8022520	And then their, their defense is like, well, so far no one's, you know, done a cease and
8022520	8023520	desist for anything.
8023520	8024760	Because they're waiting for you to make money off it.
8024760	8026160	But they're not making any money.
8026160	8027160	It's going to be free.
8027160	8029080	So it is something that is putting out for free.
8029080	8032280	It's from Frontwire called Galaxy in Turmoil.
8032280	8035520	Bobby's figured it all out in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8035520	8038820	Bobby Blackwolf says it's Frog Fractions 2.
8038820	8039820	That's it.
8039820	8040820	That's what happened.
8040820	8041820	So laugh.
8041820	8048100	It would be so awesome if that was it.
8048100	8051060	That's that is my, that's my favorite E3 announcement by the way.
8051060	8052540	It would be the biggest troll ever.
8052540	8053540	What?
8053540	8054620	It's Half Life 3.
8054620	8057580	Or it's just Frog Fractions 3.
8057580	8062100	There never was a Frog Fractions 2 or the Frog Fractions 2 was the buildup for Frog
8062100	8063260	Fractions 3.
8063260	8067140	But I was going to say my favorite E3 announcement is when they finally told us where the fuck
8067140	8069560	we can play Frog Fractions 2.
8069560	8074200	It's just, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm hoping for this year, Frog Fractions 2.
8074200	8079280	I'm hoping for Gabe to actually come out on stage and say, I'm sorry, I'm not here to
8079280	8085240	talk about Half Life, but I got Frog Fractions 2 y'all, deuces!
8085240	8087920	And then drop some mic.
8087920	8096480	He just, he can't get anywhere near a stage because people are like panting, heavy breathing,
8096480	8097480	breathing intensifies.
8097480	8100480	You know, it's just like nothing.
8100480	8102280	Our expectations are way too high.
8102280	8104980	Gabe is not allowed to touch a stage cause it's just going to be a disappointment no
8104980	8105980	matter what.
8105980	8110480	No matter what, it's going to be a disappointment because he didn't do it unless he's backed
8110480	8111480	by a full choir.
8111480	8112480	Oh my God.
8112480	8116280	Can you imagine just like, just the ridiculousness.
8116280	8120000	So I mean, since this is a, you know, our dream scenario here and everything, they give
8120000	8124160	back like the, the full like Gaben meme thing, you know, where it's fucking, you know, just
8124160	8128840	like, you know, the whole background and everything and just, you know, then eventually the mics
8128840	8132320	drop in from the ceiling and the choir, it's all of that.
8132320	8133320	Everything.
8133320	8134320	It'll be the greatest show on earth.
8134320	8135320	It will be.
8135320	8136880	Have a circus while we're at it.
8136880	8137880	Why not?
8137880	8138880	All right.
8138880	8145520	Akuma JP wants to point out, it is 2016, June 6th here.
8145520	8150560	If you cut it in half, you get three, therefore it's time to announce Half Life 3.
8150720	8155960	You know, it sounds to me, Akuma, that you're doing fractions.
8155960	8159160	And if you divide by three, you get frog fractions too.
8159160	8169960	I'm just saying, I'm just saying, hey, someday, someday now, you know what, I know we made
8169960	8175840	a decision to not do E3 this year, but now I'm a little disappointed after something
8175840	8179600	I heard about what's going to be shown at E3 this year.
8179600	8184720	And that is, there's actually going to be a company showing some games at E3 this year.
8184720	8190000	Naughty America will be attending the E3 Expo in LA, and they are going to be demoing and
8190000	8194480	showcasing the latest in adult VR content.
8194480	8195480	That's right.
8195480	8200680	Naughty America has been on the forefront of technological advancements from HD to 4K
8200680	8206440	and now VR adoption as the first major adult studio to produce VR content.
8206480	8211560	By the way, reps will be on hand to discuss the expanding role that immersive, mortal
8211560	8216040	content, mortal, Mortal Kombat.
8216040	8219040	That's not the game I want to play in this experience.
8219040	8223840	Reps will be there to discuss the expanding role that immersive mobile content plays in
8223840	8229440	adult entertainment, how gamers utilize VR headsets for adult content and explain the
8229440	8230840	technological horizon.
8230840	8235360	It's going to be like that scene in the freaking lawnmower, man.
8236360	8239800	But this goes to show that VR will survive.
8239800	8240800	Of course.
8240800	8242240	I've already, I mean, you've already tried it out.
8242240	8245320	I mean, so this is like an actual thing.
8245320	8247120	And I mean, what was it?
8247120	8249520	They've been doing this already, like a lot of different sites.
8249520	8252960	How nice of Naughty America to claim that they're the first, which is not fucking true
8252960	8253960	at all.
8253960	8254960	But whatever.
8254960	8255960	I mean, who gives a shit?
8255960	8259400	I mean, there's a lot of different content providers now, and I guess they're the most
8259400	8261960	name brand worthy of it.
8261960	8264720	But yeah, it's pretty much everywhere.
8265080	8270280	I'm mobile since it's basically just a video with head tracking.
8270280	8276600	Now this article that I'm looking at on this website, VG247.com, which I do like this website
8276600	8279640	by the way, I'm going to be a little critical here in a minute, but I do really enjoy this
8279640	8285560	website, just to be clear, actually asks, does VR porn have a place at E3, a show that
8285560	8288760	is primarily about the video game and interactive entertainment business?
8288760	8290160	Oh, these kids today.
8290160	8293160	Oh, these kids doing their reporting today.
8293200	8296800	They seem to have forgotten about Kensha Hall back in the day.
8296800	8300600	And I think some things that actually, I don't, the one that comes to mind, do you guys remember
8300600	8303040	Feel 3, I think was the name of the game.
8303040	8305480	It wasn't even in Kensha Hall, if I remember right.
8305480	8306480	Yeah.
8306480	8307480	Yeah.
8307480	8313200	It was like, it was like, it was like the second life thing that was all adult.
8313200	8314680	That shit was at E3.
8314680	8317400	So does VR porn have a place at E3?
8317400	8318400	Yes.
8318400	8319880	It's not out of character for E3.
8319880	8323000	It's not Game Expo, it's interactive entertainment.
8323000	8324000	That's right.
8324000	8325600	And porn is very entertaining.
8328600	8333320	RageNator in chat in response to my word mix up there says, kind of gives new meaning to
8333320	8336280	finish him.
8336280	8339440	I will be leaving the chat room for the night.
8339440	8341480	Goodbye.
8341480	8342480	Just kidding.
8342480	8349360	I will be opening up the Skype line, however, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, orangeloungeradio,
8349360	8350360	all one word.
8350360	8354520	Give us a call on Skype to talk about anything we've talked about so far on the show tonight
8354520	8356200	or porn, if you want, I guess.
8356200	8360520	Hey, if you got a modern heads, if you got a modern phone in Google Cardboard, you might
8360520	8361520	as well give it a try.
8361520	8364040	They have VR trailers you can check out.
8364040	8365040	There you go.
8365040	8367160	So you can get an idea.
8367160	8368840	For what it is, it's pretty impressive.
8368840	8373000	Experience it first hand or with both hands, whatever you're into.
8373000	8374280	Hey, but we're getting a call.
8374280	8375280	Let's get to it.
8375280	8376280	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.
8376280	8377280	Who's this?
8377280	8378280	Uh, hi.
8378280	8379280	It's YYR.
8379280	8382720	I feel like I just saw you.
8382720	8383720	I'm sorry, what?
8383720	8385600	I said, I feel like I just saw you.
8385600	8386600	Oh, yeah.
8386600	8387600	You know what?
8387600	8389440	I can't even believe that it was only a week ago.
8389440	8392560	It like doesn't make sense to me at all.
8392560	8393560	You know what?
8393560	8398200	I can't believe this bullshit that Skype is trying to show me an ad right now.
8398200	8403020	God, I thought you were going to say you couldn't believe it's not butter.
8403020	8404320	Well thank you, Bing.
8404320	8405600	I know, right?
8405600	8407520	Anyway, how do I ad block on Skype?
8407560	8408560	Alright, anyway.
8408560	8410560	What's in your mind tonight, my friend?
8410560	8415200	Well you know, really, one reason I called was just to say I just want to thank you guys
8415200	8419480	again for allowing me the opportunity to be on the lovely program.
8419480	8423680	I want to thank you and curse you simultaneously for introducing me to donut muffins.
8423680	8428880	Although I guess your wife plays a role in that, so you can shift that to her if you
8428880	8429880	want.
8429880	8432880	Oh, they're wonderful, but you know this.
8432920	8440840	But yeah, if anyone wants to taste this wonder and greatness, it's Devil's Teeth Baking
8440840	8444760	Company in the outer sunset neighborhood of San Francisco.
8444760	8448600	Hey, they didn't pay for that ad.
8448600	8452760	But yeah, and I've been hard at work on multitasking, plane flights are wonderful.
8452760	8457120	I actually just added a tournament mode to the game yesterday.
8457160	8463480	It basically gives any number of players you designate the same sequence, so everybody
8463480	8468000	can play the same thing and see who's best.
8468000	8474040	And supposedly, they're going to be running a midnight tournament of this game as long
8474040	8475040	as they can get it to work.
8475040	8477920	I'm sending them a build, I'm not going to be there.
8477920	8483000	If anyone is going to be at the Anime Next convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey next
8483000	8488640	weekend, I have some friends of mine, longtime friends, who are helping to run the game room
8488640	8493840	there, and well, they asked me if they could run a midnight tournament on it, so hopefully
8493840	8495600	that will be there Saturday night.
8495600	8498720	The cast of Anime Jam Sessions got to be represented there.
8498720	8502400	I can't imagine they're not there at that con.
8502400	8503680	Fantastic.
8503680	8508240	And there was one other thing I wanted to thank you for, Rob.
8508240	8510360	Well here's the thing.
8510360	8514520	I was thinking about it for days before I appeared on the show last week.
8514520	8520720	I have been playing a lot of video games over the last 30 plus years.
8520720	8525440	Lots of different genres, they can't be compared to each other, and I just wanted to thank
8525440	8530560	you for not asking me that question that you often ask of guests in the studio.
8530560	8532880	What's your favorite video game ever made?
8532880	8536840	Yeah, that one.
8536840	8553480	Well now that you bring it up, I didn't ask him because usually I do that.
8553480	8558400	I ask that question for people that are new to the show, but I didn't really consider
8558400	8560360	YYR new to the show.
8560360	8568680	So just amongst all his appearance of appearances over the years, I've just never gotten around
8568680	8570440	asking YYR that question.
8570440	8573480	Or I just assume it's DDR, BeatMania, I don't know.
8573480	8574480	So anyway, there you go.
8574480	8576240	He hung up and dodged the question.
8576240	8579800	Wow, I didn't get to figure out what else he was going to say.
8579800	8580800	Alright, whatever.
8580800	8586920	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8586920	8590760	Any last minute stories to report on LOKI or Darksharkar if anybody has a last minute
8590760	8591760	story?
8591760	8592760	No.
8592760	8599480	I was going to say the Tamps Offs Senran Kagura and Oni Chambara are now on Steam.
8599480	8600480	Oh really?
8600480	8606480	So you can pick up Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos and Senran Kagura Shinobi Versus.
8606480	8610600	I'm going to have to check those out.
8610600	8611600	I'm going to get right on that.
8611600	8613040	Just think of all the nudie mods those are going to get.
8613040	8614040	Will they import into GOG?
8614040	8615040	Lots of nudie mods.
8615040	8616040	I guess not.
8616160	8617160	Alright.
8617160	8618160	Let's move on.
8618160	8619160	Take another call.
8619160	8620160	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8620160	8621160	Who's this?
8621160	8622160	Hey.
8622160	8623160	This is Ragingator.
8623160	8624160	Hey Ragingator.
8624160	8625160	What's on your mind?
8625160	8626160	Two quick questions.
8626160	8632100	Well, the first one is well, a little long winded but I'll try to keep it short and
8632100	8633100	free if possible.
8633100	8635880	Hey Ragingator, do you need any help finding mortgage rates?
8635880	8637240	Your local mortgage rates?
8637240	8639000	Oh god, no.
8639000	8640720	Because Skype seems to think we do.
8640720	8641840	I'm just saying.
8641840	8643000	What the fuck is this?
8643000	8644000	Fuck these ads.
8644000	8645000	Alright, anyway.
8645000	8646000	Go ahead.
8646960	8657360	Now, you guys were mentioning that the whole GOG Connect earlier in the show, in fact,
8657360	8662280	Kazen was telling me about that a couple days ago.
8662280	8668800	Now Mike, my question for you regarding that is do you know if there's like a set schedule
8668800	8678360	or like set rate where they'll be introducing new gains for GOG Connect like let's say
8678360	8684120	for a second conversation, let's say it's going to be two gains per week or something
8684120	8685120	like that?
8685120	8689480	Eh, I don't know if they'll do it on a weekly basis but maybe a monthly basis but realistically
8689480	8693680	it's as fast as they can get the agreement signed with publishers and if you want that
8693680	8698280	to happen more often, I think you really have to kind of, you know, and I don't know how
8698280	8702760	I feel about this whole like social buzz or whatever but the reality is that's the
8702760	8706920	day and age we live in, I think if there's a lot of very positive buzz around this feature
8706920	8709600	out there, more people will want to get in on that.
8709600	8711440	Oh, that's the thing that people like.
8711440	8714800	Oh, the internet will say good things about us if we get in on that.
8714800	8718320	It's going to encourage more publishers to put their older games in on this.
8718320	8720920	So that's really what it comes down to, Rage Nator.
8720920	8725360	It's as fast as they can sign the agreements but I think people need to be prepared for
8725360	8730640	the fact that, you know, this feature might be around for fifty games or so and then it
8730640	8733240	mysteriously disappears.
8733240	8737520	Not saying those games are going to disappear from your library but then suddenly people
8737520	8740120	get really quiet about it.
8740120	8742280	You have to be prepared for that end game too.
8742280	8744800	Yeah, well I hope that's not the case.
8744800	8748640	Hopefully I'll stick around for a while and they continue to support it but you never
8748640	8749640	know.
8749640	8752840	Well, I mean, on the bright side, for what it's worth, I guess not really the bright
8752840	8759720	side but for what it's worth, it would be no different than what we had last week.
8759720	8761440	If it were to go away.
8761440	8763880	We'd just be back to where we were last week, right?
8763880	8764880	Yeah, true.
8764880	8772520	Well, now, moving forward, a few more second questions so you can take in more calls.
8772520	8773520	Yep.
8773520	8782440	Now, with E3 being next week, is there anything that you're possibly looking forward to or
8782480	8789400	hoping that would occur, at least, not so much in terms of console space but in terms
8789400	8793720	of possible announcements with PC gaming?
8793720	8802200	Now, we're not talking about, you know, the very unlikely, like, FY3 being out so, I mean,
8802200	8803200	come on.
8803200	8807160	It's just not going to happen but anything that would be realistic.
8807160	8811720	Well, RageNator, you couldn't have asked this question in a better year because I have the
8811720	8816200	easiest answer I've ever been able to give for this question and the answer is everything
8816200	8820800	regarding Civilization VI because we know that's a thing that's happening and I fully
8820800	8824440	expect that we're going to get the details at E3 and I'm all over that.
8824440	8827600	I'm very, very...and that's not something we're going to see on console, at least I
8827600	8831600	don't think it would be something...I can't see how they would make it on consoles.
8831600	8835560	I guess anything is possible but I'm not expecting that.
8835560	8838040	I'm expecting that to be a very PC-centric thing.
8838040	8842280	So yeah, Civilization VI, that's my easy answer but truth.
8842280	8843280	Oh, cool.
8843280	8844280	Yeah, yeah.
8844280	8850560	In fact, honestly, I really haven't played a whole lot of the older games especially
8850560	8858480	as of late now because I've got a lot of games to play but, you know, at least C4 and C5
8858480	8859480	are pretty fun.
8859480	8865400	Yeah, they're a little bit of a complicated side but still fun nonetheless so...
8865880	8871080	Alright, well, I'll let you go so you can take more calls but thanks for taking my call.
8871080	8872080	You got it, buddy.
8872080	8873080	Have a good one.
8873080	8874080	Thanks for calling.
8874080	8875080	See you next time.
8875080	8876080	Alright, bye-bye.
8876080	8877080	Bye.
8877080	8880760	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word but we have another call already
8880760	8882240	coming in so let's get to it.
8882240	8883240	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8883240	8884240	Who's this?
8884240	8885240	Hey, what's up?
8885240	8886240	This is Kajudo.
8886240	8887240	Hey, what's on your mind, Kajudo?
8887240	8888240	Nothing much.
8888240	8893280	I just want to ask you, can you honestly say that you think Overwatch has legs?
8893280	8894560	I mean, think about it.
8894560	8897200	It doesn't have any private servers, right?
8897200	8898200	Right.
8898200	8902680	Also, you can mod the game because Blizzard won't allow you to mod it.
8902680	8907560	It's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One but we all know that if your first person shooter
8907560	8912480	is in Call of Duty, it's gonna die on those systems because that's what happens to every
8912480	8916240	first person shooter that ends up on those systems and it doesn't have cross-platform
8916240	8920480	play so I think people are gonna get tired of this game really fast.
8920480	8925200	I mean, they're gonna probably have to pop up these new characters and new maps on a
8925200	8927880	week-by-week basis if they want to keep this thing going.
8927880	8933440	90% of everything you just said also applies to Diablo 3, which is still going strong on
8933440	8934440	PC.
8934440	8937040	No, actually not really because Diablo 3 has a single player.
8937040	8941040	One thing I forgot to mention is this is all online.
8941040	8946560	They have that tutorial or whatever in Overwatch or whatever it is and you can play bots but
8946560	8948280	that's still not considered single player to me.
8948320	8950760	I mean, Diablo you can play pretty much by yourself.
8950760	8952760	Have you ever been to Blizzcon?
8952760	8955560	No, I don't go to any of those things.
8955560	8962160	And see, I kind of think you're underestimating in some ways the power of Blizzard.
8962160	8963240	And I'm serious.
8963240	8966980	If you look at some of these people that are playing Overwatch now, it's a lot of the same
8966980	8974040	people that support World of Warcraft and Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone.
8974040	8976040	Why can't I even think of the name of that game at the moment?
8976040	8982760	Anyway, these games have a very, very, very loyal audience and I defer to the fact that
8982760	8987920	those tickets sell out within seconds and that wow being the fact that in my opinion
8987920	8991280	Jamie would disagree but in my opinion World of Warcraft is not the best MMO on the block
8991280	8998720	anymore yet it is still the most popular and by far Blizzard still has legions and legions
8998720	9003320	of fans behind it that are going to play a game like Overwatch simply because it's Blizzard
9003320	9005180	and Blizzard does what?
9005180	9009300	They make games extremely accessible.
9009300	9012540	This is their first person shooter.
9012540	9014260	You're talking about an MMO.
9014260	9017540	You're talking about whatever the heck Diablo is.
9017540	9020180	I don't even know what you can consider that game.
9020180	9026860	This is a totally different ball game for them and I mean when you think about PC players
9026860	9031380	I mean the main reason why Team Fortress 2 is still around and Counter-Strike, the reason
9031380	9035220	why those games are still around is because people have their own servers, they put their
9035220	9038780	mods on there and that's what keeps those types of games running.
9038780	9042460	I can't picture a first person shooter running that long without those things especially
9042460	9043460	on the PC.
9043460	9047420	I mean they could probably get away with it on like a PS4 or Xbox One because they don't
9047420	9050940	do that anyway but no way they can get away with that on a PC.
9050940	9051940	Blizzard.
9051940	9052940	There's just no way.
9052940	9058740	Blizzard also has two other games which is Hearthstone a card game and Heroes of the Storm
9058740	9064700	which is a MOBA game and that is literally all of Blizzard's titles.
9064700	9066620	So far they're batting at 100.
9066620	9069220	But those are still different from a first person shooter.
9069220	9071180	First person shooter is a totally different ball game.
9071180	9076080	I understand that but now Blizzard's throwing their wiener into the first person shooter
9076080	9077700	game and I think it's...
9077700	9079860	And their wiener is going to get chopped off by December.
9079860	9081860	I'm going to ask you one more question.
9081860	9082860	Have you played Overwatch?
9082860	9085140	Yes, I played the beta and I hated it.
9085140	9087240	What did you hate about it?
9087240	9090240	I hated the fact that there wasn't many maps.
9090240	9091240	There wasn't much you can do.
9091240	9094280	There weren't that many game modes.
9094280	9097680	Also another thing that I hated was I love to play like the stealth class and I know
9097680	9100960	they had that ninja guy but he seemed like a waste to me.
9100960	9104880	I mean he basically did pretty much everything that all the other characters did.
9104880	9107160	His weapon, his ninja stars pretty much sucked.
9107160	9108400	I mean you couldn't do much with them.
9108400	9112360	I mean the only character that I had fun with was the other girl that can like create ice
9112360	9113360	walls.
9113360	9114360	I was having fun with that.
9114360	9123040	I mean I lost interest really quickly and I have a couple of friends who also played
9123040	9126760	it and they lost interest and they were like well I might pick it up on the PC just because
9126760	9128760	it's 40 bucks on the PC.
9128760	9132440	But they were like no I'm not getting this on the PS4 because they know the community
9132440	9136480	is going to pretty much die out on the PS4 even though it says again it there.
9136480	9139960	So if you really want to play it your best bet is the PC and I don't know how long it's
9139960	9140960	going to last there.
9140960	9143360	I'm going to leave you with two more thoughts.
9143360	9145760	One at least you played it and I'll give you credit for that.
9145760	9150320	I mean even though yes it was a beta I'll admit not a lot changed from beta to release
9150320	9153360	so I'll give you at least credit that you at least tried it when you're making these
9153360	9154360	statements.
9154360	9157440	And you know sometimes things are not going to be for everybody and that's just the way
9157440	9158600	it's going to be.
9158600	9163160	But B one thing I think that Overwatch will have going for it and we'll see in a year
9163160	9166800	you know I mean who knows maybe it won't be still a thing in a year.
9166800	9171980	But I think one thing that Blizzard is going to show from their track record is that will
9171980	9177060	there be an expansion at some point to Overwatch probably but that'll be a good three to four
9177060	9182220	years down the line and in the meantime the game is going to be supported.
9182220	9185380	And again I'm just going off track record I've got nothing else but you know what's
9185380	9189860	happened with Diablo what's happened with Warcraft and all their other games is that
9189860	9194260	Blizzard is is pretty darn good about doing regular patches and content updates.
9194260	9198220	That is not something that happens in a lot of the console first person shooters today
9198220	9201660	because things like the call of duties and the battlefronts they get a refresh every
9201660	9205700	year even destiny had an expansion that you had to buy after a year.
9205700	9208900	I don't see that happening with Overwatch.
9208900	9213420	I could end up being wrong they might do an expansion in a year but again if track record
9213420	9218820	is anything go off of I think Blizzard is going to support the base game a lot.
9218820	9223220	They're going to take that more Nintendo approach Mario Kart 8 style where they're still supporting
9223220	9226620	it three years down the line but we'll see.
9227060	9233740	One other thing I just want to point out about Overwatch is you were mentioning about them
9233740	9237660	keeping up with updates and all that type of stuff they're going to have to ease up
9237660	9240260	with their with their ban hammer.
9240260	9243100	So far they've been ban hammering people for the right reasons I mean they have people
9243100	9248580	cheating you don't want to cheat online you know like I never condone that but Blizzard
9248580	9252640	is really known for just like I don't know we're banning somebody who did they weren't
9252640	9256140	cheating or they might have did something that I don't know appeared to be cheating
9256180	9261420	and they're really quick to ban somebody so if they want this game to stay alive chill
9261420	9265340	out with the ban hammer and make sure that you know someone's cheating before you ban
9265340	9266340	them.
9266340	9267340	Yeah.
9267340	9271020	All right well thank you for your input I appreciate it.
9271020	9274420	Have a good day Judo.
9274420	9275980	See ya.
9275980	9280300	Okay so there you go the show where every gamer has a voice you know what I know some
9280300	9286900	of you guys in chat or you know but not every game is for everybody and some people aren't
9286900	9290340	going to necessarily like a particular game I know there's been very popular video games
9290340	9295100	that I don't always necessarily like in fact I wasn't sure I was going to like Overwatch
9295100	9299380	you guys might remember and I've been critical of some elements of Overwatch that there's
9299380	9304820	no single player mode in this other stuff and I'm still I'm still kinda wishing it was
9304820	9310700	there but so far in my experiences with Overwatch I've had a lot of fun and I suppose at the
9310700	9314880	end of the day that is what it's all about but I get it is a valid concern will I still
9314880	9320660	be having fun in December but I'm just really hoping with Blizzard's track record I do so
9320660	9326340	anyway 1-877-GAMO-LR username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word if you want to give
9326340	9327580	us a call.
9327580	9331780	Tigerclaw in chat says you know Blizzard fans are pretty hardcore and the Warcraft movie
9331780	9336100	comes out in five days if the fans don't end up liking that movie you know Blizzard
9336100	9341620	is going to face a lot of heat because Blizzard was involved in the making of that movie.
9341620	9346340	Yeah I bet the gals from Girls Gone Wow I saw them posting on Facebook that they were
9346340	9350220	going to go see it so I'm almost positive if they taped a new show today which they
9350220	9353440	probably did I'm pretty sure we'll hear about that because remember in the UK the movie's
9353440	9358220	already out so I'm sure we'll hear about that come Wednesday when their show airs here on
9358220	9363180	the voice of geeks network but bummer because the time difference but I would love to pick
9363180	9366660	their brain a little bit about this whole Overwatch thing I'm curious if they have jumped
9366660	9372380	in and tried it at length or what have you because that would be a great example of you
9372380	9376340	know players that don't necessarily play a lot of other games are they coming over to
9376340	9379220	this simply because Blizzard's name is on it.
9379220	9385100	Alright one last call for calls 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype orange lounge radio
9385100	9390520	all one word checking in one more time for last minute stories if you have any no running
9390520	9397660	out alright just a quick teaser for next week while we give it just a few more seconds here
9397660	9402500	to see if any other calls come in I do want to mention again next week's show for you
9402500	9407700	podcast folk it'll be a little bit shorter that's because live we're going to be experiencing
9407700	9414500	the Blizzard the Bethesda press conference live essentially so we'll be taking an extended
9414500	9420260	break next week while we all listen in on the Bethesda press conference and then we'll
9420260	9424420	come back and give our immediate reactions to what's going on and so forth we'll also
9424420	9430780	be talking about EA and we're going to have plenty of other predictions as well and then
9430780	9437660	after E3 is all said and done the weekend after what we have June 18th and 19th so what
9437660	9442600	the 19th I think is that show we're going to be joined in studio here by Misty long
9442600	9449000	time OLR fan going to be here on June 19th that's her second or third trip on the show
9449000	9455520	so she'll be here on that day joining us for some E3 reactions and follow-ups and then
9455520	9459200	we're going to go I mean this is a big month because we roll right from June 19th into
9459200	9468280	the next show June 26th with it which is a double event it is my birthday my actual birthday
9468280	9476760	is June 26th and the 14th anniversary of OLR our 14th anniversary episode holy goodness is
9476760	9482840	on the 26th of June so we have a pretty full month this month 14 years we've been doing this

9526720	9531240	years which I don't see why we wouldn't at this point but you know you never know but if we can
9531240	9538540	get to 15 years I think it's just high time we just put the money in rent a space so rent a
9538540	9544680	ballroom at a motel somewhere around here and just say if you want to be there live just be here we
9544680	9550040	move our show for the night to a live space and just invite any fucking person that wants to cut
9550040	9554640	well within reason we don't want like you know trolls showing up but you know maybe they have
9554640	9559480	to maybe have to answer a few simple questions about OLR to get through the door but we'll invite
9559480	9565160	whoever to show up and we're just gonna have a big fucking party for our quesadilla it'll it'll
