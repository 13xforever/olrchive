7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, the least surprising intro you hear all year, E3 is here, and by some accounts, it's already begun. One keynote is already complete and there's six more to go. Join us as the news continues to be made even in the middle of the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 645 for this June the 12th of 2016.
45000	57000	It is E3 week and we are going to get into things here pretty shortly. Of course, we are the show about all things gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle and all that, live at the Voice Geeks Network, vog and network.com.
57000	69000	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie. Joining me by my side, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69000	70000	Hello, hello.
70000	71000	Hi.
71000	73000	And also over there, Techmaster Loki.
73000	74000	Hello.
74000	92000	Alright, we are going to get into E3 here shortly, but I really need to say something here at the top of the show. And it isn't quite gaming related, but I have to acknowledge and just pour my heart out a little bit for the senseless tragedy that happened in Orlando.
92000	104000	And it's just like, I'm at this point where it's like I don't even have like the words for a radio guy to end up speechless is really something, but I mean this really just affects us all.
104000	120000	And not just the fact that like, you know, I'm a gay guy and we sometimes joke in our community that there's this whole like six degrees of separation in our community, so I feel like, you know, what happened in Orlando, yes it's on the other side of the country, but I feel touched by it as well.
120000	131000	And, you know, it's interesting, I got a very sweet message from a listener on Twitter earlier today that's across the pond and was saying that, you know, hey, I know this is really like nowhere near you, but I'm still like thinking of you.
131000	145000	And I replied back, I said, you really never know how these things can affect people because I'll tell you guys, one of our frequent contributors here at VOG Network, Shane from the Ranger Pride cast, is actually in Orlando right now.
145000	168000	Now he's nowhere, he was nowhere near this, thank God. But I, you know, the first thing I thought when I heard this this morning was that, oh my god, I gotta, I gotta text Shane to make sure. I mean, he's not really the type to go out to these clubs and stuff, but I was still concerned so you know and, and just to hear all this tragedy that has happened is just, I, I don't even know what to say anymore.
168000	180000	Like it's just, I feel like every week there's something horrible that we're talking about and the kind of tie this together to why I want to bring this up as we're about to get into one of our biggest shows of the year on E3.
180000	190000	Inevitably somebody's going to want to tie this over to video games and I just, I, it's, I think you guys all know and I know, you know, it's not the video games.
190000	209000	And why do we continue to do a show like this in the face of all this tragedy and what's going on is, is that I can tell you guys being a gay kid growing up and getting picked on and getting taunted verbally by bullies and sometimes physically and all this stuff
209000	223000	and being threatened and all that stuff. Sometimes video games were very much my escape and my place to go to kind of, I don't want to necessarily say shut out the real world but to kind of like turn away from all that reality.
223000	236000	So I in some ways today when I heard about what was going on in Orlando, I acknowledged it, I got very angry about it but then I had to do something to take my mind off it and that was to go play a video game.
236000	252000	So anyway, I know that was a lot of verbal blah blah blah but I just I really want to get that off my chest that I'm just, I'm so angry and just upset and my heart goes out to all of those affected because like I mentioned before, you know,
252000	266000	and we joke about it in gay culture but it's a part of human culture. We're six degrees separated from these people one way or another. Those were people's children, those were people's uncles, brothers, sisters, and so on.
266000	283000	You know that we're affected by this and I just hope to hell. This country finally, I'm not going to get too political I promise but this country finally does something, something, anything to turn this around and stop this from happening.
284000	288000	Alright, anything you want to add real quick before I shift gears?
288000	308000	Just a fun tweet that I read to you earlier that Canada has had eight mass shootings ever. We've had seven since Monday. We keep having the discussion go around the rhetoric keeps circulating, but no one does anything.
308000	319000	Number one, vote people in who will do something. And number two, don't vote for people who pat themselves on the back congratulatory after 50 people are dead. Just saying.
319000	326000	And Americans, vote. Just vote. Like, I, it's such a huge party.
326000	329000	No one in this country has an excuse not to vote.
329000	331000	For real, because there's other countries.
331000	335000	You can vote from home. It should be mandatory.
335000	354000	There's other people listening in other countries that are probably like, man, I wish I could vote in my country. So anyway, again, I don't want to get too political I do want to say the chat room hello hi live.vognetwork.com and break man in our chat says, every one of us should be angry, gay, straight, bi, pan, everyone should be angry at this.
354000	373000	And I agree. Anyway, like I said, video games, that's how sometimes we escape the fuckery of the real world and so forth. So here we are. Biggest week of the year as far as video games go and a lot to take your mind off today of what's going on, EA starting things off with their press conference, our show going to be
373000	402000	even like earlier this week, it's just been like, well, but there's been announcements. So it's not necessarily league. That's true. It's kind of the I don't want to say the B roll stuff because some of this stuff feels very like I'm very B rolls is kind of like, hey, we've want to have something out before everybody went in to jump the gun a little bit. I think like we got to get the press now before we get drowned in all this other press and so forth. So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. Again, I mentioned this for a few weeks now, but we are going to be cut short tonight, the Bethesda press conference.
402000	431000	starts at seven o'clock Pacific. It's about 618 Pacific right now. We will be stopping the show right at seven taking an extended break tonight because I just I know we're not gonna be able to compete with that. But you can participate if you do want to get some feedback and chat with other folks live.vog network.com. I promise you it will be more exciting than the twitch chat that Bethesda will have. And much more filtered and so on. So you can check that out. We will be watching that live as well. And then we'll come back and we'll all kind of talk about it.
432000	442000	But for you, podcast folks, when you're used to hearing a three hour show, you're probably gonna get one tonight. That's only like an hour and a half or two hours just because I don't I don't know how long but that do we know if it has to 60 or 90 minutes?
442000	461000	Don't know, we don't know. So we're having to play tonight show a little bit by ear. For that reason, certain segments and things you're used to hearing on the show are not going to be here tonight. Fugal question of the week, rapid fire news, we're going to roll that over to next week. But for now, let's talk about EA's press conference because EA was the first to go today. This is the earliest I think I've ever seen a press conference.
461000	480000	Go during E3 week is that we had a press conference at 1pm today. Pacific time and that was EA talking about what they showed Dark Sakura. I'm gonna go a little out of order here just because I know people want to know Dark Sakura. What'd you think of Mass Effect Andromeda?
480000	487000	Pretty. And there's a lady. So happy.
487000	501000	Yeah, I mean, I have to admit I was a little bit frustrated when they said we're going to tell you more this fall. But here's a behind the scenes look and I already just kind of knew like get set the bar low. I honestly thought they were going to have the game at their EA play event.
502000	509000	Now the question is, do you really think it's coming out in spring of 2017? I don't think it's coming out in spring 2017.
509000	524000	If they're not showing it now, then I have concerns. Now, could EA be withholding for a Microsoft or Sony press conference? I don't think they would have said this fall if that was the case. I think they would have said soon or later.
524000	533000	What exactly is this fall that they would be showing them? And that's my curiosity is that you've also got this big white elephant in the room about the Nintendo NX. So when are they going to show the Nintendo NX?
533000	543000	White elephant is a type of gift exchange. Oh, sorry, pink elephant. Pink elephant is when you're drunk. It's just an elephant. It is a smelly elephant. You are mixing your metaphors.
543000	553000	It is a smelly elephant that won't stop pooping. It is a brown elephant that will not stop leaving gifts behind. I like the brown elephant.
553000	568000	The big brown elephant in the room is, what is happening in the fall? I mean, because we got the Nintendo NX thing too, right? So, and we don't know. I mean, the assumption is they're going to do it with Tokyo Game Show, though Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, so they'll bring back their thing.
568000	582000	It could be just, there's a lot of stuff like they're focusing on fourth quarter right now, and maybe that's why they're not really trying to hype up Mass Effect at this time. Because I mean, they've got like a lot of big properties that they're trying to get everybody incentivized to purchase right now.
582000	589000	And Mass Effect is probably just later. It's outside of the window that like the other titles that they were showing off were this year.
590000	604000	I am actually also surprised they didn't show Mirror's Edge. I realize the game just came out, but you've got like, what, a quarter million gamers watching a feed right now. Show us the deals. Remind us that it's in store. I was really surprised they didn't take that opportunity.
604000	612000	Yeah, I don't think they need to do that. Although, if they would have cut out half the banter that they had, they could have had time for another trailer.
613000	618000	Let's run down the list here of what they announced. Titanfall 2, and the big deal there, it's a single player mode.
618000	620000	Well, it's got single player as well.
620000	621000	Oh yeah, it has one.
621000	630000	Last time it was just like, well, it's a multiplayer game. It's a multiplayer only game, and then you can play it solo, and that's your single player campaign.
630000	641000	But this actually has a single player campaign. The new thing is they've got this grappling hook thing that's going to be pretty cool, so you can use the grappling hook to kind of tether yourself to a Titan.
641000	645000	And really, any game that adds a grappling hook is usually better, so that's always a good sign.
645000	655000	And then of course, the multiplayer looks pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean, overall, I am not sure how excited I am about the single player campaign, but it looks nice.
655000	667000	Yeah, it looked gorgeous, and I also caught that grappling hook thing. And you know, I'm not huge on shooters, but with as much as I'm now playing Overwatch, I'm kind of going like, oh, maybe I should try to do some more shooting.
667000	673000	It was fun, and in the last game, they had classes that were kind of catered more towards people that aren't necessarily into shooters.
673000	677000	Like, they had a gun that would auto-target type things, so it was, you know.
677000	678000	That's true. I remember that.
678000	683000	A little bit more, you can kind of play it however you want, and I mean, I don't know. It was alright.
683000	688000	Plus, you can rack up kills on the AI characters that are there, so that kind of helps out as well.
688000	693000	Right. Next up, they showed Madden 17, which, you know, here's the thing, guys.
693000	700000	I know a lot of us are, like, rolling our eyes at, like, the sports thing, but you've got to realize these games are, it may not be the crowd that was listening to this show.
700000	703000	Madden's going to be dead, and they'll still be Madden games.
703000	708000	These games, don't say that. This has been a very cruel year of dark soccer.
708000	711000	Okay, I don't...
711000	717000	But no, I know what you mean. I know what you mean. They will, those games will sell until the end of time.
717000	722000	But that's the point, is that, you know, as much as we all kind of, like, roll our eyes at, oh, here's the Madden game.
722000	724000	It's like, okay, you can't deny these games fucking sell.
724000	727000	Yeah, they're good, but, Mike, I didn't understand what they were trying to push with this.
727000	738000	Like, the whole thing was, we're doing more organized events with Madden 17, and I just was kind of rolling my eyes and scratching my head, like, how's this going to incentivize someone to purchase the game?
738000	743000	I understand, yeah, it's competitive, and that you're doing all these events, and that there's this prize pool, but who cares?
743000	752000	Is it the whole, if you can spend $60 on our game and then get good like these guys we're going to show a little spotlight of, then you too can win a million dollars.
752000	753000	No, you're not.
753000	755000	I kind of got that. I'm like, no, you're not.
755000	756000	No, you're not. These people...
756000	759000	I got that vibe, like, that's the reason why they might show it.
759000	765000	People think it's kind of weird that I sit at home and play Madden all the time to get really good at this, and yeah, I don't know.
765000	774000	Yeah, people think that about a lot of people that sit at home, do something for a long period of time as well, but that's the thing, is these people have that much more time ahead of you on this.
774000	777000	You're not going to all of a sudden catch up to them.
777000	785000	Yeah. I mean, the game looked gorgeous, but I, you know, and I can recognize, like, wow, that's a pretty game, and if I was into football, I'd be really into this.
785000	787000	But, you know, I'm just...
787000	788000	Yeah.
788000	789000	It is what it is.
789000	800000	I don't really know, I mean, because we're going to get into it in just a second here, but I don't really know what they would need to do to a sports game to make me interested in it, because adding more, you know, curated events, that's not doing it for me.
800000	803000	Adding a story mode, that's not doing it for me either.
803000	804000	All right, well, let's get to that.
804000	807000	So, we already talked a little bit about Mass Effect Andromeda.
807000	823000	I just wanted to say, I did think it was gorgeous, and, you know, interesting little glimpses of some characters, but I think there's a lot of assumption that that last female character that does the narration at the end is the quote-unquote new femshep, but hold on.
823000	826000	I mean, it could be, but not necessarily.
826000	831000	It could be a character akin to a Caden and Ashley type of support character.
831000	841000	So, we don't know, but it was nice to at least see even five frames of some new aliens and kind of get a sense of, you know, okay, this is going to be...
841000	845000	This is definitely a series that's going to try to differentiate itself from the main trilogy.
845000	852000	So, I look forward to whenever they're going to finally share more about it, because I just wanted to know, like, is there going to be the multiplayer again?
852000	857000	Are they going to squeeze that in there? Is it going to be as fun as it was in Mass Effect 3?
857000	859000	Yes, they will, because they can add microtransactions.
859000	860000	I guess that's true.
860000	863000	All right, then they talked a little bit about the EA Play charity.
863000	872000	I don't know how much that discussion you caught, but they kind of talked about that there was, like, meta-achievements in the games, and they were going to donate money based on the achievements that people were getting in the games.
872000	882000	And I thought it was a nice gesture. I thought it was cool. And I think this is something that a lot of people have been calling on is just, you know, throw diversity a frickin' bone.
882000	885000	And so, I kind of think EA stepped up to the plate with that.
885000	892000	And they were very supportive of these charities that support getting more women into the industry, getting more diverse voices, you know.
892000	896000	And I think some of those coding charities are also about, like, I think...
897000	902000	Sorry, I don't have all my charities memorized, but I think some of them are about getting, like, kids involved in instruction in school, too.
902000	906000	So that's cool. I mean, I can't sit here and go, you know,
906000	912000	Oh, God, EA, what a bore. I can't be cynical about that. Like, that's cool that they're, you know, gonna...
912000	914000	Gaming for good is always exciting.
916000	920000	Okay, and then I think the game you were referencing a minute ago, Loki, FIFA 17, right?
920000	924000	Yeah, FIFA 17. And they had, like, a bunch of new modes in there and enhancements and stuff.
924000	928000	But the big thing they were showing was, like, the story mode, which the other games have done that before.
928000	932000	Like, the NBA 2K series sort of does that, but it's not all dramatic like that.
932000	937000	The problem that bothered me about it is they drag it out so long during the conference.
937000	940000	Like, this dude comes out and he's like,
940000	945000	You don't know who I am, but I'm, you know, I'm this person and you're gonna know my name.
945000	947000	I'm like, I don't fucking care who the hell you are.
947000	949000	It was a little melodramatic. I was like,
949000	956000	Well, here's the thing. Okay, all that being said, though, I have to admit, I'm not super into sports games.
956000	960000	I'm not super into FIFA. But when they were showing that trailer, I was like,
960000	965000	This is kind of, like, I'm kind of living for this. Like, this is some, like,
965000	974000	Empire level of Dallas of the, what do you call that? The real, like, melodrama type of stuff.
974000	977000	You know what I mean? The melodramatic type of, like, over the top drama.
977000	981000	That's, like, in those shows. I was kind of, like, seeing a little bit in that trailer and I was like,
981000	986000	I can kind of go for this. I'm digging this. So, yeah, I was-
986000	990000	I just didn't get it. You know, being a person that I'm not, like, into sports games,
990000	993000	it's not getting me into sports games. And that's the thing. It's like, I don't know,
993000	998000	like, these games that are coming out now, like, the Madden with the, you know,
998000	1004000	the additional competitions and stuff that are gonna be curated by EA and stuff.
1004000	1011000	And then this FIFA with the story mode and stuff. How is that generating more of an audience for your game?
1011000	1014000	Because, like, the people that are fans of the game are gonna be buying the game anyways.
1014000	1018000	I just don't think this is gonna be like, Oh, you know what? I wanted a story mode.
1018000	1023000	That was the last thing I was waiting for. You know, like, hey, I really wish there was more Madden competitions
1023000	1027000	because that was really the only thing, you know, my barrier of entry to that series.
1027000	1033000	To be honest, though, I did go from, and no one curr, to, well, maybe I'd red box it.
1033000	1038000	Which is a step up. I gotta admit. But, you know, you have a lot of chatters saying right now, you know,
1038000	1044000	obviously FIFA is their biggest game. There's a very intentional reason why they did that from Europe.
1044000	1049000	Which also, I think, explains- because, you know, when they said the press conference was gonna be at 1 o'clock,
1049000	1053000	I think a lot of us were like, that seems really early. Well, they timed that so that it would be 9 o'clock in the UK.
1053000	1059000	So they- there was some intent there that they definitely were doing a press conference that overseas could see as well,
1059000	1064000	which is way more into soccer. But yeah, when they started bringing out the, um, the co- I think-
1064000	1070000	I don't even know who they are. Sorry, the coach? Coaches? Managers? Managers, yeah. The teams?
1070000	1075000	I, you know, I have to admit, I kind of glazed over, like, I literally have no idea who these people are.
1075000	1079000	But I guess people are gonna be really excited to see them in the game if you're into soccer.
1079000	1084000	So, but I have friends here who are, like, that go to the SAC Republic FC stuff all the time.
1084000	1090000	So, eh, they might be into this. But, you know, again, it's gonna sell like crazy no matter what.
1090000	1096000	Um, okay, so, so none of that stuff that I- well, the EA play was a pleasant surprise, but otherwise,
1096000	1100000	nothing I've mentioned was a surprise. All that stuff we expected.
1100000	1106000	Uh, so the first thing that really caught our eye as something new is when they came out and talked about EA Originals,
1106000	1115000	and they kind of showcased a game called Fee, which, um, looked a little to me like Journey meets Ori and the Blind Forest type of thing.
1115000	1124000	Like, there was- there was the art- the art going into it. Um, I mean, but we didn't really get to see a whole lot of what the raw gameplay looks like.
1124000	1129000	I mean, we just kind of got some bits and pieces, but it definitely looks like EA wants to push, like,
1129000	1137000	we're not just these big sports- you know, EA- EA's gotten a bad rap in the past, and so I kind of feel like,
1137000	1142000	okay, they are trying to listen to this a little bit, they're trying to help with the diversity initiative and all this stuff,
1142000	1147000	and they've always been very supportive of GLBT and all this stuff, you know, they're right there marching the pride parade and all that.
1147000	1154000	Um, and now they're kind of talking about we want to support these, we're not some big evil studio,
1154000	1162000	we want to support these low growing things and nurture them, uh, on their first game to success.
1162000	1167000	I did like that they said, basically, that they're not taking any sort of the pro- like, there's no profit sharing with it,
1167000	1173000	so any of the games that they do choose for that, it's basically, they're just giving them some money to get, you know, elevated,
1173000	1182000	and then that's it, it's EA, you know, and they're gonna publish it, but nothing's gonna be taken from the publisher- or the, uh, developer, which is kind of nice.
1182000	1188000	So that's kind of neat, so, um, I- that was the first part, I was like, okay, this is cool, like, this is something new, I'm into this,
1188000	1195000	I was surprised they only showed one, because I kind of thought this EA Originals was gonna be a multitude of games,
1195000	1200000	but they only showed this one for whatever reason, maybe this is the only one that's ready to go, I'm not sure.
1200000	1208000	Um, okay, so after the EA Originals was the Star Wars stuff, which, it was cool to see Sacramento, did you see that?
1208000	1209000	Yeah, I saw Sacramento.
1209000	1210000	Capital Games, shout out.
1210000	1211000	I saw that, I was like, woo, Capital Games!
1211000	1215000	I knew they did mobile stuff down there, I did not realize it was Star Wars they were working on.
1215000	1217000	Yeah, they're, they're, um...
1217000	1222000	I, I honestly thought they did the Dragon Age game that Jamie always talks about, I thought that was them.
1222000	1228000	They may have, I don't remember, but, yeah, they're, um, BioWare Mobile?
1228000	1233000	Well, yeah, at one point they were a BioWare, they were BioWare Sacramento, and then they changed to Capital Games, or just EA,
1233000	1236000	and so they're doing Star Wars, but anyway, I mean...
1236000	1237000	That's still huge, I mean, yeah.
1237000	1245000	Oh yeah, for sure, but to be fair, in that whole clip, I'mma be real, the, the greater clip that showed everything, besides the hometown shoutout,
1245000	1247000	I was kinda like, this is a whole lot of nothing.
1247000	1252000	The Visceral Games one looks pretty awesome, like what they, the very, like, two seconds that they showed of it looks pretty sweet.
1252000	1256000	And that was, that was, uh, Lando we saw in Battlefront, right?
1256000	1257000	That was Battlefront, yeah.
1257000	1259000	That's like the one thing I was like, oh cool, and then...
1259000	1264000	But no, the Visceral one looks pretty awesome, that's gonna be that third person action game stuff, but...
1265000	1271000	Did it, was it me, or did, like, Jade seem very, like, fake, excited about it?
1271000	1274000	It's just like, it's just like, off, somehow.
1274000	1278000	It's, it's nerves, because the guy that was demonstrating F.E.A. was also very, very, very nervous, I'm sure.
1278000	1283000	Well, that guy could understand, because you're like an indie developer, almost, and you're like in a press conference for EA, he's like, uhhh...
1283000	1288000	You know what, not everybody, just because you're good at managing games doesn't mean you're necessarily good at speaking in front of a crowd.
1288000	1298000	So, and, um, I think with good reason, there's a lot of pressure to make sure we have women on the stage and diversity on the stage.
1298000	1302000	So I think whether she really wanted to be up there or not, she probably needed to be.
1302000	1313000	So, um, maybe it was nerves. I didn't, I didn't get that same, I mean, I kind of just, the only problem I had with it is that it was a whole lot of nothing.
1313000	1321000	I kind of more got the impression she was just selling a whole lot of, stay tight, like, that's all I really got from her.
1321000	1323000	Yeah.
1323000	1325000	And the package in general, so.
1325000	1332000	And I think it's still stupid that they're making another Battlefront game after this last one came out and had, like, hardly any content.
1332000	1336000	And they're like, eh, it's gonna have the content from the new movie. It's like, yeah, that's awesome.
1336000	1340000	I think the people that bought the original Battlefront would probably like that content as well.
1340000	1341000	Yeah.
1341000	1344000	I think, oh no, fuck them. They're gonna have to buy a new game.
1344000	1354000	And then lastly, Battlefield 1, which looked really pretty, but again, a lot of, not my kind of thing, but Loki, this is your kind of thing. What did you think?
1354000	1364000	I thought it looks really cool. And I actually watched after the thing was over, they had, like, a live stream of their, the first multiplayer gameplay from it.
1364000	1370000	So they had a bunch of celebrities and, like, other, you know, players playing. It was 32 on 32.
1370000	1371000	Oh, okay. That's cool.
1371000	1376000	So they had this, they were filling it in. It wasn't just all celebrities. It was, like, half of, like, esports guys and YouTubers.
1376000	1379000	And they were half, you know, Twitch streamers and the other half was, like, celebrities.
1379000	1381000	When they showed Zac Efron, did he not want to be there?
1381000	1385000	Oh, God. He was, like, not excited at all. And then, like, same.
1385000	1390000	But I heard some people that were watching the feeds saw Snoop Dogg and he looked really into it.
1390000	1392000	Yeah, he's, like, totally into it.
1392000	1395000	Snoop Dogg's a hella gamer, though. He's talked about it.
1395000	1400000	And Terry Crews is awesome. I mean, Terry Crews is just, he's just a hilarious guy.
1400000	1404000	But, like, he was just, like, getting all into it and shit. And so, it looked awesome.
1404000	1409000	And, like, everything that they were talking about, like, the destruction and everything being very dynamic was in there.
1409000	1413000	And they kind of showed off, you know, one of the blimps coming down and everything.
1413000	1417000	It looks awesome. It looks pretty cool. I definitely want to check it out when it comes out.
1417000	1420000	I'm not really into the modern Battlefield games too much.
1420000	1423000	But I'm willing to check this out because it looks pretty, it looks nice.
1423000	1426000	It looks different and it'd be kind of fun to try it out.
1426000	1430000	So, last overall thoughts of EA's press conference.
1430000	1433000	Dark Soccer, I don't think, you only really saw the part you wanted to see.
1433000	1436000	But do you have any, you've listened to us kind of banter a little bit. Anything?
1436000	1438000	I've been getting my hair done.
1438000	1440000	Priorities.
1440000	1442000	Well, I already had this scheduled.
1442000	1443000	Her hair looks gorgeous, by the way.
1443000	1445000	Yeah, because Monet rocks.
1445000	1450000	But based on what we heard and any thoughts on the thing as a whole?
1450000	1451000	Mass Effect.
1451000	1452000	Loki?
1452000	1458000	Honestly, as I was agreeing with somebody on Twitter, I can't remember who said it.
1458000	1460000	They gave the conference a D+.
1460000	1463000	I think that's kind of where I'm at with it. It was very average and ho-hum.
1463000	1467000	There was nothing really, the gameplay for Battlefield was kind of nice.
1467000	1469000	But it was, we already kind of had a trailer of that.
1469000	1473000	It was just kind of nice to see it actually confirm that, yeah, it does sort of look like that.
1473000	1476000	But overall, there was nothing really surprising.
1476000	1480000	There wasn't anything like, ooh, any real big exciting announcements.
1480000	1482000	It was just kind of, eh.
1482000	1486000	Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at, is that it was very, very par for me.
1486000	1492000	And maybe because they're out the gate first, maybe there's something they have to kind of keep under wraps for the Sony or Microsoft.
1492000	1494000	That is true. There could be something.
1494000	1497000	And usually they go after, so there could be something going on there.
1497000	1500000	We won't know until after Monday.
1500000	1502000	But I would say it's almost below par for me.
1502000	1506000	I would say a more like C- for me, which isn't really far off from what you gave it.
1506000	1513000	Because just the fact that, you know, they were out there talking Star Wars, but didn't really give us a lot.
1513000	1516000	They were out there talking Mass Effect, but really didn't give us a lot.
1516000	1518000	I'm surprised they didn't mention anything Maxis.
1518000	1521000	I mean, I granted, or even PopCap.
1521000	1522000	PopCap was completely missing too.
1522000	1524000	Yeah, no PopCap, no Maxis.
1524000	1527000	Well, didn't they close Maxis?
1527000	1530000	Yeah, okay. But I mean, there's somebody making Sims games, I would assume.
1530000	1531000	True.
1531000	1535000	They're still going to carry on the franchise, and there's nothing PopCap related at all.
1535000	1537000	That's true. The Sims was completely missing.
1537000	1541000	Which is a bit of a, you know, I don't know if we're right around the corner from The Sims 5.
1541000	1544000	But I am kind of surprised there's kind of nothing in that franchise, you're right.
1544000	1548000	So, okay. Well, that is our thoughts on EA.
1548000	1552000	And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1552000	1555000	Lots of different comments in chat.
1555000	1558000	Let's see, talking about Snoop Dogg being into video games.
1558000	1561000	Act F says Snoop Dogg is fo-shizzle into video games.
1561000	1564000	I think that they were showing, and someone had mentioned this.
1564000	1571000	I don't know, I'm not one to identify drugs, but I think that they said that he was smoking a blunt while playing the game.
1571000	1572000	Cut!
1572000	1575000	They actually had video of that happening, too.
1575000	1577000	He is smoking something, let's put it that way.
1577000	1579000	He's got a card, you know he has a card, Wink.
1579000	1581000	He does, but it's awesome.
1581000	1586000	He's got stress or, you know, back pain or something.
1586000	1588000	Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1589000	1592000	I'm not into multiplayer, this is about Battlefield, but it was pretty damn cool.
1592000	1594000	A lot of shit going on at once.
1594000	1598000	That's the thing, even though I'm not into multiplayer because I know they get my ass handed to me pretty quickly,
1598000	1603000	but the single player campaign looks pretty awesome, too, from the cinematics and stuff that they're showing.
1603000	1605000	VidPower talking about Jade Raymond saying,
1605000	1608000	Haven't seen Jade Raymond in the spotlight for five years, good for her.
1608000	1612000	That's a good point, is that she hasn't done this in a while, so maybe that's why, you know.
1612000	1615000	I cut the executives a little slack.
1615000	1618000	Not everybody is born to get up in front of all the people.
1618000	1621000	That's why Reggie Fils-Aime is a great face for Nintendo.
1621000	1626000	And no, I'm not afraid of multiplayer, I just know my level of gameplay in multiplayer.
1626000	1628000	One more comment here, then we'll move on.
1628000	1632000	Kaijuto says, The reason why so many Star Wars games suck is because the devs try to be storytellers,
1632000	1634000	and they forget about making a fun game.
1634000	1637000	Leave the story to the movies.
1637000	1639000	Let's get into our gaming weeks quickly.
1639000	1642000	We're going to run through this quickly. How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
1642000	1645000	I played World of Warcraft.
1645000	1646000	How's that been going?
1646000	1652000	It's been really fun. I think the thing that I like the best about doing my quests there,
1652000	1657000	is that I don't have to freaking go all over the world to do the quests I'm doing.
1657000	1660000	I can stay in a particular area and get them done.
1660000	1664000	And so it's felt a lot more streamlined and less disjointed,
1664000	1669000	and there hasn't been that particular level gap between being able to do things,
1670000	1676000	where I'd just have to grind until I was at a level that I could do the next level,
1676000	1678000	and not have to be locked for it.
1678000	1681000	So it's been pretty awesome that way.
1681000	1684000	And I'm having a good time. I'm having a really good time.
1684000	1686000	I just miss everybody who used to play.
1686000	1688000	You're playing with the Game Boy guys though, right?
1688000	1689000	The Game Boy.org guys?
1689000	1692000	I sometimes see Jon sometimes.
1692000	1694000	Okay, when they're on. Fair enough.
1694000	1698000	Yeah, I just wish everybody was back, then it would be more fun like it used to be.
1699000	1701000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1701000	1703000	Just the other usuals.
1703000	1704000	Loki.
1704000	1706000	I really didn't play that much this week,
1706000	1711000	because I've been still very exhausted after work and kids and all that.
1711000	1716000	So really the only thing I've been playing is just mobile games, which is weird.
1716000	1721000	Still playing Ingress just the minimal amount so that I can keep my Sojourner thing going,
1721000	1726000	until it finally platinums out or whatever, and then I don't have to play it anymore.
1726000	1729000	And then I've been playing Pokemon GO quite a bit.
1729000	1733000	I'm up to about two-thirds of the way to level seven.
1733000	1734000	So I've been playing that.
1734000	1740000	And that's just mainly because I've had to go to a lot of parks and stuff with kids,
1740000	1741000	and it's a good way to kill time.
1741000	1743000	Plus at home you can still play it at home,
1743000	1746000	because you can put the incense thing on you,
1746000	1749000	the track the Pokemon to you and double the XP with the Lucky Egg.
1749000	1755000	And then that way you can just sit on the couch and play it occasionally when they come up to you and stuff.
1755000	1758000	So it's just a good time waster, I guess.
1758000	1759000	It's all right.
1759000	1760000	It's still very buggy, though.
1760000	1763000	I complain about it all the time with people.
1763000	1766000	Yeah, I wish I'd played something more significant, but I've just been so damn tired.
1766000	1770000	And then in the time that I have been awake, I've been trying to work on my game,
1770000	1776000	which I'm not getting very much progress there because I do end up falling asleep while I'm working on it.
1776000	1777000	My Gaming Week.
1777000	1781000	I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV, which got a patch this week, the 3-3 patch,
1781000	1783000	so an expansion on the story.
1783000	1786000	I'll keep it spoiler-free, but very, very epic.
1786000	1790000	Although the content this time is pretty unforgiving.
1790000	1792000	We tried to do the new trial.
1792000	1797000	There's a brand new eight-person fight in it, and it's hard.
1797000	1800000	We tried to do it, like five of us and a few pickup people, and we couldn't beat it.
1800000	1803000	We got it down to 2%, still couldn't beat it.
1803000	1805000	Which I don't think all the content needs to be gimme.
1805000	1808000	I think you do have to bang your head on the wall a little bit,
1808000	1812000	but I was a little surprised because that's a big step up in difficulty for Final Fantasy.
1812000	1815000	But we'll get there, I know it, and it'll feel real good when we do beat it, finally.
1815000	1819000	But seriously, the story, phenomenal.
1819000	1822000	One of the better Final Fantasy games in the series, it really is.
1822000	1826000	And also been playing Overwatch.
1826000	1828000	Still been kind of going with that.
1828000	1831000	And Alan's been super getting into Overwatch now, too.
1831000	1833000	In fact, he is double my level and then some.
1833000	1835000	So we play once in a while.
1835000	1838000	Sometimes he plays a lot right before I go to bed,
1838000	1840000	and I don't always want to binge game right before bed,
1840000	1843000	but we've been able to pop on, and there'll be some people that'll be on,
1843000	1845000	and we'll kind of do some matches here and there.
1845000	1848000	But I am enjoying Overwatch still.
1848000	1851000	Just a lot of fun, and there's still some characters I want to play.
1851000	1854000	And I got myself, or I should say Alan bought me,
1854000	1856000	because he was buying another pop figure,
1856000	1859000	but he got me the Winston doll, the pop figure doll.
1859000	1862000	It's big, because it's Winston. I like it, it's cute.
1862000	1865000	That was pretty much it for my Gimme Week, though.
1865000	1867000	So just some quick housekeeping.
1867000	1871000	We will be back with a full show next week to wrap up E3.
1871000	1874000	I do believe a longtime OLR listener and fan,
1874000	1877000	Misty, is going to be here in the studio to help us recap E3
1877000	1879000	and run down all that.
1879000	1883000	And then in two weeks, our 14th birthday here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1883000	1886000	The 14th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio
1886000	1889000	will be the same day as my actual birthday, June the 26th.
1889000	1891000	How about that?
1891000	1894000	All right, so let's try to do some news here.
1894000	1896000	We're going to do just one or two, maybe three stories,
1896000	1898000	and then we're going to get to the Classic Game of the Week
1898000	1900000	and make our way to the next press conference.
1900000	1902000	Loki, start us off tonight.
1902000	1905000	So, you know, as each year,
1905000	1907000	a lot of announcements get leaked ahead of time,
1907000	1910000	and it's usually the fault of the company
1910000	1912000	that's actually going to be doing the announcement.
1912000	1916000	And in this case, Microsoft, being Microsoft, decided that,
1916000	1921000	hey, let's go ahead and put that pre-order page up for the new Xbox Slim.
1921000	1923000	Whoops, that's not supposed to go up yet.
1923000	1924000	So, yes, we got to...
1924000	1926000	They did this last year, by the way.
1926000	1928000	I don't know if you remember, but they totally ruined last year.
1928000	1930000	So, I don't know if it's on purpose,
1930000	1932000	if it's just like a leak, quote, unquote.
1932000	1934000	But basically, it's an Xbox.
1934000	1936000	They call it the Xbox One S.
1936000	1938000	It is 40% smaller.
1938000	1940000	It has a two terabyte hard drive.
1940000	1942000	It supports 4K Ultra HD video,
1942000	1944000	a high dynamic range,
1944000	1946000	and a streamlined controller,
1946000	1948000	and also has a vertical stand.
1948000	1952000	And the game system itself looks pretty similar to it was before,
1952000	1955000	although the mesh on the bottom looks a little bit different,
1955000	1957000	and it's not so VCR-looking this time.
1957000	1960000	So, it is definitely slimmer-looking,
1960000	1965000	and apparently also maybe looks like a USB port
1965000	1968000	and an infrared sensor on the front.
1968000	1970000	So, that's all we know about it so far.
1970000	1973000	No word on what the cost is going to be or anything,
1973000	1976000	but we will find out tomorrow for that, I'm assuming,
1976000	1978000	since I'm assuming this is right around the corner
1978000	1980000	since they're taking pre-orders for it.
1980000	1983000	And, yeah, so is this the same as the souped-up system?
1983000	1984000	No.
1984000	1985000	Because it has the 4K video.
1985000	1988000	The rumor was originally that they're going to be redesigning the original system,
1988000	1990000	so they're going to be shrinking it down, which is this,
1990000	1994000	and then the new system would be something different.
1994000	1995000	It'd be separate skew altogether.
1995000	1999000	Okay, so the 4K video kind of ended up being a surprise bonus then in this.
1999000	2000000	I guess, yeah.
2000000	2002000	I don't think this is the souped-up system.
2002000	2003000	That wouldn't make...
2003000	2005000	I don't think that's the same thing.
2005000	2008000	No, yeah, because the souped-up system was talking about new chips and stuff,
2008000	2009000	and that's not what we're seeing.
2009000	2010000	Yeah, I don't think that's this,
2010000	2013000	although I am kind of curious to see what the difference would be
2013000	2015000	if how one would support and the other one wouldn't,
2015000	2019000	unless that's just going to be something that they patch in for all the systems.
2019000	2020000	Good thought.
2020000	2021000	Which could be.
2021000	2024000	I mean, I would imagine spec-wise it's probably the same.
2024000	2025000	Is 4K? I don't have a 4K TV.
2025000	2027000	Is it still just an HDMI cable?
2027000	2029000	It's still HDMI, but I think it may...
2029000	2030000	I don't really know.
2030000	2032000	Because I was thinking maybe there's a physical port on the back that's different.
2032000	2033000	I don't know.
2033000	2035000	To be honest, I don't know.
2035000	2037000	I don't have a 4K TV, nor am I not.
2037000	2038000	Anyone in chat know?
2038000	2040000	I'm not too interested in getting one just yet.
2040000	2041000	I think it's way too early.
2041000	2044000	I don't know how much 4K content is out there.
2044000	2046000	And to be honest, the 1080 stuff that comes over,
2046000	2048000	you know, with Netflix and everything,
2048000	2050000	it's not always that great-looking anyways,
2050000	2052000	so I don't really think I need that just yet.
2054000	2057000	Besides the file size and everything and bandwidth, no thanks.
2057000	2060000	Yes, this new Xbox One sounds great if you waited.
2062000	2064000	But for me, it's kind of a...
2064000	2066000	Well, here's the thing too, though.
2066000	2068000	I did wait.
2068000	2070000	I haven't purchased an Xbox One yet.
2070000	2073000	I'm still hoping we hear something about Crackdown this year.
2073000	2075000	My thing is, though, is...
2075000	2077000	And this is also the same...
2077000	2079000	It's got me on the fence too about PlayStation VR.
2079000	2082000	It's like, what's it going to mean with these new systems
2082000	2084000	that are going to be coming out?
2084000	2086000	In fact, I wanted to see something real quick here.
2086000	2088000	I don't remember if it's part of the show.
2088000	2090000	It is not part of the show.
2090000	2092000	Oh, maybe it is.
2092000	2094000	Okay, so yeah, I don't know what exactly it means, though,
2094000	2096000	with these new systems coming out.
2096000	2098000	Is it just going to be an upgrade that they do every now and then?
2098000	2100000	I know that they're saying that these older systems
2100000	2103000	are going to still be able to support the same content,
2103000	2105000	but is it going to be supporting it
2105000	2108000	just like the 3DS did with Hyrule Warriors,
2108000	2110000	where it plays good on one
2110000	2112000	and doesn't play that great on the other?
2112000	2114000	I kind of want more information about that
2114000	2116000	before I jump into that stuff.
2117000	2119000	All right, well, another big thing
2119000	2121000	that was announced ahead of E3,
2121000	2123000	not leaked, but announcement,
2123000	2126000	y'all, I was happy about this.
2126000	2128000	Final Fantasy XII Remaster.
2128000	2131000	It's happening. It's true.
2131000	2133000	I'm so excited about this.
2133000	2135000	Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age
2135000	2137000	will be coming out on the PlayStation 4.
2137000	2140000	This is going to be a remaster
2140000	2143000	based on the International Zodiac Job System,
2143000	2145000	so similar to what we got with the Final Fantasy X Remaster,
2145000	2147000	and it looks gorgeous,
2147000	2149000	and I'm so, so happy this game is getting a second chance.
2149000	2150000	I never played XII, really.
2150000	2152000	I'm so happy this game is getting a second chance
2152000	2154000	because Final Fantasy XII on PlayStation 2
2154000	2156000	came out right when the Xbox 360 did,
2156000	2159000	so I think a lot of it got lost in that whole shuffle,
2159000	2162000	so I'm really happy this game is getting a second chance.
2162000	2164000	The battle system is really, really fun.
2164000	2165000	It's different.
2165000	2167000	It's not what you're used to in the old-school games,
2167000	2168000	but I love it.
2168000	2170000	Although, with XV coming around,
2170000	2172000	it seems kind of similar to XV almost.
2172000	2174000	Yeah, I guess, but...
2174000	2176000	Or is it more Kingdom Hearts?
2176000	2178000	Honestly, not to get you too excited,
2178000	2180000	it felt more like XI's battle system
2180000	2181000	than anything else. It really did.
2181000	2183000	Yeah, I know you've mentioned that before.
2183000	2185000	I know that sounds weird, but it really feels like XI's,
2185000	2188000	and I loved programming the gambits for your supports
2188000	2190000	because you can tell them, like,
2190000	2192000	oh, at 20% health, start healing,
2192000	2195000	otherwise attack, use fire if the mob is weak.
2195000	2197000	You can set all this crazy stuff.
2197000	2198000	It's really cool.
2198000	2201000	They're talking high-resolution upgrades
2201000	2205000	for movie scenes, fonts, 7.1 channels surround support.
2205000	2208000	Why don't they have that in the MMO?
2208000	2211000	You should be able to hire support characters or something
2211000	2213000	and then be able to program them like that.
2213000	2214000	That would be pretty awesome.
2214000	2216000	English and Japanese voices,
2216000	2217000	you'll be able to switch between them.
2217000	2219000	Original and newly re-recorded backgrounds,
2219000	2221000	you'll be able to switch between them.
2221000	2224000	Shorter load times, autosave, and speed mode,
2224000	2226000	and speed mode operability.
2226000	2228000	So I'm really hyped for this.
2228000	2230000	I'm really, really, really excited about this.
2230000	2231000	So, yay.
2231000	2235000	Looking at the chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2235000	2236000	DarkTetsuya says,
2236000	2238000	This reminded me of a conversation I had with someone
2238000	2240000	about the possibility of a 12 remaster.
2240000	2241000	I tried to finish 12,
2241000	2244000	but even after using a GameShark to get myself unstuck,
2244000	2245000	I still couldn't finish the game,
2245000	2249000	so I hope the HD version fixes some of the problems I had.
2249000	2251000	And BobbyBlackWolf saying Final Fantasy 12
2251000	2253000	was my favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack.
2253000	2254000	It was really, really good.
2254000	2256000	I'm curious on 11 Mobile now,
2256000	2259000	which, whenever that information's supposed to come out,
2259000	2261000	because I know they're supposed to be doing something with that.
2261000	2262000	Before we get to the classic game of the week,
2262000	2265000	Dark Soccer, you want to quickly tell us about what you had.
2266000	2267000	Huh?
2267000	2268000	Your story up next.
2268000	2269000	Before we get to the classic game of the week.
2269000	2270000	Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
2270000	2271000	That's okay.
2271000	2276000	I have to say that I've still been reading up about what's gone on.
2276000	2277000	I understand.
2277000	2279000	There's definitely a lot weighing on our minds today.
2279000	2281000	So sorry about that.
2281000	2286000	So, I've actually known people who were affected by this
2286000	2290000	that Fallout 4, for some reason, showed up free.
2290000	2291000	Who knows?
2291000	2293000	It was apparently just a pricing error.
2294000	2296000	I know someone who is affected by this too.
2296000	2297000	Okay.
2297000	2299000	They might be sitting across from you.
2299000	2300000	Really?
2300000	2306000	So, Microsoft said that for those who downloaded Fallout 4 for free,
2306000	2308000	the licenses are revoked.
2308000	2309000	Too bad.
2309000	2315000	But they are going to give everyone $10 in their Microsoft account
2315000	2319000	as an inconvenience payment.
2320000	2323000	Why not just own it and let them keep Fallout?
2323000	2326000	Because they can do that.
2326000	2327000	They have the ability to do that.
2327000	2330000	And people knew that it wasn't like,
2330000	2332000	oh, I thought it was free.
2332000	2335000	It was more like, hey, it's free now.
2335000	2338000	Go download it before they catch it.
2338000	2342000	I mean, the Digital Deluxe version was free too, which is like $100.
2342000	2345000	And at some point, Bethesda is hemorrhaging a lot of money.
2345000	2347000	It was the same thing with, what was it?
2347000	2350000	It was with, what's that, Harmonics game?
2350000	2351000	Amplitude.
2351000	2353000	They did it with Amplitude.
2353000	2356000	And I didn't gain fucking $10 from Sony.
2356000	2357000	All right.
2357000	2360000	Well, look, and before I get nasty emails,
2360000	2362000	we already bought Fallout 4.
2362000	2363000	We just had it on PC.
2363000	2364000	Alan has it on PC.
2364000	2366000	It was kind of one of those things where I was like,
2366000	2368000	well, I'm curious, but no big loss.
2368000	2371000	If I want to borrow it now in Steam library, I can.
2371000	2373000	I've got the console version.
2373000	2374000	No.
2374000	2375000	All right.
2375000	2377000	Let's get to the classic game of the week.
2377000	2379000	Back before there was digital storefronts.
2379000	2382000	Or maybe, actually, maybe not this week.
2382000	2384000	Maybe when there was digital storefronts.
2384000	2385000	I forgot.
2385000	2387000	It's only got to be 10 years old.
2387000	2389000	We're going to take a trip back in time,
2389000	2391000	and Dark Soccer's going to find a game that she thinks, hey,
2391000	2393000	you guys should be playing this game this week.
2393000	2396000	So Dark Soccer, in the spirit of E3.
2396000	2398000	Yes, in the spirit of E3.
2398000	2401000	What is this week's classic game of the week?
2401000	2403000	Half-Life 2, Episode 1.
2404000	2407000	Which, yes, I've done Half-Life, and I've done Half-Life 2.
2407000	2409000	But I'm doing Half-Life 2, Episode 1.
2409000	2412000	Is there a certain reason you have Half-Life on the brain
2412000	2413000	right now?
2413000	2414000	Is there a particular reason?
2414000	2416000	Well, you know, we always speculate,
2416000	2418000	because there's a 3 in E3.
2418000	2419000	So I'm just saying.
2419000	2423000	So maybe this isn't the first time you'll hear about Half-Life.
2423000	2424000	Half-Life 3 confirmed.
2424000	2425000	Oh, my God.
2425000	2426000	Oh, my God.
2426000	2427000	Half-Life 3 confirmed.
2427000	2428000	Exactly.
2428000	2431000	So we all know what Half-Life is.
2431000	2433000	It's a first-person shooter.
2433000	2437000	This starts exactly from where Half-Life 2 ended.
2437000	2441000	And it continues the game of Gordon and Alex and Dog
2441000	2448000	going through their adventures and a cliffhanger ending.
2448000	2455000	And I just picked it, because it came out June 1 in 2006.
2455000	2458000	That's how old Half-Life 2, Episode 1 is.
2458000	2460000	That's how long we've been fucking waiting.
2460000	2463000	Well, not true, because there's an Episode 2, but still close.
2463000	2465000	We've been waiting a long time for Half-Life, Episode 3.
2465000	2468000	But one of the special things about this, though,
2468000	2473000	is that it does have an improved AI for Alex, in particular,
2473000	2476000	in the game.
2476000	2479000	And it was the upgraded version of the source engine
2479000	2483000	that had better lighting effects and different facial animation
2483000	2484000	technology.
2484000	2487000	And then it allowed the AI enemies
2487000	2492000	to also use different fighting tactics.
2492000	2495000	So it definitely added some more challenges, too.
2495000	2498000	And it added more settings to the game.
2498000	2502000	So it definitely was a big addition to the series.
2502000	2504000	And it would definitely be worth mentioning.
2504000	2507000	But we're still waiting.
2507000	2508000	Still waiting.
2508000	2509000	And that's it.
2509000	2510000	Still waiting for that day.
2510000	2514000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Half-Life 2,
2514000	2516000	Episode 1.
2518000	2520000	To register participation for this week's episode
2520000	2522000	of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com,
2522000	2525000	use the passphrase, skate.
2525000	2528000	So we got like five minutes here before we have to cut over
2528000	2529000	to the Bethesda conference.
2529000	2531000	So maybe we can squeeze in release dates real quick?
2531000	2532000	Do you think we can travel around the world,
2532000	2533000	check out release dates?
2533000	2534000	Because there's probably not a lot this weekend.
2534000	2535000	No, there's not a lot.
2535000	2537000	Unless there are surprises.
2537000	2539000	That's the thing to cross your fingers for.
2539000	2540000	True, yeah.
2540000	2541000	Some surprises.
2541000	2542000	Some surprises.
2542000	2546000	But so far, what's on the plate, Dead by Daylight on PC,
2546000	2551000	Dreamfall Chapters Book 5 Redux on PC, Mac and Linux.
2551000	2552000	That is it.
2552000	2558000	On June 13th, cat lateral damage for PlayStation 4 in the UK.
2558000	2559000	And that's it?
2559000	2560000	Yeah.
2560000	2561000	All right.
2561000	2563000	Well, let me, I'm running over to Japan real quick.
2563000	2564000	Run, run, run.
2564000	2566000	And checking what's coming out of there in Japan.
2566000	2569000	It looks like it's a little busier over there this week.
2569000	2573000	On the 16th, on PlayStation 4, you have Root Letter
2573000	2575000	is out in Japan this week.
2575000	2577000	Again, on the PlayStation 4.
2577000	2581000	And then traveling over to the Wii U.
2581000	2583000	Still slow this week.
2583000	2587000	The next big release in Japan is Minecraft Wii U edition on the 23rd.
2587000	2590000	Meanwhile, on the PlayStation Vita,
2590000	2594000	we have Hakoyuki, Shinkai Hana no Shu,
2594000	2598000	as well as Root Letter is out on the Vita.
2598000	2600000	So you have those to look forward to this week.
2600000	2603000	And then lastly, wanting to check the DS
2603000	2605000	to see if there's anything on the DS this week.
2605000	2609000	Oh, Taiko no Tatujin Doko Don Mystery Adventure.
2609000	2610000	That's right.
2610000	2615000	A Taiko no Tatujin game that is like an adventure game.
2615000	2617000	It's not your typical Taiko no Tatujin.
2617000	2618000	But don't be fooled.
2618000	2620000	You still have the drum beats and all that good stuff in it.
2620000	2622000	But this one's going to be a little more of a hybrid game.
2622000	2624000	So there you go.
2624000	2626000	That is your Japanese releases for this week.
2626000	2627000	All right, guys.
2627000	2628000	We're going to take a quick break.
2629000	2632000	And when we come back, we will hopefully...
2632000	2634000	Skyrim HD, you think?
2634000	2635000	Hopefully?
2635000	2636000	Possibly.
2636000	2637000	So you want me to say something?
2637000	2638000	Elder Scrolls VI?
2638000	2639000	Come on.
2639000	2641000	Hey, Oblivion was 2006.
2641000	2643000	Skyrim was 2011.
2643000	2644000	Maybe?
2644000	2646000	Maybe?
2646000	2647000	It's about time.
2647000	2648000	Set the bar to realism.
2648000	2649000	But we know Dishonored 2.
2649000	2650000	We're about to see.
2650000	2655000	Dishonored 2, I mean, the stuff that they think was very likely so far.
2655000	2658000	So Dishonored 2, obviously, is going to be there.
2658000	2663000	They've got, let's see, Dishonored 2 Fallout 4 DLC, Doom DLC,
2663000	2668000	Elder Scrolls Online updates, Elder Scrolls Legends,
2668000	2672000	and then some rumored, Wolfenstein 2, The Evil Within 2,
2672000	2676000	Prey 2, Skyrim Remastered, and maybe Quake, but probably not.
2676000	2677000	All right.
2677000	2678000	Do we know if it's 60 or 90 minutes?
2678000	2679000	We don't know, do we?
2679000	2680000	Don't know.
2680000	2681000	All right.
2681000	2684000	So we will be back when the Bethesda press conference is over.
2684000	2685000	Stay tuned.
2685000	2686000	Don't go anywhere.
2686000	2688000	For you podcast folks, it's going to be a time warp.
2688000	2690000	We will be right back.
2696000	2699000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
2699000	2707000	Live tonight, June the 12th of 2016, our 645th episode already in progress.
2707000	2712000	We had a nice big break as we were watching the Bethesda press conference
2712000	2713000	together as a group.
2713000	2714000	What did y'all think?
2714000	2718000	I kind of thought it was pretty good.
2718000	2722000	You know, they did a really good job hyping their games and showing a lot of gameplay.
2722000	2728000	I almost think they showed too much gameplay towards the end, but that's just me.
2728000	2730000	I know some people are way more into the Dishonored stuff than I am,
2730000	2734000	but I thought they did a, I thought, especially contrasted to EA earlier today,
2734000	2736000	which was a lot of, I think, more talk.
2736000	2738000	I think they did a great job.
2738000	2742000	It wasn't as exciting as last year, I think, but it was still very good.
2742000	2743000	Yeah.
2743000	2745000	Yet another game I might have been interested in,
2745000	2747000	but there was no mention of a female protagonist.
2747000	2748000	Which game was that?
2748000	2749000	Prey.
2749000	2751000	Ah, yeah, Prey.
2751000	2756000	That one was interesting because, well, with Prey, I mean, I remember the older game,
2756000	2760000	and I think a lot of us were anticipating Prey 2, but this game they showed,
2760000	2764000	I mean, I know Prey was kind of like a sci-fi hybrid thing.
2764000	2768000	It seems like a reimagining, but I'm still not interested.
2768000	2771000	There was a lot of Native American culture tie-ins in the old game,
2771000	2773000	and I don't know if that's going to still be there.
2773000	2778000	But even in the supposed Prey 2 that they were showing didn't look anything like Prey,
2778000	2781000	so I don't know. I guess it's not a big deal.
2781000	2783000	Let's go down the list. We'll revisit Prey in a moment,
2783000	2785000	but let's go down the list of everything they showed.
2785000	2788000	This one really surprised me, especially because they opened with this,
2788000	2790000	and they didn't close with it.
2790000	2793000	The closer was kind of, okay, that's it, bye.
2793000	2795000	I'm kind of surprised they didn't close with this.
2795000	2799000	But they opened big with Quake Champions, so Quake is coming back.
2799000	2801000	DarkSakura, were we talking about this just last week?
2801000	2803000	More Quake? Here we go.
2803000	2805000	I said it would be nice.
2805000	2808000	So Quake Champions, which to me kind of feels like,
2808000	2811000	oh, they might have seen what was going on with Overwatch,
2811000	2814000	that people really like these characters that are very fleshed out.
2814000	2817000	They're a first-person shooter, and maybe this is their own kind of spin on that.
2817000	2819000	I don't know. That's kind of what I took away from it.
2819000	2824000	But at least for me, Quake has not particularly been a character-driven game before,
2824000	2827000	but it looks like they're going to really try to change that with this new one.
2827000	2829000	But it looks sweet.
2829000	2831000	I was kind of surprised to see it so soon after Doom.
2831000	2833000	What did you think, Logie?
2833000	2835000	I thought it was all right. I'm not a huge fan of Quake,
2835000	2837000	but it looks decent.
2837000	2842000	I mean, it's an arena shooter, so I wish it was an actual Quake game,
2842000	2848000	not just this kind of arena, multiplayer-focused game, I guess.
2848000	2851000	More of an actual storyline Quake game.
2851000	2853000	But whatever. That's fine.
2854000	2857000	Next up, obviously they didn't show a lot of gameplay,
2857000	2861000	but with their QuakeCon coming up, they're probably saving the big reveal for that.
2861000	2864000	Elder Scrolls Legends, the card game, they showed a little bit of that,
2864000	2867000	which, again, not to keep saying Bethesda wants to be Blizzard,
2867000	2870000	but this looked a lot like Hearthstone to me,
2870000	2873000	especially when they were saying it's tablets now, too.
2873000	2877000	Yeah, a big meh from me because I just don't give a shit about those types of games.
2877000	2880000	Yeah, I have to say, as much as I love Elder Scrolls,
2880000	2884000	I was not really, you know, but I get there are people super into trading card games
2884000	2886000	that are going to be really excited about this.
2886000	2890000	So, you know, different stuff for different people.
2890000	2894000	The Fallout 4 add-ons, so they talked a little bit about Fallout 4 after that,
2894000	2896000	and then showed off some of the add-ons.
2896000	2898000	Yeah, the contraptions thing was pretty funny.
2898000	2900000	The add-ons are just going to be fantastic.
2900000	2902000	I mean, just with all the stuff you can do in the game
2902000	2906000	and now that you can create elevators and stuff and make contraptions,
2906000	2909000	I can only imagine all the YouTube videos are going to come out from that.
2909000	2912000	The other part was torturing Mama Murphy like that.
2912000	2917000	That was fantastic. So, yeah, that was pretty awesome.
2917000	2921000	Yeah, and, you know, again, I don't know the Fallout 4 world super, super well.
2921000	2923000	I've kind of watched Alan play a little bit of it,
2923000	2926000	but I did think that the theme park thing looked pretty funny, too.
2926000	2929000	That was something that has been rumored to be coming out for a while now.
2929000	2934000	Even, like, with the original, with Fallout 4, they had, like,
2934000	2937000	it was in one of the updates that said Nuka World,
2937000	2944000	leaked actual, like, it was like an internal email that came out in 2014 or 15
2944000	2946000	was saying something about Fallout Nuka World.
2946000	2948000	So, it was something that they've been planning from the get-go,
2948000	2952000	but it'll be neat to check out, like, an actual, another expansion.
2952000	2956000	I still hope you have to play Far Harbor, so I'm looking forward to that.
2956000	2958000	But, yeah, more expansions.
2958000	2961000	And then, obviously, they're feeling a lot of love with the Fallout Shelter,
2961000	2964000	and they're talking about now Fallout Shelter is going to be a PC game,
2964000	2968000	but then I thought it was all too interesting that they're bringing the vault into the Fallout 4 game.
2968000	2970000	Yeah, so you can make your own vault, which is pretty awesome.
2970000	2972000	Even DarkSakura piped up, she went,
2972000	2973000	I want a vault!
2973000	2975000	Speaking, then you can experiment.
2975000	2979000	It appeals to my Sims house building love.
2979000	2984000	And you can experiment on your, you know, vault guests, if you will,
2984000	2986000	so that's pretty awesome.
2986000	2990000	Let's see, so then, big announcement, Skyrim HD is real,
2990000	2992000	and it's October 28th is when it's coming back.
2992000	2994000	Looks like mod support will be a part of it as well.
2994000	2996000	Yep, that'd be awesome. I would pick that up.
2996000	2999000	They're going to be able to charge you 60 bucks for that all over again, I bet.
2999000	3000000	Probably.
3000000	3003000	Yeah, that's going to be, I wonder if that'll last a long time,
3003000	3005000	or if that'll start to fall in price pretty quickly.
3005000	3007000	I would imagine it'd fall pretty quickly.
3007000	3009000	They've been pretty good at discounting some of their games,
3009000	3011000	like Wolfenstein was like 20 bucks, not too long.
3011000	3014000	And they discount that stuff pretty often, so.
3014000	3018000	Very curious how PC is going to take that,
3018000	3022000	because modding has already made PC Skyrim HD.
3022000	3023000	Yeah, I mean.
3023000	3025000	There's textures and stuff, so kind of interesting
3025000	3027000	how they're going to resell that to the PC audience.
3027000	3029000	I think it's more of a console thing.
3029000	3032000	I don't know if, I'd be surprised if they actually released it on PC.
3032000	3034000	I'm pretty sure there were three boxes on the screen.
3034000	3036000	So, it wasn't Wii U.
3036000	3038000	Of course not.
3038000	3040000	I don't know.
3040000	3044000	They could, they could try it, I guess.
3044000	3046000	I don't know why you would purchase that again.
3046000	3048000	It could be something like a lot of times when they do
3048000	3050000	like an HD remix like that or something,
3050000	3054000	they may just put it out like for 20 bucks on PC.
3054000	3056000	You know, like really cheap.
3056000	3057000	Right.
3057000	3060000	Well, I'm curious if all the expansions are bundled in as well.
3060000	3063000	That is going to sweep the pot for those that maybe never picked those up.
3063000	3065000	It would be all the expansions bundled in,
3065000	3067000	but I'm thinking if they do re-release on PC,
3067000	3069000	they're not going to charge like 60 bucks for it.
3069000	3071000	It's just going to be like 20 or something.
3071000	3072000	It's inexpensive.
3072000	3075000	They've done that in the past with other like HD
3075000	3077000	or like collectors, not collectors,
3077000	3080000	like game of the year editions or definitive editions.
3080000	3083000	They'll be, you know, console obviously is going to be more expensive
3083000	3086000	because it's a new game for that platform,
3086000	3088000	but for PC, since it's already been out,
3088000	3090000	it's more of just kind of a compilation.
3090000	3092000	Oh, Defective Candy calls us out in chat
3092000	3094000	over at live.fognetwork.com saying the nice thing is
3094000	3096000	if you own Skyrim and all its add-ons
3096000	3098000	or own Legendary Edition on Steam,
3098000	3100000	you'll get a free upgrade to Skyrim
3100000	3102000	Special Edition on October 28th.
3102000	3103000	I did not catch that.
3103000	3105000	That must have been in some type of e-mail
3105000	3107000	or some online follow-up thing.
3107000	3108000	Which I do, so that'll be cool.
3108000	3110000	That, okay, that's pretty rad then
3110000	3111000	if they're throwing that in as a free upgrade,
3111000	3113000	then that kind of answers the questions,
3113000	3114000	what to do about the HD modders and stuff,
3114000	3116000	but my thought is that maybe they went back
3116000	3118000	and changed some stuff actually in the engine itself
3118000	3120000	that's going to want to make some of the modders
3120000	3121000	go back and do new things
3121000	3123000	with some of these enhancements in the engine.
3123000	3125000	Well, yeah, because it's a pretty old engine,
3125000	3127000	so if they are updating the whole engine
3127000	3129000	and maybe run on something a little bit similar
3129000	3131000	to Fallout 4, then that would be pretty nice.
3131000	3133000	Yeah.
3133000	3135000	Let's see.
3135000	3136000	Tigerclaw says,
3136000	3137000	I also have Skyrim on 360,
3137000	3139000	which I never got around to playing
3139000	3140000	when I first bought it.
3140000	3142000	Well, sadly, I think you're going to have to rebuy it,
3142000	3144000	but maybe if they are going to get it free on PC,
3144000	3146000	it lends itself to the fact that maybe it won't be
3146000	3147000	a very expensive game.
3147000	3149000	Maybe it'll be more of a budget title.
3149000	3152000	Then Prey was the game that was shown after that.
3152000	3153000	Which is kind of confusing
3153000	3155000	because it looked like a whole new franchise
3155000	3156000	and then all of a sudden it's all Prey.
3156000	3157000	It's like, huh?
3157000	3158000	I thought it was going to be,
3158000	3160000	I thought it was going to be like Groundhog Day
3160000	3163000	or Good Morning, Malcolm would be the name of the game.
3163000	3164000	I don't know.
3164000	3165000	It was just, it was different.
3165000	3168000	It's just so like, this is Prey?
3168000	3169000	Okay, if you say so, I guess.
3169000	3172000	I mean, it didn't look anything like the first game
3172000	3175000	and didn't look anything like that second trailer
3175000	3176000	for Prey 2 or whatever.
3176000	3178000	It was just kind of, here's the thing,
3178000	3179000	we're calling it Prey.
3179000	3180000	And I'm not saying they have to like just copy
3180000	3181000	the first game or something.
3181000	3184000	Maybe there's some theme that ties them together
3184000	3185000	that, you know, you know,
3185000	3187000	why you have the different protagonists and stuff,
3187000	3188000	but I'm just...
3188000	3189000	Well, yeah.
3189000	3190000	I mean, the first one,
3190000	3192000	it was you're kidnapped by aliens basically.
3192000	3195000	So we're kidnapped by aliens again?
3195000	3196000	I don't know.
3196000	3197000	Yeah.
3197000	3198000	Let's see.
3198000	3200000	And then after that was the Doom update.
3200000	3203000	So they talked about some of the DLC for Doom.
3203000	3205000	So they're going to do like multiplayer DLC,
3205000	3206000	which, okay, cool.
3206000	3208000	But then they mentioned the shareware throwback concept
3208000	3211000	where they're going to release episode one,
3211000	3212000	or the first level, I guess,
3212000	3215000	free on Xbox and PlayStation,
3215000	3217000	which I mean, that's cool.
3217000	3220000	I love how they frame that, but it's a demo.
3220000	3222000	They're releasing a Doom demo this week, basically.
3222000	3224000	So for those that want to check it out.
3224000	3225000	But that, again...
3225000	3226000	But it would be cool though,
3226000	3228000	if like it was like the shareware thing
3228000	3231000	where I download that one level demo
3231000	3233000	and then I say purchase
3233000	3234000	and then I can download the rest of it.
3234000	3236000	Oh, are you kidding?
3236000	3237000	Of course that's going to be there.
3237000	3238000	In the day of digital sales?
3238000	3240000	Of course they want that money.
3240000	3241000	That's how they're doing it.
3241000	3242000	That's how they're going to get the money themselves.
3242000	3244000	And that's how I think that they should be doing it
3244000	3245000	with all these other games.
3245000	3247000	Like, yes, I understand you can't make a standalone demo,
3247000	3249000	but just put out the first level or something for free.
3249000	3250000	Yeah, interesting.
3250000	3252000	I'd be curious to see what kind of success they have for this.
3252000	3255000	Because again, I didn't think I would like Doom,
3255000	3256000	but I really do.
3256000	3259000	So I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of people
3259000	3262000	that can use this demo as a chance to see,
3262000	3264000	well, I'm kind of on the fence about first-person shooters.
3264000	3265000	Am I going to like this?
3265000	3266000	And I bet, you know, there'll be some.
3266000	3268000	They'll say nah, still not my cup of tea.
3268000	3269000	Too fast, too bloody, whatever.
3269000	3270000	But there'll be some that are like,
3270000	3273000	okay, push A, I want more right here.
3273000	3275000	So that is pretty cool.
3275000	3278000	Then after that, they talked about the Elder Scrolls Online,
3278000	3281000	which I've got to admit, I could not get,
3281000	3282000	as much as I love MMOs,
3282000	3284000	I really tried to get an Elder Scrolls Online.
3284000	3286000	I kind of couldn't do it.
3286000	3287000	Maybe I need to give it a second chance.
3287000	3290000	And the nice thing is about the pricing model,
3290000	3291000	I don't have to pay a monthly fee,
3291000	3293000	so I can give it another chance.
3293000	3295000	I liked how they were talking about the whole
3295000	3297000	we're going to just level sync you to everything.
3297000	3299000	You can do whatever the hell you want in the game.
3299000	3300000	That was cool.
3300000	3302000	If you want to play it with me, I own it.
3302000	3303000	I haven't played it yet.
3303000	3304000	Yeah, I own it too.
3304000	3307000	I played a little bit of it, but it was so buggy.
3307000	3310000	But then again, I played it the day it came out.
3310000	3313000	LOL Bethesda and buggy games.
3313000	3315000	So now it's probably fine.
3315000	3317000	If I can fit it into my busy schedule.
3317000	3318000	Girl.
3318000	3319000	No, I'll check it out.
3319000	3320000	Okay.
3320000	3321000	I'll check it out.
3321000	3322000	After we see Warcraft.
3322000	3324000	Yeah, which is also on my list of things to do.
3324000	3327000	Sadly, a topic we will not be able to talk about tonight
3327000	3328000	because none of us saw it yet,
3328000	3331000	but we got too busy of a show tonight anyway.
3332000	3334000	The 23rd, it will be released in Japan.
3334000	3336000	That was another pretty notable deal
3336000	3338000	is that they're going to take the Elder Scrolls Online to Japan.
3338000	3340000	I'd be very curious to see how it's received over there.
3340000	3345000	Speaking of Warcraft, World of Warcraft does not exist in Japan.
3345000	3347000	Final Fantasy XIV obviously exists in Japan,
3347000	3349000	but the MMO landscape without Warcraft in it,
3349000	3350000	very different in Japan.
3350000	3354000	So it'll be very interesting to see what Elder Scrolls Online does.
3354000	3358000	And then after that was talking about the Bethesda VR,
3358000	3363000	which kind of surprised me that they're taking existing things
3363000	3364000	and putting it into VR
3364000	3368000	because that isn't necessarily always the best idea,
3368000	3371000	but it sounds like they're taking care
3371000	3376000	to ensure that the games are kind of built for VR, so to speak.
3376000	3380000	And then they mentioned that Fallout 4 is going to be on the HTC Vive.
3380000	3385000	So interesting that they did not mention the PlayStation VR.
3385000	3387000	Oculus, I kind of get a little more
3387000	3390000	because wasn't there a little spat going on
3390000	3396000	between one of the id, which does the stuff for Bethesda,
3396000	3399000	and Oculus, wasn't there a little thing going on there?
3399000	3401000	So I can kind of see maybe why that was left out.
3401000	3403000	But this is going to be very interesting now
3403000	3406000	as we're starting to see the chess pieces move
3406000	3408000	where what VR is going to have what.
3408000	3411000	Yeah, that's definitely a great win for the Vive
3411000	3414000	because someone's looking to purchase,
3414000	3416000	you know, a VR system and it's like,
3416000	3419000	oh, hey, Fallout 4, that'd be pretty awesome.
3419000	3420000	Thank you, Bobby.
3420000	3422000	Of course, Bobby knows this shit when it comes to VR.
3422000	3424000	And in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,
3424000	3427000	I think the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus is still going on.
3427000	3430000	They feel Carmax stole ZeniMax tech and took it to Oculus.
3430000	3433000	So that was, yeah, so that's not a surprise
3433000	3435000	that they're leaving Oculus out in that regard.
3435000	3437000	But when they said Bethesda VR,
3437000	3439000	I was like, well, are they going to create their own headset?
3439000	3440000	Please don't.
3440000	3441000	Oh, yeah, please don't.
3441000	3443000	I was like, oh, see, they're saying
3443000	3444000	that he stole their tech
3444000	3445000	because they're actually developing one their own.
3445000	3447000	I'm like, oh, no, not another one.
3447000	3449000	And then it's like for the Vive, I'm like, okay, fine.
3449000	3450000	That's fine.
3450000	3452000	At least they're siding with somebody.
3452000	3453000	I was just a little worried there that,
3453000	3455000	hey, we've got our own headset.
3455000	3457000	I'd be very curious to see how that plays.
3457000	3460000	I have to admit Doom is very fast, very fluid,
3460000	3462000	and I feel like would make me very sick.
3462000	3464000	But the way he phrased it,
3464000	3468000	he wasn't saying like it's just Doom ported to VR.
3468000	3470000	He kind of was saying it's an experience.
3471000	3473000	He kind of used some words that make me think
3473000	3476000	it's not just a injecting VR.
3476000	3478000	Like they're doing something
3478000	3480000	to keep the VR stuff in mind with that.
3480000	3482000	So I'd be very curious to see about that.
3482000	3484000	And then, of course, Fallout 4,
3484000	3486000	they mentioned that will come out for the HTC Vive,
3486000	3489000	so that'll be pretty interesting.
3489000	3491000	Yeah, and Bobby in chat says,
3491000	3493000	yeah, it's an experience in the Doom world,
3493000	3496000	but Fallout 4 is a VR conversion of the game.
3496000	3499000	But Fallout 4 I don't think moves as fast as Doom does.
3499000	3504000	It's still a fast game, but it's a little more tempered.
3504000	3507000	And then lastly, of course, an extended, very extended,
3507000	3510000	very, very extended look at this.
3510000	3512000	I kind of think it was a bit much.
3512000	3514000	People are disappointed that there was no announcement
3514000	3516000	for a new Wolfenstein,
3516000	3518000	but if you caught a glimpse
3518000	3521000	of during that little DOS thing that they were doing
3521000	3523000	with the different folders that were listed on there,
3523000	3525000	they all had release dates.
3525000	3528000	Each of those folders was dated by the release of those games.
3528000	3532000	So they had Keen, 12, 14, 90, Wolf 3D, 5, 5, 92,
3532000	3534000	New Order, 5, 20, 14,
3534000	3536000	Old Blood, 5, 5, 15,
3536000	3540000	New Colossus, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.
3540000	3543000	So that's probably the new Wolfenstein
3543000	3545000	that they're like, tease!
3545000	3547000	A little tease in there.
3547000	3549000	And then, of course, the other thing.
3549000	3551000	In the old Wolfenstein games,
3551000	3554000	wasn't one of the battles that people remember
3554000	3556000	when Hitler was in a colossus?
3556000	3558000	Wasn't that the boss one?
3558000	3560000	I'm almost positive that was one of the...
3560000	3562000	Yeah, like he was in a mech. I remember that.
3562000	3564000	That was a whole big thing.
3564000	3566000	Maybe they're bringing something like that back.
3566000	3568000	Okay, so what about Dishonored 2, though?
3568000	3570000	It looked really pretty.
3570000	3572000	Yeah, it looked nice.
3572000	3574000	I think the gameplay, though, was a little long.
3574000	3576000	I'm not that excited about it,
3576000	3578000	but it looks cool.
3578000	3580000	I actually am interested in this one.
3580000	3582000	I wasn't at all interested in the first one,
3582000	3584000	but now I'm interested in this one.
3584000	3586000	Well, then, mission accomplished
3586000	3588000	on Bethesda's part, I suppose.
3588000	3590000	No, I mean, they did try to sell me
3590000	3592000	with the anus shots, but, you know.
3592000	3594000	Well, like I said,
3594000	3596000	you got ripped, and you asshole.
3596000	3598000	When I said shoot him in the butt, I wasn't literal.
3598000	3600000	But, Jamie, what'd you think about that deal, though,
3600000	3602000	where if you get the game,
3602000	3604000	you said you never really got into the first one.
3604000	3606000	Here's your chance. The first one completely remastered.
3606000	3608000	Oh, yay, you had another game in my collection
3608000	3610000	I'm not gonna play.
3610000	3612000	Whoopty shit.
3612000	3614000	This one's supposed to be pretty good, actually.
3614000	3616000	Now you know why I was tempered
3616000	3618000	when it came to the Elder Scrolls Online.
3618000	3620000	It's like, uh, another game I'll never get to.
3620000	3622000	Dishonored, I feel like, is in my Steam.
3622000	3624000	Like, it came in some damn bundle a long time ago.
3624000	3626000	Yeah, I think I got it.
3626000	3628000	They were giving it away at one point,
3628000	3630000	so, you know, they want to raise hype
3630000	3632000	for the second game, so.
3632000	3634000	ActDeaf, just curious what it is
3634000	3636000	that piqued your interest in Dishonored 2, Darasaka.
3636000	3638000	Female protagonists with cool powers.
3638000	3640000	Yeah.
3640000	3642000	I am a sucker
3642000	3646000	for a well-developed, uh,
3646000	3650000	I'm trying to think of what the right word to phrase it says.
3650000	3652000	A well-developed environment,
3652000	3654000	meaning that you've got
3654000	3656000	the history in the buildings,
3656000	3658000	you've got the people going about their days.
3658000	3660000	You can actually sit,
3660000	3662000	and people watch if you wanted to,
3662000	3664000	and it would be legit.
3664000	3666000	Like, I've followed NPCs around before
3666000	3668000	in Fable.
3668000	3670000	I can see where they went.
3670000	3672000	And you being a big Sims fan,
3672000	3674000	that doesn't surprise me at all,
3674000	3676000	because that's part of the big allure of The Sims,
3676000	3678000	is watching your Sims hook up and stuff like that.
3678000	3680000	Well, not really. It's seeing how you can torture them
3680000	3682000	until they, you know, set themselves on fire
3682000	3684000	or drown, and then you just go build more houses.
3684000	3686000	That's The Sims for me.
3686000	3688000	But I like the artistry
3688000	3690000	that went into it, and the depth.
3690000	3692000	And I kept thinking,
3692000	3694000	like, when they showed that scene,
3694000	3696000	and what was the huge rail that was going in the big circle
3696000	3698000	above their heads,
3698000	3700000	I was like, I wonder if you could get up there
3700000	3702000	and wander around.
3702000	3704000	Because one of the things I love to do in games
3704000	3706000	is find out, how can I get to where I'm not supposed to go?
3706000	3708000	How can I stand there?
3708000	3710000	How can I climb there?
3710000	3712000	And so, that's what really
3712000	3714000	set it off for me.
3714000	3716000	So, I gotta just poke you on this a little bit, because
3716000	3718000	you know, you mentioned with Prey, you weren't interested
3718000	3720000	because there wasn't a female protagonist,
3720000	3722000	but I mean, I kind of, I don't know,
3722000	3724000	I guess it's limited what we know about the game so far,
3724000	3726000	but I thought the environments were really pretty,
3726000	3728000	and I remember that about the old Prey game, so I mean,
3728000	3730000	are you just, do you think you're really serious?
3730000	3732000	I'm serious, that's it.
3732000	3734000	I think...
3734000	3736000	Don't you think it's early to judge it based off that?
3736000	3738000	I mean, at least, at least
3738000	3740000	the character was Asian too,
3740000	3742000	which you don't see a lot of... That doesn't matter,
3742000	3744000	I don't care what their, you know,
3744000	3746000	what their skin looks like,
3746000	3748000	I care if it's a character
3748000	3750000	that I can understand.
3750000	3752000	Huh. And so,
3752000	3754000	I think that we also do have,
3754000	3756000	we're getting a lot more,
3756000	3758000	you know, characters, especially, you know,
3758000	3760000	games like Mirror's Edge with only female
3760000	3762000	protagonists. I think we need
3762000	3764000	more of them, and I don't,
3764000	3766000	I don't know, I guess I'm just sort of sick
3766000	3768000	of supporting, you know,
3768000	3770000	a male narrative
3770000	3772000	for this long, you know? Does that make sense?
3772000	3774000	I guess,
3774000	3776000	and it's like, I understand the need for diversity
3776000	3778000	in games, but at the same time, like, you know,
3778000	3780000	if Prey ends up being really cool,
3780000	3782000	maybe, you know, we just saw one trailer,
3782000	3784000	maybe there'll be some, maybe there will be a playable woman
3784000	3786000	in it at some point that you take over for a little bit,
3786000	3788000	or maybe there'll be a very strong female support
3788000	3790000	character or something? I'm tired of
3790000	3792000	being, I'm tired of women being
3792000	3794000	support for a man.
3794000	3796000	In storytelling.
3796000	3798000	I'm tired of the women in refrigerators.
3798000	3800000	I'm tired of the whole thing.
3800000	3802000	We, you know,
3802000	3804000	it really is just so off-putting now.
3804000	3806000	I'm tired of
3806000	3808000	giving my money to that.
3808000	3810000	And I think that, you know,
3810000	3812000	it's time to
3812000	3814000	to have, um,
3814000	3816000	shut up,
3816000	3818000	okay? Just shut up.
3818000	3820000	Is something in chat bothering you?
3820000	3822000	You're telling me it's time to rant. It's bonds006.
3822000	3824000	Oh. No, it's not a rant.
3824000	3826000	It's something that needs to be said
3826000	3828000	and there's a difference.
3828000	3830000	We,
3830000	3832000	everybody,
3832000	3834000	I think, we're looking
3834000	3836000	so hard for
3836000	3838000	okay, thank you then. We look
3838000	3840000	so, um,
3840000	3842000	and I'm not,
3842000	3844000	we are all co-hosts.
3844000	3846000	Okay? You gotta, you gotta
3846000	3848000	respond to what is in chat here. Okay,
3848000	3850000	Stoppy says, tired of being a supporting character
3850000	3852000	is a co-host. No. Co-host means
3852000	3854000	you host with people. All three
3854000	3856000	of us. Right. And it's not
3856000	3858000	poking fun. You said it at
3858000	3860000	the really worst time. The
3860000	3862000	whole point is that, especially
3862000	3864000	in this day and age, we need to all be
3864000	3866000	on equal footing. And when you've
3866000	3868000	been delivered games
3868000	3870000	historically that have all been
3870000	3872000	written for men, that
3872000	3874000	have all starred male characters, sometimes
3874000	3876000	you get a point where you're a little fucking
3876000	3878000	sick of it. Just saying.
3878000	3880000	I can understand that, that you've
3880000	3882000	kind of hit your limit. And I hope, um,
3882000	3884000	I hope there will be
3884000	3886000	something that, you know, comes
3886000	3888000	from Bethesda in the future that will
3888000	3890000	hopefully surprise you pleasantly about
3890000	3892000	Prey. But I do want to say this,
3892000	3894000	speaking of support and all this, I do think this is worthy
3894000	3896000	of calling out. I did think it was very awesome
3896000	3898000	that everybody had the rainbow.
3898000	3900000	Everybody had the rainbow ribbon. I thought that was very, very
3900000	3902000	cool. A nice gesture by the
3902000	3904000	company. I just wanted to acknowledge. Oh, yeah.
3904000	3906000	I did find that really, really awesome.
3906000	3908000	Yes. And it's just,
3908000	3910000	you know,
3910000	3912000	EcumaJP
3912000	3914000	says, um, that
3914000	3916000	men are stupid and that is why we have a
3916000	3918000	story to tell. No, I
3918000	3920000	don't think that, I don't think that at all.
3920000	3922000	It's just that,
3922000	3924000	you know,
3924000	3926000	I,
3926000	3928000	I think that
3928000	3930000	I'm just really tired of it. I'm, I'm really
3930000	3932000	looking to have something that's going to be more
3932000	3934000	something I can relate to. And
3934000	3936000	not have to put myself into
3936000	3938000	the writing of
3938000	3940000	the character that
3940000	3942000	in the end, I
3942000	3944000	can't see eye to eye with.
3944000	3946000	I mean, yeah, we might
3946000	3948000	understand on views or I might feel this way in the situation.
3948000	3950000	But in the end, I don't have that
3950000	3952000	perspective. I don't necessarily want
3952000	3954000	that perspective. And I'm
3954000	3956000	tired of everything being delivered to me
3956000	3958000	from a man's perspective. Well, these are,
3958000	3960000	these are raw, real feelings and you're entitled
3960000	3962000	to them, whether somebody agrees with you or not.
3962000	3964000	Um, in chat,
3964000	3966000	Alan Alchemy over at live.vongnetwork.com
3966000	3968000	says, it's her $60. If people refuse
3968000	3970000	to see movies with Michael Bay or Adam Sandler
3970000	3972000	on principle, people can avoid video games
3972000	3974000	for whatever reason they want as well.
3974000	3976000	Um, Bobby in chat with a
3976000	3978000	counterpoint and I'll kind of let you
3978000	3980000	respond and then close this and move on.
3980000	3982000	Uh, Bobby in chat says, I have no problem with someone
3982000	3984000	not spending their $60 on it, but I hope this doesn't become
3984000	3986000	a movement to limit storytellers to
3986000	3988000	only have them be female protagonists.
3988000	3990000	That's what I worry about. If we can get
3990000	3992000	to a point, and I've said this before about
3992000	3994000	every type of representation
3994000	3996000	for every
3996000	3998000	aspect of diversity, we need
3998000	4000000	to get to a point where
4000000	4002000	it doesn't matter because
4002000	4004000	it's common. Where it becomes
4004000	4006000	just part of the story.
4006000	4008000	Where the representation across
4008000	4010000	the board is so
4010000	4012000	normalized that we're not
4012000	4014000	going to see,
4014000	4016000	oh, this is, we need a diversity
4016000	4018000	so let's throw a woman in here.
4018000	4020000	Oh, we need them to be diverse so let's
4020000	4022000	make her a lesbian while we're at it.
4022000	4024000	And we'll make her Asian too.
4024000	4026000	You know, it's
4026000	4028000	not, you make this a decision to
4028000	4030000	be diverse. It's, you make this
4030000	4032000	a decision to tell a good story.
4032000	4034000	This plays into who this character
4034000	4036000	is. And my
4036000	4038000	perfect ideal of
4038000	4040000	equality for everybody
4040000	4042000	is when we
4042000	4044000	don't have to worry about
4044000	4046000	safe spaces. When we don't
4046000	4048000	have to worry about representation.
4048000	4050000	When we don't have to worry
4050000	4052000	about, oh, that's so novel that they
4052000	4054000	did that. Or kudos to
4054000	4056000	Pixar for having a lesbian
4056000	4058000	couple and finding Dory.
4058000	4060000	Where it's normal.
4060000	4062000	And no one has to care.
4062000	4064000	Does that make sense?
4064000	4066000	It's fair, yes it does.
4066000	4068000	Alright. Let's move on.
4068000	4070000	However, just in the interest of trying to cover
4070000	4072000	some of these other stories before because we're obviously
4072000	4074000	running very late tonight. We do want to try to at least
4074000	4076000	take a couple calls over
4076000	4078000	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
4078000	4080000	But I think that's all we got. That was it
4080000	4082000	for the presser, right? So Loki,
4082000	4084000	anything you're going to be buying out of that?
4084000	4086000	Probably just Skyrim HD
4086000	4088000	and then I don't need to buy the DLC
4088000	4090000	because I have the season pass.
4090000	4092000	Because that's why they increased the price of the season pass after
4092000	4094000	marches because of all the additional DLC.
4094000	4096000	So I'm good there.
4096000	4098000	That's it.
4098000	4100000	I just want to mention
4100000	4102000	this very nice closure in chat.
4102000	4104000	Bobby responding to what DarkSakura said saying
4104000	4106000	I hear you. I may not agree 100%
4106000	4108000	but I hear you and I'm listening. And I think that's very
4108000	4110000	nice closure on that.
4110000	4112000	Okay, so let's move on with some
4112000	4114000	other news.
4114000	4116000	Because there's still a lot we haven't talked about yet.
4116000	4118000	So we're going to try to run through some of these stories here
4118000	4120000	so we can get to calls. So Loki?
4120000	4122000	So there's another game that was announced, or a new game
4122000	4124000	I should say, that's being announced by Volition.
4124000	4126000	Sadly it's not another Saints Row game.
4126000	4128000	But it's a game called
4128000	4130000	Agents of Mayhem.
4130000	4132000	And it's like this futuristic
4132000	4134000	single player game where
4134000	4136000	you have like a team of
4136000	4138000	I don't know, almost like pirates.
4138000	4140000	But futuristic pirates I guess.
4140000	4142000	And they have different abilities and you can switch between them.
4142000	4144000	And it looks pretty awesome.
4144000	4146000	No multiplayer though, that's kind of sad.
4146000	4148000	It almost looks like it's sort of tied into
4148000	4150000	the Saints but it's not. It's a completely different world
4150000	4152000	they've confirmed. It just happens to
4152000	4154000	have almost the same logo
4154000	4156000	and all
4156000	4158000	tours in there. But apparently all tours also in
4158000	4160000	Red Faction so that doesn't necessarily
4160000	4162000	mean anything. But
4162000	4164000	yeah, they were showing that off and that should be out sometime
4164000	4166000	in 2017 for the
4166000	4168000	consoles and PC.
4168000	4170000	Alright, I know
4170000	4172000	when I heard about that I definitely thought of you.
4172000	4174000	Well right, yeah I looked at it
4174000	4176000	but I don't know. I had to see
4176000	4178000	more of it. It's not that exciting.
4178000	4180000	I want
4180000	4182000	a new Saints Row game.
4182000	4184000	But I'll check it out I guess.
4184000	4186000	If the humor's there I'm on board.
4186000	4188000	Right, yeah.
4188000	4190000	There was a quote
4190000	4192000	out there that was like a hoi mother fucker
4192000	4194000	or something.
4194000	4196000	It was pretty funny.
4196000	4198000	It looks interesting. I like the art style
4198000	4200000	so it'd be cool to see if that carries on through the game.
4200000	4202000	Sony confirming
4202000	4204000	this week that it exists but it will
4204000	4206000	not be at E3 and that is
4206000	4208000	Andrew House, CEO of Sony Interactive
4208000	4210000	Entertainment confirming there is
4210000	4212000	a high-end PS4.
4212000	4214000	Not calling it the Neo or the 4K
4214000	4216000	or any of those names that have been thrown around
4216000	4218000	the internet. However in an interview with the
4218000	4220000	Financial Times he confirmed
4220000	4222000	it is intended to sit alongside and
4222000	4224000	compliment the standard PlayStation 4.
4224000	4226000	We will be selling both
4226000	4228000	versions through the lifecycle.
4228000	4230000	I don't like it.
4230000	4232000	I need to hear more details.
4232000	4234000	It better have sparkles.
4234000	4236000	I'm actually
4236000	4238000	glad it's not at
4238000	4240000	E3 because with the VR
4240000	4242000	kind of being around the corner
4242000	4244000	this tells me that they are expecting
4244000	4246000	for this holiday that VR will be a
4246000	4248000	solid experience without this
4248000	4250000	Neo or whatever.
4250000	4252000	I hope that's the case.
4252000	4254000	I really hope so too. Because that's gonna really
4254000	4256000	fuck it up for me if it is because
4256000	4258000	it's just
4258000	4260000	you get everybody hyped up about
4260000	4262000	your VR and then like, oh by the
4262000	4264000	way you kind of need a new console to actually get
4264000	4266000	to work right. You know it's like fuck you.
4266000	4268000	That's kind of fucked up if that's the case.
4268000	4270000	So I need to see how
4270000	4272000	it goes. I mean I have it pre-ordered.
4272000	4274000	I put the $100 down but like
4274000	4276000	I'm gonna be pissed if I spend $500
4276000	4278000	on a PlayStation VR and then Res HD
4278000	4280000	is the only thing I get to play. Actually
4280000	4282000	I won't be that upset.
4282000	4284000	I would assume that it will
4284000	4286000	buy the newer system
4286000	4288000	and have it work but it's just like
4288000	4290000	I shouldn't have to
4290000	4292000	if I'm paying like $400 for a new
4292000	4294000	system and $400
4294000	4296000	for the you know
4296000	4298000	VR like
4298000	4300000	I might as well just spend a little bit more and just get a fucking
4300000	4302000	Vive and a high end PC at that point.
4302000	4304000	That's my thing. It's like
4304000	4306000	I bought a console
4306000	4308000	to avoid this shit.
4308000	4310000	This like yearly update bullshit
4310000	4312000	and now they're like hmm we want some of that
4312000	4314000	some of that cell phone tablet
4314000	4316000	Apple money. Fuck you.
4316000	4318000	I am not doing this shit
4318000	4320000	and I don't know
4320000	4322000	I'm kind of curious to see what devs think about this
4322000	4324000	because it's just if you have to keep
4324000	4326000	making sure oh I gotta make sure my game
4326000	4328000	runs better on this version
4328000	4330000	of it and not so
4330000	4332000	not or it still runs on the other one as well
4332000	4334000	and I don't know. Yeah I gotta
4334000	4336000	really see what this is about. I mean the
4336000	4338000	Apple cell phone thing that earns my money
4338000	4340000	every other year at least. You know I feel like
4340000	4342000	the upgrade is enough to justify it every other year.
4342000	4344000	But it's something that you use every day and
4344000	4346000	I mean it's something like true I
4346000	4348000	use mine all the time and I don't necessarily do
4348000	4350000	anything graphically intensive on it. It's not like
4350000	4352000	I'm
4352000	4354000	those things can pack a punch.
4354000	4356000	So right now I understand that but like
4356000	4358000	I feel
4358000	4360000	you know I can get by for
4360000	4362000	a few years if I don't want to
4362000	4364000	necessarily do all this stuff but like I'm
4364000	4366000	not I don't buy
4366000	4368000	my phone to game on and I'm not
4368000	4370000	buying one every other year or so.
4370000	4372000	I mean I tend to buy mine until it just
4372000	4374000	doesn't fucking work anymore then I'll buy a new one.
4374000	4376000	And that's I think how it should be with the
4376000	4378000	consoles. If you're going to keep coming out with new consoles
4378000	4380000	each year like call them a different
4380000	4382000	console or something. I mean just
4382000	4384000	I don't like this just
4384000	4386000	upgrading specs. If I want to just upgrade specs
4386000	4388000	every year that's a PC.
4388000	4390000	I'm buying a PC at that point.
4390000	4392000	Why am I supporting the consoles then?
4392000	4394000	Alright. Let's move
4394000	4396000	on with some more news though so we can get to calls.
4396000	4398000	Dark Soccer do you want to take this next story?
4398000	4400000	Yes.
4400000	4402000	Speaking back on representation
4404000	4406000	there was some
4406000	4408000	negativity unleashed toward Ubisoft
4408000	4410000	regarding Watch Dogs 2.
4410000	4412000	There's a bunch of racist
4412000	4414000	assholes out there who
4414000	4416000	are upset that the hero
4416000	4418000	of Watch Dogs 2 is black.
4418000	4420000	A black hacktivist.
4420000	4422000	What's wrong with you
4422000	4424000	people? What is wrong
4424000	4426000	with you? No stop. Stop right
4426000	4428000	now if you're listening to this podcast look
4428000	4430000	in the mirror and say me
4430000	4432000	what the fuck is wrong with you?
4432000	4434000	I give
4434000	4436000	our listeners a lot of credit that they're pretty
4436000	4438000	intelligent to be listening to this show. Yes.
4438000	4440000	Honestly I'm going to say this very bluntly
4440000	4442000	anybody that felt that way
4442000	4444000	would have already tuned out on your
4444000	4446000	last rant. Let's be real. Well fuck them too.
4446000	4448000	So I mean if they've made it
4448000	4450000	this far I think people understand.
4450000	4452000	Who cares what the skin color is of the
4452000	4454000	protagonist. Some people care because
4454000	4456000	they're stupid. But we need to know
4456000	4458000	whether the game is going to just be all
4458000	4460000	downgraded like it was before. That's what
4460000	4462000	I'm interested to find out. I think
4462000	4464000	yay for
4464000	4466000	there being a black person in the lead.
4466000	4468000	I think that is great. And who gives a
4468000	4470000	shit about a black person being the lead? There's a black
4470000	4472000	person in the lead of Grand Theft Auto 5
4472000	4474000	which sold 60 million copies.
4474000	4476000	I don't think you fucking care.
4476000	4478000	I mean seriously. Very true.
4478000	4480000	Who gives a shit?
4480000	4482000	Very true. Yeah so if
4482000	4484000	it's just
4484000	4486000	Twitter needs to just be taken
4486000	4488000	away from some people.
4488000	4490000	It's just people dislike things.
4490000	4492000	And people
4492000	4494000	dislike all sorts of things. And they
4494000	4496000	whatever. I mean you can't
4496000	4498000	please everybody. Honestly
4498000	4500000	I wouldn't want to run into these people online anyway
4500000	4502000	so it's probably best they don't get the game.
4502000	4504000	It's just like I mean 60 million people
4504000	4506000	though. If they had such a problem with it
4506000	4508000	they wouldn't have bought Grand Theft Auto 5
4508000	4510000	60 million times.
4510000	4512000	Let's move on Loki.
4512000	4514000	Alright so this is pretty exciting.
4514000	4516000	You know I didn't quite buy in
4516000	4518000	on this whole Lego Dimensions
4518000	4520000	thing originally.
4520000	4522000	Oh I'm sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here.
4522000	4524000	Oh no we actually missed that last time.
4524000	4526000	So let me cover the Lego Dimensions thing real
4526000	4528000	fast. And I'll get
4528000	4530000	to the other thing. So Lego Dimensions
4530000	4532000	they announced basically their
4532000	4534000	season 2 or I guess the new set of
4534000	4536000	properties that are going to be attached
4536000	4538000	to this. And I got to say I am super
4538000	4540000	excited about it. It's like before they
4540000	4542000	had the whole thing where it's kind of the cross
4542000	4544000	franchises. You know you have Back to
4544000	4546000	the Future. Fucking Doctor Who.
4546000	4548000	You know all this stuff going together. Now
4548000	4550000	it's just it's fucking
4550000	4552000	crazy 80's shit.
4552000	4554000	So here's what they've got.
4554000	4556000	They've got A-Team, Adventure
4556000	4558000	Time, Harry Potter
4558000	4560000	Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
4560000	4562000	The Goonies, Gremlins
4562000	4564000	Knight Rider
4564000	4566000	Fucking Lego City Undercover, Sonic the Hedgehog
4566000	4568000	Powerpuff Girls, Teen Titans Go
4568000	4570000	Beetlejuice and E.T.
4570000	4572000	It's pretty badass. That is
4572000	4574000	fucking amazing. I feel like this is
4574000	4576000	a game that's aimed towards 30 somethings
4576000	4578000	and I'm eating it up. It's just like they're like
4578000	4580000	hey we know where the money is and damn
4580000	4582000	right you know where the money is and it's fucking
4582000	4584000	Legos so you know what if that
4584000	4586000	and they just they just walked into a
4586000	4588000	what's that new store called we went to an art
4588000	4590000	firm called the Brick House is that what it's called?
4590000	4592000	It's that new store that's just like a bunch of like nerd stuff
4592000	4594000	and I swear to god the Lego people just went there and went
4594000	4596000	we're gonna get that that that that
4596000	4598000	that that that like every
4598000	4600000	shirt in the store they're like we need that license
4600000	4602000	that license and then of course I
4602000	4604000	missed they also have
4604000	4606000	the main campaign
4606000	4608000	that's gonna be in there is the new Ghostbusters
4608000	4610000	movie that's as well and it
4610000	4612000	it's not something and what's cool about this you don't
4612000	4614000	need to buy
4614000	4616000	a new portal or anything it works with the old
4616000	4618000	portal and those will work for any future
4618000	4620000	versions of the game as well it's coming out September
4620000	4622000	27th but the only thing that really
4622000	4624000	stopped me from buying this originally is the price
4624000	4626000	because it's a Lego premium those sets are
4626000	4628000	like $30 for each of the expansions
4628000	4630000	and like the the actual toys
4630000	4632000	are like $20 it gets really expensive
4632000	4634000	yeah but it's
4634000	4636000	really hard you'll pay it for the Goonies it's
4636000	4638000	really hard to like not want to buy all
4638000	4640000	this shit so that's
4640000	4642000	the only problem and uh Bobby
4642000	4644000	in chat pointing out it's not Lego Dimensions 2
4644000	4646000	it's just the regular Lego dimensions
4646000	4648000	yeah it's just more stuff
4648000	4650000	which which is great
4650000	4652000	it is they're not gonna like incrementally
4652000	4654000	you know do more that's great but like seriously
4654000	4656000	that's like fucking 80s
4656000	4658000	crazy right there
4658000	4660000	alright um well let's
4660000	4662000	move on and um
4662000	4664000	I'm not sure our show role seems a little
4664000	4666000	borked right now I think some old stuff got in there somehow but
4666000	4668000	I'm going to move on to this story about
4668000	4670000	I skipped what the story was I had because it was honestly
4670000	4672000	not that interesting
4672000	4674000	well let's talk about the Dorito machine
4674000	4676000	that's at E3 have you guys seen the pictures
4676000	4678000	of this going up there's a gigantic
4678000	4680000	arcade game in the middle of the
4680000	4682000	street uh and I'm assuming
4682000	4684000	it's in one of those parking lots around the area
4684000	4686000	yes I can imagine all the traffic that would cause
4686000	4688000	from being in oh my I would know
4688000	4690000	how am I I don't know what the fuck is this
4690000	4692000	Doritos machine doing here it's gonna be a mess
4692000	4694000	uh but anyway uh
4694000	4696000	there's a bunch of other fan stuff going around but there's a
4696000	4698000	huge Doritos arcade thing
4698000	4700000	uh that is gonna be having I guess
4700000	4702000	concerts on one level of it and
4702000	4704000	then like a giant screen I mean it just
4704000	4706000	I thought it was a giant Trojan horse to get Jeff
4706000	4708000	Keeley into the actual E3 event
4710000	4712000	he is after all the Doritos pope
4712000	4714000	it's kinda neat I guess it's visibility
4714000	4716000	for all of E3 but it's a little
4716000	4718000	bit like okay this is a bit
4718000	4720000	it's just funny that it's Doritos too
4720000	4722000	does it have fountains that shoot Mountain Dew on it
4722000	4724000	when somebody gets a new high score just everybody
4724000	4726000	gets sprayed with Mountain Dew
4726000	4728000	it actually sounds disgusting
4730000	4732000	alright um
4732000	4734000	let's talk our last story tonight
4734000	4736000	uh don't think there's a
4736000	4738000	last story for me showing Rob
4738000	4740000	uh is it about Star Trek Online
4740000	4742000	oh sorry I was looking at

4770000	4772000	expansion to start the characters
4772000	4774000	of the game in the era
4774000	4776000	of the original Star Trek

4844000	4846000	on what I should cook for dinner
4846000	4848000	on Thursday and Friday by the way included

4864000	4866000	the answer my friend
4866000	4868000	if you're wondering what to cook the answer
4868000	4870000	is always tacos
4870000	4872000	tacos
4872000	4874000	uh there you go
4874000	4876000	did anybody take time off work for E3
4876000	4878000	this year? I did not
4878000	4880000	I thought about it but no I didn't
4880000	4882000	but see with the job that I have now or at least
4882000	4884000	the position I'm in I can listen to the podcast
4884000	4886000	most of the day so I'm just gonna
4886000	4888000	watch the presentations while I work
4888000	4890000	that's nice so I'm just gonna do that
4890000	4892000	sadly I will not have that option
4892000	4894000	I teach tomorrow so I'm in a class
4894000	4896000	all day so pretty I'll get to watch
4896000	4898000	Sony but I will not get to watch Microsoft
4898000	4900000	which is kind of a bummer so I'll just have to kind of
4900000	4902000	catch the highlight reel
4902000	4904000	yeah I might be the vice versa cause I'm gonna be having the
4904000	4906000	wrangle kids during Sony so
4906000	4908000	I usually try to catch it
4908000	4910000	while I'm cooking dinner or something
4910000	4912000	but
4912000	4914000	and then I'm very curious about the Zelda stuff
4914000	4916000	on Tuesday what that all is gonna
4916000	4918000	entail
4918000	4920000	my hype is not that great for
4920000	4922000	well that's good to set the bar low
4922000	4924000	well I mean I'm
4924000	4926000	excited about the game but I'm just like
4926000	4928000	is that it? I mean like I really wish they
4928000	4930000	had a presentation of some
4930000	4932000	sort of showing the other things
4932000	4934000	cause I know they have more than just Zelda
4934000	4936000	there are other things but they're not talking
4936000	4938000	about it for why
4938000	4940000	I don't understand the reason for that
4940000	4942000	yeah
4942000	4944000	let's get to the phones it's your chance to

4972000	4974000	any last minute
4974000	4976000	stories we wanna try and work in here Loki
4976000	4978000	so you know how there is all these
4978000	4980000	Microsoft leaks and
4980000	4982000	not only did the new system come out but
4982000	4984000	Dead Rising 4 is another thing that got
4984000	4986000	leaked out with actual gameplay
4986000	4988000	right
4988000	4990000	also ReCore was another thing
4990000	4992000	so GameSpot decided to email
4992000	4994000	Microsoft to get their comment on the leaks
4994000	4996000	and all they did was send them
4996000	4998000	a Shruggy like
4998000	5000000	an Aski Shrug
5000000	5002000	and then a link to their E3
5002000	5004000	page and they're like eh
5004000	5006000	that was their official response
5006000	5008000	I thought that was funny
5008000	5010000	I'm glad they have a sense of humor about it
5010000	5012000	that's funny stay tuned
5012000	5014000	sounds like Bloodstained Ritual
5014000	5016000	of the Night will be playable at E3

5018000	5020000	what comes out of that
5020000	5022000	didn't they just release a playable version of that
5022000	5024000	or they were supposed to be releasing
5024000	5026000	some sort of beta or something
5026000	5028000	I saw something I think either this week or last
5028000	5030000	Raginator
5030000	5032000	in chat is saying no love for GOG this week
5032000	5034000	big GOG deals
5034000	5036000	we gave a little love to GOG last week
5036000	5038000	to be fair and they're not paying us
5038000	5040000	but since you brought it up
5040000	5042000	this is the season for summer sales
5042000	5044000	I'm sure GOG's got theirs
5044000	5046000	what Steam's ought to be in a couple of weeks
5046000	5048000	they already have the cards up
5048000	5050000	there's a pretty good Humble Bundle right now too
5050000	5052000	I haven't checked it out
5052000	5054000	but yeah I do need to get that one because that's the one that has
5054000	5056000	that cool drifting game in it
5056000	5058000	again Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype
5058000	5060000	you know what we didn't talk about that also leaked
5060000	5062000	was Injustice 2
5062000	5064000	did you check any of that out? Injustice 2
5064000	5066000	it looked okay I mean I didn't play the first one
5066000	5068000	I have it for free since they gave it away
5068000	5070000	like a couple of years ago
5070000	5072000	so I gotta check that out
5072000	5074000	some DLC apparently already
5074000	5076000	being teased now people are reading into
5076000	5078000	some of the things that Ed Boon is saying but some of the
5078000	5080000	teased DLC Blue Beetle
5080000	5082000	Captain Cold and Swamp Thing
5082000	5084000	one of the things
5084000	5086000	though I didn't really care for about it
5086000	5088000	they were saying that they have like it's almost
5088000	5090000	it sounds like
5090000	5092000	the Overwatch loot crates that you get
5092000	5094000	or something so you basically get
5094000	5096000	these like unlocks for different armors
5096000	5098000	or something after
5098000	5100000	each match or something and I guess you
5100000	5102000	can pay to get more of those or something
5102000	5104000	I don't know I didn't really catch that
5104000	5106000	on the Nintendo
5106000	5108000	side did you see the two new Pokemon for
5108000	5110000	Sun and Moon that was in the magazine
5110000	5112000	oh I don't give a shit about that
5112000	5114000	they looked really cute though I will say there was like a cute
5114000	5116000	little koala bear looking thing
5116000	5118000	like holding a log and he's like
5118000	5120000	this is my log kind of like the log lady from Twin Peaks
5120000	5122000	this is my log and then there was like a little
5122000	5124000	puppy thingy too so it was
5124000	5126000	cute I mean if Pokemon
5126000	5128000	need to be cute right because someday
5128000	5130000	they might be in Pokemon Go I mean I know
5130000	5132000	Pokemon Go is only the first 150
5132000	5134000	they keep adding Pokemon to it because they have like
5134000	5136000	107 was the max and now it's like
5136000	5138000	130 something
5138000	5140000	yeah I think Porygon
5140000	5142000	is as high as it goes in the Pokedex so far
5142000	5144000	I think
5144000	5146000	yeah we'll see no I think it's higher
5146000	5148000	than that now I don't know we'll see
5148000	5150000	anyway also
5150000	5152000	World of Final Fantasy is
5152000	5154000	launching in October
5154000	5156000	hmm did you check out the
5156000	5158000	footage for World of Final Fantasy I'll be checking
5158000	5160000	that out that looks pretty cool I don't
5160000	5162000	remember what that is
5162000	5164000	it is the extra
5164000	5166000	Final Fantasy game that's the one that they were
5166000	5168000	teasing that I think is
5168000	5170000	the experience that is specifically made
5170000	5172000	for I'm trying to remember if this is the one
5172000	5174000	about the cell phones
5174000	5176000	no this is different this is the
5176000	5178000	one that's kind of more appealing to children
5178000	5180000	and they showed like a real
5180000	5182000	brief teaser of it last year
5182000	5184000	it's going to be on Playstation 4 and Playstation Vita
5184000	5186000	and it's going to come out October 25th
5186000	5188000	you remember there was a real quick glimpse of this
5188000	5190000	at the Playstation thing last year and it was like very
5190000	5192000	chibi Final Fantasy characters and all that
5192000	5194000	yeah
5194000	5196000	it's going to be very busy for Final Fantasy
5196000	5198000	this year with Final Fantasy 15 coming out
5198000	5200000	very soon
5200000	5202000	I
5202000	5204000	will put out one more call for calls
5204000	5206000	and then I'm going to assume people just
5206000	5208000	got caught up in watching Morgan Webb
5208000	5210000	and Adam Sessler and didn't come back
5210000	5212000	Orange Lounge Radio
5212000	5214000	all one word on Skype
5214000	5216000	of course if you didn't get through on Skype tonight
5216000	5218000	if you were doing other stuff tonight and weren't able to join us live
5218000	5220000	you can always send us an email
5220000	5222000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com
5222000	5224000	you know I did just remember
5224000	5226000	we did the mailbag
5226000	5228000	and then we did not do the FUs of the week
5228000	5230000	which usually comes right after the mailbag
5230000	5232000	so I think this is a good opportunity for us to get
5232000	5234000	a little bit ranty
5238000	5240000	all this is bad
5240000	5242000	here is justice
5242000	5244000	here is punishment
5244000	5246000	here
5246000	5248000	is it fucked up
5250000	5252000	FU
5252000	5254000	to haters everywhere
5254000	5256000	especially the ones who decide
5256000	5258000	to act on it
5258000	5260000	and FU to this asshole that my sister is
5260000	5262000	friends with I don't know what the fuck caught up to your ass
5262000	5264000	but you suck
5264000	5266000	uh Loki
5266000	5268000	um FU in my car
5268000	5270000	cause the other day as I was leaving the show
5270000	5272000	my check engine light came on
5272000	5274000	and the drive light was flashing
5274000	5276000	which means the transmission problem
5276000	5278000	except the problem is my car is driving just fine
5278000	5280000	and then a day later it went off
5280000	5282000	so I'm gonna assume everything is okay
5282000	5284000	until it finally breaks
5284000	5286000	I don't know it's buggy
5286000	5288000	and blame it
5288000	5290000	you know what the problem was
5290000	5292000	and the reason it came on
5292000	5294000	some dumb ass little ass dog
5294000	5296000	in the car instead of killing it
5296000	5298000	I decided to swerve a little bit to the left
5298000	5300000	and hit the brakes
5300000	5302000	and then the stupid light came on
5302000	5304000	so apparently there was a loose sensor or some shit
5304000	5306000	fucking dog
5306000	5308000	shit killed your ass
5308000	5310000	don't talk about killing your dog
5310000	5312000	I didn't though
5312000	5314000	I can say that now because he's still alive
5314000	5316000	uh I'm gonna just defer
5316000	5318000	to what I said at the opening of the show
5318000	5320000	for my FU of the week
5320000	5322000	honestly that's all the anger I have
5322000	5324000	in that department right now so there you go
5324000	5326000	alright um
5326000	5328000	I guess I guess that's
5328000	5330000	oh wait last minute
5330000	5332000	somebody's waiting at the last minute to call in
5332000	5334000	but let's get to it hi you're on orange songs radio who's this
5334000	5336000	hey this is akdef
5336000	5338000	hey akdef thanks for not leaving us too lonely this week
5338000	5340000	in the skype segment I was getting a little worried
5340000	5342000	what's on your mind
5342000	5344000	well
5344000	5346000	uh
5346000	5348000	I'm gonna ask you a question
5348000	5350000	first of all
5350000	5352000	yeah
5352000	5354000	to all of you
5354000	5356000	I don't know if it can be plausible
5356000	5358000	but how exciting
5358000	5360000	would it be to have
5360000	5362000	like nintendo
5362000	5364000	announcing okay since
5364000	5366000	you saw the demo
5366000	5368000	for Legend of Zelda for Wii U
5368000	5370000	and NX
5370000	5372000	we're gonna have it on the eShop right now
5372000	5374000	and you can download it on
5374000	5376000	well in this case on tuesday
5376000	5378000	how exciting would that be
5378000	5380000	I wish but
5380000	5382000	we're past those days unfortunately
5382000	5384000	those were the days of the early
5384000	5386000	xbox 360 and what 2006
5386000	5388000	c3 2005 c3
5388000	5390000	sadly those days are gone
5390000	5392000	they would not put it up because it would be reversed engineered
5392000	5394000	people would start modding it
5394000	5396000	doing crazy crap to it trying to dig through the files
5396000	5398000	find secrets and I mean
5398000	5400000	I think nintendo's probably just focused
5400000	5402000	on finishing the damn game
5402000	5404000	it's probably enough of an inconvenience for them to have to do
5404000	5406000	this e3 thing anyway which by the way
5406000	5408000	I think you're not seeing the nx version
5408000	5410000	at e3 because
5410000	5412000	you know they have to cut a demo specifically
5412000	5414000	for e3
5414000	5416000	but we do live in a day and age
5416000	5418000	of live streaming and so
5418000	5420000	maybe you're not gonna be able to play the demo yourself
5420000	5422000	but you'll be able to watch somebody else
5422000	5424000	do it live like right
5424000	5426000	there you know the one thing that's gonna be
5426000	5428000	missing is the controller so
5428000	5430000	I think maybe that's just
5430000	5432000	what they want that'll be a little more controlled
5432000	5434000	I think that's just what it boils down to
5434000	5436000	well that's for sure
5436000	5438000	well if we don't have at least
5438000	5440000	that surprise announcement
5440000	5442000	what surprise announcement
5442000	5444000	would you like from
5444000	5446000	well for many of the companies left
5446000	5448000	on e3
5448000	5450000	from
5450000	5452000	nintendo
5452000	5454000	there's the rumors going around
5454000	5456000	about earthbound 3
5456000	5458000	or mother 3 you know whatever they're gonna end up
5458000	5460000	calling it I would really love to
5460000	5462000	see that become a reality I'm not gonna hold my
5462000	5464000	breath too much
5464000	5466000	but from nintendo I've just kind of accepted the
5466000	5468000	fact that it's just not gonna happen this year
5468000	5470000	I just need to wait till next year
5470000	5472000	I am still gonna really hope that
5472000	5474000	and I know it
5474000	5476000	sounds weird to talk about old shit
5476000	5478000	but I really would like to hear that maybe
5478000	5480000	Microsoft is gonna make a major expansion
5480000	5482000	on the backwards compatibility catalog
5482000	5484000	this week
5484000	5486000	and perhaps that Playstation 1
5486000	5488000	games will be playable at least
5488000	5490000	Playstation 1 games will be playable again on
5490000	5492000	Playstation 4 I really really think it's time
5492000	5494000	and that would be a very nice surprise
5494000	5496000	I would look forward to which I know is weird to talk
5496000	5498000	about old shit but this is
5498000	5500000	important this is the reason why so cause I don't want
5500000	5502000	you going well Rob they're gonna talk about
5502000	5504000	old shit at e3 then what the fuck is the
5504000	5506000	point of e3 because you
5506000	5508000	can still have the old shit but with the
5508000	5510000	new frills that have
5510000	5512000	bridged the Playstation 3 and Playstation
5512000	5514000	4 you know what was the big
5514000	5516000	jump we took this generation
5516000	5518000	the social end of things right
5518000	5520000	so if I can play the Playstation 1 games
5520000	5522000	and stream them or
5522000	5524000	do the share play things so I
5524000	5526000	can play with friends
5526000	5528000	across a great distance that's
5528000	5530000	gonna breathe whole new life into
5530000	5532000	some of the old library there so
5532000	5534000	that's why I get excited
5534000	5536000	about the old games and the new shell
5536000	5538000	if that makes sense
5538000	5540000	yeah it absolutely
5540000	5542000	makes sense like I was actually
5542000	5544000	thinking right now that
5544000	5546000	when they announced that
5546000	5548000	new bibriven was coming to
5548000	5550000	beta and Playstation 3 like
5550000	5552000	2 years ago or
5552000	5554000	at least yeah I think 2 years
5554000	5556000	ago right yeah
5556000	5558000	and I was thinking they never
5558000	5560000	like follow
5560000	5562000	follow that up like
5562000	5564000	they should probably
5564000	5566000	yeah announce like oh
5566000	5568000	you can now play Playstation 1
5568000	5570000	games on PS4 like bibriven
5570000	5572000	and hey we're gonna announce
5572000	5574000	a new bibriven with
5574000	5576000	3 support or at least digital
5576000	5578000	yeah and that never happened
5578000	5580000	on Playstation 4 it happened on 3 but not
5580000	5582000	4 so yeah be curious
5582000	5584000	I do wanna
5584000	5586000	point this out as well when it comes to Sony
5586000	5588000	is that I think Sony is under
5588000	5590000	and for me like an expectation I really
5590000	5592000	have of them is to deliver
5592000	5594000	something really big this holiday
5594000	5596000	and you know I
5596000	5598000	fully expect there'll probably be a God of War 4
5598000	5600000	announcement I don't think it'll be ready for this holiday
5600000	5602000	but I think something they've been
5602000	5604000	teasing us with over the past couple years
5604000	5606000	they need to date for this holiday
5606000	5608000	like it's fucking time already Sony needs to
5608000	5610000	put up with some of the stuff that they've been showing
5610000	5612000	my gut tells me
5612000	5614000	Last Guardian is gonna be that game finally
5614000	5616000	will be that game and that's what we're gonna get this holiday
5616000	5618000	that's just cause I don't think it's Final Fantasy 7
5618000	5620000	not with 15 this year
5620000	5622000	it certainly ain't Kingdom Hearts 3
5622000	5624000	uh especially with you know
5624000	5626000	2.8 is gonna be that game anyway I kinda
5626000	5628000	think it's time the game looked
5628000	5630000	to be far enough along and what we saw last year
5630000	5632000	I really think Last Guardian is that game and that's my expectation
5632000	5634000	yeah that's
5634000	5636000	probably true
5636000	5638000	let me ask you this question
5638000	5640000	before I let you go ActDeft there was a
5640000	5642000	pretty big game that came out a couple days ago
5642000	5644000	which sadly we've all been distracted
5644000	5646000	in other ways we haven't been able to talk about it but I know
5646000	5648000	I know you have had to have spent
5648000	5650000	some time with Kirby RoboBot
5650000	5652000	oh yeah
5652000	5654000	Kirby Planet RoboBot I was actually gonna
5654000	5656000	ask you well all of you
5656000	5658000	why haven't you played that game but
5658000	5660000	but yeah we have all been
5660000	5662000	pretty occupied even me
5662000	5664000	I have that game
5664000	5666000	right now in front of me it's even
5666000	5668000	like on my 3DS
5668000	5670000	right now but I haven't started
5670000	5672000	yet I have been so
5672000	5674000	busy this weekend so
5674000	5676000	I haven't gotten the time to play it
5676000	5678000	uh
5678000	5680000	especially with Nintendo's calendar
5680000	5682000	being a little funky where the games come out
5682000	5684000	on Friday now right?
5684000	5686000	I can never remember what day is anymore
5686000	5688000	I think that's just you know
5688000	5690000	and I'm gonna be honest ActDeft
5690000	5692000	I like Kirby but do I like
5692000	5694000	Kirby enough to drop that money on it
5694000	5696000	I kinda just need to hear some of the feedback
5696000	5698000	first and see if it's something that
5698000	5700000	I really think is gonna be up my alley before I drop
5700000	5702000	the 30 bucks on it
5702000	5704000	well if something I have been watching
5704000	5706000	and reading reviews it's getting a lot of positive
5706000	5708000	reviews that's good
5708000	5710000	it's one of
5710000	5712000	and even some of my friends
5712000	5714000	that aren't
5714000	5716000	into Kirby
5716000	5718000	are really liking it right now
5718000	5720000	so that's something
5720000	5722000	I just
5722000	5724000	I'm waiting even to
5724000	5726000	just do all art to finish so I can play it
5726000	5728000	alright
5728000	5730000	then we're gonna let you go so we can wrap it up
5730000	5732000	ActDeft

5734000	5736000	thanks for having me
5736000	5738000	alright good call
5738000	5740000	I don't really see the
5740000	5742000	phones lighting up and we're well after
5742000	5744000	9 o'clock here on the west coast I think we are going
5744000	5746000	to shut things down here
5746000	5748000	at Orange Lounge Radio but I do wanna
5748000	5750000	thank all you guys for listening again this
5750000	5752000	week really appreciate it I know it was a bit of a shorter
5752000	5754000	show for those of you guys on the podcast feed but again
5754000	5756000	remember there was a big hour
5756000	5758000	15 minute chunk that we lost there while we were
5758000	5760000	watching the press conference
5760000	5762000	as I'm sure a lot of you were
5762000	5764000	over the weekend but we will be back
5764000	5766000	next excuse me
5766000	5768000	we will be back next
5768000	5770000	week to do a full recap of
5770000	5772000	E3 to talk about our
5772000	5774000	impressions of what we do see from Microsoft
5774000	5776000	Sony, Nintendo
5776000	5778000	who else still has to go? Ubisoft
5778000	5780000	got one to go, PC
5780000	5782000	Conference which again I'm not
5782000	5784000	expecting much out of but you never know
5784000	5786000	yeah let me see what we got on the list here real fast
5786000	5788000	I feel like I'm missing somebody
5788000	5790000	does Square have a conference? No they already
5790000	5792000	they did like their stream already
5792000	5794000	yeah they dropped their hints already
5794000	5796000	let's see here so there is
5796000	5798000	god dammit
5798000	5800000	tomorrow ok here we go here we go
5800000	5802000	so we've got
5802000	5804000	ok so EA and Bethesda have already gone
5804000	5806000	yep apparently also
5806000	5808000	in just a few minutes
5808000	5810000	there's also one from Kadokawa
5810000	5812000	I have no idea what that is that's in
5812000	5814000	20 minutes actually from now
5814000	5816000	tomorrow's Microsoft then PC Gaming
5816000	5818000	Ubisoft and then Sony
5818000	5820000	and then Nintendo has their stream
5820000	5822000	on Tuesday so really it's all
5822000	5824000	they're blowing their load tomorrow
5824000	5826000	well that's typical though for E3 week
5826000	5828000	so they
5828000	5830000	usually stretch out their conferences like multiple
5830000	5832000	days though like you'd have like EA and stuff
5832000	5834000	normally well only because
5834000	5836000	usually after Nintendo is Square Enix
5836000	5838000	but for some reason and last year actually
5838000	5840000	didn't somebody feel like there were two people
5840000	5842000	kind of in that slot last year so
5842000	5844000	I think that was lost a little bit this year
5844000	5846000	oh it was the PC thing
5846000	5848000	because with having
5848000	5850000	EA bump up a day I think that really shifted
5850000	5852000	things so it
5852000	5854000	does feel a little different this year it's going to be very different E3
5854000	5856000	but I'm excited to hear from some of the folks
5856000	5858000	who are at the show I'm hoping we can get some of our other
5858000	5860000	VoG people who actually went to the show
5860000	5862000	maybe on the show next week to talk about it a little bit
5862000	5864000	and then of course
5864000	5866000	we'll give our own perspective and we can't wait to hear
5866000	5868000	what you guys have to say let's hope for some good
5868000	5870000	surprises we'll have fun
5870000	5872000	as I end every episode
5872000	5874000	of Orange on Tradio thank you guys so much for tuning into
5874000	5876000	the show and if you enjoyed what you heard here
5876000	5878000	please tell a friend or two about the show
5878000	5880000	spread the word leave a nice 5 star
5880000	5882000	review wherever you found this show because we are
5882000	5884000	the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't put
5884000	5886000	those voices out there unless we
5886000	5888000	have them and you know I think
5888000	5890000	one thing we've definitely learned tonight perspective
5890000	5892000	and hearing from other people
5892000	5894000	can definitely be helpful
5894000	5896000	I think we can all learn from that so we want
5896000	5898000	we want more of your voices out there to be
5898000	5900000	participating with our show so
5900000	5902000	let's go around now and give everybody's
5902000	5904000	final thought Loki
5904000	5906000	I can't wait to see
5906000	5908000	what they've got in store for
5908000	5910000	Microsoft and Sony
5910000	5912000	Microsoft a lot of it's been kind of
5912000	5914000	spoiled but
5914000	5916000	so interested
5916000	5918000	to find out what they have
5918000	5920000	I'm curious to see what the
5920000	5922000	I'm assuming they're all going to be quiet about it
5922000	5924000	I kind of want to know what's going on with these new systems
5924000	5926000	it means why are you keeping us in the dark about
5926000	5928000	this shit do you not know what the fuck
5928000	5930000	is going in them because it seems like
5930000	5932000	even with like the NX I heard rumors
5932000	5934000	that they're like not manufacturing yet because they
5934000	5936000	may add VR to it it's like they don't even know what
5936000	5938000	the fuck is going to be going in those systems yet
5938000	5940000	why do we
5940000	5942000	need them if you don't know what they're for
5942000	5944000	I don't know
5944000	5946000	my final thought is the fall is
5946000	5948000	looking almost as interesting as the summer
5948000	5950000	at this point with what we were talking about at the beginning of the show
5950000	5952000	I'm very curious
5952000	5954000	to see what happens in the
5954000	5956000	fall and where all this stuff lands with these
5956000	5958000	announcements we haven't had quite yet
5958000	5960000	but dear god please don't let
5960000	5962000	Mass Effect get delayed again unless
5962000	5964000	unless they really really need it to make it a
5964000	5966000	good game and I'll understand but I just
5966000	5968000	I really want that game out oh my god
5968000	5970000	and last but not least Dark Soccer your final thought
5970000	5972000	well two things but they're related and
5972000	5974000	kind of a downer okay
5974000	5976000	I was reading a post about
5976000	5978000	cops going through
5978000	5980000	Pulse and hearing
5980000	5982000	phones ringing for people who wouldn't answer them
5982000	5984000	yeah awful and then I just
5984000	5986000	saw a post one of my friends posted
5986000	5988000	one from a lady who was trying to find her
5988000	5990000	son who was there and hadn't heard from
5990000	5992000	him in hours she
5992000	5994000	he's alive in critical condition
5994000	5996000	but he's alive
5996000	5998000	so one of the lucky ones our thoughts
5998000	6000000	pull through yeah so
6000000	6002000	um just people
6002000	6004000	out there don't take anyone you love
6004000	6006000	for granted stay close
6006000	6008000	stay in touch and
6008000	6010000	if you see anyone spouting
6010000	6012000	any kind of hateful
6012000	6014000	rhetoric you shut them down
6014000	6016000	that's all
6016000	6018000	alright and we are now gonna
6018000	6020000	shut this show down have a great week everybody
6020000	6022000	we'll do it again in seven days
6022000	6024000	have a great night and a happy E3
6050000	6052000	oh they were all still true
