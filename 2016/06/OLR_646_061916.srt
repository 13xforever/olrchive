00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Tonight, another E3 is behind us, and from Scorpio to God of War, and Breath of the Wild to Mobile Pokemon, there's a lot to discuss this week on the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange, Lounge, Radio, live tonight with episode number 646.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's the same forwards and backwards for this June the 19th, 2016. This is the show after E3.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're going to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, probably a lot of the stuff that happened this week, because it's kind of a big week for games.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My name is Rob Roberts, based out of lovely Studio N7 here in Sacramento, California. You can follow me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me, as always, my amazing co-hosts.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Say hello over there to this lovely lady who I went on a hot date with the other night. It's DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hey.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, hot date, because it's hot in Sacramento. It's always hot here.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It is.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So DarkSakura and I went and saw the Warcraft movie, which is actually kind of noteworthy because I never go to movies anymore, but Jamie was like, Rob, movie. Rob, movie.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He was like, no one wants to see Warcraft with me. Rob was like, I'll go.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, I'll go because Alan usually works weeknights, so we went.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We had a fun time.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, I got to say, you know, because we're going to get into a lot of E3 news tonight, and I know Warcraft is so last week, now that Finding Dory's out.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I actually, like, the movie was better than I thought it would be, honestly.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It was really good if you know the lore.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, if you're a gamer. I would say even if you're at least a gamer and can kind of understand video game logic a little bit.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here's your quest. Go to Dalaran. Here's your quest. Go back to here.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They definitely made a movie for Warcraft fans, which is why it's tanking in the US.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They changed some very important things in the first war.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm okay with the little changes. Things are going to happen for the movie's sake.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, plus, like, Garona in the movie was half orc, half human, and she's not that in the game.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But when the first game came out, she thought she was half orc, half human.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Spoiler alert. Well, the games are how old at this point.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, yeah, and it turns out she's half draenei instead.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And we'll join the movie!

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, for like two seconds.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, yeah, and then they... I'm sorry.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They were in the movie.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They'll be in the sequel, you know it.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I was just surprised there were no night elves. I mean, they were kind of there.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They had high elves.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They had high elves.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But Alan was like, well, they didn't go to the other continent.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But there were some fan service-y things I was hoping to see that I didn't see.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But honestly, I'm nitpicking. Overall, I had a good time.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It was a fun popcorn flick.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What, a game that takes a couple weeks to play?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Into a couple hours.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you're interested in Warcraft, I really think the movie is worth seeing. It really wasn't bad.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And even though, yes, I know I said it's tanking in the US, apparently it's doing phenomenal overseas, especially China, which is very interesting.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because, you know, there's a lot of people in China, so if they're making a movie that's doing well over there,

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
perhaps we could see a sequel that is more Chinese-funded and possibly even directed, made, who knows? We'll see.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I know the maker of the movie, Duncan Jones, said he wanted to do the Lich King story, which I would be all about that.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I would totally be down for that. That would be tremendous. Especially if we get crazy-ass Sylvanas.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That would make me extra happy.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That would be great. So, anyway, there you go. There's our hyper-review of Warcraft from our hot date on Thursday night.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Also say hello over there. Sadly, turn down our hot date, but that's okay. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't believe I was ever asked to go on the hot date.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You weren't!

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You wouldn't have gone. I think we just knew you wouldn't go.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a weeknight, and you have the parental duties and all that, and B, it's Warcraft. You don't care about Warcraft.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
See? See, I know Loki. I know Loki.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How are you otherwise, though? How was your week?

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Eh, it was alright.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Happy Father's Day to you and, of course, all our daddy gamers that are out there listening,

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
including father figures, fathers of pets, mothers who also have to be fathers, all that stuff. Hope everybody's having a good day.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you having a good Father's Day?

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Man, it's alright.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, it's okay. Does it suck?

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Nah, I wouldn't go that far.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Start off with being woken up by a child who wanted to immediately sip, you know, where I was laying. I was like, ugh.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm like, get up, daddy! Get up! I'm like, no!

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then it's like, ah, the fridge is leaking. And I'm like, ugh.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then...

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Isn't this the one day a year when you're supposed to be allowed to sleep in?

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's like, I wanna go get shoes.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then we had to go to the Palladio and I had to watch the kids while she picked out two pairs of shoes and some boutique.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Did you get shoes?

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No, I didn't get fucking shoes.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's not fair.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't get shit. And then, I mean, I guess we went to Red Robin and she paid for lunch.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But technically my burger is free because I am one of those Red Robin royalty members so my burger was comped because I just happened to be on the tenth burger.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, but Red Robin is like on the Loki list of fine dining restaurants.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It happened to be convenient nearby and it had something the kids would...

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Like, she was like saying, well, if I was to pick a restaurant, I'd probably go to Land Ocean.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm like, can you imagine our kids at fucking Land Ocean, which is like, it's a seafood, surf and turf, like, restaurant thing.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's like, you know, much higher end, way more...

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Take them to Flame and Fire.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm like, no, that's not gonna fucking happen. We'll just go to Red Robin because they can get fucking grilled cheese there and that's it.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's why I picked that restaurant, it's for the kids.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then I went to Random Restaurant for dinner, which, eh, I don't know.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They didn't speak English. Half of my dinner is, I don't know, some garbage.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And then the other half is actual edible, so...

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I tried to warn you that, well, I warned you after you already went there.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That was in hindsight.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, I didn't have the greatest experience when I went there either, but anyway.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, I hope they're doing something nice for you for when you get home.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But anyhow, let's say hello as well.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We have a special guest in the studio joining us tonight, coming from a long way away to be on our show this week.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Say hello, everybody, to Misty.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hello.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hi, Misty. Long time OLR listener and fan.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I feel weird calling you a fan because, you know, we know each other well enough now, we're just friends.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But, you know, that's, I guess, how we got to know each other as you were listening to the show.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How long have you been listening to OLR?

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
2004.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is your mic on, hun?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Make sure the switch is on over there on that mic.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Because for some reason we're not picking you up, but maybe we just don't have the, try again there.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How long have you been listening to OLR?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Technical difficulties, everybody.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
She doesn't do the radio stuff very often.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, actually, there is no switch on this mic.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did the damn thing just cut out?

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All right, well, that's what happens with live radio, is it?

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sometimes you have to switch things on the fly.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have a backup mic.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I might. Thankfully, when the video game bang guys were here, we had to hook up like six mics.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So, we're good now. Try that one, Misty. How long have you been listening to OLR?

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
April 2004.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What the hell? That one's not picking her. Oh, because that one is still muted.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay, try one more time, please.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
April 2004.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank God, there she is. There you go.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And still listening today, and here she is live.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're a big music game fan, right?

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Of course.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
As part of your adventure out here to the West Coast, you went to round one in San Jose yesterday, right?

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's right. How'd that go?

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Not bad. I mainly stuck to the Supernova 2 machine, but I did play some Crossbeats.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I sucked as much as usual at 2DX.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Gotcha. So, you got to play a little bit of this and a little bit of that.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Did you see all those zillions of crane machines that they had?

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I know you're a big fan of Pikachu. Did they have Pikachu in some of the crane games?

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Not that I recall seeing. I remember seeing Mario and Luigi, the little ones in one of them.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh God, those things are cute. I did see those.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Awesome. Well, I'm glad you could be here tonight, especially the week before our big 14th birthday, if you can believe it.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Would you buy us for our birthday?

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm just kidding. I'm just putting it on the spot.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was going to mention, there was one more thing I just remembered.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My dad had called me for Father's Day. He wanted to plan something, so we're not actually doing Father's Day this weekend.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We're doing Father's Day July 2nd, but he's like, it's a surprise. I'm not going to tell you what it is until later.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then a couple days later, he told me, he's like, okay, so we're going to go to this place and race exotic sports cars.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So that's pretty awesome. So we're going to be taking, I would give a choice of like a Lamborghini or like, I remember the other, like some other kind of car.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I just saw Lamborghini. I was like, okay, cool.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That'll be fun.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And racing it around track.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You know, actually that made me think of the show yesterday, Misty and I were on a trip and as we were coming home, I was trying to point out to her, I was like, oh, look, look, look over there on the side of the road.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's the indoor skiving place. That's the place I was talking about on OLR.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Misty was like, what place? I don't think I heard that episode.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're just not caught up on the backlog yet.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Well to be fair, it was last week's show. You were mentioning it, right?

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, was it last week's show? Maybe. I don't know.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Keep in mind, approximately the time the show was starting, that's when I was heading out to St. Louis on the train.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Gotcha. Nowhere. I'm just giving you crap. It's quite all right.

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Whenever I hear from people that are like, hey, glad to hear you're doing well. You know, I haven't listened to the show in a long time.

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm like, it's okay. I don't like take it personally. It's a big commitment to be here for a few hours.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But we appreciate the commitment of those of you that are here for the show.

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Those of you, especially live in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Some people making fun of the microphone issues that we were having a moment ago.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Stoppy in chat saying, this is false advertising. I thought every gamer has a voice here.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Look, sometimes it just takes a minute to get it all wired up.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Every gamer does have a voice. Just some of those voices can't be picked up by the microphone.

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Exactly. That's exactly right. Some of them are broken due to technical difficulties. Would you expect anything less here on OLR?

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I also admit I'm not, I'm the only one that does not have a laptop in this room. How many people are all OMG-ed when she's here?

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't have a laptop either. I have a desktop.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, you have a computer screen, period.

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm not, I got to admit, I'm not seeing a lot of stuff. I did, I do see SSG100Matt saying, confirmed, Misty carries an EMP device that kills mics on the fly.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So you're just being accused of causing the problems in chat.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I ride trains. I can't afford that stuff.

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Plus you, you were here on the 10th anniversary episode. Is that the last time? That was the last time you were here, right?

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes. 10th anniversary episode. This was a while ago. I don't, don't you like Studio N7? Isn't this a nice upgrade from where we were at before?

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It is. Yes. It's very lovely.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's see. Also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt mentioning Loki's Father's Day should be like the God of War trailer, except they're hunting bacon.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I might want to hunt something. Just go to the store and buy it.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
His mouth is full of meat, which is like a radio sin as he's trying to talk, defending the bacon thing.

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:17,000
All right. Anyway, uh, Misty, did you, did you get, I know you were on your way out here, but did you have time to get caught up in all the E3 hype or, or do you, I kind of get the sense you don't necessarily have to play the latest and greatest video games to be the gaming enthusiast you are.

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You kind of have your own, like either, you know, games that are a couple of years old, like Pokemons or whatever that you're into.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I saw you yesterday while we were coming back. You were, you were rocking the Pokemon yellow.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I was like, all right, this is old school. I liked it. I like it.

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, I do have the, the Pikachu 3DS with the Pikachu theme. So I was like, complete the trifecta and get yellow.

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You need a Pikachu invention is what you need over there, an intervention. That's okay. So what kind of games do you usually play like these days? Do you, do you tend to, do you play any of the latest and greatest stuff or do you more like to play the classics?

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
More classic stuff.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah. Yeah. As, as an example, some of the time while I was on the train, I've got my uncle ditched a Vista era laptop on me, so I've got the step mania 3.9 running on it.

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There you go. Now I know you love your music games because not only did you have to go all the way to round one, but here you are rocking step mania on the train. What is your favorite music game of all time?

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I would say, I would say DDR if I had to pick a specific mix fifth because that was my new mix.

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay. All right. You know what? Hey, this show would not exist if it wasn't for DDR cause that's how Dark Soccer Loki and I all met as I'm sure many of you know. So I'm very thankful to that.

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What's your favorite DDR song ever? You can only pick one. If you say two, I will turn off that mic permanently.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't, I can't really choose. I am a labor after all.

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Fine. Try. What's the first one that comes to your head?

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm putting her on the spot people.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let them move.

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah. Silence means let them move. Love this feeling.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If I have to say something, I would say, probably say before you.

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay. That's a very good choice. Oh, that's a good, that's a classic. That's good. I kind of thought, I kind of thought you were going to say, you're not here because I always see you play in the Makiri Al Moka stuff on the supernova, but that's all right.

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's all right. Good pick. B4U is a classic. I think Dark Soccer, one of her favorites ever is Brilliant 2U Orchestra.

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah. So, and they're not too dissimilar, those songs. So a lot of rooted in the same stuff. So awesome.

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All right. Well, Misty, I know you're going to sit in tonight's show. And, uh, even though I know you're more of a classic gamer, I'm sure you're keeping up and up on what's going on with the current stuff as we get into E3.

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So feel free to, uh, lend your voice to the conversation. I promise chatters, I'm not going to cut her off tonight.

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah. And you guys in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com where Bobby Black Wolf is yelling, just say butterfly.

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, hell no.

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:07,000
She's like, please, I have taste. All right. Anyway, uh, let's, and Stoppy says, I like that one DDR song that's all electronic and it plays really fast and it has a techno beat to it.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh yeah. Candy. Clearly is that that's the one he's talking about. Right. All right. Let's get into E3 this week. So there was a lot of news that came out of E3.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's start kind of at the top of the show this week, talking a little bit about probably what were the big two that we were looking forward to going into the week, Sony and Microsoft.

203
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes. I'm leaving Nintendo out in a moment. We'll get to them later.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What about Ubisoft?

205
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, I figure a lot of those games kind of show up at Sony or Nintendo, or we'll get to them in the show later as well. We have a lot of those coming up.

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We need to talk about how terrible the show was. Like seriously, it's like, they thought it was a good idea to do some stupid Just Dance number with giraffes and fucking, I don't know what it was.

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And then, oh, by the way, a moment of silence for those people that died in Orlando. It's like, it was just such a weird juxtaposition. I mean, it's just like, before the dance number?

208
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It was one of the more awkward tributes.

209
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's like out of all of them. It's like, oh, hey, by the way.

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You know what though? You know what though? And I said my piece on that whole thing last week, so I'm going to try to not go back to a bad place with that.

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But I was very moved with how much of an outpouring of support there was at E3 for, you know, what happened at Pulse Nightclub and, you know, the pain that the LGBT is feeling as a result of that and so forth.

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was kind of surreal to see things like Miyamoto wearing a rainbow ribbon and to hear Sony on stage at their press conference acknowledge our thoughts are with the LGBT community.

213
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It just kind of, I don't know, I just felt very like, wow, that was really great to just have that acknowledged. It really does mean a lot.

214
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Ubisoft kind of had the tackiest one of the bunch, but I'm happy they acknowledged it at all, for what it's worth.

215
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sure.

216
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So, anyway, so is that all you want to razz Ubisoft on was just dancing?

217
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No, I've got lots more, but we'll go move on to the other ones.

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Alright, can we talk about then kind of the big gaming console conferences? Again, I'll get to Nintendo later, but they didn't have a conference. They did a different thing.

219
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So let's talk, and they kind of talked about one thing and a few other things.

220
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So let's talk about Microsoft, I guess, was up first. And so Microsoft, what? They had a variety.

221
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They came out and announced, hey, there's a new console coming out that you totally didn't know about because all the information leaked out, like, way before that.

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But it's the Xbox One S. It is 40% slimmer. It's got up to a two terabyte hard drive, and it's available in August for $299. I think we're at least starting at $299.

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And go buy it now until we give you a few more reasons not to buy it because that's coming up later in the show.

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, it's called the Xbox One S because if you only give one shit about gaming, this is the console you're going to get.

225
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But if you give two shits about gaming, boy, hold on to your butts because in 2017 we've got Project Scorpio on the way.

226
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That was, I got to admit, that was a little weird to me. Like, I'm not trying to, like, there was a lot of stuff I liked about Microsoft conference.

227
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That was weird to me that they're going to try to sell this Xbox One when they're saying an even better console is on the way.

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But here's the thing, though. It's like, okay, let's pretend here. The games that they showed right now, which are running on that hardware, I'm assuming, look fine.

229
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why do I need to upgrade the hardware? They didn't give me a reason for it. They didn't say anything other than it's going to be more powerful.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay? What are you going to do with it? Are you going to be able to do 4K on everything? We're going to try.

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, it's like, because...

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But Loki, teraflops.

233
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

234
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I just like saying that word. Dark Soccer, don't you like saying that word? Teraflops.

235
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Not as much as I like Nagahide.

236
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's like a cross between terrible and a flop, so...

237
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But Jamie, the Xbox Scorpio is going to have six teraflops of power.

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It doesn't mean anything. That literally means fucking nothing. I mean, you can throw specs out all you want.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But here's the thing. Even when they're talking about cards, I want to say that they're similar to GTX 980 or something like that.

240
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And those can't even run 4K at 60 frames per second for a lot of things. What makes them think that this is going to be able to do that?

241
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Do you know what a flop is?

242
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes, a teraflop is memory bandwidth.

243
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
A flop is a floating point operation.

244
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Right. I know what a flop is, Dark Soccer. I host one every Sunday night.

245
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, that's a train wreck.

246
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's insulting to real train wrecks.

247
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Witness a train wreck.

248
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's see.

249
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What about the whole... Okay, teraflops aside and the whole new console.

250
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Again, as much as we're having a laugh here, I do enjoy my Xbox One. There were some games I'm really jazzed about.

251
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Forza Horizon 3. Thank you very much.

252
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, Forza Horizon 3 looks nice.

253
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Love it. Love that series. What about the whole emphasis on the Windows 10, Windows Play Anywhere stuff?

254
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
They're really trying to get you to buy a Windows 10 PC.

255
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, didn't Microsoft kind of already shove one down your throat if you have a Windows 7 or 8 PC?

256
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, I have a Windows 10 laptop, but I can't run any of that shit.

257
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you don't upgrade, I'm going to kill you.

258
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I can't run any of those.

259
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I mean, that's cool, I guess, that you'll be able to play cross-platform with those games.

260
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And they'll be available on both PC and their Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive.

261
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That was so fucking annoying, the entire thing. It's like, who gives a shit?

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's Windows 10 exclusive for a little bit, by the way. It's not a permanent exclusive.

263
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's exclusive for a little bit of time, and then it's going to go on the Steam.

264
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So, I don't know, it means really nothing to me, but it's nice, I guess, at least when you buy it on one, you get it on the other.

265
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
All right, let me mention some other kind of cool things, just because I don't want to get branded a hater, just because I'm picking on a few things here.

266
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But there are some other awesome things.

267
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Dead Rising 4. Hello. Frank West is back. I feel a lot better about what I'm seeing with Dead Rising 4 than I did with 3.

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's true, yes.

269
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So, I mean, it kind of feels like maybe the fact that they're putting Frank West in it is a little bit of the whole, let's go back to our roots type of thing, what made this series really fun.

270
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So, that's encouraging, I think. So, I'm excited for Dead Rising 4.

271
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah, it looks good.

272
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's see, also, hey, they mentioned Tekken 7. I didn't catch if it was some type of Microsoft exclusive or anything, but they did shine a light on Tekken 7 as part of their conference that it will be out on Xbox One in early 2017.

273
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Dark Sakura, I know you like your Tekken. Is it enough to get you to get an Xbox One?

274
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
No.

275
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think it'll be on PlayStation 4 as well.

276
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It probably will at some point, but, so I was just curious why they mentioned it at Microsoft's conference unless they have some type of...

277
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't remember what it was, if they had anything for them.

278
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's see, also Halo Wars...

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh no, they were giving out Tekken Tag 2 for free.

280
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah, that was the backwards compatibility thing.

281
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

282
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's see, Halo Wars 2 was kind of their other big thing, and they mentioned that's coming February 21st.

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Not my type of game. I used to like RTS games, but I'm just not that excited about it.

284
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I never really played the first one.

285
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I know people that were really into the first game, so I'm very happy for them, but yeah, for myself, it was not really a title for me to get excited about.

286
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like Loki, I was hoping for some more glimpses of Crackdown, which didn't seem materialized.

287
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, no glimpses of Crackdown, but hey, that's because they're working on it, so whatever.

288
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's probably not going to be out this year, unfortunately, so 2017, yay.

289
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Interesting thought from Oculus Man in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, who said they mentioned it, meaning Tekken, at their conference because they couldn't mention Street Fighter.

290
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Interesting theory. Get people hyped about a different fighting game. Very interesting theory like that.

291
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, they have, you know, killer instinct, so...

292
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That is true, Season 3 and all that.

293
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Alright, so that was...

294
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Which they announced was, I mean, they showed Gears of War 4, and then they mentioned that, oh hey, there's going to be a character from Gears of War that's going to be in Killer Instinct.

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You know, alien thing.

296
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Which they've kind of done for some other, like, cross-promotion stuff. They've put a character in, so that's neat.

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, I like Killer Instinct. It's a fun fighting game, so we'll see.

298
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's move on and talk a little bit about Sony and Sony's press conference. What did you think of Sony overall?

299
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Loki?

300
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It was alright, but even last year, there were a lot of trailers for things that I don't know when they're going to come out, and I don't think a lot of those are going to come out this year.

301
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And that's the thing.

302
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think hardly any of them are coming out this year.

303
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
At least we know that The Last Guardian has a date now, because everyone's getting kind of pissed off about that at this point, because it's been several years.

304
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But there's a lot of things that they're showing that, who knows when those are coming out?

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, not to play the I Told You So card, but I'm going to wallow in this for a minute, is that I did mention on last week's show, Sony has kept making promises, and I fully expect they need to, or else they're going to get accused of that again, is that they only ever show stuff and they never effing deliver.

306
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So I said, if they don't date one of these games that they've been teasing us with for a while for this holiday, like, Sony has to put something out this holiday.

307
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And I said it would be The Last Guardian, and sure enough, ta-da!

308
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So, but, I mean, you know.

309
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I mean, the games look good, like Horizon Zero Dawn looks nice, God of War looks great.

310
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Which also, to be fair, Horizon Zero Dawn, at least, they also dated for early next year.

311
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, it is, what, February?

312
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, it'll be out by the time the next E3 rolls around, so that was kind of a bonus, in my opinion.

313
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And then they had some zombie game, which was at the, I'm trying to remember what it was called now.

314
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The Days Gone?

315
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Days Gone, yeah, that looked alright.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay, now, here's the thing that I have to be a little bit critical of Sony about, because as much as I did really like their conference, and they are getting really good at E3.

317
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like, I would say they've been good at E3 for the past, ever since they punched Microsoft in the face live on stage, they've been delivering very, very, very solid E3s.

318
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But the one thing I do have to razz them for a little bit that I don't understand, why did they show the Days Gone thing early in the show, and then they closed with the gameplay?

319
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That felt really anti-climatic, and it felt like a substitute.

320
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And I know there's a lot of talk about, well, Rob, you can't sub things at the last minute because these things take weeks of planning and dah, dah, dah, dah.

321
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And I'm like, any party planner always has a plan B for when something goes wrong.

322
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I feel like that was plan B.

323
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You know what could have been a nice tail end to that? A good old-fashioned announcement from Rockstar Games.

324
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Of Red Dead Redemption 2, which everyone was expecting, and that does seem like the perfect thing that could have capped off Sony's conference.

325
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yet, not only was it not at Sony's conference, it was not at E3 at all, which is kind of one of the surprising misfires in the prediction world.

326
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, and then they showed off Call of Duty Infinite Warfare, which, here's the thing that's kind of funny about it.

327
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Like, watching the gameplay footage, I didn't know what game it was until the very end. I'm like, that was Call of Duty?

328
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I mean, because it just didn't, it's so out there now, it's just hardly recognizable.

329
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, well, and Bobby was getting into this a little bit on his show because he mentioned that he was really into it and then kind of felt a little bit dirty when he realized it was a Call of Duty game.

330
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I have to admit, I have a lot of those same feelings, is that I was like, I was like, you know, at first I was kind of into it.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I was like, oh, is this like a, I mean, I know it's not Mass Effect, but it's kind of like a, is it trying to go over the same audience?

332
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Like, what is this? And I was like, oh, maybe it's a little too shooty for me. I don't know if I'd be into this.

333
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But I'm like, but it kind of looks really cool. I bet there's gonna be a big new IP. And then it was Call of Duty! And I was like, oh my God!

334
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I was disappointed they didn't really announce anything about, like, backwards compatibility or anything like that. It's just like nothing.

335
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, that was, that was a surprise to be missing was, well, and the fact that the Vita is just been written off completely at this point.

336
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I mean, we kind of all knew it was coming, but there's people clinging to their Vitas, like, you know, no, I will love my Vita forever! Give me something!

337
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Literally nothing from Sony on the Vita. So that end of things is a little disappointing. But I do overall think they built a lot of great hype into their press conference.

338
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I mean, the Hideo Kojima thing, which, although you have to admit was totally expected, I did not expect that they would already have, like, a trailer type of thing.

339
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Which is like, what the fuck is this?

340
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Which is, which is great. It gets people talking. I mean, what is up with the pregnant man Norman Rita's thing? I don't know, but okay, whatever.

341
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Norman Fetus, as everybody keeps making the joke.

342
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, and the fact that he was showing us all of the game's assets at that press conference, that's for sure.

343
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But yeah, well, Shane and I were watching the Sony conference together when the Hideo Kojima thing started, and then it was Norman Rita's.

344
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We were sitting there going, oh shit, Guillermo del Toro's name is going to come up. Oh shit, this is going to be the fucking sucker punch that gets everybody just like Final Fantasy VII and...

345
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Well, actually, to go back with that, you know, real quick, let's take a step back with kind of surprises like that, because there was a lot of things.

346
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Like, first of all, Call of Duty, there was a game that looked, oh shit, this looks like P.T.

347
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes! And then what the fuck, it's Resident Evil!

348
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay, that was a huge win in my opinion. Did you see that Dark Soccer, the Resident Evil 7?

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I saw some of it.

350
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh my god. Yeah, when the thing was playing, we were like, oh, this is Sony's answer to P.T.

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I saw the house.

352
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, I was definitely like, okay, this is a P.T. thing, this is what it is.

353
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Well, remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we had stories about that some of the producers from P.T. went over to Capcom to work on Resident Evil,

354
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and now it's one of those things in retrospect, now that you've seen the trailer, you're like, wow, that should have been fucking obvious, we should have seen that coming.

355
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But there it is, Resident Evil 7.

356
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Way to fill the gap in the market. Bravo.

357
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, and then the fact that they said it was VR on top of that, I was, yeah, that was actually probably one of the biggest highlights of E3, in my opinion,

358
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
was being like really fucking interested in a Resident Evil game again. I can't remember the last time I could say that.

359
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And Resident Evil Biohazard, nonetheless. And in Japan, it's called Biohazard Resident Evil.

360
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, finally they're bridging these fucking names together, which is nice, so maybe in the future we won't have this difference anymore.

361
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I still think Biohazard is a better name overall.

362
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I like Biohazard is the name, too, but I like that the game is going to have both titles here, so that's pretty cool.

363
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I did not check out the demo yet, though. I would be doing a disservice to my friends if I played it without them here to see me screaming,

364
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
so I'm sitting on it for a little bit before I play it. So, did you check out the demo yet?

365
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No, I didn't download the demo. One of the things I, well, I'll get to in my gaming week, I guess.

366
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There was some stuff that I did download that, you know, was like, hey, it's available now. So, I did that.

367
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No, I didn't download that one. I was looking for it, but they didn't have it up when I was checking, so I just didn't download it.

368
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, it took a while to come up that night. Like, I swear I didn't go up until 1 AM, but I just ended up grabbing it the next day, whatever.

369
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, so anyway, I want to mention, I didn't finish my thought on the Guillermo del Toro thing during the Death, what is Death Stranding?

370
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Is that the name of the game? What a fucking Kojima name.

371
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Clearly, Sony handed Kojima a blank check and just said, just do it, buddy. Whatever you want. Do it, buddy. We don't care.

372
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You're Team Sony now. Like, make everybody cry. Just do it.

373
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So, and it was worthy of, in my opinion, what should have been the actual closing of Sony's show and not the plan B.

374
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, that would have been the fantastic way to close it.

375
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That was in the middle of the show? And they had something bigger for the closing? What the hell was it?

376
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That's what I thought. I was like, oh my God, this is going to be like, this closing is going to fucking kill us, like whatever it is.

377
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And then it just was kind of, oh, we're going to just do some more.

378
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And it's another No Man's Sky trailer that no one gives a shit about at this point.

379
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Hey, you know what? Props to Sony for not even mentioning that game's name on the stage.

380
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's coming in like two months, so that's fine.

381
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And don't get me wrong. I have it preordered. I will be playing it. I'm excited to play it. But like, it was time to not talk about that game.

382
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So, I was very happy for that. So, in my opinion, Sony was mostly a win.

383
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It wasn't quite like out of the park, smashing a window in the parking lot like it was last year, but it was pretty good.

384
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
They still did a pretty darn good job, I thought. The Kojima thing and the Resident Evil thing, they have a lot of, the God of War trailer looked great.

385
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Like, I'm not usually into God of War games, but I was very much about that trailer.

386
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Even though, I don't want to sound like too big of a Tumblr user, but the animal stuff was a little hard for me to watch.

387
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But I could still probably let it slide. I think the game looked really, really fun. Exciting.

388
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And just really different from the prior God of War games.

389
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So, genre bending a little bit.

390
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Not really, but okay.

391
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Really? It's the same.

392
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It looked a little, I don't know, it looked-

393
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It just has more narrative. You're still chopping up.

394
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think so. Maybe it just seemed like it was a little bit slowed down in a way.

395
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And I wasn't okay with that.

396
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And just the beginning, because your son dragging you down, it's just like, perhaps he'll die or something and then he'll be back to like, oh hey, it's God of War again.

397
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm gonna kill everybody. Yeah, we'll see.

398
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So, yeah. A little sad to not see Guillermo del Toro's name on the Kojima project, but I understand. That was family-head.

399
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And how can we forget about the new Spider-Man game?

400
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh yeah. That looked pretty fantastic.

401
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't know if that was necessarily a closer, but I'm kind of surprised I didn't get more attention.

402
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It wasn't a closer, but yeah, it was pretty nice. It looked cool.

403
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, no, that looks great, especially with Insomniac being involved with that. Yeah, that looked like a lot of fun.

404
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And then I think it's worth mentioning the Crash Bandicoot thing, too.

405
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I was a little like, oh, are they gonna announce a new game? And then they were kind of like, Skylanders!

406
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And I was kind of like, but it's cool that they're remastering the old games.

407
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I wonder if this is them measuring the hype a little bit? Like, should they do a full-on new Crash Bandicoot game?

408
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't know. But that was pretty cool to hear that those remasters are coming. I'm all about that.

409
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Alright. Let's see, going into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

410
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Tigerclaw says, the new God of War is going to be interesting since it will take on Norse mythology.

411
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
This means you'll probably get to fight Loki. Perhaps.

412
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Maybe? Perhaps. Let's see.

413
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Stoppy in chat says, ugh, I hated Crash. Not every game is going to please everybody.

414
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Crash was like the first PlayStation game I owned, so I'm excited to check out the remaster.

415
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Let's see, other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

416
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Dark Tetsuya said, did anyone see the Crash Shadow as the guy was walking on stage?

417
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah, I noticed that. It was very obviously going to be a Crash Bandicoot thing, but I thought it was going to be a new game.

418
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because that was kind of where Sony set the bar after their conference last year, where it's like, we're just granting gamer wishes.

419
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Everybody come rub our lamp and get your gaming wish, because we're granting them.

420
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They showed a lot of VR stuff, and a lot of that looked kind of interesting.

421
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
My thing is, I don't know how deep of experiences those are. They showed a Star Wars thing that looks like it was just a mission that you do.

422
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And then there was some integration with Final Fantasy XV, which was something.

423
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, but they're all sideshows compared to the real game.

424
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But you know what, I will say this. I'm very thankful that Sony didn't mention their...

425
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't even want to call it successor console, because that's not really what it is.

426
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But Sony didn't mention their console upgrade, I guess.

427
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm really glad that Sony didn't do that, because that shows me that what they're hyping for PlayStation VR right now will work with the PlayStation 4 that you have.

428
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And isn't going to require this new thing. Because remember we talked about this last week or the week before on the show?

429
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That I was very concerned with this whole fact that the PS4 upgrade is coming, and that people are saying it's going to be the definitive way to do VR.

430
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And I'm kind of like, well then why the fuck am I getting the VR thing right now, if it's not going to work right on PlayStation 4?

431
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But this kind of helps, I think, with some of those feelings for them to not announce that, yet talk about all this VR stuff.

432
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Because the expectation is, that's what we'll get this holiday, and it'll be a lot of these rich experiences.

433
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And also, I was reading some of the impressions of people that went to the Best Buy events that they had on Thursday and Friday, basically showing off the VR.

434
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And people liked it. They thought it was good. And the headset felt light. They didn't really have any problems with it, so it seems to be pretty positive.

435
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Well, my understanding too is that if you didn't go to E3, there's a ton of Best Buys now that have the PlayStation VR for you to try.

436
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Ah, they only give it two days, and that's it. And it wasn't that much. There was like two in California. There's a double-end in somewhere in SoCal.

437
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, you know what? Probably because they had to have a retail rep policing it, because they can't just leave it out on a kiosk. Those things will get damaged or stolen so easily.

438
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So they probably had to have a live person there to do it.

439
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, what was it that I heard? There was somebody trying to download the Zelda demo on an SD card or some shit like that?

440
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I got, oh man, there was a lot of fuckery at E3 this year. I just gotta say, there was some stuff on Twitter I was reading that was super not cool.

441
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Like, gamers behave yourselves. Like, you wanna know why gamers get a shit reputation sometimes? It's because of shit like this.

442
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And I think it's very important that the rest of us who aren't idiots call out this behavior.

443
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I know what you're alluding to, and it's not necessarily gamers giving bad times, because those events are for press.

444
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So fucking look at your own selves when you're going to that.

445
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I am not gonna say that we might have a problem where the killer is inside the house, so to speak.

446
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I absolutely would believe that, you know, there are some seedy people who probably have worked their way up in the industry.

447
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And like I said, those people that are, the 96% of people out there who are way more awesome need to speak up when they see shit going on.

448
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Okay, and then along with that, can we talk about the other flops of E3 as well?

449
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If you must.

450
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Okay, so these are brief, and most of these you might not have even noticed actually happened.

451
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Actually, a few things. They had a few other livestreams going on. One that I kind of checked out a part of was a Friday the 13th game. Remember that one that was on Kickstarter?

452
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Actually, it looks really good. It looks just like the movie, and you actually get to play as Jason and everything, and I'm digging that.

453
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I've seen some of the clips on Twitter that are really fucking gross.

454
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Oh yeah, it's absolutely gross.

455
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Fucking gross.

456
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Whatever, it's the game, okay? It's fine.

457
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This is the type of thing that Jamie would play and laugh at.

458
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What?

459
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Friday the 13th where you're playing as Jason getting to murder everybody?

460
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay, that would be fun.

461
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
See? See? All you have to say is murder, and Jamie perks up like a dog when you say, treat?

462
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Sega had something planned, like a livestream planned for the anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog, and they were going to be making this big announcement.

463
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The big announcement was there was a contest for the biggest fan of Sonic. Oh, and fuck you, here's another Sonic Boom game.

464
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Loki, are you going to be entering the Sonic?

465
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh fuck, no I'm not.

466
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Why not?

467
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm not a fan of Sonic.

468
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay, OLR listeners.

469
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm not even a fan of Sonics.

470
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You like Sonic the fast food chain?

471
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
No, I don't.

472
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You don't like tater tots and lime slushies?

473
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No.

474
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Chat room, Loki should enter the contest, shouldn't he? Come on.

475
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Chatters, wouldn't you back Loki up if he entered the contest for Sonic's biggest fan?

476
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Misty, shouldn't he enter? He should enter, right? She's dying over there, she can't even.

477
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I think Loki should enter.

478
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'll just take a picture of me flipping off the camera and that's it.

479
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I owe no Sonic perks.

480
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Okay, now you give me a reason to actually want you to enter.

481
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

482
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And, Loki, since you want to win, you have to do it in full costume.

483
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Sorry, so Photoshop everything. I'll dye myself blue, I'll spike my hair. Of course it's all Photoshop, I'm not actually going to do that.

484
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I mean, come on.

485
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And then I'll tell everybody in Ingress you're a traitor.

486
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Stacks of like, you know, my house will have like the thing. No, I'm not going to do that.

487
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And then of course the PC conference sucked balls like normal, so.

488
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah.

489
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's see, SSG100Matt says, Loki will only enter the contest if they promise to get rid of his stupid friends if he does it.

490
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I've undergone leg extensions so that my legs can be long and spindly just like Sonic.

491
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You know, the new Sonic, because I have to stay close to being accurate to the character and now that they have lengthened his legs, I also need to go and lengthen my legs as well.

492
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Just cut that and send it in as the clip. There it is.

493
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's incredibly painful, but...

494
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But you gotta go fast.

495
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I gotta go fast. And everybody knows if you have a longer stride, you can go faster, so that is really an evolution right there.

496
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Love it. Any other teraflops you want to mention, Loki?

497
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:07,000
For the love of God, Ubisoft, for the love of God, please do not do the mock co-op conversations or chatter or whatever the fuck you want to call it.

498
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It is so fucking irritating and unrealistic. Nobody fucking talks like that. And you wasted too goddamn long on it.

499
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And I didn't need to have a section of your stupid conference talking about your stupid fucking Assassin's Creed movie that's coming out.

500
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That was so fucking boring.

501
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And was it steep? Looks kind of lame.

502
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Wow, you're just kicking them while they're down. Was there anything you liked? The South Park game?

503
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Watch Dogs 2 actually looks pretty good.

504
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Alright, there we go. Alright, good. We got some good news there. Alright.

505
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Uh, yes, Darcyra.

506
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What?

507
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, I thought you were going to say something.

508
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Well, now that I'm standing up, no.

509
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Would you like to talk down to us now that you're standing up?

510
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I have to say that I kind of wish I'd been able to go this year.

511
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, really?

512
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Really? What for?

513
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And then, um, I also then realized that I hate large groups of people.

514
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, the good news is there's less people than there were in years past. So it wouldn't be as, if you survived E3 2006, you can survive this.

515
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Bobby, I'm so confused about your comment there because Lost Planet would be a Capcom property and you didn't sit in a Konami press conference to hear about it.

516
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm sure they had something more terrible. What was their game that they had on like PSP for a while that was like some first person shooter?

517
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Well, I lost them on the PSP because it doesn't have a fucking second analog stick. So, good luck aiming with that.

518
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And it was a tiny, I had some time. It was so memorable I can't think of the damn name for it.

519
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Darcyra wonders if it was Coded Arms.

520
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Maybe. I don't remember.

521
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Alright. Um, let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I remember sitting in a 2008 press conference watching Avi Arad talk about some game movie that never came out.

522
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It happens. Some things they show off at E3 get cancelled. Where's that Wii Vitality sensor? Didn't happen.

523
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks. Things that we played since we weren't at E3, but we did play some games here at home.

524
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We'll talk about our gaming weeks and then we'll get into the news tonight, which yes, we'll include Nintendo and some more of Ubisoft and some of these other things we haven't mentioned yet about E3.

525
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with your gaming week. What kind of video games did you play this week?

526
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Not much of anything. I played some World of Warcraft. I played some Ingress. I have played a lot of Miitomo. I guess it's kind of playing it. More like interacting with it.

527
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I played pop and music yesterday. Whichever one of the ones they have in Japantown is. And I just played the same old songs that I like playing anyway.

528
00:43:47,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What else did I play? Oh yeah, I finished all my puzzles. No, I did that the week before. I'm trying to remember because I played something else. Oh yeah, well we played Jairus at my house.

529
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I finished your game. You have that arcade cabinet now. That's pretty awesome. Yeah, we have Jairus at my house. Dan got it for free.

530
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah, we were all singing along to the song.

531
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's Takata and Fugin D minor, the remix. The remix. Yeah, Jairus happened. Yeah, Jairus.

532
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Dan seemed a little impressed that I remembered the ship patterns in the first few stages.

533
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Oh, the other thing is that we got an Ultracade. Really? Yeah, Dan's like, don't go spending any money. Buy the $500 Ultracade. Wait a minute. After you left.

534
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I seem to remember like a decade ago on this show we used to make fun of Ultracade. Did you kick it? I know, did you kick your Ultracade machine? Yes. Okay, thank you. I kicked it. Can we all come over and kick it? Yes.

535
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But Dan's hope is to get it fixed up and then get rid of it. Well, he said, well, if we don't like it, we can sell it for a grand. I'm like, but why? If it's not working, why did you do this?

536
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't even remember why we had to kick an Ultracade machine that just became a meme out of this show. It was like, send us your pick. That was like a contest we ran. Send us a picture of you kicking a machine.

537
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Was it something shady that they did? Yeah, it was something shady. Did they try to like register MAME or something? Ah, something like that. They tried to like copyright MAME or something. I don't remember. Something like that. Yeah, they were shoving out MAME.

538
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well, now, I mean, you know what I wouldn't mind having, to be honest, is an Ultra pin. Yes, those machines are hot. That would be pretty cool. I played a few games on one of those and I think it would be nice to have, but then again, nothing is like having the originals.

539
00:45:49,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So, oh, and I did actually play more pinball this weekend because Dan redid the rubbers in our Black, not Black Knight. Well, he did it for Black Knight, for World Cup and for Twilight Zone. Dan bought some new rubbers. They're actually silicone.

540
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But they go on the flippers so that they don't get damaged by the ball. Protection is important. But these actually are supposed to last forever and not lose any of their give. So, he also fixed the left flipper in Twilight Zone. So, I played a decent amount of Twilight Zone this weekend.

541
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Sounds like Dan's really kind of made a little niche of fixing up broken shit. He's selling the rig. Yeah, the driving rig. Oh, really? Yeah, he's done with it. We've actually taken all those months. He had three 27 inch monitors hooked up to it. And he took one for himself and gave me the other two. Nice. So like, ooh, I can actually play without my glasses. Yeah, he retired.

542
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Ragenator in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com calling out something you had posted on Facebook that Dan had had you hold his balls to while he was fixing the pinball machine.

543
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes, he said hold my balls and then he gave me three. You're a very special husband.

544
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You know, to be honest, I've never felt Dan's balls or anybody's pinballs for that matter. What does a pinball feel like? How much do they weigh? Are they heavy? They're metal balls. Are they heavy or are they kind of light? They're a little heavy-ish.

545
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Describe the balls in detail.

546
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
They're dirty yet kind of shiny.

547
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And aren't you really supposed to be touching them with your hands? Because when you would not want getting, you wouldn't want like grime or anything on those balls. You know, wouldn't it affect how they roll? Is it something that you want to like make sure that you're not touching them with like oil from your fingers?

548
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm sure Darcy would respond to that. This is how I roll, bitch.

549
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Do pinballs weigh 80 grams? If that helps you?

550
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I don't speak international. I only speak American.

551
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
They're 2.7 centimeters in diameter.

552
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
This is all, I don't understand any of these words that you're saying right now.

553
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
All right. Anyway, okay, look, we need to move on from talking about pinballs, but one of these days I'm going to come over and touch his balls.

554
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Because I just want to feel for myself.

555
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
They're fucking metal balls.

556
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Roll them around in your hands.

557
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Won't somebody let me touch their balls?

558
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I was trying to do the whole goblin thing, king thing with the three of them and I'm not that dexterous.

559
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
All right. Let's move on with somebody else's gaming week.

560
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Misty, you're a nice, super serious person to go to after that exchange. Misty, how was your gaming week?

561
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Not too bad.

562
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Make sure you're talking right in that mic so we can hear you.

563
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So yeah, round one, cross speeds, 2DX, Supernova 2.

564
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Did a day trip to Reno, ended up going to Circus Circus and playing the Supernova there.

565
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And on the way in, attention spanned, among things, Neko Atsume on my phone.

566
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Because if there's any conversation more exciting than talking about pinballs, it's talking about cat butts.

567
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Cat butts are the best butts.

568
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I feel like there's an OLR dream game in there somewhere.

569
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Pinballs and cat butts. I don't like a love story. I don't know. We'll see.

570
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I don't want to see where we have to shoot the ball for multi-ball.

571
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All right. So it sounds like Misty had a fun, we've been doing so much traveling, getting to go to some of these arcades and stops and stuff.

572
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And how was the in and out?

573
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It was good.

574
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I always have to ask the East Coasters, how'd you feel about it, or Midwesterners in this case, how'd you feel about the in and out?

575
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Because, you know, they don't have them past a certain point.

576
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?

577
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I played a few things. One of the things that they announced that we didn't talk about with the, well maybe we're going to talk about it, so I apologize if we are.

578
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Out of Ubisoft is they're talking about the new South Park game.

579
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And if you pre-order digitally, you also get South Park the Stick of Truth.

580
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And since I was going to pick up the new game anyways, I was like, sweet, I will go ahead and just pre-order it.

581
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And sure enough, there's South Park the Stick of Truth for the PlayStation 4.

582
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And so I played some of that, and it's fantastic still, because I played it a little bit on 360, never finished it.

583
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But damn, that game is awesome.

584
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So, definitely enjoying that.

585
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
One of the other ones that they said, you know, hey, it's available now after the press conference.

586
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And then it got very pissed off because that's when they started wasting time with the stupid Assassin's Creed movie talk.

587
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And all the other shit that they were wasting time with.

588
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Was Blood, Trials of the Blood Dragon.

589
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It was a cross between Trials, that really crazy, somewhat over-the-top motorcycle, I guess it's like a racing puzzle game.

590
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And then of course, Blood Dragon, which was the ridiculous 80s, 90s infused shooter game that was all sorts of retro and cheesy and whatever.

591
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So it's both of those combined, and it's pretty awesome.

592
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's very similar to the last expansion they did for Trials, which I don't remember that was called.

593
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
They had like a flaming unicorn and stuff the last time.

594
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But it's kind of similar, this one you actually do some shooting and there's some off-the-bike stuff, which is kind of eh, it's alright.

595
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But I do like to have this RC card that you can play as.

596
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It's a little bit of a mix-up of the actual game.

597
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But definitely check it out, it's worth the money.

598
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And then I played a little bit of Ingress, I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.

599
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Don't like the new update with Pokemon Go, makes it even buggier, and they made it more grindy.

600
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Which, I kind of don't want to play it.

601
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I heard around the grapevine that an update came out yesterday to fix a lot of those bug issues.

602
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Just in case you haven't seen it.

603
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Ah, no. It still has not.

604
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And then I downloaded Smash Brothers for the Wii U because it was on sale.

605
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh yeah, E3 sales.

606
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And they don't normally discount that stuff, so I figured out what the hell, so I let my son play that.

607
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I actually haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.

608
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I didn't download all the characters.

609
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And by the way, and I know I'm part of the problem because I did pay the money for them, but it's whatever.

610
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I have a real problem with paying for $5 for one DLC character.

611
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I mean, yes I know I'm stupid and actually did that as well, but I still don't approve of that practice.

612
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And whereas I made the exception this time, I will not be doing that in the future.

613
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But seriously, $5 for a fucking character? Come on.

614
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That's it.

615
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Alright, my gaming week.

616
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
To be honest, I haven't played a lot of new stuff.

617
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Just been kind of still making progress on some of the old stuff.

618
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Still playing a little bit of Overwatch.

619
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Alan got really into Overwatch.

620
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
He plays it more than I do at this point.

621
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So once in a while I'll try to team up and play some games, but I'm not very good at it.

622
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But one of the things I'm continuing to enjoy about Overwatch is that there are characters that do more than just shoot the guns.

623
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So that if you aren't good at shooters, you can still kind of do things that still support your team.

624
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So I really appreciate that.

625
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I think that's part of what is kind of brilliant about the design of Overwatch in the first place.

626
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But I've been still having fun with that.

627
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And also been playing, I was still playing Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, believe it or not.

628
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't have any more gym badges.

629
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Because I'm at this point where it was like, okay I had to walk down this route to get to this place to get some weird item I didn't even have to be using.

630
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Then I have to go like up and all the way around.

631
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So anyway, I'm still kind of stuck a little bit in Pokemon, but I'm making progress.

632
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So I've still been playing that, believe it or not.

633
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And I've been playing, this is weird.

634
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like just on a whim, one of my friends was talking about this game.

635
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So I was like, you know what, I should check it out.

636
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I haven't played this game in a long time.

637
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You remember when I was talking about Path of Exile?

638
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I went back and played that a little bit.

639
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That is the free to play game that's on Steam and I'm sure a ton of other, those types of places too.

640
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's kind of Diablo-esque.

641
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Although there's a lot, there's like Diablo, like Blizzard kind of likes to keep things simple, right?

642
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Path of Exile kind of goes a little deeper.

643
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Not just with their, you know, very complicated skill tree.

644
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But you know, your abilities are in gems that level independently and you can link things together.

645
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
There's a lot that even I am still trying to learn and figure out and understand.

646
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But I'm having fun with it.

647
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And considering that I'm kind of at a point where I think I'm a little burned out on Diablo 3.

648
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Like I love Diablo 3, but okay, here we are season six and kind of the same grind.

649
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And I kind of got my reward and I'm a little bit over it.

650
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm kind of glad that like Path of Exile, even though I'm a total noob,

651
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
is kind of satisfying a lot of my urges to play, you know, pew pew, kill all the things, collect loot and all that stuff.

652
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So yeah, I guess that would be the other shout out I would give this week would be that.

653
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Path of Exile, it's got a crazy huge skill tree.

654
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah, and didn't they like add to it with this ascendancy stuff, which I don't even understand.

655
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
There's a whole nother, like last time I played the game this wasn't in there.

656
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Now there's this prophecy stuff too.

657
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Like I find like these coins and this like fortune teller will tell me these things that are going to happen.

658
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And my video game logic tells me, oh, these are quests that I'm going to like open a portal and go to.

659
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
No, they're just things I have to I guess look out for.

660
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm not even sure how it works.

661
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'm sure there's a Path of Exile fan out there who's getting extraordinarily frustrated listening to my noob ass.

662
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But I'm going to keep at it and try to read some more guides this week to figure it all out and see.

663
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Because I am having fun with it for what it's worth and that's the most important thing, right?

664
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So there you go.

665
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
All right, let's move on.

666
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
We need to get into some gaming news and some of the other stuff that happened this week at E3 and outside of E3 even.

667
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But first, Loki with, you know, the other company that a lot of people are talking about this week, right, Loki?

668
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Right. Yes. So Nintendo, of course, their thing was they're only showing Zelda.

669
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So that's what they did. They started off with their stream, the trailer for Zelda, the Breath of the Wild.

670
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And it is this very big open world Zelda game.

671
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It is what I've been looking for in a Zelda game for a long time because it is very similar art style wise to Wind Waker.

672
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And it also shares a lot of stuff from Wind Waker.

673
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And there's even like some theory about like some sort of convergence on different timelines within Zelda.

674
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:19,000
But it's basically like, spoiler, in Wind Waker there's a part where you find out, hey, the world is flooded and actually Hyrule is under the world.

675
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
That these islands that you're finding are just the mountain tops.

676
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And I was like, damn, why couldn't they have just made this whole game like Hyrule and in this art style?

677
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And sure enough, a few years later, this game comes out and it's basically that game with Hyrule and it's open world and it's awesome.

678
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So that's what this is. And so they showed it off, basically showing off a small section of the map, which I want to say they said it was like 2% of the map.

679
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But it was goddamn huge. Like I don't even think they explored the whole thing there the entire time.

680
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
But there's so much you can do with it. Physics are just ridiculous amount of stuff that you can do with the environment.

681
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Like set fire to things and the wind takes the fire and all sorts of like unintended things you can do.

682
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's just very neat. A different type of Zelda game.

683
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I know one thing you like to do with these open world games like in your Grand Theft Auto type of games is like try to break things, go places you shouldn't go, kill your character in the most horrific way possible.

684
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Do you see that you're going to be able to do some of that in the new Zelda?

685
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Probably. I mean, why not? Yeah.

686
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Apparently the new Zelda will let you run around shirtless too.

687
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, you can put clothes on if you want to.

688
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But who wants to do that? Please.

689
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You just have Link in his underwear. I don't know. It looked cool. I'm definitely looking forward to it.

690
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
They didn't really talk about the NX at all or what exactly is going to be different with that version of the game.

691
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But I mean, considering this is just on the Wii U right now, it looks pretty damn good for the Wii U.

692
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah. I didn't even need E3 to sell me on this game. I think maybe that was part of my quote unquote frustration about Nintendo really dedicating as much as they did with E3 to Zelda.

693
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Because for me personally, I was like, I already know I'm going to want this game based on what they've shown of this previously.

694
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And I mean, nothing about that has changed. I did not have the time to sit and watch hours and hours of live stream.

695
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I was like, I need like a five minute Cliff Notes version.

696
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But there's enough stuff on YouTube where I kind of got a sense of what's going on.

697
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm like, yeah, okay, this looks like it's just going to be a freaking huge Zelda game.

698
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And yeah, I already knew I wanted it.

699
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Zelda and, you know, what else?

700
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Like Shadow of the Colossus, getting the big Shadow of the Colossus vibe from it.

701
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The demo obviously was different. It was, you know, earlier on in the development cycle.

702
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So they didn't show like, you know, there's going to be more like NPCs and towns and stuff like that in the game as well.

703
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
But they didn't really show that. So I don't know. It looks good. I'm definitely looking forward.

704
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm definitely going to be picking it up when it comes out.

705
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Let's see. Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

706
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Stoppy says, I think it looks interesting, but I will need other games to convince me to get an NX.

707
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Maybe Nintendo will have a killer E3 next year.

708
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Well, that decision to get you to buy an NX has to happen before E3 next year.

709
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
If the rumors are to be believed that that system is coming out by the end of the fiscal year, which means March, April, right?

710
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
We're going to get to that very soon, but I don't, yeah.

711
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
You don't think it's going to happen?

712
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I know. I just, I think that we're going to have, I think it's going to be deja vu all over again.

713
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I, I'm trying to be a little more optimistic. I, I think the whole reason they did what they did with E3 was so they didn't have to do deja vu.

714
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,000
But here's the, well, here's the problem though with that. I mean, yes, I understand that they're getting people hyped about this game and stuff.

715
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:58,000
They've already said that, Hey, um, God, I really should have looked over everything, but they basically said, Hey, guess what?

716
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Um, yeah, there's not really going to be, we're not making any more we use. Sorry. There's like less than a million left. Get them while you can.

717
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Huh?

718
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So I mean, they're trying to get you to buy a console for this game. I mean, I don't know.

719
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:26,000
All right. Well, we will see what develops with NX, but as far as Zelda goes, I'm sold, but I will probably be buying the Zelda game on the NX.

720
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Because I can't imagine I'm not going to want Nintendo's next console. I really can't imagine I'm not going to want it.

721
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Maybe I'm just meeting a consumer.

722
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
We'll discuss this in a minute.

723
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Fine. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about the Star Trek game that came out of the Ubisoft conference.

724
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's a Star Trek bridge crew, uh, going to be coming for the PlayStation VR, the HTC Vive and Oculus.

725
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So it will have, uh, all the VRs, all the things, uh, Red Storm Entertainment is creating the game and, uh, they of course made Far Cry 3 and 4 and The Division.

726
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Uh, and so there's actually a whole little, um, um, like, uh, video that they showed where they had LeVar Burton and Jerry Ryan.

727
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I think what Carl Urban, I think was, was all playing it. And they were all kind of into the game.

728
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You know, VR games can kind of be a hard sell at these conferences because you can't show the VR.

729
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Right. And, and I mean, this is like,

730
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Just real quick aside, do you think with the PlayStation VR being out by next year, do you think the next E3 I will be able to experience in VR? I bet I can.

731
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And so that way they'll be able to show me VR games in VR, but we'll, we'll see. But I, I just have this interesting feeling that that could be a thing. We'll see.

732
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I kind of feel like that's what Oculus wants to do with the Facebook and the event. Anyway, anyway.

733
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:54,000
They have, they have VR streaming. So I mean, it could, it could happen. Anyway. Um, so yeah, uh, the game looked pretty fun.

734
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Um, but the old, okay, here's the only thing I, I, the only issue I guess I had with it is that these guys were all playing in one room. Right.

735
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And I was like, okay, so you have the three Star Trek, um, celebrities, and then you have, you know, the, the guy that was leading the demo.

736
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And I'm thinking who's going to have four VR headsets at their house or even tell their friends like, hey, come on over and bring your VR headset.

737
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Hopefully we all have the same brand so we can play the game. So not right now, but you know, it sounds preposterous, but well, I guess we'll see.

738
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:38,000
But, and I know you're probably yelling online, online. Yeah. I'm assuming a lot of this has to be online, but there's a big difference between online and in the same room.

739
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Well, also like Nintendo banks on all the time for Oculus and like even PlayStation VR and stuff that might be difficult.

740
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I can see like your VR is might, might be an option because it's cheaper, like, you know, whatever the Android dream or whatever that is, something like that.

741
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Or hell if Apple ever decides to come out with VR, which I'm sure it's a matter of time. Um, that's something a little bit more feasible because everybody has smart devices and you know, it's something that they may be a very,

742
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I could see in five years that VR is going to take off to the point where it's going to be just like, no one thought everyone's gonna have smartphones on, you know, it's like, those are expensive. Why would, who would pay $600 for a phone?

743
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I mean, that's silly, but then again, uh, Bobby Blackwolf, our, uh, he's of course, super into VR over at live.voggenetware.com says, uh, it is an online game.

744
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:38,000
They were all in the same studio for TV sake. I, again, I kind of say that's one of those things you have to be aware of when you're getting, buying into the marketing of these games is that there's a lot of stuff.

745
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
To be honest, why was this trailer so short and that stupid Eagle trailer or Eagle gameplay thing that they did was so long.

746
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Um, and then, uh, Bobby Blackwolf also mentions if you want to play the game in the same room, play Artemis.

747
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Um, while we're on the subject of Star Trek, by the way, there's other two, two quick asides I want to mention.

748
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
One, I want to mention the, um, Starboard power coupling, uh, our pals over there, uh, at the voice keys network.

749
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:12,000
They just hit their 100th episode. Um, Captain Matt was actually here the other night doing the show live here from the same studio, uh, with his pals, uh, Eddie and Ken over Skype.

750
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So big congrats to the cast of Starboard power coupling on episode 100. Yay. Um, on a bit of a downer, um, in which Chad is bringing up right now.

751
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Yes, I did hear about the, uh, unfortunate tragedy that happened to, uh, Anton Yelchin today. That's, um, that's horrible.

752
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Uh, especially kind of hearing about that it was, you know, literally a freak accident, uh, just kind of, you know, a reminder to, um, make the most of every day.

753
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Because, uh, you never know.

754
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I, this is going to sound awful for me. It was completely preventable and it's just, it should be common sense that you don't leave your car running in neutral.

755
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Mhm.

756
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Practice some common sense people. Be safe.

757
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah.

758
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I mean, it's still, it's a tragedy. It's a great loss.

759
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Exactly.

760
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
But it was still a result of his own negligence.

761
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah. So just be careful people. Be careful. All right. Anyhow, um, let's move on with some other gaming news. Dark Sakura.

762
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Well, this has been, I think, a little bit of an edgy topic for some people is about things done for Twitch viewers to, to, uh, inflate viewer, uh, and, uh, follower counts.

763
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So now, um, it actually is, uh, a part of Twitch policy now that, um, view bots and follow bots and chat impersonation bots are, uh, completely, um, you know, not allowed.

764
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:17,000
You can't have them. And now, um, they are actually, uh, following through with a lawsuit against seven different bot makers who are, uh, selling their products to, uh, increase, uh, follower and viewer count. So, uh, yeah, they're, they're tacking down on them.

765
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I just, why would you buy fake viewers when you know they're fake? And I completely understand that Twitch does like the rankings based on view count. And so you're like bolstering yourself in the rankings, but still I'm kind of like to have earned something falsely like that is just like, oh, like your whole thing is tainted.

766
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And if you are destined to be a talented, uh, live broadcaster, do it of your own merits. You know what I mean? Just weird.

767
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It's just, people will do anything. I think I honestly would like to see that these Twitch streamers who are using these services get reprimanded or even banned in some way.

768
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, to be fair, devil's advocate, because I think this is important. If people knew that people were going to get banned for these fake streamers, I could hire fake or sorry, not fake streamers.

769
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I could hire fake viewers to go on your channel. So you'd get in trouble. That's, that's the only devil's advocate perspective I have is that you have, I mean, you don't want to false ban anybody. Although I agree with you. Yes. They need to maybe lawsuit and then maybe, um, uh, what would you call subpoena the records?

770
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So then they can truly figure out who's buying them and do something about it. But yeah, I would, I would be very cautious about false positives. That's my only thing.

771
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Um, uh, and then the other thing, there was nothing I wanted to say with that, with the whole, um, Twitch and the buying and all that stuff. Um, damn it. Train left the station. I can't remember what I was going to say. So I guess I'll go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

772
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Uh, let's see. Dungeon Buster says, I heard Riot banned a few players for botting their League of Legends streams. Oh, that, that's what it was. Um, World of Warcraft. I seem to remember there was a very similar sort of thing where they sued some of those gold spammer people

773
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:16,000
that kept spamming on their game. So this seems very similar to that whole thing or, or no, it wasn't the spammers. It was the people making the bot programs. That's who they went after.

774
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
See, that was actually another reason why I quit final fantasy 14.

775
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Oh, uh, just an aside though, it was addressed this week and there is going to be a gold spam report thing in the next patch to be fair, but that, but yes, that has been always an annoyance about 14 for way too long.

776
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Finally, it's being addressed and you know, the hilarious thing about it, how it came up while Yoshida, the producer was playing final fantasy 14 during the, he got gold spammed.

777
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah.

778
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So he finally mentioned, by the way, we're going to have a reporting thing in the next patch. So,

779
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Well, it needs to have a complete not arriving thing. You know, it's just completely irritating. And that was a big, that was actually, I'd say 50% of the reason I left because Warcraft has that thing licked.

780
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You don't have to look at the chat and they can't message you directly. So,

781
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:21,000
All right. Well, uh, we'll hope the appropriate people that are taking advantage of these CD services or the CD services themselves get a nice, good spanking, uh, for being very, very naughty.

782
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Let's move on to the next story. Loki.

783
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:40,000
All right. So, um, Reggie was in an interview, um, I want to say, what was it with Bloomberg and regarding, you know, what he thought, you know, about E3 and kind of like the other systems that were available, uh, mainly, you know, now that Sony is talking about the PlayStation

784
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Neo, um, or their next system or briefly mentioned it and, you know, the Xbox Scorpio and kind of their comment on it, you know, what, what did they have planned for the NX, that type of thing.

785
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And basically he came out, you know, kind of dodged the question by saying, you know, for us, it's not about the specs, it's not about the teraflops, um, or the, you know, processing power.

786
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's about the content, um, basically saying that they're a content company and their focus is to put their entertaining titles on the Wii U and on the NX.

787
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Loki, I think we actually have a video of that.

788
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Your competitors, uh, you know, talked about their forthcoming, the Xbox and a new PlayStation. How do you think the NX console will stack up to them?

789
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You know, for us, it's not about specs. It's not about teraflops. It's not about the horsepower of a particular system. For us, it's about the content.

790
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Nintendo is a content focused company. We create entertainment that makes people smile. So for us, we're focused on bringing our best entertainment to both the Wii U as well as the NX in the future.

791
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:59,000
So for us, whatever Microsoft and Sony are doing in terms of talking about new systems, that's for them to fight out in that red ocean.

792
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:08,000
For us, we want to make sure we're bringing our best content forward. And right now the reaction to Zelda has been, uh, has been more than we could have ever imagined.

793
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Okay. To be fair, Loki, is he wrong?

794
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I'm not, hold on. I was going to take that angle as well.

795
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
All right. All right.

796
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And you know, to be fair, their content is fantastic. Nintendo's games are fantastic. And you know, their approach, what they're talking about here could be that they're, they're not really focused on talking about specs and stuff right now because they're putting out great games that are just going to run on whatever hardware platform they have.

797
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And that's really the draw to these systems.

798
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:47,000
But, but lower your speakers, everybody. But no, no, no. Hold on, hold on. But this is the exact same shit that he fucking talked about with the Wii U and why it was underpowered when it came out.

799
01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Don't get me wrong. Nintendo content is great. It's been great on the Wii U, but if those specs can't run the games that are running on the higher spec systems of your competitors, you're going to be fucked once more.

800
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And that's going to hurt you big time. And granted, yes, there are going to be people that buy your systems for those first party titles, but the Wii U has been the worst selling console that they've had, period.

801
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So, okay, I do actually get your point. Part of what has hurt the Wii U so bad is that the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One games can't be easily ported for the Wii U. I get that.

802
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:42,000
However, assuming that NX is going to be on that same level where it does perform as the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, isn't it true that the new consoles don't matter because Sony and Nintendo have been saying the new consoles don't matter because everything will be playable on the original consoles.

803
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So therefore, in theory, the games should port to NX.

804
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Assuming that the specs of the system are up to that, but being that I'm talking about specs makes me worry and being that he kind of dodged it to content makes me late.

805
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Because if they were like, yeah, you know, not to worry, our system spec wise will be, you know, it'll be able to handle like the stuff that they put out.

806
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
He didn't talk about anything like that. And that worries me because they dodged that last time the same way. And it's like they don't get it.

807
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And it just, it, we'll see. I mean, they haven't talked specs yet.

808
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
That's, I get that. That's valid. I do believe NX, well, not that any opinion is not valid, but you know what I mean?

809
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I agree with you to that point is that if the NX is not at least PlayStation 4 powerful, then there's going to be a big problem because you're right.

810
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It's going to suffer that same fate where third party don't want to just make their games for this system. They don't want to have to do this whole separate thing for it.

811
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I I'm totally with you there. I just don't think the new systems, if, if Sony and Microsoft are being, you know, transparent and what they're saying about these, these upgrades or whatever, that everything should still work.

812
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Hopefully that won't ultimately matter. That makes sense. I just, I just, when someone dodges a question like that, I kind of worry. That's all. Yeah.

813
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But he did make a damn good point coming out of this E3, everybody's talking about Zelda, which is not on a PlayStation 4 level terafloppy system.

814
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That is true. But the sad thing is, it's probably the last great title that's going to be on that system that you've already pretty much killed off already.

815
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And it's like, you know, that's cool, but, uh, I mean, I don't know. I, and I'm, I'm with in agreement with him about like, you know, how they're talking about the new systems because so far, I mean, it's very easy.

816
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So far, they haven't really told us what those systems are going to be used for. And everybody's trying to follow up with questions to see how exactly they're going to use that because what they're saying doesn't seem to make any sense.

817
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And what they're replying with doesn't make any sense either. It's like, well, it's not going to really do much aside from upscale a 4k. Then why do I want to buy this? I mean, I don't know. It just doesn't make any sense.

818
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It's like, why is that a knee right now?

819
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

820
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Cajudo in chat says, if the new Nintendo doesn't at least have a hard drive in it and Nintendo might be fucked. Well, the Wii U's got, well, it's not very big.

821
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah. I already, I already had the plug in something external because I don't want to download another game. I was like, this is stupid.

822
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I kind of don't think that's going to be a problem, but I think what we do need to question is the whole, the rumors about no disc drive. Does this mean that they're going back to flash?

823
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I mean, that's still kind of a thing that obviously E3 is not addressing because we're not talking about NX right now, but a very kind of curious question about that.

824
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I think that, I mean,

825
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Because you can't go download only and not have a gigantic hard drive.

826
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Right. But I think that they're, they're going to go cartridge again, which that ups the manufacturing costs.

827
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And I mean, you're, you're limited to what you can fit on whatever media that they choose to put it on there.

828
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And I understand, I mean, it sounds like they want to do a portable system that way, but.

829
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I still stand by my prediction that the reason why they're going back to cartridge is so that you can put that cartridge in a portable system.

830
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Right. But my worry is also that, you know, because of the reason people still have optical drives is because one, they like watching Blu-rays and stuff on their systems.

831
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And two, it's a lot cheaper to manufacture that stuff and a lot quicker to manufacture it versus putting on cartridge.

832
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But then again, they have expertise to do that since they've been putting on cartridges, you know, for the 3DS.

833
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I do get that point, but one more devil's advocate question for you, then we're going to move on for time.

834
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
What do you watch more Blu-rays or Netflix?

835
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Netflix. But if you want to get to the point where I have a 4K TV, I'm sure as hell not going to be streaming that because it doesn't come over to 1080p half the time.

836
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So, yeah, I mean, granted, yes, we're thinking right now.

837
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's another thing, too. Right now, we're talking spec wise that these systems are going to be around for a while.

838
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But at Sony and Microsoft, they already have these new systems lined up.

839
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah, they're saying, oh, yeah, it's going to play all the same stuff.

840
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But how long is it going to take them to change that decision? I give it a year or so before they're like, oh, but there's these games that only run on these systems.

841
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
And it's slowly, oh, now we're not making those old systems. Okay, now everything is going to be this.

842
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
All right, let's move on. I want to talk about something else out of Ubisoft's conference that I think got a lot of people talking.

843
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And even even Loki can't hate on this, I don't think, is that they finally showed some information about South Park.

844
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
The Fractured But Whole was the best part of the whole conference.

845
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And even a date for the game, December 6th, is when the game will be out.

846
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And it seems like it's riffing on the whole superhero genre, which has been on the Civil War stuff.

847
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah, which is all big in theaters right now. So this is kind of like the play on that.

848
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Apparently, you will be able to do a fart that will rip time. That's that's classic.

849
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
There's a dozen different classes in the game. You can mix and match between them.

850
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You will be playing as the new kid and be interacting with the other South Park characters.

851
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
If you preorder, you get a copy of the Stick of Truth, which I did, and I love it because you can play it right now.

852
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Nice. So, yeah, I'm I'm excited about the game, too, because the last South Park game was pretty good.

853
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I know I know this one will be good as well in chat. There seems to be a lot of excited stuff about that in chat, too.

854
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Stoppy says, I love it when serious news agencies have to say that title.

855
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I think that's probably half the reason that they...

856
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Of course it is. Of course it is.

857
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It's called the new South Park game.

858
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Yeah, it's all about in the delivery as well.

859
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
But here's the best part.

860
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,000
The fractured but whole. Like if you can kind of say it in a way that doesn't sound like the whole.

861
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
The best part is, you know, there's going to be some news outlets that just don't fucking get it.

862
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
They don't realize that it's a pun.

863
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The old news lady that's been on the station since the 1970s reporting, you know.

864
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The fractured but whole.

865
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
You can get like a Barbara Walters saying that, you know.

866
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Today on 20-20, the fractured but whole.

867
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Coming up next on The View.

868
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I somehow have combined Barbara Walters and Julia Child. Don't ask.

869
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I'm not paid to do impressions.

870
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Dark Soccer, are you excited about the fractured but whole?

871
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
No.

872
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
You want to know what?

873
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
What?

874
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I don't give a shit about the fractured but whole.

875
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Alright, then let's move on.

876
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Unintended.

877
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Let's move on to another story, Dark Soccer.

878
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Oh, good lord.

879
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So, this makes me kind of happy, even though I didn't play the second one, which I don't know why.

880
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But there is plans for Bayonetta 3.

881
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Hideki Kamiya said that he was asked when considering Bayonetta 3.

882
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And he said, yes, I've been thinking about it a lot.

883
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
So, I think that they are looking for opportunities to be able to make it.

884
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
But that doesn't mean they're making it.

885
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
No.

886
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Yet.

887
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It means that they really want to.

888
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
If Nintendo wants to write a check, so that bad boy is an exclusive to the NX, which they ought to do.

889
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It is...

890
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Okay.

891
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Can I tinfoil hat for a moment here?

892
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Sure.

893
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
A criminal amount of people have not experienced Bayonetta 2.

894
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And I understand that's because it's on The View.

895
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I wonder those.

896
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Go borrow my copy for fuck's sake.

897
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You've got to play Bayonetta 2.

898
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
But you have kids at home and you really shouldn't play that game when they're within 50 feet of the house.

899
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But here's the thing.

900
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
It's criminal how few people have played Bayonetta 2.

901
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And I said, and many people have said, that game is not going to ever come out for Sony or Microsoft because Nintendo paid for that game.

902
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That doesn't mean it won't come out on the NX.

903
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I really hope, if nothing else, so that Bayonetta 3 can happen.

904
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Yes.

905
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Bayonetta 2 gets a second chance on the NX.

906
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I would be totally okay if Nintendo comes out and says one of the launch titles for the Nintendo NX is Bayonetta 2 Remastered.

907
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And there's going to be so many people that are going to be like,

908
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Remastered? That game just came out.

909
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And I'm going to be like, you fucks didn't play it the first time and so you're missing the fuck out.

910
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So here's your chance. Eat it.

911
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Right, Dark Sakura?

912
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yes.

913
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Thank you.

914
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Let's see.

915
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Going over to a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

916
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
DungeonBuster says it's great at least the first game. Really want to play the second game.

917
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Yeah, you got to check it out.

918
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Stoppy says one and two remastered.

919
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Even better!

920
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Why the fuck not?

921
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
They already put one on the Wii U.

922
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Why the fuck not?

923
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And you know what?

924
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And they can come up with a witty yet sexually charged subtitle for the collection.

925
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
They can call it the Bayonetta Ménage à Trois.

926
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Perfect!

927
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Print it. Patent pending.

928
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Nintendo owes us a quarter of every copy sold.

929
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Trademarked.

930
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Alright.

931
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things that will be coming to a gaming store a little sooner than Bayonetta 3.

932
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Loki.

933
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:10,000
So, this week we've got Deadlight Director's Cut on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

934
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Pac-Man 256 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

935
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
They're porting Umbrella Corps.

936
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:24,000
If you don't remember, that was as a first person shooter spinoff of Resident Evil that was on PlayStation 4 and is going to be on PC.

937
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
A game called Valhalla.

938
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
That's on PC, Mac, and Linux.

939
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And then on Friday, Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.

940
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Hey! What do you know? The Olympics are coming to the Wii U, but maybe not actually to Rio because they're in financial trouble right now.

941
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And then Tokyo Mirage Sessions.

942
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Sonic's got to run away from that Zika virus as fast as he can.

943
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yes.

944
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Bad joke.

945
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Tokyo Mirage Sessions.

946
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Cross FE.

947
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
That's coming out on Wii U as well.

948
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And then, of course, I couldn't forget, you know, the game that's going to make you cry like an anime fan on Prom Night.

949
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Mighty No. 9 is going to be coming out on PC, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U this Tuesday.

950
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Not your words. The official words.

951
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Those are the official words.

952
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
The only thing that'll make you cry in that game is the fact of how lame it probably is going to be.

953
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Actually, to be honest, I watched a stream of it. It looked okay.

954
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
It wasn't terrible.

955
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Misty, any interest in Mighty No. 9?

956
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It was really cheesy as fuck, though.

957
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You like classic games. Mighty No. 9 is kind of a throwback to Mighty No. 9. Would you check out Mighty No. 9?

958
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Or Steaming Pile of Poopy?

959
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
What do you think, Misty?

960
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Honestly, not sure. I would probably have to at least give it a once over before I actually put more thought into it.

961
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Alright. That puts you above 90% of the gaming public right there.

962
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Did she just say, I'm not going to have an opinion until I actually play it?

963
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I think she did. Good for you.

964
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Good for you.

965
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Fuck off.

966
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
At least we get them for the Bethesda conference.

967
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
But someday if, you know, Jeff were to...

968
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
If he were not able to fulfill his duties as host of E3, then I would hope that Adam would be able to step up and...

969
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
What is it, a beauty pageant?

970
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Should Jeff Keighley be unable to fulfill his duties as the Dorito Pope?

971
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Should the next Papal election actually elect Adam Sessler or Morgan Webb or some kind of...

972
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Or both.

973
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Conjoined anomaly of the two of them.

974
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You just made me think of a news article.

975
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
What?

976
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
You saying Dorito Pope made me think of...

977
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Instead of the white smoke, they'll be waving the orange cheese dust when he's elected.

978
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You made me think of the other Republican that called Trump Cheeto Jesus.

979
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Speaking of orange.

980
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I know, right?

981
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Alright, anyway.

982
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Hey, let's go to Japan. Let's check out what's coming out of Japan.

983
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I'm coming out on June 23rd over in Japan.

984
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Buy this for yourself as a birthday present for Orange Lounge Radio to all of our Japanese listeners.

985
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So Akuma JP and anyone else who might be over there who never emails us or calls us or participates in chat.

986
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But June 23rd is the 14th anniversary of our show and is the day that you can pick up The Walking Dead in Japan.

987
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Which Square Enix is actually publishing over there. It's kind of interesting.

988
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Also, Need for Speed gets a price reduction and goes into the EA best hits.

989
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And that whole biohazard umbrella core thing that Loki was talking about a minute ago.

990
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Also out in Japan this week.

991
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That is all on the PlayStation 4.

992
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
If you want to go over to the PlayStation 3, actually nothing this week on the PlayStation 3.

993
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I guess the release is over there slowing down a little bit.

994
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But over on the Wii U, you get Minecraft Wii U edition comes out this week.

995
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
As well as Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is out this week as well.

996
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So a little bit more exciting of a week on the Wii U in Japan than it has been in a little while.

997
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
How about Nintendo's other system, the 3DS?

998
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
There's really only one game out this week.

999
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:33,000
It's Bokuju Monogatari Mitsu no Rino Taisetsu na Tomodachi comes out this week.

1000
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So does that mean? I see the word Tomodachi in it.

1001
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
What's the name again?

1002
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Bokuju Monogatari Mitsu no Rino Taisetsu na Tomodachi.

1003
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Something about best friend?

1004
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Perhaps. And it looks like...

1005
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Legend something?

1006
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Honestly, this looks like a farming game.

1007
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
And judging by the box art...

1008
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Is he from the chat?

1009
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I think he is.

1010
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
That's how I judge Japanese games is by the box art.

1011
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It looks like this girl's best friend is the puppy and this boy's best friend is the kitty.

1012
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
So this is some type of farming type of game, clearly.

1013
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And there's also Happy Little Cows and I Believe in Alpaca, which is kind of a win for me.

1014
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah, weird.

1015
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So there you go. That is out on the 3DS.

1016
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I'm sure it's kind of like another one of those farming sim games.

1017
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:31,000
So if you eat up stuff like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, this kind of looks like it's right up your sleeve.

1018
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Lastly, checking on the PlayStation Vita this week.

1019
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Caligula is out in Japan this week.

1020
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Not to be confused with the porno from the 70s.

1021
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Or maybe referring to the original Roman Emperor who spawned such...

1022
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
This looks like it could be a modernization anime version of that, who knows.

1023
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But also on the Vita this week, Refrain no Chika.

1024
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I like modern anime porn.

1025
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
To-ma-jo no Riodan comes out this week as well in Japan.

1026
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And AkumaJP says, yes, farming means...

1027
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Bokuju Monogatari means farming game.

1028
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So there it is.

1029
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And yes, that's what I said, SSG100Matt here.

1030
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I'll send you this game as well.

1031
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And yes, no Malcolm McDowell in this game to be seen, but there it is.

1032
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Alright, let's go to Europe. Dark Sakura.

1033
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Some stuff.

1034
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:36,000
On the 21st we have Pac-Man 256 on PS4, X-Bone and PC.

1035
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
The Tech Remancer on PS4 and Xbox One and PC.

1036
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And Deadlight Director's Cut on all of the above.

1037
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:50,000
So on the 24th we also have Dino Demi's Kick-Off Revival on PS4.

1038
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And on Wii U, Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE.

1039
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
That's it.

1040
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

1041
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Use the passphrase, church.

1042
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1043
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Hey, that Pac-Man 256 though, I played that on my mobile phone.

1044
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Does that mean that game is going to be free on the consoles?

1045
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I didn't see anything about it.

1046
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
They're going to make me pay for some stuff.

1047
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
You always pay one way or another.

1048
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I guess that's true.

1049
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Alright, I was just curious because I'll probably pick that up on PlayStation 4.

1050
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
But if it's too much money then never mind because it's free on the phone.

1051
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
You know, actually there's a real...

1052
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I could just take a look right now and see on the storefront since you can pull that up.

1053
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Hooray!

1054
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I'll take a look at that one line.

1055
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Alright, we'll look later. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you have in the news?

1056
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
So this is kind of funny. We didn't even really know about this.

1057
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And I think it was ridiculous in the first place.

1058
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
But No Man's Sky, the game was actually going through a lawsuit regarding its name.

1059
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Apparently, Sky has been the issue of that.

1060
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Apparently, Sky TV, they settled a three year long lawsuit with them over the word Sky in that game.

1061
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I just... I don't know what to say.

1062
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I mean, glad that they get to keep their name.

1063
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
But that's stupid.

1064
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
There's no confusion whatsoever in that.

1065
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Apparently, you guys, I'm a motherfucking fugitive.

1066
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And I didn't even know this until this story came out.

1067
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Yes, apparently.

1068
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That is what I've been calling myself in the DDR community and then this show.

1069
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Well, I usually use Rob Roberts more often than I do anymore.

1070
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But my Twitter handle is still Sky.

1071
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So that's kind of funny that I've gotten away with it for fourteen years.

1072
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Well, you also spell it differently.

1073
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I do spell it different. I guess that's the big difference.

1074
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And I also, I don't sell myself. At least not yet.

1075
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So maybe that helps too.

1076
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But no, I had no idea that this was an issue either.

1077
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Which is kind of funny to hear that the word Sky is so...

1078
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Apparently, this isn't the first time that Sky TV has gone after a company for that.

1079
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:10,000
They also went after Microsoft for their cloud service, Sky Drive, which later was changed to OneDrive because of trademark disputes.

1080
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Oh no, I emailed Microsoft and told them to back the fuck up.

1081
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
That's why that changed.

1082
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I don't know what this other news thing is all about.

1083
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Rumors. What can you do?

1084
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
What did you tell them? That you should force them to keep the name of your products?

1085
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Like you forced them to take Windows 10?

1086
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat just kind of rolling it all up in a giant Katamari ball and calling it No Man's Sky Drive with an IE.

1087
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Thank you.

1088
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Perfect. No Man's Sky Drive.

1089
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
There's the name of tonight's episode.

1090
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I don't know, pinballs and cat butts was also pretty good.

1091
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I don't know if things are allowed to fly in video games since the word Sky is apparently on lockdown.

1092
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
But there's a lot of characters flying around in Overwatch.

1093
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And since Overwatch already launched, it's not like Blizzard is going to come to E3 and talk about Overwatch.

1094
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So there really wasn't a lot to say.

1095
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But there was a post that went out during E3 week where the game director Jeff Kaplan did talk about some of the things that are going to be coming to Overwatch to keep the game at the front of your memories and keep the fan base energized.

1096
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Didn't talk about any release dates for characters or maps.

1097
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
But did mention that the team's highest priority is competitive play.

1098
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So this will be a separate multiplayer selection and it's going to be a little bit more of a serious ranked thing than the casual thing that exists today where the serious people have no other place to play.

1099
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
It's kind of a mixing pool right now so hopefully things will be separated.

1100
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Of course no date on that besides soon or when it's done.

1101
01:32:49,000 --> 01:33:00,000
But there is talk about a possible public test realm test to get player feedback which is something that they do in their other games such as World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 and so forth.

1102
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
So there you go. That's what's going on with Overwatch.

1103
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

1104
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
We're going to go back to a classic time where video games didn't fly around the sky. They were nailed to the ground.

1105
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
This is a trip down memory lane. Every week DarkSakura opens the vault and finds a game where she thinks,

1106
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Hey! You! Play this game or I hate you. It's the classic game of the week.

1107
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Poor children.

1108
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
DarkSakura. What is the classic game of the week this week?

1109
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
The classic game is popin' music.

1110
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
What? That's not a classic game. No, I'm kidding.

1111
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It's more classic than Halo.

1112
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
The first popin' music came out September 29th, 1998.

1113
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So it is pretty much classic Bimani. I mean, if you want to look at it that way.

1114
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Basically, popin' music, for those who have lived under rocks and don't know, is not meant to look like a musical instrument or a DJ setup or anything like that.

1115
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Not like how Keyboard Mania and Gitarura and Beatmania and all that were.

1116
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Instead, you have little buttons. You have nine colored buttons.

1117
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And you have to hit the buttons in time with how it hits the bottom line. Very Beatmania in that kind of respect.

1118
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And then you get great, good, or bad. And as you build up a combo, you get fever.

1119
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:42,000
So you can play it in five button mode. I'm sorry, not in five. Yeah, you can play in five button mode or you can play in nine button mode.

1120
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It is just pretty good. I mean, there's no additional score bonuses like in 2DX. Combos are great.

1121
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I believe that they introduced Battle Mode in...

1122
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,000
No, Battle Mode was there, I think, from the beginning where you could have a little mini-game in the middle where you could battle against your friends.

1123
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:10,000
But pop and music for the Bimani series has been one of the ongoing mainstays.

1124
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:18,000
In fact, there are some crazy, I'd say, ongoing items. So this is pretty cool.

1125
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,000
You also have your little balls on the screen. Balls are called Pop-Kun.

1126
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:33,000
You can play in high speed. You can change the appearance of everything. You can do random so it changes the patterns on everything.

1127
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Honestly, it was about time I mentioned it, so here you go.

1128
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And on top of that, it has little characters that have always been, I'd say, mainstays of the series.

1129
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And now, for some reason, I can't find their names.

1130
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yami and Mimi. Yami is the cat. Mimi is the rabbit.

1131
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And yeah, I'm just gonna go with pop and music.

1132
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Alright, you do that. There it is, your classic game of the week. Pooping music. I'm sorry, pop and music.

1133
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Not to be confused with Beaten Groovy on the Xbox 360, which I was very proud of Dark Soccer for not using those words in a sentence.

1134
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And I apologize for ruining her segment by doing so now.

1135
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Because that game was really an atrocity to the great fun of pop and music.

1136
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Which, if you've never played, I always explain this to people where it's like, imagine, what was the best part of playing Trouble, the board game Trouble?

1137
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,000
It was hitting that pop-o-matic bubble every time you got to, and trying to break it every time.

1138
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Because you don't just tap the button, you fucking slam your hand on it, and you pop that bubble.

1139
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Well, imagine if somebody actually made a video game all about pressing the pop-o-matic bubble on Trouble.

1140
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
That is pop and music. You use five or nine of them, and it's beautiful.

1141
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And that's, god damn it, that's why I love music games. Right there. Love it.

1142
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, though. We've got plenty more show to come.

1143
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
We've got some rapid-fire news. The Frugal Question of the Week. Yes, we have a Frugal Question of the Week this week.

1144
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And plenty more to come when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1145
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Don't go anywhere. We will be back.

1146
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with our 646th episode for this June 19th of 2016.

1147
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, here in studio with our pal, Misty.

1148
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,000
A long time OLR listener and fan joining us in studio tonight. Why the hell not? Just because.

1149
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Basically.

1150
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Basically. And also because, I guess it's worth noting, you know, next week we are going to be celebrating.

1151
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
We're not really doing anything special for it because, you know, 14 is a weird number.

1152
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But next week is the 14th anniversary episode of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

1153
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Because I don't know if I can after all these years. But we're going to be celebrating that.

1154
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:16,000
The official birthday of Orange Lounge Radio is June 23rd, 2002 was episode number one of this program.

1155
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:26,000
All those years ago where we sat around playing, we had a bunch of people in the house playing like BeatMania 2DX in one room.

1156
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And I think DDR, Lord knows what mix in the other. Probably Jamie had her Dreamcast pads over or something.

1157
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:43,000
And we were doing our little show in one corner of the room talking about, I think we were talking about a parent who had changed their baby's diapers on a keyboard mania machine.

1158
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
And how mad we were about that. I know that was one of the dark sides.

1159
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That was the one that I told her to get her baby's ass off the machine.

1160
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
How does one do that though?

1161
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I believe that the term is, people's fingers touch that.

1162
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I don't understand how someone would even do that. I mean, because like the machine isn't that big.

1163
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
It was big enough.

1164
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Isn't this interesting that 14 years later you have a whole new perspective on that story?

1165
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
It's like I just would think that they wouldn't sit still. That baby is going on the floor.

1166
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So here we are. Anyway, we'll be looking back and taking your calls and just doing the whole Resiquit podcast, patting yourself on the back thing. We'll do a little bit of that.

1167
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
But not too much.

1168
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I mean, they are holding off the announcement of Half-Life 3 just for the show.

1169
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Oh, thank heavens. Half-Life 14 confirmed. Well, Loki, 4 minus 1 is 3.

1170
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
It is.

1171
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Here I am saying 14 is not a big deal.

1172
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:51,000
But, actually, I think what next week needs to signify, and this is very important, is that it's not that it's our 14th year, but it's the fact that we are only one year away from the OLR quiceniera.

1173
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Which, I'll be damned if it's not the biggest fucking thing we've ever done at Orange Lounge Radio.

1174
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:07,000
We barely did anything for the 10th. Whatever for the 500th. We need to go all out for the OLR quiceniera.

1175
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I will get a party dress for the OLR quiceniera. So, hopefully details on that over the next year. Anyhow.

1176
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Well, that would be one way to get me back quicker.

1177
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:28,000
God. Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, you need to find that kid, referring to the baby on the keyboard mania machine.

1178
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
He's all grown up now.

1179
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And interview him for next week's episode. Because the kid would be 14 years old. Oh my god.

1180
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:45,000
That baby, Dark Soccer, is going to high school right now. Help.

1181
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Alright.

1182
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
His mom won't be changing his diapers.

1183
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I was going to say, and in some portions of the country, he could even be changing his own baby's diapers.

1184
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Alright. Let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get to. Let's get to it. Loki.

1185
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So, they had a real brief thing that they talked about Pokemon Go during their whole Nintendo stream.

1186
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And, you know, for those not in the know, Pokemon Go is a new location-based mobile game from Niantic, who puts out Ingress.

1187
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
We talk about it sometimes. They're currently in beta right now. Closed beta. We're not supposed to be talking about it, but fuck them.

1188
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So, well. Whatever. I do what I want.

1189
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So, Pokemon Go, they're going to have, they announced that they're going to have this device that's going to be sold separately called the Pokemon Go Plus.

1190
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:46,000
And it's this little thing. It looks like, almost like a Poke Ball, but kind of in a teardrop shape, I guess.

1191
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And it has a little button on it that lights up different colors depending on stuff that's happening in the game.

1192
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,000
So, it may buzz and flash if there's a Pokemon nearby and you push the button and it'll attempt to catch it.

1193
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Without actually using your phone. So, you don't even need to look at your phone's screen. It just syncs with the Bluetooth.

1194
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And you can actually catch Pokemon while you're out without actually running the game.

1195
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It's kind of neat. That would come in handy if I'm playing it in my car, because then I wouldn't have to worry about, you know, fumbling with my phone.

1196
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I'd just be like, click the button, click the button, you know.

1197
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Or if I'm like trying to sneakily catch a Pokemon while I'm at work on break or something.

1198
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Why not?

1199
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
So, that is going to be available for $34.99.

1200
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And then, of course, Miyamoto did reveal that, oh, it's going to be out at the end of July.

1201
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And they're like, we're not supposed to be saying that.

1202
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
And they even kind of retracted that as well.

1203
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:51,000
On top of that, they're saying that, you know, when the game launches, it's going to be just the red and blue games worth of Pokemon that generation.

1204
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Which I do see that kind of right now.

1205
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And then they're saying that maybe in the future there may be some sort of gameplay crossover with Pokemon Go and Pokemon Sun and Moon.

1206
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
So, we'll see.

1207
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't think the game's coming out in July.

1208
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
It is pretty damn early.

1209
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I think way too many news outlets ran with that Pokemon in July thing.

1210
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And yes, I understood what was said on the livestream, but I would be very surprised if Pokemon Go is released in July.

1211
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I think way too many news orgs ran with that.

1212
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:30,000
It is very early in that game. That game is not ready to come out any time soon.

1213
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
But then again, we've only been testing it for a few weeks.

1214
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yeah, it's not that it's bad at all.

1215
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
It's just that some of the game elements still need to be ironed out, some of the balancing.

1216
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
You know, there's just, there's a little more that needs to go.

1217
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
You know, from what I've heard, because I'm not as brazen as Loki is, but there you go.

1218
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We're not posting screenshots. They all know who I am.

1219
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
No one listens to this show. Come on, seriously.

1220
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Fair enough.

1221
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I've made my peace with that, so that's fine.

1222
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I did too, about 12 years ago.

1223
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
What else you got, Loki?

1224
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Alright, and in Activision, I mean, we've been talking about this for a while now.

1225
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Activision's finally bringing out their Skylanders Academy show.

1226
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
There's Spyro, goddammit.

1227
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
At least he doesn't look like a fucking freak like the actual figure does.

1228
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
But the Skylanders Academy that's going to be coming out on Netflix.

1229
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
And it's got quite a cast in there as well.

1230
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I'm just excited, well, I'm not really excited about it, but I like that the villain has voice of, you know, Zim from Invader Zim.

1231
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
So, that is kind of cool.

1232
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Although, I'd really wish that Invader Zim was on Netflix instead, but whatever.

1233
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Maybe this is something my son will get into, and I'll say, no, we're not fucking buying those games because that's ridiculous.

1234
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:52,000
And then finally, you know, with the new Zelda game coming out, it's good to know that they're not doing it alone.

1235
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
They're also going to be getting help from Monolith.

1236
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And Monolith, of course, will be the developers behind the Xenoblade Chronicles games.

1237
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So, I could definitely see some sort of influences from that in the new Zelda game.

1238
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,000
You know, we were talking earlier in the show about Wii U games that are pretty good that people have missed, like Bayonetta 2.

1239
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:21,000
There's another, I think if they remade Xenoblade Chronicles for the NX and did that, I don't think anybody would complain or think that it was a bad idea.

1240
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Just saying.

1241
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
No.

1242
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Hey, speaking of the NX, apparently there will be more talk on NX this year.

1243
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Yeah, I know, this is kind of one of those.

1244
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Kind of has to be.

1245
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It kind of has to be, right?

1246
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:39,000
But, for what it's worth, in a financial post-interview with a representative from Nintendo, Scott Moffat,

1247
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
it was confirmed that they will talk more about NX this year.

1248
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,000
So, they did talk about, let's see, with The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild being among the titles we're working on for NX,

1249
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
we're very excited, it will be an immediate reason game fans will want to buy the hardware.

1250
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Second, it's important to have a clear positioning for your proposition and be able to explain it to consumers in a simple and easy way.

1251
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Those are among the things we're working for on NX.

1252
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:11,000
You don't know how to explain your system to people, and it's, I guess it's about a year out, but...

1253
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Okay, here's the part you really want to know.

1254
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
There will be more information coming out later this year.

1255
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
We certainly understand everyone's desire and interest to learn more.

1256
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
We can't wait to tell you all about it.

1257
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
But E3 was not the time.

1258
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:30,000
We wanted to focus our efforts on The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and also on Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.

1259
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
A fantastic new experience in that franchise.

1260
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Later this year, you can expect to get more information on NX.

1261
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Interesting, because I sort of feel like, at least in the build-up to E3, the Pokemon stuff was really like a footnote.

1262
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Like, it's like, no, this is Zelda and nothing but Zelda.

1263
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
We were kind of sitting here going like...

1264
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Yeah, they showed Pokemon first.

1265
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
They're like, okay, let's get this out of the way and then we can talk to Zelda.

1266
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Yeah, and then when it kind of came to actually E3 time, it was like, okay, well, Pokemon, you know, between Go and Sun and Moon,

1267
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
got a fair amount of time, although I'm sure some out there, if Shane's out there, would probably argue not enough time.

1268
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:14,000
But at least it got more than what we thought, which was nothing with Zelda kind of taking over.

1269
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:21,000
So it's interesting that suddenly now folks were saying, well, E3 was about more than just Zelda, let me tell you.

1270
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Anyway.

1271
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Hey, backwards compatibility on the Xbox One.

1272
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Are you a fan of Portal 2 or Left 4 Dead?

1273
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
You should be, because both those games are great.

1274
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
And yeah, they are now on backwards compatibility on Xbox One, so you can play those.

1275
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Also, if you have the more B-list titles, Flashback, Brain Challenge, and Babel Rising, which I don't know any of those games,

1276
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
and I've been doing this show for 14 years, but they are now backwards compatible.

1277
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
So go have fun.

1278
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:55,000
What about the rest of the Orange Box stuff, like, you know, Half-Life 2?

1279
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
That's a great question that I would like to have an answer.

1280
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I was very surprised...

1281
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I would assume if they've got those games running that they have the source engine working, so you would think that that would work.

1282
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I was surprised that Microsoft didn't do more backwards compatibility and, like, fucking lost obviously already.

1283
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
You know what? I still give them props, because they're at least doing it.

1284
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Fuck you, Nin- you know, not fuck you, Nintendo, but they're doing plenty of backwards compatibility, Nintendo.

1285
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Fuck you, Sony, for not even fucking addressing it with your fucking system that's gonna put out 4K, but can't run the fucking PlayStation 1 games.

1286
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Loki. But you can rent them all.

1287
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Oh, well fuck you. You know what? Nobody rents shit anymore, unless it's from Red Box, and I don't see your fucking backwards compatible games in Red Box.

1288
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Anyway, let's, uh, I need to get- I need to get less Loki and more Jamie, so let's shift the topic to Mass Effect, shall we?

1289
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Yes.

1290
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Perfect.

1291
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I can go for this course of action.

1292
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So there is more information out there, just a little bit, about Mass Effect Andromeda.

1293
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:06,000
The character name has been revealed via Twitter, and yes, it was the character we saw at the end of the trailer is the main character.

1294
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:16,000
And, uh, her name is, but we know it will be able to be male or female, but this time instead of male in the trailers, this is gonna be the default, it sounds like, is the female.

1295
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And her name will be Ryder. That's R-Y-D-E-R. So, Ryder is the main character's name.

1296
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Some folks speculating that perhaps, you know, Commander Shepard got their name from Alan Shepard, the first man in space.

1297
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Some wondering if Ryder could be a reference to Sally Ride, which would be a very appropriate tribute because she passed within the past few years.

1298
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
So, um, that could have been something that crossed their mind during the development of this game.

1299
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Who knows? But there we go, now we have a name, Ryder. We don't know if it's Commander Ryder, we could kind of assume, but we'll find out.

1300
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Not soon enough, but we'll find out. DarkSakura.

1301
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Well, some other news coming out of E3 is a trailer has come out for Dragon Quest VII, Fragments of the Forgotten Past, and it will launch in North America on September 16th, 2016 on the 3DS.

1302
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I'm excited about this. The StreetPass thing in this game sounds really cool. So, yay!

1303
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Fun. And then also coming with Final Fantasy XV will be a little bonus game called A King's Tale Final Fantasy XV, which is a side-scrolling beat-em-up that features the main character's father.

1304
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So, that's kind of cool. Sorry, a little built-in prequel, if you will.

1305
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:49,000
And then last but not least, um, some, uh, things for the NX to consider is that of course they want to work on a new kind of Mario game. Miyamoto said so, so we believe him. Right? Right?

1306
01:50:49,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Um, so, uh, no idea what it's gonna be, but it's something. And it's new, apparently. So, it'll probably be a platformer of some kind.

1307
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Well, it makes sense because Super Mario Maker was kind of supposed to be the swang song to Mario as we know it. It's gonna be weird if they just put out, you know, Mario games like we've seen when it's like, I could have made that in Mario Maker.

1308
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, by the way, our chat room is, uh, coming up with some names for this, uh, rider character in Mass Effect. Uh, let's see, uh, Tigerclaw is saying now you can make Winona Rider. You could. You could do Winona Rider.

1309
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Uh, let's see, uh, Raginator is saying Knight Rider. Um, ActDeaf is suggesting Common Rider. Uh, SSG100Matt say you can name your character KK Rider.

1310
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
What about Saber Rider? Who remembers that?

1311
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Uh, why not? But, uh, I, I love that. I think my female will definitely be Winona Rider, just like my female Shepard was Sherry Shepard. So, I'm gonna have Winona Rider, but my male rider is gonna be Richard Rider.

1312
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Ha, ha.

1313
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
And I'll leave it to you to fill in the blanks there.

1314
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Good. I can claim Common Rider then.

1315
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Yes, you can.

1316
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Alright, uh, let's move on with the foogle question of the week.

1317
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
What do you want to bet BioWare changes that name before the game's out?

1318
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Based on, uh, everything coming up in chat right now.

1319
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
No.

1320
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Bobby Blackwolf suggesting Face Rider. No, it's alright. Anyway, hey, DarkSakura, DarkSakura just looked at her brain with how she rolled those eyes.

1321
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Alright, let's go to the foogle question of the week. Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio or, uh, Google.com slash PlusOrangeLoungeRadio.

1322
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:58,000
And this week we asked, of course, another E3 has come and gone. What got you the most excited about gaming's future from this E3?

1323
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:08,000
We're gonna start on Google Plus this week with AJ Twist who said, Microsoft. I'm not excited about them. I'm more interested in what they're trying to do with PC Xbox crossover.

1324
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:16,000
What's their plan five years from now? Is the Xbox gonna be a console or a platform like Steam is? What's gonna happen to Steam on Windows?

1325
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:25,000
So, maybe we have more questions than answers, but, you know, it's very interesting to see that kind of future of, um, Microsoft.

1326
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Let's go over to Facebook where we got our first answer from Rhetortainment who said, three words, nude Norman Reedus.

1327
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:45,000
That was definitely, that was not on my E3 bingo card. I will say that. Nobody predicted that. Nobody. And if you did, buy a lottery ticket. Seriously.

1328
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Rhetortainment also closes that saying. Also, failure and despair to Konami. I suppose I have to mention this at some point.

1329
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Y'all saw the tweet, right? That was a picture of Konami's booth, although somebody sent it to me on Twitter and said,

1330
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Hey, Rob, you should do your podcast from here cause it looks like a really low traffic area where nobody's at.

1331
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:14,000
And it was a picture of Konami's room. And my reply was, I'm sorry, but the room's gonna be so empty that the sound's gonna echo too much.

1332
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I can't, I can't do a good podcast there. Yeah, an echo chamber. What the hell was Konami even doing at E3?

1333
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I guess, is there a persona game? My God. Boy was I about to give Konami credit for something that they sure didn't deserve. I apologize to RPG fans everywhere.

1334
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Don't they have like, they have something coming out. Pro Evo? No, there's something other than Pro Evo that they had coming out. I just don't remember what it was.

1335
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Pachinko. No, it was some anime game. Oh, well. I don't remember. Alright, anyway.

1336
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Moving on, Red the Haze over on Facebook says, I'm on the other side of the world right now, but I still gotta see Spiderman by Insomniac live.

1337
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And for the first time in ages, I got super excited by surprise reveal. I want more recognizable properties handled by proven devs.

1338
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Dark Tetsuya says, if you've seen my timeline this week, then you know I'm all aboard the hype train for The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.

1339
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,000
A new generation Zelda, but in the open world style of the NES original. Where do I sign up?

1340
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Second place would have to go to Kojima's Death Stranding. There definitely seems to be a lot of layers to the game and its theme and all that stuff, as is par for the course with a Kojima trailer.

1341
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And let's not forget the photoshops that have come out of that trailer, such as the pictures of Norman Reedus crying holding a Playstation Vita.

1342
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Or holding a Popplio, the Pokemon that's very neglected and the starting Pokemon and the next thing.

1343
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:50,000
What else? Norman Reedus crying holding things has been great. Although, Norman Reedus throwing a little shade on his own Twitter.

1344
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I don't know if you guys saw, but right after that press conference and that was shown, he actually retweeted an Instagram thing where Kojima was drinking from a cup.

1345
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Where somebody, I'm pretty sure, photoshopped on that Konami Tears. Did you see that?

1346
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Yes I did. That was on his Tumblr or Instagram.

1347
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Fucking hilarious.

1348
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Great. Let's see. Also, moving on to Veronica Isabelle who said The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.

1349
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And Andy R said I got a fairly decent amount of hands-on, face-on time with Playstation VR and I gotta say I'm loving it.

1350
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Eve Valkyrie was amazeballs and stuff like Farpoint and Headmaster were pretty good too.

1351
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Probably has the VR was pretty mad though.

1352
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Unfortunately, at the moment, I'm still a little concerned about getting actual full games in VR as opposed to bad conversions of non-VR games or short demo-like experiences.

1353
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:46,000
But as far as tech is concerned, I'm on board. I'd almost consider even going in on Oculus or Vive now, but I like how Playstation VR doesn't break the bank as much.

1354
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And honestly, I feel like Playstation VR is the most comfortable of the bunch.

1355
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Ragenator says I'm excited to see that Tekken 7 is coming to PC. It's about damn time the PC gamers got a Tekken game.

1356
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
As an aside, it's too bad the older Tekken games aren't either on Steam or GOG.

1357
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I've been a huge fan of the series since Tekken 2 on the Playstation 1.

1358
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And lastly, Hitstun says I'm running behind on gaming news. Was Freedom Planet 2 at E3? I'm pretty hyped for Freedom Planet 2.

1359
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,000
The first one is a perfect example of retro-inspired gameplay in a modern engine and I can't wait to see what they do in Unity.

1360
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,000
You know, I gotta admit, Hitstun, I don't remember seeing a lot coming out about that game at E3.

1361
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:32,000
But, speaking of games that I was hoping to hear more on that I didn't see enough on, where was my Civ 6 coverage?

1362
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Remember when they announced it? I know it was there.

1363
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Was that during the PC conference?

1364
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Oh, was it during the PC conference?

1365
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I don't know, I didn't watch it. I heard it was boring as hell.

1366
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Okay, somebody on Twitter, I'm not gonna say who, somebody on Twitter posted a selfie with the people making Civilization 6.

1367
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And I was like, great selfie, where's my news? How was the game? Did you play it? Was it a demo? Did it look good?

1368
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Have you even played a Civ game before?

1369
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So I was just a little bit like, I want to know a little more about the Civ 6, but granted I didn't dig deep enough to be fair.

1370
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I probably just need to get on good old Google News and try to find where all the hands-on was Civ 6 or what it was they were showing at E3.

1371
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,000
But of course, does it really matter because we all know I'm gonna get that game anyway? Maybe not.

1372
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I guess it's kind of like the Zelda thing. I don't need to watch 8 hours of Zelda. I'm already gonna buy it. Does it matter at this point?

1373
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I guess it's the same thing with Civ 6.

1374
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Alright, moving on, let's get back into some long form news. Again, add us on Facebook.

1375
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1376
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Skye, reminds me of the Russians bombarding us with questions when you took a selfie with the farming simulator cow.

1377
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Okay, to be fair, yes that did happen a couple years ago. I took a selfie with the farming simulator because I thought it was a cute cow.

1378
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And I was like, look at me with the farming simulator. All of a sudden I'm getting all these fucking questions. Like, tell us about the game.

1379
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And I was like, oh shit, people, I did not know in Russia a farming simulator was some serious fucking business, but apparently it is.

1380
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:20,000
And to be fair, I'm sure it has a cult following here in the States too. There's enough of a following where they would make those fucking games if there weren't people playing them.

1381
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:33,000
But I do also want to point out, since that time, I also got addicted to Euro Truck Simulator, so I understand the sim needs. I've been enlightened since those days of selfies with cows.

1382
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I think they have Euro Truck Simulator for VR too, so.

1383
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I'm all about, I'll get it. I'm all about that. It'll be fun. Anyway. Alright, let's move on with some other news. Loki.

1384
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:56,000
So this I didn't even see at all at E3, but apparently Rock Band 4 is getting an expansion in October called Rock Band Rivals.

1385
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:11,000
And with that they're going to be getting an update, I guess, that allows them to add some support for custom set lists, double kick pedal support, I'm assuming for the drums, and then practice mode as well.

1386
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:25,000
And, yeah. I guess that's going to be the last update that they're getting? I don't know. That's what it says.

1387
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Interesting ploy to get Rock Band through a second holiday season now that the game is more fleshed out and probably where it should have been when it released, but we'll see if that pays off or not.

1388
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
They didn't mention a price though, right?

1389
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
No, they didn't say...

1390
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:50,000
See, if it's like a $60 game then they can kind of sit on it, but if it's, you know, like $20 or $25 I might be into that.

1391
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yeah, it doesn't really say anything as far as that they're just going to be adding new features in the future, which is vague as hell.

1392
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Yeah, it is.

1393
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And then along with that, they're supposed to be having a new guitar. It was apparently based off of, was it a Fender Jaguar?

1394
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Oh yeah, that was that whole stealthy video they put out before E3 was actually pictures of that controller.

1395
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Yeah, so it looks neat, I guess. I don't know.

1396
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
If you don't have enough plastic instruments in your house, here's a new one.

1397
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I like the charger that they have where you can set your guitar in it and it charges it. That's kind of neat.

1398
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
That's pretty cool. I like that.

1399
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
What the hell is that? I have no idea what this thing is.

1400
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
What is it?

1401
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It's some sort of adapter. Oh, Xbox One.

1402
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Oh, it's the legacy adapter.

1403
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
It's the wired legacy adapter for Xbox One. So you can plug in your instrument.

1404
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,000
See, that's really the only way I would do that because I have all the instruments for the 360 and just...

1405
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Yeah, I mean, I need to have those work before I buy that game.

1406
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Alright, well, believe it or not, E3 was not the only big thing in tech that happened last week because Apple did one of their keynotes as well.

1407
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Not as a part of E3, but I think Worldwide Developers Conference was also last week.

1408
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Every year.

1409
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Yeah, so there's always the great decision that nerds have to make. Am I going to pay attention to E3?

1410
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
It's an easy decision.

1411
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Well, it just depends on who you are.

1412
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:25,000
But anyway, Apple, as a part of WWDC, did announce iOS 10, which is something that we've been anticipating.

1413
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But there is a new future in there that is of some importance, I think, to gamers.

1414
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
There's going to be something in iOS 10 called ReplayKit Live.

1415
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
This will allow you to livestream apps in addition to being able to record them.

1416
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
So you can also do your own audio or video remarks.

1417
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
So, of course, you have to wait for this to come out.

1418
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
We don't know the date just yet, just kind of a vague timeframe.

1419
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:52,000
But, you know, Apple kind of does things like clockwork in this department, so you can probably take a pretty good guess.

1420
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
And, of course, we have to wait for the apps that support it as well.

1421
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
But this is going to be a pretty big deal.

1422
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Android folks have been able to do this, I believe, through the Twitch app.

1423
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So it sounds like iOS is going to be able to do that as well with streaming games.

1424
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:15,000
So if Loki wanted to, I suppose, he could go out and stream Pokemon Go and be yelling and screaming when the Charmander runs away.

1425
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And his little poof of smoke, because Loki didn't catch him.

1426
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
No, I wouldn't be able to because I don't have a fucking iOS device.

1427
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I have an Android device. Technically, I could probably do that now if I wanted to.

1428
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Fine, then I'll do it. I'll do it.

1429
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
All right. But there you go. That is something to look forward to in iOS 10.

1430
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Let's move on to something completely different, Dark Sakura.

1431
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Well, you know, one of my special loves is finding beta and prototype builds of games.

1432
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Especially if they don't come out.

1433
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So any EA game? I'm sorry.

1434
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
So this one especially makes me happy.

1435
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:54,000
It's put out by someone who owned a Dreamcast developer kit.

1436
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:03,000
And found a build of a cancelled Echo the Dolphin Defender of the Future sequel called Echo 2 Sentinels of the Universe.

1437
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:07,000
The ROM has already been uploaded. Some of the levels are playable.

1438
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
They are missing, you know, there's no audio.

1439
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
They're missing, you know, textures and certain interactive elements.

1440
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
But the game was well underway.

1441
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And it actually comes from the Katana Dreamcast development kit.

1442
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
So it's pretty neat. The ROM is available.

1443
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:36,000
You can actually find the link to it from I believe that the site is called Hidden Palace.

1444
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,000
If you go to HiddenPalace.org, there is a lot of information on it there.

1445
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So Echo fans, go get it. Go play. Maybe finish it.

1446
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Finish it.

1447
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Alright.

1448
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:59,000
There's some more details coming out regarding Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 and 3.

1449
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I can't keep track of these fucking numbers.

1450
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
I mean, I don't know what the hell this is.

1451
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
The trailer looked neat.

1452
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I have not played.

1453
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
See, they really need to come out of the collection of all the Kingdom Hearts games for like Playstation 4.

1454
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Then I can go back and actually play them.

1455
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Because I have no fucking clue.

1456
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I played one, but it was so long ago, like, I don't remember it.

1457
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
And I haven't played any of the other ones.

1458
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
And I can't keep track of that story.

1459
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,000
But apparently, I guess, they're saying that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep 0.2, a fragmentary passage.

1460
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Subtitle crazy, yo.

1461
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:40,000
They basically said that they can alter the game pretty easily now because of the Unreal Engine 4.

1462
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
And they've improved the lighting.

1463
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
They were saying that...

1464
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I guess...

1465
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I was kind of going into details regarding the game, so I'm trying to see if I can get a brief summary here.

1466
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Basically, they said the intended play order of the games, according to this, is Dream Drop Distance, and then a fragmentary passage, and then Kingdom Hearts 3.

1467
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And...

1468
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Basically, they said that the fragmentary passage is not entirely scrapped content from Kingdom Hearts 3.

1469
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It was something that they felt they needed to make before Kingdom Hearts 3.

1470
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Was I the only one this whole time up until like two weeks ago when the E3 madness started?

1471
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I thought that 2.8 was going to be 1 and 2, but on the Playstation 4.

1472
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,000
And so I was kind of disappointed when I found out, oh, it's just the 3DS one.

1473
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Except for the fact that means it'll have the Tron Legacy level, which I guess is awesome.

1474
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Yeah, and they did show that in the trailer, but yeah, I'm kind of with you.

1475
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
The way they numbered this shit with all the stuff, I don't fucking know what content's in here.

1476
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Just put out a goddamn collection.

1477
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Can't they just put out the Kingdom Hearts buffet?

1478
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Here's all the fucking games.

1479
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Yeah, I get it. 2.8 and 0.2 equals 3.

1480
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
And a 12 volume encyclopedia explaining the story.

1481
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Exactly. I don't fucking know. Just tell me, okay, here's the game.

1482
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
We're going to order all the fucking chapters of the game. Just play these in order. You'll get the storyline. Done.

1483
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Thank you. That's all I need.

1484
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
But like this, I don't understand this. Like, I don't know what to buy. I don't know what to play.

1485
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I don't know the fucking story.

1486
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Is Sora still in it? I mean, is there a Mickey game?

1487
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Yeah.

1488
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I don't know. I don't know who these people are.

1489
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Yeah.

1490
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Alright.

1491
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I think Cloud gets in there at some point.

1492
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Isn't he a bad guy at one time? I don't know. Sephiroth?

1493
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I want to just quickly, before I move on to the next story, you know, we have a live chat room.

1494
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,000
So part of doing this show is that sometimes you get live updates on not just gaming things, but things that happen in the real world.

1495
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And we were just talking about this earlier, about the whole tragic death of Anton Yelchin.

1496
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And there's an update here from Stoppy in our chat room.

1497
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And I thought this was worth mentioning with what we were talking about, Dark Sakura, with the whole negligence.

1498
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,000
It might not have been based on this report.

1499
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Apparently, Jalopnik is saying the car that killed him might have been the subject of a recall having a faulty gear selector.

1500
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:19,000
In mid-April, Jeep recalled 1.1 million vehicles equipped with 8-speed automatic transmission because, according to the automaker's recall notice, some drivers exited their vehicles without first selecting park, ultimately causing the cars to roll away uncontrollably.

1501
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Why would it be in neutral, though?

1502
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I don't know, but if something was wrong with the gear selector, it might have got stuck there on the way back.

1503
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Anyway, again, that report coming from Jalopnik, I'm sure we're going to be hearing a lot more in the coming days, but ain't that going to be something if it ends up...

1504
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,000
If that is the case, then we're looking at an even bigger deal.

1505
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Well, I mean, maybe like I know a lot of the cars, you can't take the key out of the ignition unless it's in park.

1506
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Maybe it's allowing you to take the key out of the ignition for some reason.

1507
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Who knows?

1508
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I mean, my car doesn't let you take the key out if it's not in park.

1509
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
So we're going to hear a lot about this in the coming days, I'm sure.

1510
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,000
There's going to be a lot more than just, you know, because people are going to want answers.

1511
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Anyhow, I know that was not directly gaming-related, but y'all are nerds, and I know even if you didn't want to admit you saw it, you all went and saw the new Star Trek films, and despite how you felt about the movies, that kid did a great job playing in those movies.

1512
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
So, he was a lot of fun to watch.

1513
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Alright, let's move on to some more gaming...

1514
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Actually, this is the part where we would do the mailbag.

1515
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Participate at orangeloungerator.com is the place to send emails.

1516
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:41,000
However, my understanding is that Dark Sakura went into the emailbag, and what did you find, Dark Sakura?

1517
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Jack shit.

1518
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Wasn't there a story, mister?

1519
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Did we miss a story?

1520
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Oh, I was supposed to do a story, I'm sorry, I'll get to that.

1521
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Boy, we're failing on all sorts of levels tonight, but the emailbag tonight is empty.

1522
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
And I failed at reading my story in a timely manner.

1523
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Anyway, so, in lieu of the emailbag, why don't we talk about Microsoft and Steam and their relationship here?

1524
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Oh, hey, that reminds me, I mean, completely unrelated, but now that we thought we had all the game show stuff...

1525
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I love how you just fucking read me for not doing my story! I open my mouth and I start to do the story.

1526
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Oh, hey, I'm gonna derail you with this random fucking thought I had!

1527
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Okay, and it's been like 14 years and this is a surprise, come on.

1528
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Aren't quesadillas delicious?

1529
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:46,000
No, what I was gonna say is, you know, I'm sure you've heard that the match game's coming back, right?

1530
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
That I, okay, that is worth talking about. Yes, I have heard that it's coming back.

1531
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:59,000
It debuts, if I'm not mistaken, the same night, or no, no, no, the Celebrity Family Feud and the Pyramid start the same, like, it's gonna be a Sunday night thing.

1532
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
But I don't think the match game's a part of that, right?

1533
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,000
The Pyramid is the guy that just left Kelly Michael Stram.

1534
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
No, not Pyramid, I'm talking about match game.

1535
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Alec Baldwin.

1536
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
That's right, yes, yes.

1537
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Which is, it's a little weird for me, but I have to see an emotion. I mean, honestly, it kinda doesn't matter who hosts the show, it's really about who are the mainstay panelists.

1538
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I wanna see who the panelists are.

1539
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Yeah, I know that TBS piloted one, complete with the 70s retro set, and one of the standing panelists was supposed to be Sarah Silverman.

1540
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:40,000
And I understand she's controversial, and I understand that not everybody likes her, but I think she would have been pretty fucking hilarious on that show.

1541
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I can't remember who the other standing, you know, usually there's a few that are standing, like Charles Nelson Reilly back in the day, and what Richard Dawson was on it all the fucking time.

1542
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Brett, not Brett Butler. What was her name? Brett Summers, was that her name?

1543
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I don't remember.

1544
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Damn it. Brett Butler was the one that was on Grace Under Fire. What's she doing? I guess she could be a match game panelist.

1545
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
But, yeah.

1546
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Alright, sorry.

1547
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:17,000
No, that's okay. I was excited. I thought we were gonna talk about Casa Diaz. Alright, let's talk about Xbox and Steam.

1548
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Apparently, there was some talk about what's going on, and this was during a giant bomb livestream that was going on where Phil Spencer was on, talking about Microsoft kinda going back into the, growing, I guess, in the PC gaming space.

1549
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:37,000
And they actually talked about Steam, which is interesting because Windows typically has tried to push their own platform, right?

1550
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:49,000
So Phil Spencer did comment on this, and I gotta say, Phil Spencer does do a really good job handling the press and the media and kinda showing that he is a gamer that kinda gets it, unlike the guy before him.

1551
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:58,000
But anyway, Phil Spencer did mention, I look at Steam today, it's on an incredible growth trajectory. It's a massive force in gaming, a positive force.

1552
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I think it will be bigger a year from now than it is today, and five years later it will still be bigger again.

1553
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I look at Valve as an important independent software vendor for us on Windows. They are a critical part of gaming success on Windows.

1554
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I don't think Valve's hurt by not having our first party games in their store right now. They're doing well. We will ship games on Steam again.

1555
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Hmm. And then he actually went on to say, talk about some of the shortcomings of the Windows Store.

1556
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:30,000
They all haven't gone swimmingly. Some of them have gone well. Forza 6, Apex did well. Quantum Break wasn't our best PC release.

1557
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Killer Instinct did well on PC. Gears of War Ultimate Edition was okay. We definitely learned there.

1558
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:41,000
And then one more comment on Steam here. There's gonna be areas where we cooperate and there's gonna be areas where we compete.

1559
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
The end result is better for gamers. Ain't that the truth?

1560
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I like hearing Phil Spencer and hearing him talk. Even when I don't always agree with what Microsoft does, I think it's in a much better place now under Phil Spencer than it was previously.

1561
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week. Since I've messed up the flow of this show so bad, what better way to get things back on track than releasing a little angst?

1562
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:34,000
FU to trying hard. Sometimes you try and it's just not good enough. So, fuck it.

1563
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Um, Loki.

1564
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Um, FU to the dinner place I went to, the Tofu. I don't even know, some Tofu place. Tofu is in the title. I should have really just said, uh, nope. Not going there.

1565
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Loki, what the hell were you thinking?

1566
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I don't know what I was thinking.

1567
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
At least you got a Slurpee.

1568
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I did get a Slurpee. That was the best part. I should get another Slurpee on my way home. That's really shit.

1569
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
They have banana flavor. That's my fucking favorite.

1570
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Uh, I don't remember a banana with cherry coke.

1571
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
If you see banana, I want a text message. Banana's my favorite.

1572
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Blue raspberry. They may have banana.

1573
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Alright. That's it.

1574
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Uh, Misty. Since you're here, join in. FU. What do you want to say FU to?

1575
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I will agree with Jameis somewhat, especially when it comes to people's opinions of what you're doing.

1576
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Just fuck it. Do what you're going to do as long as it's not going to screw your health over or something like that.

1577
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Do whatever you- or infringing on somebody else. Do whatever the hell you want to do unless you're going to, you know, piss off somebody else.

1578
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Basically.

1579
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Alright. Uh, and then my FU of the week goes to, I think just kind of like, stress.

1580
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
I just, oh my god, like, every little thing has been taking me off today.

1581
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I don't know if I'm just, like, having, um, the 90 day male PMS thing or what it is, but I swear to god, every little thing's been taking me off today.

1582
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And it's just been non-stop, so I think it's just all stress. So FU distress.

1583
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Alright, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys, and we're going to get to the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.

1584
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1585
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Uh, but before we get there, just a couple quick stories. Loki.

1586
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Alright, um, so, you may remember there was that game, Allison Rowe, we talked about how it was cancelled.

1587
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Um, you know, basically it was like this, almost like an answer to PT.

1588
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:27,000
However, you know, they were sitting, they were going to discuss why it was cancelled.

1589
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
It doesn't really answer anything. Basically, their comment was, you know,

1590
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:42,000
after long consideration between Team17 and ourselves, we have reached a mutual agreement to end our collaboration on publishing Allison Rowe under Team17's games label.

1591
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Um, sometimes things pan out differently than expected as game development and publishing have so many layers of complexity.

1592
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:57,000
We'd like to especially thank everyone for their support throughout, and this has and always will be appreciated.

1593
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Okay, then what the hell does that mean?

1594
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:08,000
What the hell kind of explanation was that? Sometimes mommy and daddy get very angry at each other and say things they don't mean.

1595
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Like, what the hell kind of explanation was that? That was weird.

1596
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Yeah, so it's like, uh, does that mean you're going to still make it?

1597
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I'm worried Resident Evil 7's not going to come out because it's too close to PT and that fucking game is cursed.

1598
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Swear to God.

1599
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Yeah, Dark Tetsuya in chat says, well, at least we have Resident Evil 7 to look forward to.

1600
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Look out. Be careful.

1601
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Well, something you do have to look forward to, if nothing else, is the console release of Stardew Valley.

1602
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
That game, I still don't understand why Dark Sakura isn't playing because I do think she'd be a big fan of this, but we'll see.

1603
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Stardew Valley, I was waiting for a witty retort.

1604
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Stardew Valley was confirmed during E3 week. It's not like the game was there, but it was confirmed during E3 week.

1605
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Well, actually, I did see it at one of the press conferences, so maybe they had it on one of the kiosks on the show floor.

1606
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
It was listed, it was under the Xbox Indie Games, I want to say.

1607
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Ah.

1608
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
They showed that, because they also showed, uh, um, was it We Happy Few?

1609
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Yeah. So, Stardew Valley was confirmed. It will be coming to the Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, and the Wii U.

1610
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:31,000
So, Stardew Valley will be getting some help with the ports from Chucklefish and Sick Head Games, and the game is expected to be out in the winter holiday season, although they don't say a specific date.

1611
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,000
But, the author did say in his blog post that he posted on this,

1612
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I'm also excited about the possibility of utilizing special console features like the Wii U's second screen.

1613
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I hope he, this is one of those games that would really benefit with the whole, like, inventory management and stuff from a second screen,

1614
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:57,000
so I really hope he's able to do what Minecraft could not do by actually implementing the second screen.

1615
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
So, uh, Loki, have you checked out Stardew Valley at all?

1616
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Nope.

1617
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
You really should. You guys are-

1618
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Nope.

1619
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Fail, fail, fail.

1620
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Okay, uh, well anyway, that's going to do it for the scripted news tonight, but it is about time for us to open up the Skype line.

1621
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:17,000
That's right, it's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls on anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we missed.

1622
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I don't know.

1623
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Skype line is open now.

1624
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1625
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Please make sure you've tested your connection with Echo 123 before you give us a call.

1626
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
That is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1627
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,000
And, well, it's lighting up already, so let's get to it.

1628
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1629
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
It's Shane.

1630
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Well, hi, Shane, how are you?

1631
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I'm fine.

1632
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I feel like it's been a long time since we've heard from you. How's Ranger Pridecast going?

1633
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Uh, I'm sure it's okay. I haven't been on the last week, so.

1634
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Well, uh-

1635
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I need to mute my TV, because I don't want to hear me through the TV.

1636
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
That's, yeah, you should probably, the first rule of calling into a radio show is to mute your radio.

1637
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I was busy playing Pokemon, so I didn't care to follow these rules.

1638
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,000
That's no excuse.

1639
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:06,000
And I know you were out of town last week, and I'd mentioned to the listeners, you unfortunately were in Orlan-

1640
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Well, I mean, you were in Orlando when everything happened there, but you were nowhere near that mess, thank heavens.

1641
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Yeah, three days of death is basically what I went into Orlando with, I guess, so it's not great.

1642
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Uh, yeah, there's not been a lot of good news coming out of Orlando, that's for sure.

1643
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:31,000
But anyway, let's go on to happier things to take our mind off of all that craziness going on.

1644
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Video games, what'd you think of E3?

1645
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Um, you mean the Pokemon Sun and Moon show? It was pretty good.

1646
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:41,000
So, let me guess, you called in tonight to talk about Pokemon Sun and Moon?

1647
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
That is my first topic.

1648
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Alright, well, what would you like to say about Pokemon Sun and Moon?

1649
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Besides the fact that it looks amazing, I think that for the first time, probably since, I don't know, probably the first time period,

1650
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I think they're really doing a great job of making the entire game more accessible to people who are not as maybe into it.

1651
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:19,000
And don't follow the sites to look up strategies for battling, or just have a very vague understanding of how Pokemon works.

1652
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I think this entry is really allowing a newer, bigger audience to come in and join the fun that we all have.

1653
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Why is that? What is it about this game compared to the others?

1654
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Well, originally, for the first six generations, if you are fighting a Pokemon, you know, you kind of should have an understanding of some sort of like, you know, the weaknesses to the elements.

1655
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Like if you are a water type Pokemon that you're using, it's going to be strong against fire.

1656
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Well, that's basically all you kind of know, unless you're like constantly looking up things on the internet about, you know, each move and all this.

1657
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Well, now what they're doing is not only, you know, if you look that up, you'll know that information.

1658
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:14,000
But if you battle, say, like if I'm Popplio, because that's what I'm going to be is Popplio, and I'm fighting Litten.

1659
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Well, I know that my water attacks can be strong against it.

1660
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:27,000
But now when I select that move after the first time I've battled against Litten, I will see on that move, it'll say it is super effective.

1661
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:33,000
So no longer will you have to go back and forth trying to remember things like that. It's going to list it for you.

1662
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:39,000
And another great thing is during the stream, Popplio leveled up and learned a fairy move.

1663
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Well, that's a newer, you know, typing that came out last generation.

1664
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:48,000
And it's not good against fire. And it showed right there underneath it, not very effective.

1665
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:54,000
So you know what moves are going to be, you know, strong against the Pokemon that you're fighting or weak.

1666
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
They probably just figure everyone's going on the internet anyway.

1667
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Well, yeah, probably. But if you don't have access to the internet, what if you're on like a plane ride and you forget?

1668
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Another great thing that they've kind of streamlined is the fact that during the battles, without having to go through extra screens,

1669
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,000
you can select each move and find out exactly how strong it is and what it does.

1670
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:25,000
And they have a way instead of writing down on paper that I see all the time when I watch the video game tournaments,

1671
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,000
they have a little icon of your character on the bottom screen that you touch.

1672
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:36,000
And if you have any status effects, like if your speed has been lowered or if you gained attack power, it's going to show it there.

1673
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:45,000
So that's brand new as well. And it just looks gorgeous. And I love all the new Pokemon and I want to collect them all.

1674
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Even the basic Pokemon that are in the game you're excited about?

1675
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Yeah, like, like Yungoos and the little, like, Donald Trump looking mongoose there.

1676
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,000
No, okay, there's some, like, there's some parody Twitter account out there that already followed me.

1677
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:11,000
That has to be a listener of this show because they tweeted something about it, but it's actually like a Yungoos that is like parodying Trump.

1678
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Yeah, I just blocked it. I didn't really care. That's annoying.

1679
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
You already blocked, but it's Pokemon, Shane. Why did you block it?

1680
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:26,000
If you're going to be annoying with Pokemon, I don't like you. So I'm not going to listen to you or talk to you.

1681
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
You're so mean.

1682
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I just love that the 40 minute demo, the person playing had Popplio as his Pokemon. Like, this is, this is made for me.

1683
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I love it. It's so cute.

1684
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
What about, um, what about Pokemon Go? How are you feeling about that?

1685
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Um, I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm still not in the beta, whatever. I don't care anymore.

1686
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I preordered my little Go attachment because I just feel like that's going to be beneficial.

1687
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:05,000
And I'm interested in seeing how it's going to connect to Sun and Moon because during that presentation, they did say that there is planned connectivity somewhere down the line.

1688
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:11,000
And it is not your Pokemon going between the two games. Get that fanfic out of your head right now because the two games...

1689
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I wouldn't want it. It's just Gen 1 Pokemon cares about them.

1690
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:21,000
It's stuff I've been seeing on the Pokemon Go Reddit and stuff is just like, get that fanfic out of your head that is not happening because that would just, that's way too imbalanced.

1691
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:30,000
The Pokemon in Pokemon Go, so I've heard, are a lot different than the Pokemon in the games. Like, as far as stats go and how you level them and all that stuff.

1692
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Yeah, I wouldn't even see a point in that to be quite honest. If it unlocks random little things, that's cool.

1693
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Yeah, that would be cool. Items or a secret little lair or something. I don't know. Something silly. Maybe like, Flare for your Pokemon Go profile or something. Who knows?

1694
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Yeah, that works.

1695
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Was that it or was there something else you wanted to talk about?

1696
02:25:50,000 --> 02:26:00,000
So the other thing is gaming related but not video game related. While I was gone, I played in this thing called an escape room.

1697
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I've never even really heard of them before but apparently they're all over the place and you have 60 minutes, you're locked in a room and you solve puzzles to get out.

1698
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:14,000
And it is literally the coolest thing I've ever done.

1699
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Really?

1700
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:22,000
I had such a good time. If you like puzzles and thinking, then you're just going to get a huge kick out of it.

1701
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:32,000
The first one that me and my boyfriend did, we were in an art gallery, this very small art gallery and the theme was a heist.

1702
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And somebody had stolen a painting and we had to, it was currently being hidden there and we had to get it and get out.

1703
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:46,000
So we're in this little room, there's just like six paintings on the wall and a barred door and we're like, we don't, we didn't really know what to do.

1704
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And time's ticking away and then you start like reading the placards and they lead to clues that are in the painting, like really small numbers.

1705
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:59,000
At some point, we actually unlock the door next to us, which opens up into another room with all these different things.

1706
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:04,000
And the coolest part of that one that we played, we played too, because we had so much fun the first time.

1707
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:09,000
But the coolest part of that one was we had this number and we didn't know what to do with it.

1708
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,000
There were no more locks that we could like twist to, you know, put the number in.

1709
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:23,000
But he found this keypad on this bookcase and he put the number in the keypad and we hear a click and then we could slide the entire bookcase.

1710
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:28,000
And this bookcase is big. It's like takes up half a wall, but we slid it over into another room with bars.

1711
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:33,000
And that was so awesome. Like it just blew my mind that things like this exist.

1712
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Yeah. And actually a lot of people in chat are like, oh yeah, they got one in my town or what have you.

1713
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,000
And yeah, these things are kind of like a trend across America right now. They're all over. I haven't done one myself yet.

1714
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:48,000
And, you know, it's kind of one of those things I always saw and kind of went, oh, that could either be like really awesome or really freaking lame.

1715
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:55,000
But you were, you were really excited about that. I mean, you said it's the coolest thing you've ever done and you hang out with me a lot and I'm really cool.

1716
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,000
So this is cooler than that. Wow.

1717
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I just, I don't know what to say to that. That's a big ego.

1718
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they had one of these in the middle of the gaming floor at MomoCon.

1719
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,000
So now this is the type of thing they bring to conventions and stuff, too.

1720
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I don't see that's that's my problem, though, is that this one is the first one I did.

1721
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:22,000
And what I liked so much about it was that we were not even that's an escape room game.

1722
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Our rooms had multiple rooms attached to them to, you know, to go through.

1723
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:34,000
The second one we did, it was me and Bobby and then these three other people, this family.

1724
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:42,000
And the thing was like we had to escape from prison. So me and Bobby are in a jail cell and there's a wall dividing us and the other team who are also in a jail cell.

1725
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:49,000
We had to work to get out of that to get into a boiler room to slide down a freaking slide into the warden's office.

1726
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:56,000
So it's it's not just one room, but all these other places I'm hearing are like, oh, yeah, we just stick you in a room and you have to figure out all these puzzles.

1727
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I don't know. That doesn't feel like as cool to me. Well, I wanted to expand.

1728
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Orlando is the theme park capital of the world, so they kind of have to step their game up. You know what I mean?

1729
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Well, and this is in other places. I do have a couple in Sacramento, actually.

1730
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Yeah, there are some I know there's one right by the sushi place that that Shane and I've gone to several times.

1731
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:25,000
There's one like literally right in that same shopping center. And then I imagine like didn't this whole trend start in the Bay Area in like San Francisco?

1732
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
So I imagine San Francisco has to have some bang up escape rooms.

1733
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:36,000
There's actually because I looked on Yelp last night or Jim did Flaco Jones.

1734
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:45,000
And there's one here in my town of Elk Grove. And it's got the highest ratings of like all the local ones, all Sacramento, Roseville, all the our entire area.

1735
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Interesting. So, yeah, Bobby, I need to do it.

1736
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Bobby saying there's two of them in Atlanta. Oh, when I come out for Dragon Con, Bobby, I'll be fine, wouldn't it?

1737
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:02,000
You know, you say that and I say that because I think it's really fun. But the problem is with these games is you have to have the right temperament for it.

1738
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:08,000
You can't get frustrated easily. Are you saying are you saying that I might snap at Bobby Black?

1739
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Oh, I said I said that to you already. You'd snap at anybody. I don't know how you would do in these.

1740
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And like, as I found out when we were working with our team, if you've got somebody who's kind of bossy and thinks that they need to take charge, that's a hindrance as well.

1741
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I would never crazy. I would never do that.

1742
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:32,000
All right. If that's what you think, we'll go with that, even though we know better.

1743
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:37,000
All right. So I know the escape room concept is kind of interesting. It's like IRL type of stuff.

1744
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:43,000
It's like video games IRL and a lot of I think I haven't done like phone apps and stuff to try to capture some of that same magic.

1745
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I'm sure it's not the same thing, though, because you're not like sliding an actual bookcase across the wall and all that stuff.

1746
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Yeah, I think there are things like that. And I you know, maybe I try them because I like figuring out puzzles so much.

1747
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Oh, one of the other cool things about the one that we did with the wall that slid, we also had to put together a puzzle randomly, but we couldn't find all the pieces.

1748
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:12,000
And it actually like when you put it all together, it was like a riddle. So we had to figure out that puzzle without having all the pieces.

1749
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:17,000
I was like, oh, God. But I got out because we beat we beat both of them, which was awesome.

1750
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:22,000
So, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says escape rooms are the new team building exercise.

1751
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:27,000
My girlfriend is doing one with her company in a few weeks. I've heard of that being used in like a corporate world, too.

1752
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:33,000
How do they get you in the room? Do they say, here's this jail cell for you to walk into? Like what? How do they get you in there?

1753
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Well, the one that we went to, I see you're going in of your own volition, but it's just like a long hallway and all the doors on the outside.

1754
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
They just look normal, look like normal doors. So they're just like, OK, you go in this room for the jail.

1755
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And they told us to go in one room and the other team or the other people go in the other room and then you get in there.

1756
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:02,000
It's like, oh, this looks like, you know, a really run down prison cell. They did a really good job.

1757
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Interesting. OK. All right. All right. Well, I'm going to let you go so we can try to get more calls.

1758
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:16,000
But thanks for the call. That was. Yeah, I feel like we do need to do an escape room, but I feel like it's only fun if I'm allowed to somehow livestream it or broadcast it.

1759
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:21,000
But I feel like you're never going to be able to do one because when you're in there, they don't let you use your phone at all.

1760
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure they don't like it's it's probably they probably watch you, too, huh?

1761
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, because I actually tonight I called the one here in Elk Grove and I just asked some questions about it, like some escape rooms.

1762
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I guess they have the people like I don't know if you want to call them like monitors or whatever, but the person running the game for you.

1763
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Sometimes they're in the room, which I think is weird and awkward. But like the one I did and apparently this one here, they actually have cameras in there that they watch you from.

1764
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:54,000
We didn't want you to wreck their shit either, you know. So, yeah, but they also can help you out with clues, like if you're stuck, they can see why you're stuck and give you a clue.

1765
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Interesting. Huh. All right. Well, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before I get convinced to go to one of these.

1766
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
And I'm sure you'll call right back to tell everybody what a horrible bitch I was.

1767
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Oh, yeah. I'll be like, we didn't beat it because Rob threw a fit.

1768
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
I just sat in the middle of the floor and refused to keep going.

1769
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Just lock me in here forever, you son of a bitch.

1770
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
No, you'll just pout in the corner because nobody's listening to you.

1771
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Oh, Rob, I don't know. I'd rather do an escape room with like you than some random mofo.

1772
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,000
That's true. Who do you want, me or a random mofo?

1773
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I don't know, because when we had the parents that were older and the girl with the broken leg, which was not helpful when we had to slide down a slide.

1774
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Don't be inconsiderate.

1775
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Well, she was inconsiderate to break her leg.

1776
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Like, they were a hindrance. They were an extra layer of difficulty on top of the difficulty we already had to work with.

1777
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:53,000
So, you'd just be like, you'd up the difficulty by five because you were there.

1778
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Alright, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls. We'll let people know how it goes. Alright, bye.

1779
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Bye.

1780
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, if you want to do it the old fashioned way, or Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1781
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
But our phones are lighting up, so let's get back to it.

1782
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1783
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Hey, this is Stoppy. How are you guys doing?

1784
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Hey, good. Hi, good to hear from you, Stoppy. What's up?

1785
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Hey, not much. I was just going to tell you guys that I went to the Sony Playstation Experience that was in theaters.

1786
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Oh, okay, cool. How was that whole setup?

1787
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:28,000
It was a total circus. Just to get there, there was nothing in my city. There were no theaters in my city that were hosting it.

1788
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:36,000
So, I had to go one that was like over 250 miles away because I'm a total Sony pony, so I went ahead and did that.

1789
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Is that the name? Wait, the Sony Pony? Do you guys call each other Sony Bronies, too?

1790
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:47,000
We should, we should. Just condense it all to one thing, I guess.

1791
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Why not?

1792
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Yeah, so it was a nightmare to get up there, but I actually did like the show, and it was really interesting to see the show with all sorts of fans and people around you.

1793
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Because, you know how it started with that whole melodramatic orchestra and all that kind of shit?

1794
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Yeah.

1795
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Well, at home, I would have expected that people are like, oh wow, this is a really impressive performance.

1796
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:18,000
But in theaters, we were all laughing at that. We could not stop cracking up. We were like, are these guys serious? What the hell?

1797
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:23,000
So, it was kind of like a combination of E3 and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1798
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Exactly, exactly. Yeah, that's a good way of thinking of it. But yeah, it was just absolutely hilarious right there at the beginning.

1799
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:37,000
People were just making fun of it the whole way through. But it was really fun, and there were definitely people who were shocked at certain announcements.

1800
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:44,000
And it was just interesting to see the whole crowd, how they reacted to certain things. I had never seen something like that before.

1801
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Did they give you any freebies or anything to take with you, so you could show the world that you're a Sony Pony?

1802
02:35:51,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Yeah, yeah. They gave us this cup, which I guess you could get a drink for, but since a lot of us are just nerds, we just collected them and didn't even fill it up.

1803
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:09,000
But then also like a poster, a card, which I have no clue what you're supposed to do with it. It's like this collectible card. I don't know, if anybody wants mine, just get in touch with me.

1804
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:13,000
What did the cup say? Microsoft Tears?

1805
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:20,000
It said, no, it was like E3 experience. It just looked like a really cheap cup that you could get anywhere.

1806
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:27,000
And it's not something I would ever want people to see, so they know my shame of being such a fanboy.

1807
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Then they also gave you a digital code, so you could get, I think it was like $10 in Playstation credit, which is pretty cool.

1808
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
And a whole bunch of other stuff, like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, all this other stuff.

1809
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Okay, I like that. It's kind of like you get a little bit of that gas money back you spent.

1810
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Exactly, exactly. I wish.

1811
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:55,000
It was the same problem here. If I wanted to go, I would have had to drive to the Bay Area, which I can't have a 9 to 5 and do that.

1812
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:03,000
It was fine. Shane and I just sat in the living room and watched it. Kind of a lot of the same thing.

1813
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:11,000
We would talk with each other like, oh, is Guillermo del Toro's name going to come up next? How did Norman Reedus' ass go over?

1814
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Oh, I'm glad that you asked that, because someone right next to me was this couple.

1815
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:24,000
And you could tell that it was a guy like me who just dragged his girlfriend over, and she was like, oh my God, when is this fucking thing going to end?

1816
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:32,000
So she was quiet the whole time, and I could kind of tell out of the core of my eye that she was looking at a lot of this like, what the hell am I looking at?

1817
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Why are people going crazy for this bearded guy who's bald and that sort of thing?

1818
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:45,000
But then once you got to Norman Reedus, she instantly sparked to life right away. I was like, what the hell?

1819
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Yeah, he was a big fan amongst many people over there, so yeah.

1820
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:02,000
That's awesome. That sounds like you had a good time. What did you personally enjoy out of Sony's conference? What got you hyped? What got your hype to maximum levels?

1821
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:12,000
I got to say, aside from Kojima's game, maybe the Spider-Man by Insomniac game, because I have been such a fan of just the Spider-Man games, because it's really weird.

1822
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I'm not a fan of the movies or the comics, but I'm more of a fan of him as a video game character, because I love a lot of the video games they used to come out with.

1823
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Some of them are here in this, but this one, it seems like it is going to be a hit. So if they could just recapture what they did with Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox I think it was on,

1824
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:36,000
then it's just going to blow everything away, because that is such a good game, and I trust Insomniac that they could get it right.

1825
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:43,000
No chance to do the VR thing though, right? Even though they didn't have VRs, I guess probably not.

1826
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:50,000
No, I wish, I wish, but no, it was just a wham bam thank you ma'am thing. They just got you in there, got you out, and then that's it.

1827
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I guess I better drive home.

1828
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Exactly.

1829
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:00,000
So how does the Sony Pony feel about what, because now that's going to be your name, Stoppy the Sony Pony.

1830
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:06,000
How does the Sony Pony feel about what Microsoft and Nintendo brought this year?

1831
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:15,000
I thought that Microsoft's conference was pretty competent. I kind of felt that the Xbox One S or whatever it's called,

1832
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I was a little disappointed because it was already revealed beforehand. It was already leaked, so I wasn't really impressed with that.

1833
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:31,000
But as far as some of their other stuff, I thought Sea of Thieves was really interesting, but the people that they got to record with it were by far the most unbearable people on the planet.

1834
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:39,000
But Nintendo, they were okay, but again it was what you expected. It was what, Zelda, then Pokemon, big surprise.

1835
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:55,000
And Zelda's okay, but it just doesn't look like my kind of game. Like I said earlier in the chat, I'm going to need other stuff to get me to get an NX if I get an NX because just having Zelda isn't going to cut it for me. I'd rather just borrow it off a friend if it's just going to be for that alone.

1836
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Alright, some of our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com. YYR is suggesting, I hope his real name is Tony so he can be Sony Pony Tony.

1837
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
No, unfortunately not.

1838
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:16,000
I'm sad to report I can see his name on Skype and it is not Tony. In fact, it doesn't rhyme at all, so sorry about that. But maybe there is a Sony Pony named Tony out there somewhere.

1839
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,000
If so, I'll take that domain.

1840
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Alright.

1841
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Love it.

1842
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Alright, yeah, go ahead.

1843
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:34,000
No, no, one last thing. Also Grow Up, I'm so glad that they, no I'm not telling that to the chat, but no, the game Grow Up, I'm so glad that they announced that because I was a big fan of Grow Home.

1844
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:41,000
And it's like my go-to chill game. It's like my Soma. That's why I just plug in so I can just tune out and enjoy myself for a while.

1845
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:53,000
But I'm so glad they got a sequel because a lot of these indie games, they're so great, but they're just not getting sequels. I don't know if the publishers don't think there's a demand there or if the companies just don't have the money.

1846
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:04,000
But I'm so glad that this one's getting a sequel because I remember finishing that game and I was like, I just wish there was more. It's one of those games where I don't want any improvements, I just want more. And now I'm going to get more. So I'm very happy for that.

1847
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Yeah, thank you for bringing that to attention because there's a lot of other stuff that was announced too that sometimes doesn't get the spotlight. But yeah, that's part of the reason I play games like Diablo and Path of Exile and all that stuff.

1848
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:27,000
For me, those are kind of like my chill games. Click, click, click, get loot, enjoy. It's very zen. Minecraft I think is a very zen game in my opinion. That's how I approach it.

1849
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Alright, well, Tony the Stony Pony. Stony Pony, Stony Pony.

1850
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
You're trying to incriminate me now, okay? I'm going to get raided by now.

1851
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Alright, well I appreciate the call. Thank you very much for calling in and telling us about the Sony experience. I appreciate it.

1852
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
No problem. Catch you later.

1853
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Alright, take care. Bye.

1854
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Bye bye.

1855
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Do you like how I just called him Tony anyway? Like, sorry buddy. Your name is now Tony. I don't care what they call you.

1856
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word. I wanted to check in with Loki real quick and see if there's any last minute stories. Or Dark Soccer if she has any.

1857
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Um, sure. And of course we can mention that the Steam Summer Sale will be starting June 23rd running through July 4th.

1858
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Oh dear God.

1859
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Prepare your wallets.

1860
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Prepare your wallets. You can't handle it.

1861
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Winter is coming.

1862
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Alright.

1863
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Winter is coming.

1864
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,000
That's right. Didn't GOG do something recently too?

1865
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Yeah.

1866
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Oh boy.

1867
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Yeah they did. And then also, um, apparently CG Product Red has a developer kit, um, or at least is familiar with the developer kit for the NX and says it will be fantastic. So.

1868
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Okay.

1869
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
I guess we'll see.

1870
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:42,000
And The Witcher 3 kind of, you know, pushed the limits. But anyway, our phone is ringing off the hook and some people are not going to get through tonight. I'm so sorry but, um, I guess Misty being here finally ups our popularity. I don't know what it is.

1871
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I don't know why. It's only me.

1872
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Nobody would call it in the past couple of weeks. Maybe it's E3. I don't know. But we do have another call on the line. Hi. You are on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

1873
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Well I would call in more. But I've been busy on the weekend so I am sorry, Rama. I am so sorry.

1874
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Rama, all I'm hearing is excuses right now.

1875
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Well I am so sorry.

1876
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I hope you're doing okay though. Better than your cell phone connection is because you're breaking up a little bit but we'll deal. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1877
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Well I have to apologize for that. I think my mixer is going to be retired any week now, so.

1878
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Well take it out behind the barn and shoot it. But you sound alright for the moment. What's on your mind?

1879
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Sweet. Alright, well, first things first. Go to the top of the show, Rob. I want you to know something.

1880
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Yes?

1881
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
You can hold my balls.

1882
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
You have a pinball machine?

1883
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Really? No.

1884
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
I should get one of those.

1885
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What pinball machine has black balls in it? I don't...

1886
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Well, actually, I will tell you this.

1887
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
What?

1888
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Twilight Zone has white ceramic balls for the Powerball.

1889
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Okay.

1890
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Because the ceramic balls are lighter and non-magnetic so they're not affected by the magnets in the system.

1891
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I'm going to speculate Rama does not have white ceramic balls in his pinball machine.

1892
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
So you can get black ceramic balls as well.

1893
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Oh, I see. Well, I'm glad. Bobby Blackwolf in chat. Delete your account.

1894
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Thank you for that. What else did you want to talk to us about, Rama?

1895
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Well, you talked earlier about the whole issue with Twitch. People buying the viewer bots and the fake addings in the comments and all of that.

1896
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Yeah.

1897
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:43,000
They do it to build popularity numbers because I see this on Facebook, on the like pages, cosplayers.

1898
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:50,000
They're buying likes to build their popularity. It's like, well, I'm so and so cosplayer. I have over 10,000 likes.

1899
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I want to be a guest at your convention. And then when you break it down, you notice that they have maybe 2,000 real likes.

1900
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
8,000 likes are coming out in Mexico City.

1901
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:07,000
And this is a big thing on Instagram, too.

1902
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:16,000
So this is not something unique to Twitch streamers. This is cosplayers. This is probably artists.

1903
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:22,000
This is, you know, not to throw everybody under the bus, but my point is it's not unique to any one community, basically.

1904
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Because if you build up your popularity numbers and let's say you're able to, you know, monetize it, make that money.

1905
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I've always said it this way. Yes, you may be very popular on social media, but what am I outside of that?

1906
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Where is your website where I can see like your videos and stuff, you know, or your cosplayers, this or that?

1907
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I'm not going to sit there and like go through your archives to find stuff, you know?

1908
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Yeah.

1909
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'd love to have 2,000 real likes.

1910
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:56,000
You know, if we could just buy 50,000 likes on YouTube, we would never have to worry about would we go to E3 or not.

1911
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:11,000
But we wouldn't do that. I mean, because it would feel much better to have those 50,000 likes organically and know that people give a shit about what you're posting rather than, you know, emptiness.

1912
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Because it is weird when people have all those likes on YouTube, yet their actual videos only get, you know, a dozen views.

1913
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
That's for sure.

1914
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Well, thank you for reminding us that these issues are much more than just one community. How was E3 for you?

1915
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
I didn't go to E3.

1916
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:34,000
I know you didn't, but you're watching it at home like everybody else, I'm sure.

1917
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Yeah, I did. Well, I didn't bother with the Nintendo press because I knew it was on there.

1918
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Between Sony and Microsoft, I thought it was a bit of a tie. I liked what both sides had, basically.

1919
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I know I'm getting the Xbox One S, the two terabyte console. That's a wrap.

1920
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,000
You're not worried about the whole fact that Scorpio is going to be the big thing a year from now?

1921
02:46:53,000 --> 02:47:03,000
The Scorpio is supposed to be for, let's say somebody wants to get into diehard gaming, but they don't have like the 1,500 bucks to put together a powerful desktop.

1922
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:15,000
That's what the Scorpio is supposed to be. And since it's going to be from a manufacturer that can get a good deal, I have a feeling when Scorpio comes out, it's going to be around $600 or $700.

1923
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:30,000
It's going to be pretty much like a high-end gaming console, higher-end graphics card, more RAM, like a higher-tier processor, you know. It's just going to be able to handle everything and then some.

1924
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:36,000
You know, just tin foil hatting, because I love to do that here on OLR. I have no more favorite pastime.

1925
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:49,000
You know, if Sony is going to announce their own thing next year and Microsoft is set to announce the Scorpio thing, I hope Microsoft doesn't put themselves in a position to once again get undercut by Sony on the stage of E3.

1926
02:47:50,000 --> 02:48:01,000
I hope they negotiate to go second after Sony or announce at a different time frame or something, just because, you know, and you all can see these headlines coming a mile away.

1927
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Is that if PlayStation's Neo or whatever the hell they call it ends up being $100 cheaper than Microsoft's Scorpio, when you talk about these prices, I'm like, wow.

1928
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:20,000
That was just the first thought to my head is that you say, oh, well, Microsoft's going to put it out for $700. I'm going, well, shit, what if Sony does theirs for $600? Then it's going to be E3 from a couple years ago all over again.

1929
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
See, but here's the thing.

1930
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Terraplops be damned.

1931
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:37,000
True that. Now, if supposedly the specs for the PS4 Neo has been leaked and I looked at it, truth be told, that thing shouldn't retail no more than $400.

1932
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Now, I can see if the Project Scorpio is higher, if it's like more powerful than what the Neo is.

1933
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:50,000
I understand that price adjustment, but if there's just something slightly more at that cost, then I'm not seeing it.

1934
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Me personally, I'm the casual gamer. I have no problem sitting there playing, getting Xbox One S and just playing with y'all and having a good time.

1935
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I'm not going to sit there and get a Scorpio, get the top of the line headset, top of the line mouse and keyboard and be like, let's kill somebody.

1936
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:12,000
That's not me, no. I like to have fun and play.

1937
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Alright. It's going to be a very interesting E3 next year and in the off cycle.

1938
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:26,000
I'm really curious to see what non-E3 stuff, because for all we know, Sony might pull the curtain on their Neo thing at the PlayStation experience.

1939
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Assuming they do a third one, which I don't see why they wouldn't.

1940
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Probably. A couple more things I'm going to get out of here.

1941
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
You were talking earlier about the Real Escape games.

1942
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:41,000
They had something like that here about a year or so ago for Attack on Titan out in Staten Island, and it was pretty fun.

1943
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:45,000
You could actually go with a team of four or they just put people together.

1944
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:49,000
So like a branded thing. It was like a themed escape room.

1945
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Yeah. The company's called Scrap. They're the ones who originated the Real Escape games out of Japan and here.

1946
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:58,000
But then now there are other companies popping up doing their versions.

1947
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:03,000
And if you just Google Real Escape games, you'll find different ones and so forth.

1948
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
I actually think I remember hearing about that Attack on Titan one.

1949
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Now that you bring it up, I'm like, I feel like we had a story on this when that first happened.

1950
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:12,000
But anyway, interesting to see how that's kind of all the rage now.

1951
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:17,000
If Shane is to be believed about how fun they are, which I don't see why he wouldn't.

1952
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Yeah. Now as for the whole Xbox One, Windows 10 compatibility, it's like this.

1953
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:29,000
If your PC is pretty much the same specs as an Xbox One, you can just get it for PC.

1954
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:32,000
That's where the benchmark is going to be.

1955
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:37,000
As long as your machine has the same specs, pretty much is on par with the console.

1956
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:45,000
And if your machine is not up to par, well then you have Xbox One, well you can go that way.

1957
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Alright, fair enough. We'll see how that strategy works out for Microsoft.

1958
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:56,000
It's going to be very interesting, but as somebody who has a pretty nice PC and Xbox One,

1959
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:00,000
I am excited that I only have to buy the damn things once to play wherever I want.

1960
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
There you go.

1961
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Alright. Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,

1962
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:07,000
but everybody should be listening to Anime Jam Session on Tuesday.

1963
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Yes, because we'll be talking about Anime Next 2016, how fun it was.

1964
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
We were right up the street from the casinos.

1965
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Woohoo! Good times.

1966
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Alright, my friend, take care.

1967
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Alright, you too.

1968
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Alright, bye.

1969
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Alright.

1970
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Those are some good calls tonight.

1971
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Sadly, I am going to close the Skype line and we are still getting calls in.

1972
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I'm so sorry, but this is a good time for you to email us.

1973
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but we are past midnight on the East Coast,

1974
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,000
9 o'clock here on the West Coast.

1975
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:37,000
So, I do want to move on with wrapping up the show and getting on out of here for the night,

1976
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
because some folks have to work tomorrow.

1977
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Misty, thank you so much for being here tonight.

1978
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I know you didn't get to talk an awful, awful lot, but I really hope you had fun.

1979
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
It was great to have you here.

1980
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
It's always fun to see it play out live, huh?

1981
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Indeed.

1982
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Anything that folks listening should know about how live differs from just listening at home?

1983
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Huh?

1984
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:04,000
I'm actually blanking, but it's just cool being here in person.

1985
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Well, it was cool to have you here in person.

1986
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
I really appreciate you being here and have a great rest of your trip.

1987
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Hope you get to play a lot more DDR.

1988
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Alright, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1989
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:17,000
You know shit's going sideways if I sign up for TSA PreCheck.

1990
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:23,000
You, the train and bus and every other thing is signing up for TSA PreCheck.

1991
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Is it that you just don't like flying or you are nervous about it?

1992
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:35,000
For me, it's mostly F-U-T-S-A, aside from being that damn high up in the air.

1993
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:39,000
I think there's a lot of people saying that right now, especially after some of those lines at the airport.

1994
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Good luck with that whole process and have a safe trip home, okay?

1995
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,000
I will.

1996
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Alright.

1997
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Hey, as I always say at the end of every episode, thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1998
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,000
If you like what you heard here at the show, please tell a friend or five about the show,

1999
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:56,000
because we don't buy our likes, we just ask for word of mouth. That's it.

2000
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:03,000
We could have 5,000 likes if our listeners would go tell all of their friends a thousand times,

2001
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
but we really appreciate all the support.

2002
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:11,000
A nice five star review goes a long way on a place like iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show.

2003
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Thank you guys so much for your support. It means everything.

2004
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,000
I forgot to check in if there were any other last minute stories.

2005
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:18,000
No.

2006
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I'm just kind of assuming there wasn't. Yeah, okay, good.

2007
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:23,000
So let's wrap it up. Let's say goodnight for the night.

2008
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2009
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Yes. If you have boys, teach them to ask for consent.

2010
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Drunk is not consent.

2011
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Drugs are not consent.

2012
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Clothes is not consent.

2013
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Ask first.

2014
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Don't teach your boys to be rapists.

2015
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Holy shit, yes.

2016
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:51,000
And when you see a little boy push a little girl in the playground, it's not boys being boys.

2017
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
It's this boy has hurt a girl.

2018
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:56,000
You teach them that's bad.

2019
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
That's a trip to the naughty step.

2020
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
No more of this boys will be boys shit.

2021
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:04,000
That's how you make rapists. Just saying.

2022
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:09,000
My final thought for the night is on a less serious notion.

2023
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:13,000
The popcorn that Misty brought was delicious, and thank you for making me fat.

2024
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,000
I appreciate that.

2025
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
You're welcome.

2026
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2027
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:24,000
My final thought is I got to take time off work tomorrow to fix my stupid refrigerator.

2028
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Don't.

2029
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Which is going to be awkward because I have to call, like my work, you can't really call in like that.

2030
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:36,000
I mean, so I have to call in and use a sick day, I guess, and lie about why I'm not going to be there.

2031
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So tomorrow I could call in and unironically ask you, is your refrigerator running?

2032
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,000
No, it's not. It is running. It's just dripping.

2033
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Well, go catch it.

2034
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:54,000
But at least we found Iron Man behind the refrigerator, so that's good.

2035
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Oh, hooray, hooray.

2036
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Because my son threw him like months ago, and I'm like, I don't know where the hell Lego Iron Man is.

2037
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Oh, there he is.

2038
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Alright, we'll use Iron Man to plug the leak.

2039
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Alright, that's going to do it. Thank you guys again for listening to the show.

2040
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Hope you all had a great E3.

2041
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Hey, guess what? We're going to be back to do it again in seven days.

2042
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:16,000
And if an E3 wrap-up show wasn't fun enough, next week is our fourteenth birthday.

2043
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
What are you going to buy us? Bring your presents next week.

2044
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:21,000
You know what I'm thinking next week? Because it's been too long.

2045
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
You know what I'm thinking next week, you guys?

2046
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
We need to do a game, Nick. We need a list list, a match game.

2047
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
We need something fun next week. What do you guys say?

2048
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
A game next week for our birthday? How about it?

2049
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Alright, we'll see you in seven days. Have a great week and happy gaming, everybody. Bye.

2050
