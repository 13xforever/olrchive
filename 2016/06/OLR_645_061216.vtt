Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, the least surprising intro you hear all year, E3 is here, and by some accounts, it's already begun. One keynote is already complete and there's six more to go. Join us as the news continues to be made even in the middle of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 645 for this June the 12th of 2016.

00:45.000 --> 00:57.000
It is E3 week and we are going to get into things here pretty shortly. Of course, we are the show about all things gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle and all that, live at the Voice Geeks Network, vog and network.com.

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie. Joining me by my side, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hello, hello.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Hi.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And also over there, Techmaster Loki.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Hello.

01:14.000 --> 01:32.000
Alright, we are going to get into E3 here shortly, but I really need to say something here at the top of the show. And it isn't quite gaming related, but I have to acknowledge and just pour my heart out a little bit for the senseless tragedy that happened in Orlando.

01:32.000 --> 01:44.000
And it's just like, I'm at this point where it's like I don't even have like the words for a radio guy to end up speechless is really something, but I mean this really just affects us all.

01:44.000 --> 02:00.000
And not just the fact that like, you know, I'm a gay guy and we sometimes joke in our community that there's this whole like six degrees of separation in our community, so I feel like, you know, what happened in Orlando, yes it's on the other side of the country, but I feel touched by it as well.

02:00.000 --> 02:11.000
And, you know, it's interesting, I got a very sweet message from a listener on Twitter earlier today that's across the pond and was saying that, you know, hey, I know this is really like nowhere near you, but I'm still like thinking of you.

02:11.000 --> 02:25.000
And I replied back, I said, you really never know how these things can affect people because I'll tell you guys, one of our frequent contributors here at VOG Network, Shane from the Ranger Pride cast, is actually in Orlando right now.

02:25.000 --> 02:48.000
Now he's nowhere, he was nowhere near this, thank God. But I, you know, the first thing I thought when I heard this this morning was that, oh my god, I gotta, I gotta text Shane to make sure. I mean, he's not really the type to go out to these clubs and stuff, but I was still concerned so you know and, and just to hear all this tragedy that has happened is just, I, I don't even know what to say anymore.

02:48.000 --> 03:00.000
Like it's just, I feel like every week there's something horrible that we're talking about and the kind of tie this together to why I want to bring this up as we're about to get into one of our biggest shows of the year on E3.

03:00.000 --> 03:10.000
Inevitably somebody's going to want to tie this over to video games and I just, I, it's, I think you guys all know and I know, you know, it's not the video games.

03:10.000 --> 03:29.000
And why do we continue to do a show like this in the face of all this tragedy and what's going on is, is that I can tell you guys being a gay kid growing up and getting picked on and getting taunted verbally by bullies and sometimes physically and all this stuff

03:29.000 --> 03:43.000
and being threatened and all that stuff. Sometimes video games were very much my escape and my place to go to kind of, I don't want to necessarily say shut out the real world but to kind of like turn away from all that reality.

03:43.000 --> 03:56.000
So I in some ways today when I heard about what was going on in Orlando, I acknowledged it, I got very angry about it but then I had to do something to take my mind off it and that was to go play a video game.

03:56.000 --> 04:12.000
So anyway, I know that was a lot of verbal blah blah blah but I just I really want to get that off my chest that I'm just, I'm so angry and just upset and my heart goes out to all of those affected because like I mentioned before, you know,

04:12.000 --> 04:26.000
and we joke about it in gay culture but it's a part of human culture. We're six degrees separated from these people one way or another. Those were people's children, those were people's uncles, brothers, sisters, and so on.

04:26.000 --> 04:43.000
You know that we're affected by this and I just hope to hell. This country finally, I'm not going to get too political I promise but this country finally does something, something, anything to turn this around and stop this from happening.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Alright, anything you want to add real quick before I shift gears?

04:48.000 --> 05:08.000
Just a fun tweet that I read to you earlier that Canada has had eight mass shootings ever. We've had seven since Monday. We keep having the discussion go around the rhetoric keeps circulating, but no one does anything.

05:08.000 --> 05:19.000
Number one, vote people in who will do something. And number two, don't vote for people who pat themselves on the back congratulatory after 50 people are dead. Just saying.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
And Americans, vote. Just vote. Like, I, it's such a huge party.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
No one in this country has an excuse not to vote.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
For real, because there's other countries.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
You can vote from home. It should be mandatory.

05:35.000 --> 05:54.000
There's other people listening in other countries that are probably like, man, I wish I could vote in my country. So anyway, again, I don't want to get too political I do want to say the chat room hello hi live.vognetwork.com and break man in our chat says, every one of us should be angry, gay, straight, bi, pan, everyone should be angry at this.

05:54.000 --> 06:13.000
And I agree. Anyway, like I said, video games, that's how sometimes we escape the fuckery of the real world and so forth. So here we are. Biggest week of the year as far as video games go and a lot to take your mind off today of what's going on, EA starting things off with their press conference, our show going to be

06:13.000 --> 06:42.000
even like earlier this week, it's just been like, well, but there's been announcements. So it's not necessarily league. That's true. It's kind of the I don't want to say the B roll stuff because some of this stuff feels very like I'm very B rolls is kind of like, hey, we've want to have something out before everybody went in to jump the gun a little bit. I think like we got to get the press now before we get drowned in all this other press and so forth. So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. Again, I mentioned this for a few weeks now, but we are going to be cut short tonight, the Bethesda press conference.

06:42.000 --> 07:11.000
starts at seven o'clock Pacific. It's about 618 Pacific right now. We will be stopping the show right at seven taking an extended break tonight because I just I know we're not gonna be able to compete with that. But you can participate if you do want to get some feedback and chat with other folks live.vog network.com. I promise you it will be more exciting than the twitch chat that Bethesda will have. And much more filtered and so on. So you can check that out. We will be watching that live as well. And then we'll come back and we'll all kind of talk about it.

07:12.000 --> 07:22.000
But for you, podcast folks, when you're used to hearing a three hour show, you're probably gonna get one tonight. That's only like an hour and a half or two hours just because I don't I don't know how long but that do we know if it has to 60 or 90 minutes?

07:22.000 --> 07:41.000
Don't know, we don't know. So we're having to play tonight show a little bit by ear. For that reason, certain segments and things you're used to hearing on the show are not going to be here tonight. Fugal question of the week, rapid fire news, we're going to roll that over to next week. But for now, let's talk about EA's press conference because EA was the first to go today. This is the earliest I think I've ever seen a press conference.

07:41.000 --> 08:00.000
Go during E3 week is that we had a press conference at 1pm today. Pacific time and that was EA talking about what they showed Dark Sakura. I'm gonna go a little out of order here just because I know people want to know Dark Sakura. What'd you think of Mass Effect Andromeda?

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
Pretty. And there's a lady. So happy.

08:07.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, I mean, I have to admit I was a little bit frustrated when they said we're going to tell you more this fall. But here's a behind the scenes look and I already just kind of knew like get set the bar low. I honestly thought they were going to have the game at their EA play event.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
Now the question is, do you really think it's coming out in spring of 2017? I don't think it's coming out in spring 2017.

08:29.000 --> 08:44.000
If they're not showing it now, then I have concerns. Now, could EA be withholding for a Microsoft or Sony press conference? I don't think they would have said this fall if that was the case. I think they would have said soon or later.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
What exactly is this fall that they would be showing them? And that's my curiosity is that you've also got this big white elephant in the room about the Nintendo NX. So when are they going to show the Nintendo NX?

08:53.000 --> 09:03.000
White elephant is a type of gift exchange. Oh, sorry, pink elephant. Pink elephant is when you're drunk. It's just an elephant. It is a smelly elephant. You are mixing your metaphors.

09:03.000 --> 09:13.000
It is a smelly elephant that won't stop pooping. It is a brown elephant that will not stop leaving gifts behind. I like the brown elephant.

09:13.000 --> 09:28.000
The big brown elephant in the room is, what is happening in the fall? I mean, because we got the Nintendo NX thing too, right? So, and we don't know. I mean, the assumption is they're going to do it with Tokyo Game Show, though Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, so they'll bring back their thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:42.000
It could be just, there's a lot of stuff like they're focusing on fourth quarter right now, and maybe that's why they're not really trying to hype up Mass Effect at this time. Because I mean, they've got like a lot of big properties that they're trying to get everybody incentivized to purchase right now.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
And Mass Effect is probably just later. It's outside of the window that like the other titles that they were showing off were this year.

09:50.000 --> 10:04.000
I am actually also surprised they didn't show Mirror's Edge. I realize the game just came out, but you've got like, what, a quarter million gamers watching a feed right now. Show us the deals. Remind us that it's in store. I was really surprised they didn't take that opportunity.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, I don't think they need to do that. Although, if they would have cut out half the banter that they had, they could have had time for another trailer.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
Let's run down the list here of what they announced. Titanfall 2, and the big deal there, it's a single player mode.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, it's got single player as well.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh yeah, it has one.

10:21.000 --> 10:30.000
Last time it was just like, well, it's a multiplayer game. It's a multiplayer only game, and then you can play it solo, and that's your single player campaign.

10:30.000 --> 10:41.000
But this actually has a single player campaign. The new thing is they've got this grappling hook thing that's going to be pretty cool, so you can use the grappling hook to kind of tether yourself to a Titan.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And really, any game that adds a grappling hook is usually better, so that's always a good sign.

10:45.000 --> 10:55.000
And then of course, the multiplayer looks pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean, overall, I am not sure how excited I am about the single player campaign, but it looks nice.

10:55.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah, it looked gorgeous, and I also caught that grappling hook thing. And you know, I'm not huge on shooters, but with as much as I'm now playing Overwatch, I'm kind of going like, oh, maybe I should try to do some more shooting.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
It was fun, and in the last game, they had classes that were kind of catered more towards people that aren't necessarily into shooters.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Like, they had a gun that would auto-target type things, so it was, you know.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
That's true. I remember that.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
A little bit more, you can kind of play it however you want, and I mean, I don't know. It was alright.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Plus, you can rack up kills on the AI characters that are there, so that kind of helps out as well.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Right. Next up, they showed Madden 17, which, you know, here's the thing, guys.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
I know a lot of us are, like, rolling our eyes at, like, the sports thing, but you've got to realize these games are, it may not be the crowd that was listening to this show.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Madden's going to be dead, and they'll still be Madden games.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
These games, don't say that. This has been a very cruel year of dark soccer.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Okay, I don't...

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
But no, I know what you mean. I know what you mean. They will, those games will sell until the end of time.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
But that's the point, is that, you know, as much as we all kind of, like, roll our eyes at, oh, here's the Madden game.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's like, okay, you can't deny these games fucking sell.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, they're good, but, Mike, I didn't understand what they were trying to push with this.

12:07.000 --> 12:18.000
Like, the whole thing was, we're doing more organized events with Madden 17, and I just was kind of rolling my eyes and scratching my head, like, how's this going to incentivize someone to purchase the game?

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
I understand, yeah, it's competitive, and that you're doing all these events, and that there's this prize pool, but who cares?

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
Is it the whole, if you can spend $60 on our game and then get good like these guys we're going to show a little spotlight of, then you too can win a million dollars.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
No, you're not.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I kind of got that. I'm like, no, you're not.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
No, you're not. These people...

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I got that vibe, like, that's the reason why they might show it.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
People think it's kind of weird that I sit at home and play Madden all the time to get really good at this, and yeah, I don't know.

12:45.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, people think that about a lot of people that sit at home, do something for a long period of time as well, but that's the thing, is these people have that much more time ahead of you on this.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
You're not going to all of a sudden catch up to them.

12:57.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah. I mean, the game looked gorgeous, but I, you know, and I can recognize, like, wow, that's a pretty game, and if I was into football, I'd be really into this.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
But, you know, I'm just...

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It is what it is.

13:09.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't really know, I mean, because we're going to get into it in just a second here, but I don't really know what they would need to do to a sports game to make me interested in it, because adding more, you know, curated events, that's not doing it for me.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Adding a story mode, that's not doing it for me either.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
All right, well, let's get to that.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
So, we already talked a little bit about Mass Effect Andromeda.

13:27.000 --> 13:43.000
I just wanted to say, I did think it was gorgeous, and, you know, interesting little glimpses of some characters, but I think there's a lot of assumption that that last female character that does the narration at the end is the quote-unquote new femshep, but hold on.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I mean, it could be, but not necessarily.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
It could be a character akin to a Caden and Ashley type of support character.

13:51.000 --> 14:01.000
So, we don't know, but it was nice to at least see even five frames of some new aliens and kind of get a sense of, you know, okay, this is going to be...

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
This is definitely a series that's going to try to differentiate itself from the main trilogy.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
So, I look forward to whenever they're going to finally share more about it, because I just wanted to know, like, is there going to be the multiplayer again?

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Are they going to squeeze that in there? Is it going to be as fun as it was in Mass Effect 3?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Yes, they will, because they can add microtransactions.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I guess that's true.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
All right, then they talked a little bit about the EA Play charity.

14:23.000 --> 14:32.000
I don't know how much that discussion you caught, but they kind of talked about that there was, like, meta-achievements in the games, and they were going to donate money based on the achievements that people were getting in the games.

14:32.000 --> 14:42.000
And I thought it was a nice gesture. I thought it was cool. And I think this is something that a lot of people have been calling on is just, you know, throw diversity a frickin' bone.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
And so, I kind of think EA stepped up to the plate with that.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
And they were very supportive of these charities that support getting more women into the industry, getting more diverse voices, you know.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
And I think some of those coding charities are also about, like, I think...

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Sorry, I don't have all my charities memorized, but I think some of them are about getting, like, kids involved in instruction in school, too.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
So that's cool. I mean, I can't sit here and go, you know,

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh, God, EA, what a bore. I can't be cynical about that. Like, that's cool that they're, you know, gonna...

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Gaming for good is always exciting.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Okay, and then I think the game you were referencing a minute ago, Loki, FIFA 17, right?

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah, FIFA 17. And they had, like, a bunch of new modes in there and enhancements and stuff.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
But the big thing they were showing was, like, the story mode, which the other games have done that before.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Like, the NBA 2K series sort of does that, but it's not all dramatic like that.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
The problem that bothered me about it is they drag it out so long during the conference.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Like, this dude comes out and he's like,

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
You don't know who I am, but I'm, you know, I'm this person and you're gonna know my name.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm like, I don't fucking care who the hell you are.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It was a little melodramatic. I was like,

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
Well, here's the thing. Okay, all that being said, though, I have to admit, I'm not super into sports games.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm not super into FIFA. But when they were showing that trailer, I was like,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
This is kind of, like, I'm kind of living for this. Like, this is some, like,

16:05.000 --> 16:14.000
Empire level of Dallas of the, what do you call that? The real, like, melodrama type of stuff.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
You know what I mean? The melodramatic type of, like, over the top drama.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
That's, like, in those shows. I was kind of, like, seeing a little bit in that trailer and I was like,

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
I can kind of go for this. I'm digging this. So, yeah, I was-

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
I just didn't get it. You know, being a person that I'm not, like, into sports games,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
it's not getting me into sports games. And that's the thing. It's like, I don't know,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
like, these games that are coming out now, like, the Madden with the, you know,

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
the additional competitions and stuff that are gonna be curated by EA and stuff.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
And then this FIFA with the story mode and stuff. How is that generating more of an audience for your game?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Because, like, the people that are fans of the game are gonna be buying the game anyways.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
I just don't think this is gonna be like, Oh, you know what? I wanted a story mode.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
That was the last thing I was waiting for. You know, like, hey, I really wish there was more Madden competitions

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
because that was really the only thing, you know, my barrier of entry to that series.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
To be honest, though, I did go from, and no one curr, to, well, maybe I'd red box it.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Which is a step up. I gotta admit. But, you know, you have a lot of chatters saying right now, you know,

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
obviously FIFA is their biggest game. There's a very intentional reason why they did that from Europe.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Which also, I think, explains- because, you know, when they said the press conference was gonna be at 1 o'clock,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
I think a lot of us were like, that seems really early. Well, they timed that so that it would be 9 o'clock in the UK.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
So they- there was some intent there that they definitely were doing a press conference that overseas could see as well,

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
which is way more into soccer. But yeah, when they started bringing out the, um, the co- I think-

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't even know who they are. Sorry, the coach? Coaches? Managers? Managers, yeah. The teams?

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
I, you know, I have to admit, I kind of glazed over, like, I literally have no idea who these people are.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
But I guess people are gonna be really excited to see them in the game if you're into soccer.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
So, but I have friends here who are, like, that go to the SAC Republic FC stuff all the time.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
So, eh, they might be into this. But, you know, again, it's gonna sell like crazy no matter what.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
Um, okay, so, so none of that stuff that I- well, the EA play was a pleasant surprise, but otherwise,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
nothing I've mentioned was a surprise. All that stuff we expected.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
Uh, so the first thing that really caught our eye as something new is when they came out and talked about EA Originals,

18:26.000 --> 18:35.000
and they kind of showcased a game called Fee, which, um, looked a little to me like Journey meets Ori and the Blind Forest type of thing.

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
Like, there was- there was the art- the art going into it. Um, I mean, but we didn't really get to see a whole lot of what the raw gameplay looks like.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
I mean, we just kind of got some bits and pieces, but it definitely looks like EA wants to push, like,

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
we're not just these big sports- you know, EA- EA's gotten a bad rap in the past, and so I kind of feel like,

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
okay, they are trying to listen to this a little bit, they're trying to help with the diversity initiative and all this stuff,

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
and they've always been very supportive of GLBT and all this stuff, you know, they're right there marching the pride parade and all that.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Um, and now they're kind of talking about we want to support these, we're not some big evil studio,

19:14.000 --> 19:22.000
we want to support these low growing things and nurture them, uh, on their first game to success.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
I did like that they said, basically, that they're not taking any sort of the pro- like, there's no profit sharing with it,

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
so any of the games that they do choose for that, it's basically, they're just giving them some money to get, you know, elevated,

19:33.000 --> 19:42.000
and then that's it, it's EA, you know, and they're gonna publish it, but nothing's gonna be taken from the publisher- or the, uh, developer, which is kind of nice.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
So that's kind of neat, so, um, I- that was the first part, I was like, okay, this is cool, like, this is something new, I'm into this,

19:48.000 --> 19:55.000
I was surprised they only showed one, because I kind of thought this EA Originals was gonna be a multitude of games,

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
but they only showed this one for whatever reason, maybe this is the only one that's ready to go, I'm not sure.

20:00.000 --> 20:08.000
Um, okay, so after the EA Originals was the Star Wars stuff, which, it was cool to see Sacramento, did you see that?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, I saw Sacramento.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Capital Games, shout out.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I saw that, I was like, woo, Capital Games!

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
I knew they did mobile stuff down there, I did not realize it was Star Wars they were working on.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah, they're, they're, um...

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
I, I honestly thought they did the Dragon Age game that Jamie always talks about, I thought that was them.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
They may have, I don't remember, but, yeah, they're, um, BioWare Mobile?

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, yeah, at one point they were a BioWare, they were BioWare Sacramento, and then they changed to Capital Games, or just EA,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
and so they're doing Star Wars, but anyway, I mean...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
That's still huge, I mean, yeah.

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
Oh yeah, for sure, but to be fair, in that whole clip, I'mma be real, the, the greater clip that showed everything, besides the hometown shoutout,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I was kinda like, this is a whole lot of nothing.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
The Visceral Games one looks pretty awesome, like what they, the very, like, two seconds that they showed of it looks pretty sweet.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
And that was, that was, uh, Lando we saw in Battlefront, right?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
That was Battlefront, yeah.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
That's like the one thing I was like, oh cool, and then...

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
But no, the Visceral one looks pretty awesome, that's gonna be that third person action game stuff, but...

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
Did it, was it me, or did, like, Jade seem very, like, fake, excited about it?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
It's just like, it's just like, off, somehow.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
It's, it's nerves, because the guy that was demonstrating F.E.A. was also very, very, very nervous, I'm sure.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Well, that guy could understand, because you're like an indie developer, almost, and you're like in a press conference for EA, he's like, uhhh...

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
You know what, not everybody, just because you're good at managing games doesn't mean you're necessarily good at speaking in front of a crowd.

21:28.000 --> 21:38.000
So, and, um, I think with good reason, there's a lot of pressure to make sure we have women on the stage and diversity on the stage.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
So I think whether she really wanted to be up there or not, she probably needed to be.

21:42.000 --> 21:53.000
So, um, maybe it was nerves. I didn't, I didn't get that same, I mean, I kind of just, the only problem I had with it is that it was a whole lot of nothing.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
I kind of more got the impression she was just selling a whole lot of, stay tight, like, that's all I really got from her.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
And the package in general, so.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
And I think it's still stupid that they're making another Battlefront game after this last one came out and had, like, hardly any content.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
And they're like, eh, it's gonna have the content from the new movie. It's like, yeah, that's awesome.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
I think the people that bought the original Battlefront would probably like that content as well.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I think, oh no, fuck them. They're gonna have to buy a new game.

22:24.000 --> 22:34.000
And then lastly, Battlefield 1, which looked really pretty, but again, a lot of, not my kind of thing, but Loki, this is your kind of thing. What did you think?

22:34.000 --> 22:44.000
I thought it looks really cool. And I actually watched after the thing was over, they had, like, a live stream of their, the first multiplayer gameplay from it.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
So they had a bunch of celebrities and, like, other, you know, players playing. It was 32 on 32.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, okay. That's cool.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
So they had this, they were filling it in. It wasn't just all celebrities. It was, like, half of, like, esports guys and YouTubers.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
And they were half, you know, Twitch streamers and the other half was, like, celebrities.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
When they showed Zac Efron, did he not want to be there?

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
Oh, God. He was, like, not excited at all. And then, like, same.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
But I heard some people that were watching the feeds saw Snoop Dogg and he looked really into it.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah, he's, like, totally into it.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Snoop Dogg's a hella gamer, though. He's talked about it.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
And Terry Crews is awesome. I mean, Terry Crews is just, he's just a hilarious guy.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
But, like, he was just, like, getting all into it and shit. And so, it looked awesome.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
And, like, everything that they were talking about, like, the destruction and everything being very dynamic was in there.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
And they kind of showed off, you know, one of the blimps coming down and everything.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
It looks awesome. It looks pretty cool. I definitely want to check it out when it comes out.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
I'm not really into the modern Battlefield games too much.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
But I'm willing to check this out because it looks pretty, it looks nice.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
It looks different and it'd be kind of fun to try it out.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
So, last overall thoughts of EA's press conference.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Dark Soccer, I don't think, you only really saw the part you wanted to see.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
But do you have any, you've listened to us kind of banter a little bit. Anything?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I've been getting my hair done.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Priorities.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Well, I already had this scheduled.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Her hair looks gorgeous, by the way.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah, because Monet rocks.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
But based on what we heard and any thoughts on the thing as a whole?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Mass Effect.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Loki?

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
Honestly, as I was agreeing with somebody on Twitter, I can't remember who said it.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
They gave the conference a D+.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
I think that's kind of where I'm at with it. It was very average and ho-hum.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
There was nothing really, the gameplay for Battlefield was kind of nice.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
But it was, we already kind of had a trailer of that.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
It was just kind of nice to see it actually confirm that, yeah, it does sort of look like that.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
But overall, there was nothing really surprising.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
There wasn't anything like, ooh, any real big exciting announcements.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
It was just kind of, eh.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at, is that it was very, very par for me.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
And maybe because they're out the gate first, maybe there's something they have to kind of keep under wraps for the Sony or Microsoft.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
That is true. There could be something.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And usually they go after, so there could be something going on there.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
We won't know until after Monday.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
But I would say it's almost below par for me.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
I would say a more like C- for me, which isn't really far off from what you gave it.

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
Because just the fact that, you know, they were out there talking Star Wars, but didn't really give us a lot.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
They were out there talking Mass Effect, but really didn't give us a lot.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I'm surprised they didn't mention anything Maxis.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I mean, I granted, or even PopCap.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
PopCap was completely missing too.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Yeah, no PopCap, no Maxis.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Well, didn't they close Maxis?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Yeah, okay. But I mean, there's somebody making Sims games, I would assume.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
True.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
They're still going to carry on the franchise, and there's nothing PopCap related at all.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
That's true. The Sims was completely missing.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Which is a bit of a, you know, I don't know if we're right around the corner from The Sims 5.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
But I am kind of surprised there's kind of nothing in that franchise, you're right.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
So, okay. Well, that is our thoughts on EA.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Lots of different comments in chat.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Let's see, talking about Snoop Dogg being into video games.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Act F says Snoop Dogg is fo-shizzle into video games.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
I think that they were showing, and someone had mentioned this.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't know, I'm not one to identify drugs, but I think that they said that he was smoking a blunt while playing the game.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Cut!

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
They actually had video of that happening, too.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
He is smoking something, let's put it that way.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
He's got a card, you know he has a card, Wink.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
He does, but it's awesome.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
He's got stress or, you know, back pain or something.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I'm not into multiplayer, this is about Battlefield, but it was pretty damn cool.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
A lot of shit going on at once.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
That's the thing, even though I'm not into multiplayer because I know they get my ass handed to me pretty quickly,

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
but the single player campaign looks pretty awesome, too, from the cinematics and stuff that they're showing.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
VidPower talking about Jade Raymond saying,

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Haven't seen Jade Raymond in the spotlight for five years, good for her.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
That's a good point, is that she hasn't done this in a while, so maybe that's why, you know.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I cut the executives a little slack.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Not everybody is born to get up in front of all the people.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
That's why Reggie Fils-Aime is a great face for Nintendo.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
And no, I'm not afraid of multiplayer, I just know my level of gameplay in multiplayer.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
One more comment here, then we'll move on.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Kaijuto says, The reason why so many Star Wars games suck is because the devs try to be storytellers,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and they forget about making a fun game.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Leave the story to the movies.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks quickly.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
We're going to run through this quickly. How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I played World of Warcraft.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
How's that been going?

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
It's been really fun. I think the thing that I like the best about doing my quests there,

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
is that I don't have to freaking go all over the world to do the quests I'm doing.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
I can stay in a particular area and get them done.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
And so it's felt a lot more streamlined and less disjointed,

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
and there hasn't been that particular level gap between being able to do things,

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
where I'd just have to grind until I was at a level that I could do the next level,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
and not have to be locked for it.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
So it's been pretty awesome that way.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And I'm having a good time. I'm having a really good time.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I just miss everybody who used to play.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
You're playing with the Game Boy guys though, right?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
The Game Boy.org guys?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
I sometimes see Jon sometimes.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Okay, when they're on. Fair enough.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, I just wish everybody was back, then it would be more fun like it used to be.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Just the other usuals.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Loki.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I really didn't play that much this week,

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
because I've been still very exhausted after work and kids and all that.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
So really the only thing I've been playing is just mobile games, which is weird.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
Still playing Ingress just the minimal amount so that I can keep my Sojourner thing going,

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
until it finally platinums out or whatever, and then I don't have to play it anymore.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
And then I've been playing Pokemon GO quite a bit.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I'm up to about two-thirds of the way to level seven.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
So I've been playing that.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
And that's just mainly because I've had to go to a lot of parks and stuff with kids,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
and it's a good way to kill time.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Plus at home you can still play it at home,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
because you can put the incense thing on you,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
the track the Pokemon to you and double the XP with the Lucky Egg.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
And then that way you can just sit on the couch and play it occasionally when they come up to you and stuff.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
So it's just a good time waster, I guess.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
It's all right.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
It's still very buggy, though.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
I complain about it all the time with people.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah, I wish I'd played something more significant, but I've just been so damn tired.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
And then in the time that I have been awake, I've been trying to work on my game,

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
which I'm not getting very much progress there because I do end up falling asleep while I'm working on it.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
My Gaming Week.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV, which got a patch this week, the 3-3 patch,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
so an expansion on the story.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I'll keep it spoiler-free, but very, very epic.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Although the content this time is pretty unforgiving.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We tried to do the new trial.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
There's a brand new eight-person fight in it, and it's hard.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
We tried to do it, like five of us and a few pickup people, and we couldn't beat it.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
We got it down to 2%, still couldn't beat it.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Which I don't think all the content needs to be gimme.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I think you do have to bang your head on the wall a little bit,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
but I was a little surprised because that's a big step up in difficulty for Final Fantasy.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
But we'll get there, I know it, and it'll feel real good when we do beat it, finally.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
But seriously, the story, phenomenal.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
One of the better Final Fantasy games in the series, it really is.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
And also been playing Overwatch.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Still been kind of going with that.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And Alan's been super getting into Overwatch now, too.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
In fact, he is double my level and then some.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
So we play once in a while.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Sometimes he plays a lot right before I go to bed,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and I don't always want to binge game right before bed,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
but we've been able to pop on, and there'll be some people that'll be on,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and we'll kind of do some matches here and there.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
But I am enjoying Overwatch still.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Just a lot of fun, and there's still some characters I want to play.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
And I got myself, or I should say Alan bought me,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
because he was buying another pop figure,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
but he got me the Winston doll, the pop figure doll.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
It's big, because it's Winston. I like it, it's cute.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
That was pretty much it for my Gimme Week, though.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So just some quick housekeeping.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
We will be back with a full show next week to wrap up E3.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
I do believe a longtime OLR listener and fan,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Misty, is going to be here in the studio to help us recap E3

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
and run down all that.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
And then in two weeks, our 14th birthday here at Orange Lounge Radio.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
The 14th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
will be the same day as my actual birthday, June the 26th.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
How about that?

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
All right, so let's try to do some news here.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
We're going to do just one or two, maybe three stories,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
and then we're going to get to the Classic Game of the Week

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
and make our way to the next press conference.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Loki, start us off tonight.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
So, you know, as each year,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
a lot of announcements get leaked ahead of time,

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
and it's usually the fault of the company

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
that's actually going to be doing the announcement.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
And in this case, Microsoft, being Microsoft, decided that,

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
hey, let's go ahead and put that pre-order page up for the new Xbox Slim.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Whoops, that's not supposed to go up yet.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
So, yes, we got to...

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
They did this last year, by the way.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I don't know if you remember, but they totally ruined last year.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
So, I don't know if it's on purpose,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
if it's just like a leak, quote, unquote.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
But basically, it's an Xbox.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
They call it the Xbox One S.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It is 40% smaller.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It has a two terabyte hard drive.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It supports 4K Ultra HD video,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
a high dynamic range,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and a streamlined controller,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
and also has a vertical stand.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
And the game system itself looks pretty similar to it was before,

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
although the mesh on the bottom looks a little bit different,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and it's not so VCR-looking this time.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
So, it is definitely slimmer-looking,

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
and apparently also maybe looks like a USB port

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
and an infrared sensor on the front.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So, that's all we know about it so far.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
No word on what the cost is going to be or anything,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
but we will find out tomorrow for that, I'm assuming,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
since I'm assuming this is right around the corner

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
since they're taking pre-orders for it.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
And, yeah, so is this the same as the souped-up system?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
No.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Because it has the 4K video.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
The rumor was originally that they're going to be redesigning the original system,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
so they're going to be shrinking it down, which is this,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
and then the new system would be something different.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
It'd be separate skew altogether.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
Okay, so the 4K video kind of ended up being a surprise bonus then in this.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
I guess, yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I don't think this is the souped-up system.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
That wouldn't make...

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I don't think that's the same thing.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
No, yeah, because the souped-up system was talking about new chips and stuff,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
and that's not what we're seeing.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah, I don't think that's this,

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
although I am kind of curious to see what the difference would be

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
if how one would support and the other one wouldn't,

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
unless that's just going to be something that they patch in for all the systems.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Good thought.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Which could be.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I mean, I would imagine spec-wise it's probably the same.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Is 4K? I don't have a 4K TV.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Is it still just an HDMI cable?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
It's still HDMI, but I think it may...

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
I don't really know.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Because I was thinking maybe there's a physical port on the back that's different.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
I don't know.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
To be honest, I don't know.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I don't have a 4K TV, nor am I not.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Anyone in chat know?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm not too interested in getting one just yet.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
I think it's way too early.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I don't know how much 4K content is out there.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And to be honest, the 1080 stuff that comes over,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
you know, with Netflix and everything,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
it's not always that great-looking anyways,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
so I don't really think I need that just yet.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Besides the file size and everything and bandwidth, no thanks.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Yes, this new Xbox One sounds great if you waited.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
But for me, it's kind of a...

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Well, here's the thing too, though.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I did wait.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I haven't purchased an Xbox One yet.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
I'm still hoping we hear something about Crackdown this year.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
My thing is, though, is...

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
And this is also the same...

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
It's got me on the fence too about PlayStation VR.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
It's like, what's it going to mean with these new systems

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
that are going to be coming out?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
In fact, I wanted to see something real quick here.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I don't remember if it's part of the show.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
It is not part of the show.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh, maybe it is.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Okay, so yeah, I don't know what exactly it means, though,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
with these new systems coming out.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Is it just going to be an upgrade that they do every now and then?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I know that they're saying that these older systems

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
are going to still be able to support the same content,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
but is it going to be supporting it

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
just like the 3DS did with Hyrule Warriors,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
where it plays good on one

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
and doesn't play that great on the other?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I kind of want more information about that

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
before I jump into that stuff.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
All right, well, another big thing

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
that was announced ahead of E3,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
not leaked, but announcement,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
y'all, I was happy about this.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Final Fantasy XII Remaster.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
It's happening. It's true.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I'm so excited about this.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
will be coming out on the PlayStation 4.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
This is going to be a remaster

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
based on the International Zodiac Job System,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
so similar to what we got with the Final Fantasy X Remaster,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and it looks gorgeous,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
and I'm so, so happy this game is getting a second chance.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
I never played XII, really.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I'm so happy this game is getting a second chance

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
because Final Fantasy XII on PlayStation 2

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
came out right when the Xbox 360 did,

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
so I think a lot of it got lost in that whole shuffle,

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
so I'm really happy this game is getting a second chance.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The battle system is really, really fun.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
It's different.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
It's not what you're used to in the old-school games,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
but I love it.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Although, with XV coming around,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
it seems kind of similar to XV almost.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah, I guess, but...

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Or is it more Kingdom Hearts?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Honestly, not to get you too excited,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
it felt more like XI's battle system

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
than anything else. It really did.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Yeah, I know you've mentioned that before.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I know that sounds weird, but it really feels like XI's,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
and I loved programming the gambits for your supports

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
because you can tell them, like,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
oh, at 20% health, start healing,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
otherwise attack, use fire if the mob is weak.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
You can set all this crazy stuff.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
It's really cool.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
They're talking high-resolution upgrades

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
for movie scenes, fonts, 7.1 channels surround support.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Why don't they have that in the MMO?

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
You should be able to hire support characters or something

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
and then be able to program them like that.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
That would be pretty awesome.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
English and Japanese voices,

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
you'll be able to switch between them.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Original and newly re-recorded backgrounds,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
you'll be able to switch between them.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Shorter load times, autosave, and speed mode,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and speed mode operability.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
So I'm really hyped for this.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm really, really, really excited about this.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
So, yay.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
Looking at the chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
DarkTetsuya says,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
This reminded me of a conversation I had with someone

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
about the possibility of a 12 remaster.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
I tried to finish 12,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
but even after using a GameShark to get myself unstuck,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I still couldn't finish the game,

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
so I hope the HD version fixes some of the problems I had.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And BobbyBlackWolf saying Final Fantasy 12

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
was my favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
It was really, really good.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm curious on 11 Mobile now,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
which, whenever that information's supposed to come out,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
because I know they're supposed to be doing something with that.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Dark Soccer, you want to quickly tell us about what you had.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Huh?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Your story up next.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
That's okay.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
I have to say that I've still been reading up about what's gone on.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I understand.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
There's definitely a lot weighing on our minds today.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
So sorry about that.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
So, I've actually known people who were affected by this

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
that Fallout 4, for some reason, showed up free.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Who knows?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It was apparently just a pricing error.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I know someone who is affected by this too.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Okay.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
They might be sitting across from you.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Really?

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
So, Microsoft said that for those who downloaded Fallout 4 for free,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
the licenses are revoked.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Too bad.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
But they are going to give everyone $10 in their Microsoft account

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
as an inconvenience payment.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Why not just own it and let them keep Fallout?

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Because they can do that.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
They have the ability to do that.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
And people knew that it wasn't like,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
oh, I thought it was free.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
It was more like, hey, it's free now.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Go download it before they catch it.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
I mean, the Digital Deluxe version was free too, which is like $100.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
And at some point, Bethesda is hemorrhaging a lot of money.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It was the same thing with, what was it?

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
It was with, what's that, Harmonics game?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Amplitude.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
They did it with Amplitude.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
And I didn't gain fucking $10 from Sony.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
All right.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Well, look, and before I get nasty emails,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
we already bought Fallout 4.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
We just had it on PC.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Alan has it on PC.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
It was kind of one of those things where I was like,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
well, I'm curious, but no big loss.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
If I want to borrow it now in Steam library, I can.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I've got the console version.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
No.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
All right.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Back before there was digital storefronts.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Or maybe, actually, maybe not this week.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Maybe when there was digital storefronts.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
I forgot.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
It's only got to be 10 years old.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We're going to take a trip back in time,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
and Dark Soccer's going to find a game that she thinks, hey,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
you guys should be playing this game this week.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
So Dark Soccer, in the spirit of E3.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Yes, in the spirit of E3.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
What is this week's classic game of the week?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Half-Life 2, Episode 1.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Which, yes, I've done Half-Life, and I've done Half-Life 2.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
But I'm doing Half-Life 2, Episode 1.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Is there a certain reason you have Half-Life on the brain

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
right now?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Is there a particular reason?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Well, you know, we always speculate,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
because there's a 3 in E3.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
So I'm just saying.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
So maybe this isn't the first time you'll hear about Half-Life.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Half-Life 3 confirmed.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Oh, my God.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Oh, my God.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Half-Life 3 confirmed.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Exactly.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
So we all know what Half-Life is.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It's a first-person shooter.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
This starts exactly from where Half-Life 2 ended.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
And it continues the game of Gordon and Alex and Dog

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
going through their adventures and a cliffhanger ending.

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
And I just picked it, because it came out June 1 in 2006.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
That's how old Half-Life 2, Episode 1 is.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
That's how long we've been fucking waiting.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Well, not true, because there's an Episode 2, but still close.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
We've been waiting a long time for Half-Life, Episode 3.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
But one of the special things about this, though,

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
is that it does have an improved AI for Alex, in particular,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
in the game.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
And it was the upgraded version of the source engine

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
that had better lighting effects and different facial animation

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
technology.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
And then it allowed the AI enemies

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
to also use different fighting tactics.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
So it definitely added some more challenges, too.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
And it added more settings to the game.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
So it definitely was a big addition to the series.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
And it would definitely be worth mentioning.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
But we're still waiting.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Still waiting.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
And that's it.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Still waiting for that day.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Half-Life 2,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Episode 1.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
To register participation for this week's episode

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
use the passphrase, skate.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
So we got like five minutes here before we have to cut over

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
to the Bethesda conference.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
So maybe we can squeeze in release dates real quick?

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Do you think we can travel around the world,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
check out release dates?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Because there's probably not a lot this weekend.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
No, there's not a lot.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Unless there are surprises.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
That's the thing to cross your fingers for.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
True, yeah.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Some surprises.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Some surprises.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
But so far, what's on the plate, Dead by Daylight on PC,

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Dreamfall Chapters Book 5 Redux on PC, Mac and Linux.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
That is it.

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
On June 13th, cat lateral damage for PlayStation 4 in the UK.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
And that's it?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Yeah.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
All right.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Well, let me, I'm running over to Japan real quick.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Run, run, run.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And checking what's coming out of there in Japan.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
It looks like it's a little busier over there this week.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
On the 16th, on PlayStation 4, you have Root Letter

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
is out in Japan this week.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Again, on the PlayStation 4.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
And then traveling over to the Wii U.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Still slow this week.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
The next big release in Japan is Minecraft Wii U edition on the 23rd.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
Meanwhile, on the PlayStation Vita,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
we have Hakoyuki, Shinkai Hana no Shu,

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
as well as Root Letter is out on the Vita.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
So you have those to look forward to this week.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
And then lastly, wanting to check the DS

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
to see if there's anything on the DS this week.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Oh, Taiko no Tatujin Doko Don Mystery Adventure.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
That's right.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
A Taiko no Tatujin game that is like an adventure game.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
It's not your typical Taiko no Tatujin.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
But don't be fooled.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You still have the drum beats and all that good stuff in it.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But this one's going to be a little more of a hybrid game.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So there you go.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
That is your Japanese releases for this week.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
All right, guys.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
We're going to take a quick break.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
And when we come back, we will hopefully...

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Skyrim HD, you think?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Hopefully?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Possibly.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
So you want me to say something?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Elder Scrolls VI?

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Come on.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Hey, Oblivion was 2006.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Skyrim was 2011.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Maybe?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Maybe?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
It's about time.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Set the bar to realism.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
But we know Dishonored 2.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
We're about to see.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
Dishonored 2, I mean, the stuff that they think was very likely so far.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
So Dishonored 2, obviously, is going to be there.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
They've got, let's see, Dishonored 2 Fallout 4 DLC, Doom DLC,

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
Elder Scrolls Online updates, Elder Scrolls Legends,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
and then some rumored, Wolfenstein 2, The Evil Within 2,

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
Prey 2, Skyrim Remastered, and maybe Quake, but probably not.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
All right.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Do we know if it's 60 or 90 minutes?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
We don't know, do we?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Don't know.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
All right.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
So we will be back when the Bethesda press conference is over.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Stay tuned.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Don't go anywhere.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
For you podcast folks, it's going to be a time warp.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
We will be right back.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

44:59.000 --> 45:07.000
Live tonight, June the 12th of 2016, our 645th episode already in progress.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
We had a nice big break as we were watching the Bethesda press conference

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
together as a group.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
What did y'all think?

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
I kind of thought it was pretty good.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
You know, they did a really good job hyping their games and showing a lot of gameplay.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
I almost think they showed too much gameplay towards the end, but that's just me.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I know some people are way more into the Dishonored stuff than I am,

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
but I thought they did a, I thought, especially contrasted to EA earlier today,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
which was a lot of, I think, more talk.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I think they did a great job.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
It wasn't as exciting as last year, I think, but it was still very good.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Yeah.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Yet another game I might have been interested in,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
but there was no mention of a female protagonist.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Which game was that?

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Prey.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Ah, yeah, Prey.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
That one was interesting because, well, with Prey, I mean, I remember the older game,

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
and I think a lot of us were anticipating Prey 2, but this game they showed,

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
I mean, I know Prey was kind of like a sci-fi hybrid thing.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
It seems like a reimagining, but I'm still not interested.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
There was a lot of Native American culture tie-ins in the old game,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
and I don't know if that's going to still be there.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
But even in the supposed Prey 2 that they were showing didn't look anything like Prey,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
so I don't know. I guess it's not a big deal.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Let's go down the list. We'll revisit Prey in a moment,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
but let's go down the list of everything they showed.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
This one really surprised me, especially because they opened with this,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
and they didn't close with it.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
The closer was kind of, okay, that's it, bye.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I'm kind of surprised they didn't close with this.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
But they opened big with Quake Champions, so Quake is coming back.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
DarkSakura, were we talking about this just last week?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
More Quake? Here we go.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I said it would be nice.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
So Quake Champions, which to me kind of feels like,

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
oh, they might have seen what was going on with Overwatch,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
that people really like these characters that are very fleshed out.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
They're a first-person shooter, and maybe this is their own kind of spin on that.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I don't know. That's kind of what I took away from it.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
But at least for me, Quake has not particularly been a character-driven game before,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
but it looks like they're going to really try to change that with this new one.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
But it looks sweet.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I was kind of surprised to see it so soon after Doom.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
What did you think, Logie?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I thought it was all right. I'm not a huge fan of Quake,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
but it looks decent.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
I mean, it's an arena shooter, so I wish it was an actual Quake game,

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
not just this kind of arena, multiplayer-focused game, I guess.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
More of an actual storyline Quake game.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
But whatever. That's fine.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Next up, obviously they didn't show a lot of gameplay,

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
but with their QuakeCon coming up, they're probably saving the big reveal for that.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Elder Scrolls Legends, the card game, they showed a little bit of that,

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
which, again, not to keep saying Bethesda wants to be Blizzard,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
but this looked a lot like Hearthstone to me,

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
especially when they were saying it's tablets now, too.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah, a big meh from me because I just don't give a shit about those types of games.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Yeah, I have to say, as much as I love Elder Scrolls,

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
I was not really, you know, but I get there are people super into trading card games

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
that are going to be really excited about this.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
So, you know, different stuff for different people.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
The Fallout 4 add-ons, so they talked a little bit about Fallout 4 after that,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
and then showed off some of the add-ons.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah, the contraptions thing was pretty funny.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
The add-ons are just going to be fantastic.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I mean, just with all the stuff you can do in the game

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
and now that you can create elevators and stuff and make contraptions,

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
I can only imagine all the YouTube videos are going to come out from that.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
The other part was torturing Mama Murphy like that.

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
That was fantastic. So, yeah, that was pretty awesome.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
Yeah, and, you know, again, I don't know the Fallout 4 world super, super well.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I've kind of watched Alan play a little bit of it,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
but I did think that the theme park thing looked pretty funny, too.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
That was something that has been rumored to be coming out for a while now.

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000
Even, like, with the original, with Fallout 4, they had, like,

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
it was in one of the updates that said Nuka World,

48:57.000 --> 49:04.000
leaked actual, like, it was like an internal email that came out in 2014 or 15

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
was saying something about Fallout Nuka World.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
So, it was something that they've been planning from the get-go,

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
but it'll be neat to check out, like, an actual, another expansion.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
I still hope you have to play Far Harbor, so I'm looking forward to that.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
But, yeah, more expansions.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
And then, obviously, they're feeling a lot of love with the Fallout Shelter,

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
and they're talking about now Fallout Shelter is going to be a PC game,

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
but then I thought it was all too interesting that they're bringing the vault into the Fallout 4 game.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Yeah, so you can make your own vault, which is pretty awesome.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Even DarkSakura piped up, she went,

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
I want a vault!

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Speaking, then you can experiment.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
It appeals to my Sims house building love.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
And you can experiment on your, you know, vault guests, if you will,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
so that's pretty awesome.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
Let's see, so then, big announcement, Skyrim HD is real,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
and it's October 28th is when it's coming back.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Looks like mod support will be a part of it as well.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Yep, that'd be awesome. I would pick that up.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
They're going to be able to charge you 60 bucks for that all over again, I bet.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Probably.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
Yeah, that's going to be, I wonder if that'll last a long time,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
or if that'll start to fall in price pretty quickly.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I would imagine it'd fall pretty quickly.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
They've been pretty good at discounting some of their games,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
like Wolfenstein was like 20 bucks, not too long.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
And they discount that stuff pretty often, so.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
Very curious how PC is going to take that,

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
because modding has already made PC Skyrim HD.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Yeah, I mean.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
There's textures and stuff, so kind of interesting

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
how they're going to resell that to the PC audience.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I think it's more of a console thing.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
I don't know if, I'd be surprised if they actually released it on PC.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I'm pretty sure there were three boxes on the screen.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
So, it wasn't Wii U.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Of course not.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I don't know.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
They could, they could try it, I guess.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I don't know why you would purchase that again.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
It could be something like a lot of times when they do

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
like an HD remix like that or something,

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
they may just put it out like for 20 bucks on PC.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
You know, like really cheap.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Right.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Well, I'm curious if all the expansions are bundled in as well.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
That is going to sweep the pot for those that maybe never picked those up.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
It would be all the expansions bundled in,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
but I'm thinking if they do re-release on PC,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
they're not going to charge like 60 bucks for it.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It's just going to be like 20 or something.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
It's inexpensive.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
They've done that in the past with other like HD

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
or like collectors, not collectors,

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
like game of the year editions or definitive editions.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
They'll be, you know, console obviously is going to be more expensive

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
because it's a new game for that platform,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
but for PC, since it's already been out,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
it's more of just kind of a compilation.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Oh, Defective Candy calls us out in chat

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
over at live.fognetwork.com saying the nice thing is

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
if you own Skyrim and all its add-ons

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
or own Legendary Edition on Steam,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
you'll get a free upgrade to Skyrim

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Special Edition on October 28th.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
I did not catch that.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
That must have been in some type of e-mail

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
or some online follow-up thing.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Which I do, so that'll be cool.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
That, okay, that's pretty rad then

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
if they're throwing that in as a free upgrade,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
then that kind of answers the questions,

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
what to do about the HD modders and stuff,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
but my thought is that maybe they went back

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
and changed some stuff actually in the engine itself

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
that's going to want to make some of the modders

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
go back and do new things

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
with some of these enhancements in the engine.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Well, yeah, because it's a pretty old engine,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
so if they are updating the whole engine

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
and maybe run on something a little bit similar

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
to Fallout 4, then that would be pretty nice.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Yeah.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Let's see.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Tigerclaw says,

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
I also have Skyrim on 360,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
which I never got around to playing

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
when I first bought it.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Well, sadly, I think you're going to have to rebuy it,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
but maybe if they are going to get it free on PC,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
it lends itself to the fact that maybe it won't be

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
a very expensive game.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Maybe it'll be more of a budget title.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Then Prey was the game that was shown after that.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Which is kind of confusing

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
because it looked like a whole new franchise

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
and then all of a sudden it's all Prey.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
It's like, huh?

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
I thought it was going to be,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I thought it was going to be like Groundhog Day

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
or Good Morning, Malcolm would be the name of the game.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
I don't know.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
It was just, it was different.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
It's just so like, this is Prey?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Okay, if you say so, I guess.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
I mean, it didn't look anything like the first game

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
and didn't look anything like that second trailer

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
for Prey 2 or whatever.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
It was just kind of, here's the thing,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
we're calling it Prey.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
And I'm not saying they have to like just copy

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
the first game or something.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
Maybe there's some theme that ties them together

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
that, you know, you know,

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
why you have the different protagonists and stuff,

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
but I'm just...

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Well, yeah.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
I mean, the first one,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
it was you're kidnapped by aliens basically.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
So we're kidnapped by aliens again?

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
I don't know.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Let's see.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And then after that was the Doom update.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
So they talked about some of the DLC for Doom.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
So they're going to do like multiplayer DLC,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
which, okay, cool.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
But then they mentioned the shareware throwback concept

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
where they're going to release episode one,

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
or the first level, I guess,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
free on Xbox and PlayStation,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
which I mean, that's cool.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
I love how they frame that, but it's a demo.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
They're releasing a Doom demo this week, basically.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
So for those that want to check it out.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
But that, again...

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
But it would be cool though,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
if like it was like the shareware thing

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
where I download that one level demo

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
and then I say purchase

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
and then I can download the rest of it.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Oh, are you kidding?

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Of course that's going to be there.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
In the day of digital sales?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Of course they want that money.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
That's how they're doing it.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
That's how they're going to get the money themselves.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
And that's how I think that they should be doing it

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
with all these other games.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Like, yes, I understand you can't make a standalone demo,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
but just put out the first level or something for free.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah, interesting.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I'd be curious to see what kind of success they have for this.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Because again, I didn't think I would like Doom,

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
but I really do.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
So I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of people

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
that can use this demo as a chance to see,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
well, I'm kind of on the fence about first-person shooters.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Am I going to like this?

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
And I bet, you know, there'll be some.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
They'll say nah, still not my cup of tea.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Too fast, too bloody, whatever.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
But there'll be some that are like,

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
okay, push A, I want more right here.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
So that is pretty cool.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Then after that, they talked about the Elder Scrolls Online,

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
which I've got to admit, I could not get,

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
as much as I love MMOs,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I really tried to get an Elder Scrolls Online.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I kind of couldn't do it.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Maybe I need to give it a second chance.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
And the nice thing is about the pricing model,

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
I don't have to pay a monthly fee,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
so I can give it another chance.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I liked how they were talking about the whole

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
we're going to just level sync you to everything.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
You can do whatever the hell you want in the game.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
That was cool.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
If you want to play it with me, I own it.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
I haven't played it yet.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Yeah, I own it too.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
I played a little bit of it, but it was so buggy.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
But then again, I played it the day it came out.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
LOL Bethesda and buggy games.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
So now it's probably fine.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
If I can fit it into my busy schedule.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Girl.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
No, I'll check it out.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Okay.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
I'll check it out.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
After we see Warcraft.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Yeah, which is also on my list of things to do.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Sadly, a topic we will not be able to talk about tonight

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
because none of us saw it yet,

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
but we got too busy of a show tonight anyway.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
The 23rd, it will be released in Japan.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
That was another pretty notable deal

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
is that they're going to take the Elder Scrolls Online to Japan.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I'd be very curious to see how it's received over there.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
Speaking of Warcraft, World of Warcraft does not exist in Japan.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Final Fantasy XIV obviously exists in Japan,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
but the MMO landscape without Warcraft in it,

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
very different in Japan.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
So it'll be very interesting to see what Elder Scrolls Online does.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
And then after that was talking about the Bethesda VR,

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
which kind of surprised me that they're taking existing things

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
and putting it into VR

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
because that isn't necessarily always the best idea,

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
but it sounds like they're taking care

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
to ensure that the games are kind of built for VR, so to speak.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
And then they mentioned that Fallout 4 is going to be on the HTC Vive.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
So interesting that they did not mention the PlayStation VR.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Oculus, I kind of get a little more

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
because wasn't there a little spat going on

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
between one of the id, which does the stuff for Bethesda,

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
and Oculus, wasn't there a little thing going on there?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
So I can kind of see maybe why that was left out.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
But this is going to be very interesting now

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
as we're starting to see the chess pieces move

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
where what VR is going to have what.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Yeah, that's definitely a great win for the Vive

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
because someone's looking to purchase,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
you know, a VR system and it's like,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
oh, hey, Fallout 4, that'd be pretty awesome.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Thank you, Bobby.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Of course, Bobby knows this shit when it comes to VR.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
And in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
I think the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus is still going on.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
They feel Carmax stole ZeniMax tech and took it to Oculus.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
So that was, yeah, so that's not a surprise

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
that they're leaving Oculus out in that regard.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
But when they said Bethesda VR,

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I was like, well, are they going to create their own headset?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Please don't.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Oh, yeah, please don't.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I was like, oh, see, they're saying

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
that he stole their tech

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
because they're actually developing one their own.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I'm like, oh, no, not another one.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
And then it's like for the Vive, I'm like, okay, fine.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
That's fine.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
At least they're siding with somebody.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
I was just a little worried there that,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
hey, we've got our own headset.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I'd be very curious to see how that plays.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
I have to admit Doom is very fast, very fluid,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
and I feel like would make me very sick.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
But the way he phrased it,

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
he wasn't saying like it's just Doom ported to VR.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
He kind of was saying it's an experience.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
He kind of used some words that make me think

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
it's not just a injecting VR.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Like they're doing something

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
to keep the VR stuff in mind with that.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
So I'd be very curious to see about that.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
And then, of course, Fallout 4,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
they mentioned that will come out for the HTC Vive,

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
so that'll be pretty interesting.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Yeah, and Bobby in chat says,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
yeah, it's an experience in the Doom world,

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
but Fallout 4 is a VR conversion of the game.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
But Fallout 4 I don't think moves as fast as Doom does.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
It's still a fast game, but it's a little more tempered.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
And then lastly, of course, an extended, very extended,

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
very, very extended look at this.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I kind of think it was a bit much.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
People are disappointed that there was no announcement

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
for a new Wolfenstein,

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
but if you caught a glimpse

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
of during that little DOS thing that they were doing

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
with the different folders that were listed on there,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
they all had release dates.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Each of those folders was dated by the release of those games.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
So they had Keen, 12, 14, 90, Wolf 3D, 5, 5, 92,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
New Order, 5, 20, 14,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Old Blood, 5, 5, 15,

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
New Colossus, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
So that's probably the new Wolfenstein

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
that they're like, tease!

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
A little tease in there.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
And then, of course, the other thing.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
In the old Wolfenstein games,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
wasn't one of the battles that people remember

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
when Hitler was in a colossus?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Wasn't that the boss one?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I'm almost positive that was one of the...

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Yeah, like he was in a mech. I remember that.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
That was a whole big thing.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Maybe they're bringing something like that back.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Okay, so what about Dishonored 2, though?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
It looked really pretty.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Yeah, it looked nice.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I think the gameplay, though, was a little long.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I'm not that excited about it,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
but it looks cool.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I actually am interested in this one.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I wasn't at all interested in the first one,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
but now I'm interested in this one.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Well, then, mission accomplished

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
on Bethesda's part, I suppose.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
No, I mean, they did try to sell me

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
with the anus shots, but, you know.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Well, like I said,

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
you got ripped, and you asshole.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
When I said shoot him in the butt, I wasn't literal.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
But, Jamie, what'd you think about that deal, though,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
where if you get the game,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
you said you never really got into the first one.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Here's your chance. The first one completely remastered.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, yay, you had another game in my collection

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I'm not gonna play.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Whoopty shit.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
This one's supposed to be pretty good, actually.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Now you know why I was tempered

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
when it came to the Elder Scrolls Online.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It's like, uh, another game I'll never get to.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Dishonored, I feel like, is in my Steam.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Like, it came in some damn bundle a long time ago.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Yeah, I think I got it.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
They were giving it away at one point,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
so, you know, they want to raise hype

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
for the second game, so.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
ActDeaf, just curious what it is

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
that piqued your interest in Dishonored 2, Darasaka.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Female protagonists with cool powers.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I am a sucker

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
for a well-developed, uh,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I'm trying to think of what the right word to phrase it says.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
A well-developed environment,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
meaning that you've got

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
the history in the buildings,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
you've got the people going about their days.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
You can actually sit,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and people watch if you wanted to,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and it would be legit.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Like, I've followed NPCs around before

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
in Fable.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I can see where they went.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And you being a big Sims fan,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that doesn't surprise me at all,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
because that's part of the big allure of The Sims,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
is watching your Sims hook up and stuff like that.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Well, not really. It's seeing how you can torture them

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
until they, you know, set themselves on fire

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
or drown, and then you just go build more houses.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That's The Sims for me.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But I like the artistry

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
that went into it, and the depth.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And I kept thinking,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
like, when they showed that scene,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
and what was the huge rail that was going in the big circle

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
above their heads,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I was like, I wonder if you could get up there

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
and wander around.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Because one of the things I love to do in games

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
is find out, how can I get to where I'm not supposed to go?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
How can I stand there?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
How can I climb there?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And so, that's what really

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
set it off for me.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So, I gotta just poke you on this a little bit, because

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
you know, you mentioned with Prey, you weren't interested

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
because there wasn't a female protagonist,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
but I mean, I kind of, I don't know,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I guess it's limited what we know about the game so far,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
but I thought the environments were really pretty,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
and I remember that about the old Prey game, so I mean,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
are you just, do you think you're really serious?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I'm serious, that's it.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I think...

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Don't you think it's early to judge it based off that?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I mean, at least, at least

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
the character was Asian too,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
which you don't see a lot of... That doesn't matter,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I don't care what their, you know,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
what their skin looks like,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I care if it's a character

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that I can understand.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Huh. And so,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I think that we also do have,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
we're getting a lot more,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
you know, characters, especially, you know,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
games like Mirror's Edge with only female

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
protagonists. I think we need

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
more of them, and I don't,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I don't know, I guess I'm just sort of sick

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
of supporting, you know,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
a male narrative

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
for this long, you know? Does that make sense?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I guess,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and it's like, I understand the need for diversity

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
in games, but at the same time, like, you know,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
if Prey ends up being really cool,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
maybe, you know, we just saw one trailer,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
maybe there'll be some, maybe there will be a playable woman

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
in it at some point that you take over for a little bit,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
or maybe there'll be a very strong female support

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
character or something? I'm tired of

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
being, I'm tired of women being

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
support for a man.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
In storytelling.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm tired of the women in refrigerators.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I'm tired of the whole thing.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
We, you know,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
it really is just so off-putting now.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I'm tired of

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
giving my money to that.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And I think that, you know,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
it's time to

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
to have, um,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
shut up,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
okay? Just shut up.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Is something in chat bothering you?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You're telling me it's time to rant. It's bonds006.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Oh. No, it's not a rant.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It's something that needs to be said

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and there's a difference.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
everybody,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I think, we're looking

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
so hard for

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
okay, thank you then. We look

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
so, um,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and I'm not,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
we are all co-hosts.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Okay? You gotta, you gotta

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
respond to what is in chat here. Okay,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Stoppy says, tired of being a supporting character

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
is a co-host. No. Co-host means

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
you host with people. All three

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
of us. Right. And it's not

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
poking fun. You said it at

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
the really worst time. The

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
whole point is that, especially

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
in this day and age, we need to all be

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
on equal footing. And when you've

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
been delivered games

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
historically that have all been

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
written for men, that

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
have all starred male characters, sometimes

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
you get a point where you're a little fucking

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
sick of it. Just saying.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I can understand that, that you've

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
kind of hit your limit. And I hope, um,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I hope there will be

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
something that, you know, comes

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
from Bethesda in the future that will

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
hopefully surprise you pleasantly about

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Prey. But I do want to say this,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
speaking of support and all this, I do think this is worthy

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
of calling out. I did think it was very awesome

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
that everybody had the rainbow.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Everybody had the rainbow ribbon. I thought that was very, very

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
cool. A nice gesture by the

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
company. I just wanted to acknowledge. Oh, yeah.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I did find that really, really awesome.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yes. And it's just,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
you know,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
EcumaJP

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
says, um, that

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
men are stupid and that is why we have a

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
story to tell. No, I

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
don't think that, I don't think that at all.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
It's just that,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
you know,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I think that

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I'm just really tired of it. I'm, I'm really

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
looking to have something that's going to be more

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
something I can relate to. And

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
not have to put myself into

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
the writing of

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
the character that

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
in the end, I

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
can't see eye to eye with.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I mean, yeah, we might

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
understand on views or I might feel this way in the situation.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But in the end, I don't have that

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
perspective. I don't necessarily want

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
that perspective. And I'm

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
tired of everything being delivered to me

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
from a man's perspective. Well, these are,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
these are raw, real feelings and you're entitled

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
to them, whether somebody agrees with you or not.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Um, in chat,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Alan Alchemy over at live.vongnetwork.com

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
says, it's her $60. If people refuse

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
to see movies with Michael Bay or Adam Sandler

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
on principle, people can avoid video games

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
for whatever reason they want as well.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Um, Bobby in chat with a

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
counterpoint and I'll kind of let you

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
respond and then close this and move on.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Uh, Bobby in chat says, I have no problem with someone

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
not spending their $60 on it, but I hope this doesn't become

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
a movement to limit storytellers to

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
only have them be female protagonists.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That's what I worry about. If we can get

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
to a point, and I've said this before about

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
every type of representation

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
for every

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
aspect of diversity, we need

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
to get to a point where

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
it doesn't matter because

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
it's common. Where it becomes

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
just part of the story.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Where the representation across

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the board is so

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
normalized that we're not

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
going to see,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
oh, this is, we need a diversity

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
so let's throw a woman in here.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Oh, we need them to be diverse so let's

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
make her a lesbian while we're at it.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And we'll make her Asian too.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You know, it's

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
not, you make this a decision to

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
be diverse. It's, you make this

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
a decision to tell a good story.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
This plays into who this character

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
is. And my

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
perfect ideal of

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
equality for everybody

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
is when we

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
don't have to worry about

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
safe spaces. When we don't

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
have to worry about representation.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
When we don't have to worry

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
about, oh, that's so novel that they

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
did that. Or kudos to

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Pixar for having a lesbian

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
couple and finding Dory.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Where it's normal.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And no one has to care.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Does that make sense?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It's fair, yes it does.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Alright. Let's move on.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
However, just in the interest of trying to cover

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
some of these other stories before because we're obviously

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
running very late tonight. We do want to try to at least

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
take a couple calls over

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But I think that's all we got. That was it

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
for the presser, right? So Loki,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
anything you're going to be buying out of that?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Probably just Skyrim HD

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and then I don't need to buy the DLC

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
because I have the season pass.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Because that's why they increased the price of the season pass after

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
marches because of all the additional DLC.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So I'm good there.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That's it.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I just want to mention

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
this very nice closure in chat.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Bobby responding to what DarkSakura said saying

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I hear you. I may not agree 100%

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
but I hear you and I'm listening. And I think that's very

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
nice closure on that.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Okay, so let's move on with some

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
other news.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Because there's still a lot we haven't talked about yet.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So we're going to try to run through some of these stories here

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
so we can get to calls. So Loki?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
So there's another game that was announced, or a new game

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I should say, that's being announced by Volition.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Sadly it's not another Saints Row game.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But it's a game called

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Agents of Mayhem.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And it's like this futuristic

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
single player game where

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
you have like a team of

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I don't know, almost like pirates.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But futuristic pirates I guess.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And they have different abilities and you can switch between them.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And it looks pretty awesome.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
No multiplayer though, that's kind of sad.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It almost looks like it's sort of tied into

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
the Saints but it's not. It's a completely different world

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
they've confirmed. It just happens to

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
have almost the same logo

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and all

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
tours in there. But apparently all tours also in

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Red Faction so that doesn't necessarily

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
mean anything. But

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
yeah, they were showing that off and that should be out sometime

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
in 2017 for the

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
consoles and PC.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Alright, I know

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
when I heard about that I definitely thought of you.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Well right, yeah I looked at it

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
but I don't know. I had to see

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
more of it. It's not that exciting.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I want

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
a new Saints Row game.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
But I'll check it out I guess.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
If the humor's there I'm on board.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Right, yeah.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
There was a quote

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
out there that was like a hoi mother fucker

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
or something.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
It was pretty funny.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
It looks interesting. I like the art style

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
so it'd be cool to see if that carries on through the game.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Sony confirming

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
this week that it exists but it will

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
not be at E3 and that is

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Andrew House, CEO of Sony Interactive

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Entertainment confirming there is

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
a high-end PS4.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Not calling it the Neo or the 4K

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
or any of those names that have been thrown around

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
the internet. However in an interview with the

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Financial Times he confirmed

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
it is intended to sit alongside and

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
compliment the standard PlayStation 4.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
We will be selling both

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
versions through the lifecycle.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I don't like it.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I need to hear more details.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
It better have sparkles.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm actually

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
glad it's not at

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
E3 because with the VR

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
kind of being around the corner

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
this tells me that they are expecting

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
for this holiday that VR will be a

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
solid experience without this

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Neo or whatever.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I hope that's the case.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I really hope so too. Because that's gonna really

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
fuck it up for me if it is because

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
it's just

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
you get everybody hyped up about

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
your VR and then like, oh by the

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
way you kind of need a new console to actually get

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
to work right. You know it's like fuck you.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
That's kind of fucked up if that's the case.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So I need to see how

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
it goes. I mean I have it pre-ordered.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I put the $100 down but like

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I'm gonna be pissed if I spend $500

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
on a PlayStation VR and then Res HD

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
is the only thing I get to play. Actually

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I won't be that upset.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I would assume that it will

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
buy the newer system

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and have it work but it's just like

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I shouldn't have to

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
if I'm paying like $400 for a new

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
system and $400

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
for the you know

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
VR like

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I might as well just spend a little bit more and just get a fucking

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Vive and a high end PC at that point.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
That's my thing. It's like

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I bought a console

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
to avoid this shit.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
This like yearly update bullshit

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and now they're like hmm we want some of that

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
some of that cell phone tablet

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Apple money. Fuck you.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I am not doing this shit

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and I don't know

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I'm kind of curious to see what devs think about this

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
because it's just if you have to keep

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
making sure oh I gotta make sure my game

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
runs better on this version

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
of it and not so

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
not or it still runs on the other one as well

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and I don't know. Yeah I gotta

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
really see what this is about. I mean the

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Apple cell phone thing that earns my money

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
every other year at least. You know I feel like

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
the upgrade is enough to justify it every other year.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But it's something that you use every day and

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I mean it's something like true I

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
use mine all the time and I don't necessarily do

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
anything graphically intensive on it. It's not like

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I'm

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
those things can pack a punch.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So right now I understand that but like

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I feel

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
you know I can get by for

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
a few years if I don't want to

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
necessarily do all this stuff but like I'm

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
not I don't buy

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
my phone to game on and I'm not

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
buying one every other year or so.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I mean I tend to buy mine until it just

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
doesn't fucking work anymore then I'll buy a new one.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And that's I think how it should be with the

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
consoles. If you're going to keep coming out with new consoles

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
each year like call them a different

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
console or something. I mean just

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I don't like this just

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
upgrading specs. If I want to just upgrade specs

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
every year that's a PC.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I'm buying a PC at that point.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Why am I supporting the consoles then?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Alright. Let's move

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
on with some more news though so we can get to calls.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Dark Soccer do you want to take this next story?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Yes.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Speaking back on representation

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
there was some

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
negativity unleashed toward Ubisoft

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
regarding Watch Dogs 2.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
There's a bunch of racist

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
assholes out there who

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
are upset that the hero

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
of Watch Dogs 2 is black.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
A black hacktivist.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
What's wrong with you

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
people? What is wrong

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
with you? No stop. Stop right

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
now if you're listening to this podcast look

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
in the mirror and say me

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I give

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
our listeners a lot of credit that they're pretty

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
intelligent to be listening to this show. Yes.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Honestly I'm going to say this very bluntly

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
anybody that felt that way

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
would have already tuned out on your

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
last rant. Let's be real. Well fuck them too.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So I mean if they've made it

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
this far I think people understand.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Who cares what the skin color is of the

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
protagonist. Some people care because

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
they're stupid. But we need to know

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
whether the game is going to just be all

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
downgraded like it was before. That's what

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I'm interested to find out. I think

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
yay for

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
there being a black person in the lead.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I think that is great. And who gives a

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
shit about a black person being the lead? There's a black

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
person in the lead of Grand Theft Auto 5

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
which sold 60 million copies.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I don't think you fucking care.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I mean seriously. Very true.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Who gives a shit?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Very true. Yeah so if

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
it's just

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Twitter needs to just be taken

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
away from some people.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It's just people dislike things.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And people

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
dislike all sorts of things. And they

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
whatever. I mean you can't

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
please everybody. Honestly

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I wouldn't want to run into these people online anyway

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
so it's probably best they don't get the game.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It's just like I mean 60 million people

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
though. If they had such a problem with it

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
they wouldn't have bought Grand Theft Auto 5

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
60 million times.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Let's move on Loki.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Alright so this is pretty exciting.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
You know I didn't quite buy in

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
on this whole Lego Dimensions

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
thing originally.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Oh I'm sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Oh no we actually missed that last time.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
So let me cover the Lego Dimensions thing real

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
fast. And I'll get

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
to the other thing. So Lego Dimensions

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
they announced basically their

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
season 2 or I guess the new set of

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
properties that are going to be attached

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
to this. And I got to say I am super

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
excited about it. It's like before they

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
had the whole thing where it's kind of the cross

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
franchises. You know you have Back to

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
the Future. Fucking Doctor Who.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You know all this stuff going together. Now

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
it's just it's fucking

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
crazy 80's shit.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So here's what they've got.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
They've got A-Team, Adventure

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Time, Harry Potter

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The Goonies, Gremlins

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Knight Rider

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Fucking Lego City Undercover, Sonic the Hedgehog

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Powerpuff Girls, Teen Titans Go

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Beetlejuice and E.T.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It's pretty badass. That is

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
fucking amazing. I feel like this is

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
a game that's aimed towards 30 somethings

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
and I'm eating it up. It's just like they're like

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
hey we know where the money is and damn

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
right you know where the money is and it's fucking

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Legos so you know what if that

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and they just they just walked into a

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
what's that new store called we went to an art

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
firm called the Brick House is that what it's called?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It's that new store that's just like a bunch of like nerd stuff

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and I swear to god the Lego people just went there and went

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
we're gonna get that that that that

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
that that that like every

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
shirt in the store they're like we need that license

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
that license and then of course I

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
missed they also have

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
the main campaign

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
that's gonna be in there is the new Ghostbusters

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
movie that's as well and it

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
it's not something and what's cool about this you don't

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
need to buy

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
a new portal or anything it works with the old

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
portal and those will work for any future

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
versions of the game as well it's coming out September

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
27th but the only thing that really

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
stopped me from buying this originally is the price

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
because it's a Lego premium those sets are

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
like $30 for each of the expansions

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and like the the actual toys

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
are like $20 it gets really expensive

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
yeah but it's

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
really hard you'll pay it for the Goonies it's

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
really hard to like not want to buy all

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
this shit so that's

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
the only problem and uh Bobby

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
in chat pointing out it's not Lego Dimensions 2

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
it's just the regular Lego dimensions

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
yeah it's just more stuff

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
which which is great

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
it is they're not gonna like incrementally

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
you know do more that's great but like seriously

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
that's like fucking 80s

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
crazy right there

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
alright um well let's

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
move on and um

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I'm not sure our show role seems a little

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
borked right now I think some old stuff got in there somehow but

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'm going to move on to this story about

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I skipped what the story was I had because it was honestly

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
not that interesting

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
well let's talk about the Dorito machine

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
that's at E3 have you guys seen the pictures

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
of this going up there's a gigantic

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
arcade game in the middle of the

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
street uh and I'm assuming

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
it's in one of those parking lots around the area

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
yes I can imagine all the traffic that would cause

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
from being in oh my I would know

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
how am I I don't know what the fuck is this

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Doritos machine doing here it's gonna be a mess

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
uh but anyway uh

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
there's a bunch of other fan stuff going around but there's a

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
huge Doritos arcade thing

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
uh that is gonna be having I guess

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
concerts on one level of it and

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
then like a giant screen I mean it just

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I thought it was a giant Trojan horse to get Jeff

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Keeley into the actual E3 event

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
he is after all the Doritos pope

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
it's kinda neat I guess it's visibility

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
for all of E3 but it's a little

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
bit like okay this is a bit

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
it's just funny that it's Doritos too

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
does it have fountains that shoot Mountain Dew on it

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
when somebody gets a new high score just everybody

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
gets sprayed with Mountain Dew

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
it actually sounds disgusting

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
alright um

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
let's talk our last story tonight

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
uh don't think there's a

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
last story for me showing Rob

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
uh is it about Star Trek Online

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
oh sorry I was looking at

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
uh the uh

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
the mail

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
that I could have read

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
oh my bad was there an email that came in last minute

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
yes there was we'll get to that right after the story then

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
it's tiny okay um

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
so anyway uh there is some news about

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Star Trek Online which

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
oh my god I need to

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
just actually sit down and play it again

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
so Star Trek Online is gonna be

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
having um

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
a uh old school

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
upgrade they're doing an

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
expansion to start the characters

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
of the game in the era

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
of the original Star Trek

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
series and you can have all of

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
the original ships and

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
you know time travel

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
stuff and doing

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
you know wearing short mini skirts

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
while you go around looking good just don't wear red

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000

expansion can the dudes wear mini skirts too

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
like in the early episodes of Next Generation

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I'm sure they were called skants Rob

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
pardon me

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I would play a dude in a skant just to have it

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
okay

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000

I've taken portions

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
of next week off

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
not to watch E3 to watch the US

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Open just think uh six hours

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
a day everyday of rich men hitting

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
white balls on perfectly manicured grass

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
so I'm looking for suggestions

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
on what I should cook for dinner

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
on Thursday and Friday by the way included

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
underneath this recipe I'm cooking tonight

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
steak hair Redertainment and it's sauteed

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
chicken cutlets with wine sauce

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
you wanna know what? what?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I have in my freezer right now

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
marinated chicken thighs

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
in Beaujolais

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
with herbs de provence

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
the answer my friend

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
if you're wondering what to cook the answer

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
is always tacos

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
tacos

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
uh there you go

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
did anybody take time off work for E3

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
this year? I did not

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I thought about it but no I didn't

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
but see with the job that I have now or at least

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
the position I'm in I can listen to the podcast

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
most of the day so I'm just gonna

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
watch the presentations while I work

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
that's nice so I'm just gonna do that

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
sadly I will not have that option

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I teach tomorrow so I'm in a class

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
all day so pretty I'll get to watch

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Sony but I will not get to watch Microsoft

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
which is kind of a bummer so I'll just have to kind of

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
catch the highlight reel

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
yeah I might be the vice versa cause I'm gonna be having the

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
wrangle kids during Sony so

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I usually try to catch it

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
while I'm cooking dinner or something

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
but

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
and then I'm very curious about the Zelda stuff

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
on Tuesday what that all is gonna

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
entail

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
my hype is not that great for

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
well that's good to set the bar low

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
well I mean I'm

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
excited about the game but I'm just like

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
is that it? I mean like I really wish they

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
had a presentation of some

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
sort of showing the other things

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
cause I know they have more than just Zelda

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
there are other things but they're not talking

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
about it for why

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I don't understand the reason for that

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
yeah

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
let's get to the phones it's your chance to

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
chime in on anything about E3

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
if you wanna talk about EA earlier today you wanna talk

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
about Bethesda you wanna talk about something

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
else that's happened during the week

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
some of the leaks or maybe something you're looking forward to

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
it's your chance to call in

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
all one word Orange Lounge

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Radio on Skype

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat over at live.vognetware.com

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
says I feel ya Loki I'll still be there

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
front row center for Tuesday

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
yeah I'm still very curious

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I gotta admit

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
any last minute

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
stories we wanna try and work in here Loki

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
so you know how there is all these

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Microsoft leaks and

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
not only did the new system come out but

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Dead Rising 4 is another thing that got

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
leaked out with actual gameplay

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
right

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
also ReCore was another thing

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
so GameSpot decided to email

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Microsoft to get their comment on the leaks

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
and all they did was send them

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
a Shruggy like

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
an Aski Shrug

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and then a link to their E3

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
page and they're like eh

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
that was their official response

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I thought that was funny

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I'm glad they have a sense of humor about it

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
that's funny stay tuned

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
sounds like Bloodstained Ritual

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
of the Night will be playable at E3

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
2016 I'm excited to see

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
what comes out of that

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
didn't they just release a playable version of that

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
or they were supposed to be releasing

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
some sort of beta or something

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I saw something I think either this week or last

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Raginator

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
in chat is saying no love for GOG this week

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
big GOG deals

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
we gave a little love to GOG last week

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
to be fair and they're not paying us

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
but since you brought it up

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
this is the season for summer sales

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I'm sure GOG's got theirs

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
what Steam's ought to be in a couple of weeks

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
they already have the cards up

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
there's a pretty good Humble Bundle right now too

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I haven't checked it out

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
but yeah I do need to get that one because that's the one that has

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
that cool drifting game in it

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
again Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
you know what we didn't talk about that also leaked

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
was Injustice 2

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
did you check any of that out? Injustice 2

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
it looked okay I mean I didn't play the first one

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I have it for free since they gave it away

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
like a couple of years ago

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
so I gotta check that out

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
some DLC apparently already

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
being teased now people are reading into

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
some of the things that Ed Boon is saying but some of the

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
teased DLC Blue Beetle

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Captain Cold and Swamp Thing

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
one of the things

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
though I didn't really care for about it

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
they were saying that they have like it's almost

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
it sounds like

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
the Overwatch loot crates that you get

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
or something so you basically get

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
these like unlocks for different armors

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
or something after

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
each match or something and I guess you

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
can pay to get more of those or something

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I don't know I didn't really catch that

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
on the Nintendo

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
side did you see the two new Pokemon for

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Sun and Moon that was in the magazine

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
oh I don't give a shit about that

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
they looked really cute though I will say there was like a cute

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
little koala bear looking thing

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
like holding a log and he's like

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
this is my log kind of like the log lady from Twin Peaks

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
this is my log and then there was like a little

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
puppy thingy too so it was

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
cute I mean if Pokemon

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
need to be cute right because someday

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
they might be in Pokemon Go I mean I know

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Pokemon Go is only the first 150

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
they keep adding Pokemon to it because they have like

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
107 was the max and now it's like

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
130 something

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
yeah I think Porygon

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
is as high as it goes in the Pokedex so far

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I think

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
yeah we'll see no I think it's higher

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
than that now I don't know we'll see

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
anyway also

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
World of Final Fantasy is

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
launching in October

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
hmm did you check out the

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
footage for World of Final Fantasy I'll be checking

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
that out that looks pretty cool I don't

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
remember what that is

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
it is the extra

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Final Fantasy game that's the one that they were

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
teasing that I think is

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
the experience that is specifically made

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
for I'm trying to remember if this is the one

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
about the cell phones

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
no this is different this is the

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
one that's kind of more appealing to children

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
and they showed like a real

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
brief teaser of it last year

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
it's going to be on Playstation 4 and Playstation Vita

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
and it's going to come out October 25th

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
you remember there was a real quick glimpse of this

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
at the Playstation thing last year and it was like very

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
chibi Final Fantasy characters and all that

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
yeah

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
it's going to be very busy for Final Fantasy

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
this year with Final Fantasy 15 coming out

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
very soon

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
will put out one more call for calls

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and then I'm going to assume people just

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
got caught up in watching Morgan Webb

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and Adam Sessler and didn't come back

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
all one word on Skype

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
of course if you didn't get through on Skype tonight

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
if you were doing other stuff tonight and weren't able to join us live

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
you can always send us an email

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
you know I did just remember

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
we did the mailbag

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
and then we did not do the FUs of the week

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
which usually comes right after the mailbag

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
so I think this is a good opportunity for us to get

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
a little bit ranty

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
all this is bad

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
here is justice

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
here is punishment

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
here

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
is it fucked up

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
FU

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
to haters everywhere

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
especially the ones who decide

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
to act on it

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and FU to this asshole that my sister is

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
friends with I don't know what the fuck caught up to your ass

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
but you suck

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
uh Loki

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
um FU in my car

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
cause the other day as I was leaving the show

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
my check engine light came on

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and the drive light was flashing

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
which means the transmission problem

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
except the problem is my car is driving just fine

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
and then a day later it went off

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
so I'm gonna assume everything is okay

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
until it finally breaks

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I don't know it's buggy

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
and blame it

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
you know what the problem was

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and the reason it came on

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
some dumb ass little ass dog

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
in the car instead of killing it

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I decided to swerve a little bit to the left

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and hit the brakes

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
and then the stupid light came on

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
so apparently there was a loose sensor or some shit

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
fucking dog

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
shit killed your ass

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
don't talk about killing your dog

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
I didn't though

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I can say that now because he's still alive

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
uh I'm gonna just defer

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
to what I said at the opening of the show

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
for my FU of the week

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
honestly that's all the anger I have

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
in that department right now so there you go

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
alright um

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I guess I guess that's

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
oh wait last minute

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
somebody's waiting at the last minute to call in

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
but let's get to it hi you're on orange songs radio who's this

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
hey this is akdef

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
hey akdef thanks for not leaving us too lonely this week

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
in the skype segment I was getting a little worried

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
what's on your mind

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
well

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
uh

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I'm gonna ask you a question

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
first of all

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
yeah

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
to all of you

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I don't know if it can be plausible

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
but how exciting

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
would it be to have

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
like nintendo

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
announcing okay since

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
you saw the demo

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
for Legend of Zelda for Wii U

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
and NX

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
we're gonna have it on the eShop right now

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
and you can download it on

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
well in this case on tuesday

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
how exciting would that be

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I wish but

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
we're past those days unfortunately

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
those were the days of the early

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
xbox 360 and what 2006

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
c3 2005 c3

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
sadly those days are gone

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
they would not put it up because it would be reversed engineered

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
people would start modding it

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
doing crazy crap to it trying to dig through the files

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
find secrets and I mean

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I think nintendo's probably just focused

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
on finishing the damn game

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
it's probably enough of an inconvenience for them to have to do

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
this e3 thing anyway which by the way

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I think you're not seeing the nx version

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
at e3 because

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
you know they have to cut a demo specifically

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
for e3

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
but we do live in a day and age

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
of live streaming and so

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
maybe you're not gonna be able to play the demo yourself

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
but you'll be able to watch somebody else

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
do it live like right

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
there you know the one thing that's gonna be

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
missing is the controller so

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I think maybe that's just

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
what they want that'll be a little more controlled

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I think that's just what it boils down to

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
well that's for sure

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
well if we don't have at least

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
that surprise announcement

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
what surprise announcement

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
would you like from

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
well for many of the companies left

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
on e3

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
from

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
nintendo

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
there's the rumors going around

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
about earthbound 3

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
or mother 3 you know whatever they're gonna end up

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
calling it I would really love to

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
see that become a reality I'm not gonna hold my

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
breath too much

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
but from nintendo I've just kind of accepted the

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
fact that it's just not gonna happen this year

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I just need to wait till next year

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I am still gonna really hope that

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and I know it

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
sounds weird to talk about old shit

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
but I really would like to hear that maybe

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Microsoft is gonna make a major expansion

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
on the backwards compatibility catalog

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
this week

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
and perhaps that Playstation 1

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
games will be playable at least

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Playstation 1 games will be playable again on

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Playstation 4 I really really think it's time

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
and that would be a very nice surprise

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I would look forward to which I know is weird to talk

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
about old shit but this is

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
important this is the reason why so cause I don't want

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
you going well Rob they're gonna talk about

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
old shit at e3 then what the fuck is the

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
point of e3 because you

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
can still have the old shit but with the

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
new frills that have

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
bridged the Playstation 3 and Playstation

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
4 you know what was the big

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
jump we took this generation

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
the social end of things right

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
so if I can play the Playstation 1 games

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
and stream them or

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
do the share play things so I

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
can play with friends

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
across a great distance that's

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
gonna breathe whole new life into

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
some of the old library there so

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
that's why I get excited

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
about the old games and the new shell

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
if that makes sense

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
yeah it absolutely

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
makes sense like I was actually

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
thinking right now that

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
when they announced that

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
new bibriven was coming to

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
beta and Playstation 3 like

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
2 years ago or

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
at least yeah I think 2 years

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
ago right yeah

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
and I was thinking they never

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
like follow

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
follow that up like

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
they should probably

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
yeah announce like oh

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
you can now play Playstation 1

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
games on PS4 like bibriven

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and hey we're gonna announce

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
a new bibriven with

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
3 support or at least digital

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
yeah and that never happened

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
on Playstation 4 it happened on 3 but not

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
4 so yeah be curious

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I do wanna

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
point this out as well when it comes to Sony

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
is that I think Sony is under

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
and for me like an expectation I really

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
have of them is to deliver

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
something really big this holiday

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
and you know I

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
fully expect there'll probably be a God of War 4

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
announcement I don't think it'll be ready for this holiday

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
but I think something they've been

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
teasing us with over the past couple years

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
they need to date for this holiday

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
like it's fucking time already Sony needs to

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
put up with some of the stuff that they've been showing

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
my gut tells me

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Last Guardian is gonna be that game finally

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
will be that game and that's what we're gonna get this holiday

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
that's just cause I don't think it's Final Fantasy 7

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
not with 15 this year

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
it certainly ain't Kingdom Hearts 3

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
uh especially with you know

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
2.8 is gonna be that game anyway I kinda

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
think it's time the game looked

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
to be far enough along and what we saw last year

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I really think Last Guardian is that game and that's my expectation

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
yeah that's

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
probably true

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
let me ask you this question

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
before I let you go ActDeft there was a

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
pretty big game that came out a couple days ago

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
which sadly we've all been distracted

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
in other ways we haven't been able to talk about it but I know

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I know you have had to have spent

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
some time with Kirby RoboBot

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
oh yeah

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Kirby Planet RoboBot I was actually gonna

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
ask you well all of you

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
why haven't you played that game but

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
but yeah we have all been

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
pretty occupied even me

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I have that game

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
right now in front of me it's even

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
like on my 3DS

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
right now but I haven't started

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
yet I have been so

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
busy this weekend so

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I haven't gotten the time to play it

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
uh

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
especially with Nintendo's calendar

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
being a little funky where the games come out

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
on Friday now right?

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I can never remember what day is anymore

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I think that's just you know

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and I'm gonna be honest ActDeft

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I like Kirby but do I like

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Kirby enough to drop that money on it

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I kinda just need to hear some of the feedback

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
first and see if it's something that

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I really think is gonna be up my alley before I drop

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
the 30 bucks on it

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
well if something I have been watching

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
and reading reviews it's getting a lot of positive

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
reviews that's good

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
it's one of

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
and even some of my friends

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
that aren't

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
into Kirby

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
are really liking it right now

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
so that's something

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I just

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I'm waiting even to

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
just do all art to finish so I can play it

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
alright

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
then we're gonna let you go so we can wrap it up

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
ActDeft

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
alright take care my friend

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
thanks for having me

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
alright good call

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I don't really see the

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
phones lighting up and we're well after

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
9 o'clock here on the west coast I think we are going

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
to shut things down here

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
at Orange Lounge Radio but I do wanna

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
thank all you guys for listening again this

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
week really appreciate it I know it was a bit of a shorter

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
show for those of you guys on the podcast feed but again

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
remember there was a big hour

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
15 minute chunk that we lost there while we were

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
watching the press conference

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
as I'm sure a lot of you were

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
over the weekend but we will be back

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
next excuse me

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
we will be back next

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
week to do a full recap of

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
E3 to talk about our

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
impressions of what we do see from Microsoft

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Sony, Nintendo

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
who else still has to go? Ubisoft

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
got one to go, PC

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Conference which again I'm not

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
expecting much out of but you never know

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
yeah let me see what we got on the list here real fast

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I feel like I'm missing somebody

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
does Square have a conference? No they already

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
they did like their stream already

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
yeah they dropped their hints already

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
let's see here so there is

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
god dammit

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
tomorrow ok here we go here we go

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
so we've got

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
ok so EA and Bethesda have already gone

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
yep apparently also

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
in just a few minutes

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
there's also one from Kadokawa

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I have no idea what that is that's in

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
20 minutes actually from now

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
tomorrow's Microsoft then PC Gaming

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Ubisoft and then Sony

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and then Nintendo has their stream

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
on Tuesday so really it's all

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
they're blowing their load tomorrow

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
well that's typical though for E3 week

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
so they

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
usually stretch out their conferences like multiple

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
days though like you'd have like EA and stuff

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
normally well only because

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
usually after Nintendo is Square Enix

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
but for some reason and last year actually

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
didn't somebody feel like there were two people

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
kind of in that slot last year so

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I think that was lost a little bit this year

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
oh it was the PC thing

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
because with having

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
EA bump up a day I think that really shifted

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
things so it

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
does feel a little different this year it's going to be very different E3

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
but I'm excited to hear from some of the folks

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
who are at the show I'm hoping we can get some of our other

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
VoG people who actually went to the show

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
maybe on the show next week to talk about it a little bit

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and then of course

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
we'll give our own perspective and we can't wait to hear

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
what you guys have to say let's hope for some good

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
surprises we'll have fun

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
as I end every episode

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
of Orange on Tradio thank you guys so much for tuning into

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
the show and if you enjoyed what you heard here

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
please tell a friend or two about the show

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
spread the word leave a nice 5 star

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
review wherever you found this show because we are

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't put

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
those voices out there unless we

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
have them and you know I think

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
one thing we've definitely learned tonight perspective

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
and hearing from other people

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
can definitely be helpful

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I think we can all learn from that so we want

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
we want more of your voices out there to be

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
participating with our show so

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
let's go around now and give everybody's

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
final thought Loki

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I can't wait to see

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
what they've got in store for

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Microsoft and Sony

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Microsoft a lot of it's been kind of

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
spoiled but

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
so interested

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
to find out what they have

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I'm curious to see what the

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I'm assuming they're all going to be quiet about it

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I kind of want to know what's going on with these new systems

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
it means why are you keeping us in the dark about

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
this shit do you not know what the fuck

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
is going in them because it seems like

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
even with like the NX I heard rumors

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
that they're like not manufacturing yet because they

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
may add VR to it it's like they don't even know what

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
the fuck is going to be going in those systems yet

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
why do we

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
need them if you don't know what they're for

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I don't know

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
my final thought is the fall is

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
looking almost as interesting as the summer

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
at this point with what we were talking about at the beginning of the show

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I'm very curious

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
to see what happens in the

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
fall and where all this stuff lands with these

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
announcements we haven't had quite yet

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
but dear god please don't let

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Mass Effect get delayed again unless

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
unless they really really need it to make it a

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
good game and I'll understand but I just

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I really want that game out oh my god

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
and last but not least Dark Soccer your final thought

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
well two things but they're related and

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
kind of a downer okay

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I was reading a post about

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
cops going through

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Pulse and hearing

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
phones ringing for people who wouldn't answer them

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
yeah awful and then I just

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
saw a post one of my friends posted

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
one from a lady who was trying to find her

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
son who was there and hadn't heard from

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
him in hours she

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
he's alive in critical condition

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
but he's alive

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
