27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
30000	32000	And Rob Roberts
32000	37000	Hi my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	48000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live with this tonight, episode number 647 for this June the 26th of 2016.
48000	54000	I gotta say, usually every week I listen to Jason's intro just so I have an idea, kind of like what's leading into the show.
54000	59000	This week I didn't so that is actually really, for some reason I just didn't listen to it this week.
59000	62000	And that was actually a nice surprise. Thank you Jason.
62000	70000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining you guys here as we have every week for the past 14 years since June 23rd, 2002.
70000	74000	Back then we used to talk about everything that was going on with music gaming.
74000	81000	Things like Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania, Parappa the Rappa, Bust a Move or Groove depending on what side of the pond you were on.
81000	89000	And all those types of things and then here we are all these years later as video game fans talking about the thing that we really love, video games.
89000	96000	And we used to, after we would play DDR at the arcade, we'd go to the, I've told this story like 500 times in the past year but I'm gonna tell it again.
96000	98000	It's because you're old and that's what they do.
98000	103000	Hey, you be quiet until I introduce you. After 14 years you should know the rules by now.
103000	105000	And I'll get off your lawn, that's fine.
106000	115000	So we would go to the cafe that was in the parking lot and we would eat and sit around and talk smack about DDR games in general.
115000	118000	And that's what we'd like to do here on our show that we've created.
118000	127000	And here we are 14 years later, me, Rob Roberts on Twitter at SkySKIE and joining me by my side for these 14 years.
127000	129000	My longest relationship ever with a woman.
129000	132000	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
132000	133000	Hey.
133000	134000	How are you?
134000	136000	I'm full of roughage.
136000	137000	Yeah?
137000	140000	Yes, I had my usual subway stop.
140000	145000	Yeah, where they actually know you now. It's like the Cheers bar, right? But you come through the door.
145000	146000	She asks about my cosplay.
146000	147000	Does she? That's great.
147000	148000	Yeah.
149000	153000	That's awesome. How is your cosplay? You're working on something for Gamer X, right?
153000	157000	It is, but it's also coming along kind of slowly.
157000	162000	And I'm gonna be pulling a Jiggly Caliente with the corset.
164000	166000	Sometimes you gotta do whatever you gotta do to make it work.
166000	170000	Yeah, just if you don't know the reference, just look it up.
170000	182000	Thank you very much. I have not loaded up Steam yet, but I know you let me know that it is not only the 14 year, but as Jason said in the intro, it does happen to be my actual birthday today.
182000	192000	And you actually on Steam bought me a Steam controller, which is awesome because I can't wait to check that out and see if I really can play Civ on the TV with one of those.
192000	196000	And then you bought me Shower with Your Dad Simulator, right?
196000	198000	Yeah, because you're worth 69 cents.
199000	202000	I'm worth 69 cents, which is funny for that game.
202000	208000	No, I laughed my ass off. I saw my buddy Derek playing that when we were visiting him when we went to the Ingress thing in Tucson.
208000	212000	So yeah, that game looks hilarious. I put it on my wish list.
212000	217000	And Jamie is making the Shower with Your Dad wishes come true. Thank you. I appreciate that.
217000	218000	Enjoy!
220000	221000	All right.
221000	224000	You should fetch the goodies while you introduce the others.
224000	229000	Oh yes, and you brought some goodies to the show tonight. You guys are spoiling me tonight.
229000	232000	Well, they're also for the anniversary show.
232000	235000	I have to share a birthday with my baby.
235000	237000	It's like having your birthday on Easter.
237000	239000	And it's like having a baby in a throuple.
240000	242000	I'm gonna go get the cupcakes now.
242000	246000	So say hello to our third over there, Techmaster Loki.
246000	247000	Hello.
247000	248000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
248000	249000	I'm doing fine.
249000	252000	Let Shane take your usual spot on the show.
252000	256000	That shit gets really hot. And it's summer, so that's why I'm sitting on this show.
256000	259000	Hey, you can't talk to me until you introduce me.
259000	264000	Be quiet. I can talk about you. I just don't want to hear you speak as long as possible.
264000	266000	Where you're sitting now is right by the AC vent.
266000	273000	Yeah, that's also. But yeah, it's basically that couch, whereas it is comfortable, it is also very warm.
273000	277000	And so, this is not the weather for me to sit on that couch.
277000	279000	It's just like, ah, it's too bad.
279000	282000	That couch used to be mine, and I can attest to this.
282000	286000	This is one of the first triple degree days we've had in SAC in a while, too, right?
286000	288000	A couple weeks.
288000	294000	We did in May, and then it got cooler again, and then it didn't.
294000	296000	I forgot. Can you blame me?
296000	297000	So, cupcakes.
297000	305000	Okay, so live joining us in chat since I want to introduce these guys every week in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
305000	310000	because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
310000	314000	Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
314000	320000	We do have a live chat room where the question is being asked by William Murderface,
320000	322000	the fuck is a throuple?
322000	325000	That's a relationship between three people.
325000	329000	I know it's not something you hear about every day, but it's when three people are-
329000	330000	It's like a couple.
330000	331000	It's a couple, but there's three.
331000	332000	There's three.
332000	335000	Derek Barry, Nebraska Thunderfuck, and that other guy.
335000	341000	It's like if three people throw up at the same time, they throuple.
341000	343000	I suppose, I suppose.
343000	348000	So, in a way, we're a throuple, but it's not that kind of throuple.
348000	353000	It's a platonic throuple is what we have here at Orange Lounge Radio
353000	356000	because I've joked that this show is our baby that we've had in a throuple,
356000	358000	and our baby's turning 14 years old today.
358000	361000	Old enough to be obnoxious and going through puberty.
361000	365000	No, no, they can start doing- well, the puberty part, yes.
365000	367000	They can drive in Mississippi.
367000	370000	They can be obnoxious far before that.
370000	373000	But, old enough to mow the goddamn lawn.
373000	377000	And old enough to complain and not do it anyways.
377000	380000	Hey, Loki, by the way, I want to say a big thank you.
380000	383000	You guys are giving me a present today.
383000	385000	Loki got me on PlayStation 4.
385000	388000	He actually bought me a copy of Fallout 4
388000	392000	because my copy that I had on Xbox One mysteriously vanished
392000	394000	after I only had it for a week, which was a bummer,
394000	397000	but I suppose I didn't really deserve it.
397000	401000	So, Loki actually got me a copy of Fallout 4 on PlayStation 4, which is awesome.
401000	404000	Alan will be very happy to hear that because he's been trying to get me to play that.
404000	407000	And hey, the mod should be starting anytime soon, so we'll have mods.
407000	411000	And also, he handed this to me and said,
411000	415000	Now you don't have a fucking excuse. He gave me a copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 4.
415000	417000	You gotta play it. It's awesome.
417000	422000	I will check it out. I'm excited to check out all the souped-up graphics and all that stuff.
422000	426000	I'm going to chat again for some more comments.
426000	428000	Misty in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
428000	432000	I think I prefer triad, but I'm also more used to hearing it.
432000	439000	Oh, I guess I didn't know it was one of those things like soda and pop and just calling it coke.
439000	441000	I didn't know it was one of those things where it had different names.
441000	442000	Some people just say threesome.
442000	445000	Yeah, I guess so. I'd always heard throuple.
445000	448000	Some people say Friday nights.
448000	454000	Anyhow, as if it's any surprise at this point, also joining us tonight is Shane.
454000	457000	There is filling in the middle of this cupcake.
457000	458000	Is there really?
458000	459000	Yeah.
459000	464000	Now, you know how fucking unprofessional it is to eat while you're trying to talk on air because people don't want to hear that.
464000	465000	I'm just saying.
465000	468000	Bitch, this is us. Professionalism is nothing.
468000	472000	I'll take the microphone into the bathroom if I need to.
472000	480000	Please don't. Which, by the way, speaking of professionalism on broadcasting, congrats on Ranger Pride.
480000	482000	I know you guys have been doing very well over there with your show.
482000	484000	Thank you. We didn't have a show this week.
484000	486000	When you bothered to show up, you did very well.
486000	490000	Okay, so one week I was traveling and then this week we didn't have it.
490000	493000	And we're coming back next week just fine.
494000	498000	It's funny because if you look at the schedule for guys on the show, it's been really, really bad lately.
498000	499000	Yeah, I know.
499000	501000	If you guys didn't know, Xtra had shingles.
501000	504000	And he posted about that on Twitter, so it's not like it's private or anything.
504000	507000	But yeah, so that's why we've been out for a couple weeks.
507000	510000	That's always a distinct possibility of me because I have never had chicken buns.
510000	511000	Oh my god.
511000	512000	Same.
512000	514000	But you know what? I'm fucking immune.
514000	516000	Let's hope. Let's hope.
516000	518000	I'm too afraid. I've never had it either.
518000	521000	I thought there was a point where if you don't get it by a certain age, you're not going to get it.
521000	522000	No, it just gets worse.
522000	523000	It works.
523000	524000	Oh shit.
524000	525000	No, not necessarily.
525000	529000	Because my uncle had chicken pox when he was a kid and he had shingles as an adult.
529000	534000	And then on top of that though, I think they do have, well I know they have basically,
534000	537000	you can get a couple shots and then be immune to chicken pox.
537000	540000	But fuck that. I ain't getting any more shots.
540000	543000	I am just going to play my odds.
543000	551000	Okay, and I do want to respond to something in chat because my little comment about soda and pop and coke from earlier is now going on in chat.
551000	554000	And I want to make this clear. Don't ever call it pop in front of me.
554000	557000	Yeah, that is a sound. That's not a drink.
557000	559000	Yeah, that's what bubblegum does.
559000	562000	And when you say pop, yeah, exactly. That's what I think of.
562000	564000	Well, gum is nasty anyway.
564000	566000	I have the same reaction. So don't call it pop around me.
566000	572000	It's soda or it's coke or it's fizzy drink. I don't care. Just don't call it P-O-P.
572000	574000	Because I think that's P-O-O-P.
575000	577000	I've just learned to be specific.
577000	582000	Now in Alabama, everything is a fucking coke. It's a southern thing.
582000	584000	Everything is a coke.
584000	585000	I'd like a coke.
585000	588000	Alright, well you have this, this, and this.
588000	590000	I said I wanted a coke.
590000	592000	So anyway.
592000	596000	But I have preferred just saying, may I have a non-caffeinated cola?
596000	601000	If I want a non-caffeinated cola beverage.
601000	606000	Being from California for, you know, the beginning of my life and then moving to Kansas.
606000	611000	They called it pop there and I always called it soda and I would correct them every single time.
611000	613000	The entire time I lived there.
613000	614000	You're doing the Lord's work.
614000	616000	I know. I was.
616000	617000	Thank you.
617000	618000	You're welcome.
618000	619000	Alright.
619000	620000	Specifically for you.
620000	626000	And to answer Slag Kick's question, I do not call all sodas cokes. I quit that habit really quickly because it annoyed me.
626000	627000	I'm a very specific person.
627000	631000	I hate having to go to restaurants and you get that awkward, yeah I'd like a coke, oh we have Pepsi.
631000	634000	So I always have to go, I'd like a coke or a Pepsi.
634000	636000	Just your cola beverage please.
636000	638000	Yeah, I think her idea of doing cola actually works really well.
638000	640000	That's what I do. May I have a cola beverage?
640000	641000	Yeah.
641000	647000	Which instantly crosses out Dr. Pepper, root beer, and any of the clear beverages.
647000	650000	Now one of these days I hope I actually get asked.
650000	654000	If I say I want a cola, I hope somebody says, does that mean you want RC Cola?
654000	656000	Because I'll be like, fuck yeah.
656000	659000	But I have yet to ever find a restaurant that has RC Cola.
659000	660000	You've never heard of RC Cola?
660000	662000	No one's gonna have RC Cola on tap.
662000	663000	I beg to differ.
663000	665000	I can fucking dream, thank you very much.
665000	667000	I found RC Cola on tap.
667000	670000	If you say cola, why would that exclude like Dr. Pepper?
670000	672000	Because Dr. Pepper is technically not considered a cola.
672000	673000	What is it?
673000	683000	It's a soda, but they could not, it actually was a legal reason that they could not call it a cola to prevent some type of competition thing with Coca Cola.
683000	684000	Here's the other with you.
684000	690000	When I lived in Chico, um, when I went to school up there, which is, Chico's a town that's like two hours north of here, that's a big college town.
690000	696000	They didn't have Dr. Pepper like anywhere, it was all Dr. Thunder, which I thought was so weird, and I never understood that.
696000	698000	That, isn't that like the Walmart brand?
698000	699000	You would think?
699000	702000	It is like, it's like a knockoff brand or something.
702000	703000	Is it like Mr. Pibb?
703000	705000	I may actually have the name wrong, but it was Dr. Something Else.
705000	707000	Mr. Pibb, Dr. Pepper is, you know.
707000	708000	Mr. Pibb was okay, but-
708000	709000	I like Mr. Pibb.
709000	712000	He didn't go to, he didn't get his doctor and he's just Mr. Pibb.
712000	716000	Even though this stuff tastes like shit, I go nuts when I find Tab.
716000	723000	Because the cans have never changed since like the 70s, and I'm like, I'm drinking history.
723000	730000	I think college towns have some weird like, contract with places like that, because like you said, they didn't have Dr. Pepper, they had Dr. Thunder.
730000	736000	My college town had Mr. Pibb, and Dr. Pepper was nowhere to be found in that town.
737000	741000	I will point out, they're talking, again, I'm like, why are we talking about soda on our video game show?
741000	744000	But I suppose, well, you know, when you play games, you do drink a lot of soda, so everybody has an opinion on this.
744000	749000	Or if you're up until nine in the morning sharing friend codes, and you have to stay awake for the rest of the day.
749000	750000	Like your night last night?
750000	753000	But Pepsi is still far superior anyway.
753000	755000	So in chat, they're talking about this whole Coke thing.
755000	761000	I do want to point out, I did find the one place in Atlanta that didn't have Coke, and that had Pepsi instead of Coke.
761000	764000	And I gotta say, like, because I actually prefer Pepsi to Coke.
764000	765000	Was it an Oasis in the desert?
765000	767000	It was the Hard Rock Cafe, believe it or not.
767000	770000	It has Pepsi and not Coke. And I was floored.
770000	776000	I tend to like Pepsi more, but when you get some of these places that have the perfect ratio of syrup and the carbonated water.
776000	779000	Like I went to this Mizuki sushi place by my house.
779000	782000	Holy crap, that soda was fucking awesome.
782000	785000	It was just the perfect amount of syrup in there.
785000	788000	It's just, give me more of that. I don't care what it is, just keep giving it to me.
788000	790000	Bobby said they burned that place to the ground.
791000	796000	Here's the weird thing. I like Pepsi, but if I go diet, I way prefer Coke Zero.
796000	804000	See, Misty's got it right. I loved back when I was visiting Alabama, I could find Cheerwine at the grocery store, and it made me happy.
804000	810000	And now, thankfully, the BevMo or something near my house gets Diet Cheerwine in.
810000	815000	But I can't drink it because of the caffeine. It is very caffeinated.
816000	820000	I miss caffeine so freaking much.
820000	824000	And Dungeon Buster, trying to bring it back to game, says the best cola is Nuka Cola.
824000	830000	Let's see, also our pals, Slagkick from Gamebooey.org, joining us in chat tonight.
830000	831000	Hi, Slagkick.
831000	835000	I hear on this week's show, they're going to have a discussion about Mighty No. 9.
835000	838000	Because, you know, that game has been getting a lot of flack on the interwebs.
838000	844000	But my understanding is that Captain Spike over on that show actually says it is not that bad and y'all need to shut up.
844000	848000	So that'll be on Gamebooey.org this week, so stay tuned for that on Tuesday.
848000	853000	But Slagkick, Dr. Slagkick, I suppose, because he's found the answer here.
853000	859000	Dr. Pepper was a frequent player in the 1990s antitrust history of the United States.
859000	868000	As a part of these activities, economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that Dr. Pepper is a pepper-flavored drink and not a cola.
868000	871000	Pepper does not taste like pepper.
871000	873000	That is stupid.
874000	875000	I like Dr. Pepper, though.
875000	878000	I never found a pepper that tasted like that.
878000	879000	No.
879000	880000	Whatever.
880000	887000	All right, anyhow, so it is our 14-year anniversary show, so, you know, this is crazy.
887000	894000	As of June 23rd, 2002 was our very first episode, and now here we are 14 years later.
894000	899000	You know, you kind of hit a point, just like you do with your regular birthdays, because today happens to be my actual birthday.
899000	903000	And I would say everything after 21 was just kind of, eh, right?
903000	908000	Kind of like after 21, it's like, oh, hey, it's my birthday, eh, you know, big deal.
908000	915000	And I think we're kind of getting to that point with the podcast, but it's so awesome that you guys have been supporting us for all these years.
915000	923000	And I think if nothing else, this is a chance for us to kind of step back and just be like, oh, my gosh, like, you know, we've done this for so long,
923000	928000	and it's because of the support of you guys out there and the awesome community that we have.
928000	934000	You know, we don't have the largest community. We're not the most listened to video game podcast, that's for sure, by any means.
934000	943000	But we have, I would argue, the most loyal, if not one of the most loyal podcasts, followings out there.
943000	948000	And so I just, I really appreciate you guys that do turn out for the show and listen.
948000	953000	It's funny because once in a while somebody will tell me, oh, OLR, gosh, I haven't listened to that in years.
953000	957000	I need to come back and listen to that again or something, so, but I'm still always like, they told it.
957000	961000	We just need to start serving beer and wine like Barnes and Noble and then we'll bring them back.
961000	969000	What a genius idea, right? Hey, Jamie, let's go get drunk and read. Doesn't that sound like fun?
969000	977000	That sounds like tons of fun. It's like, go wild, you know, move into the philosophy section.
977000	980000	I'm going to drink until Twilight's good.
980000	983000	I don't think there's enough liquor in the back.
983000	988000	Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says, not to mention all the podcasts you guys have influenced too.
988000	994000	That is honestly the most ultimate compliment I think the show can get.
994000	999000	Is that, you know, you influenced me to do my own gaming podcast or whatever it is.
999000	1003000	That's always like the most awesome compliment we can get.
1003000	1008000	Or when we inspire our loud friend who interrupts people to do a Power Rangers podcast.
1008000	1011000	That's always very, I'm just messing with you.
1011000	1012000	Whatever.
1012000	1017000	So William Cranston, you know, what do you think? I don't really see him as Zoran, but whatever.
1017000	1022000	Oh, um, what's his real name? I forgot.
1022000	1023000	Brian Cranston.
1023000	1024000	Brian, yeah.
1024000	1025000	Not William, William.
1025000	1031000	We'll talk about it this week on our show, but I am fine. I mean, who saw Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa?
1031000	1038000	But I love Elizabeth Banks, so she's just the right amount of crazy and loud.
1039000	1044000	It's just the, the costumes just don't look right.
1044000	1051000	In the pictures we've seen from the set, the Red Ranger suit actually looks good.
1051000	1055000	The pictures that they've shown, like publicity stills, I don't like those ones.
1055000	1064000	But I think once we see it in real action and not these like over, I don't know, over digitally enhanced pictures.
1064000	1067000	I think a lot of people's opinions will change.
1067000	1073000	I feel like I'm going to get dragged to see the Power Rangers movie by somebody who show her name nameless.
1073000	1077000	And so I'll end up having to see it even though I know like next to nothing about it.
1077000	1080000	I mean, like it sounds interesting. I just, you know, I don't know.
1080000	1086000	I've never seen some of the Power Ranger movies in theaters, which I don't know why, because I didn't really like Power Rangers.
1086000	1088000	But somehow I did watch them in theaters.
1088000	1093000	I never saw the second one to this day. I haven't seen the second movie, but I saw the first one in theaters.
1093000	1094000	I liked it when I was a kid.
1094000	1096000	I saw it in a theater.
1096000	1102000	Ragenator in chat says, just to think, in a few years, you three will hear fans that can say,
1102000	1107000	Hey, I started listening to you when I started kindergarten. Now I'm married with children.
1107000	1111000	You realize we're kind of already getting those emails, except it's like junior high school and now I'm married.
1111000	1115000	And I'm always like, wow, I feel so old right now.
1115000	1118000	But no, it is really flattering when we get emails like that.
1118000	1120000	I'm very thankful for that.
1120000	1125000	But it's just like, wow, this really has been going on for a very long time.
1125000	1131000	Before we get into our gaming weeks and news and all that, Shane, I know you are a really, really big fan of Pokemon.
1131000	1139000	In fact, I almost feel like I should call Annie's intervention because you actually showed me this spreadsheet that you put together for all the Pokemon.
1139000	1141000	Well, I need it. I need it. It's important.
1141000	1146000	Okay. Can you explain why you need a spreadsheet for Pokemon and what it's doing for you?
1146000	1148000	I don't see why this isn't just part of our gaming weeks.
1148000	1150000	Because it falls under gaming.
1150000	1152000	Well, whatever.
1152000	1155000	I'll talk about this, but I'll probably talk about it when we get to our gaming weeks anyway.
1155000	1162000	So I made a spreadsheet because I need to know which Pokemon I need technically for what they call a living dex.
1162000	1169000	Which means you actually, and I'm using quote marks here, physically have that Pokemon in your bank or your boxes.
1169000	1175000	And then on that same spreadsheet, I'm marking off which ones I have shinies for also.
1175000	1184000	So I've got some functions because I'm using Google Docs and keeping track of everything that way.
1184000	1191000	And I've got color coding and it's super awesome. And I don't know why we're talking about it now.
1191000	1194000	Fine. We'll talk about the shiny collecting and all that later when we get to gaming weeks.
1194000	1198000	But in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com, Slidekick says,
1198000	1202000	Shane and I should do a Pokecast. Hmm.
1202000	1208000	There is talk in my head already about something like that.
1208000	1211000	What do you guys think? Do you think Shane should have his own show about Pokemon?
1211000	1213000	Even though he already has one about Power Rangers?
1213000	1216000	That sometimes turns into Pokemon.
1216000	1218000	Because me and Spike both love Pokemon.
1218000	1221000	You should do the ultimate crossover of PokeRangers.
1221000	1227000	Our topic for this week's episode has to do with Pokemon and Power Rangers together.
1227000	1229000	So it kind of works out that way.
1229000	1232000	One of these days, I swear, we all need to end up in the same room.
1232000	1243000	All of us folks at VoG and we're going to do that super show that's like the orange PokeRanger blackwolf buoy.org sistahood show or something.
1243000	1246000	It'll be a lot of fun.
1246000	1253000	Anyway, also in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com, some folks wanting a copy of this spreadsheet that you're putting together.
1253000	1256000	Misty says, dude, Shane, can I have a copy?
1256000	1261000	Yeah, I can. I can send it over. Rob can collect all of the like emails and I can just...
1261000	1265000	Did you think that maybe this tool, this spreadsheet already existed out there before you actually...
1265000	1271000	Well, it probably does. I mean, it's pretty simple. Just make a spreadsheet.
1271000	1277000	It's not fancy. I mean, besides the random functions I have on there and it's like two of them.
1277000	1282000	TarZXF. I know that guy. I can't believe he's listening tonight. How you doing?
1282000	1290000	TarZXF has known me a very, very long time, you guys. He's known me probably longer than anybody else.
1290000	1296000	It says in chat, can the show be named Pokey Whatever?
1296000	1303000	No, because when it's something I care about, I'm super excited to talk about it.
1303000	1310000	Alright, let's get into the types of video games that we've been playing this week because I know Shane wants to talk more about shiny collecting.
1310000	1316000	But I'm going to make them wait. As we do, how is your gaming week starting with Dark Soccer? What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
1316000	1324000	I finally picked up Stardew Valley. Haven't played it yet. I also just picked up Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
1324000	1326000	Such a good game.
1326000	1328000	I watched Rob finish it.
1328000	1329000	That game's great.
1329000	1330000	I also...
1330000	1332000	Did you already have the ending spoiled? Oh no.
1332000	1333000	Yeah, it's fine.
1333000	1335000	Go to the rapture.
1335000	1337000	Stop it.
1337000	1347000	I also picked up... I think it's Forbidden Planet that looks a lot like a Sonic clone. So it already is really pretty.
1347000	1349000	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen that one.
1349000	1361000	So as for stuff I've actually played, I broke out Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer again so that I could design a house for...
1361000	1369000	Who did I do? Oh, I did one for Catan and his entire freaking family.
1369000	1377000	And then I did... What else did I play? I'm actually way behind on Danganronpa 2.
1377000	1378000	Oh my gosh.
1378000	1380000	I know I need to play some more but I couldn't.
1380000	1382000	I want to talk about themes.
1382000	1385000	Well, I already have had a lot spoiled for me so it's okay.
1386000	1394000	I've been playing World of Warcraft. I hit 100. That's about it.
1394000	1399000	Jamie's really trying to tempt me to roll on World of Warcraft again just so y'all know.
1399000	1403000	I need someone to play with. Remember all the adventures?
1403000	1405000	But now I have Shower with your dad to play.
1405000	1407000	But remember all of the adventures?
1407000	1409000	It was fun. It was good.
1409000	1413000	And Sakurina's a decent enough level. She could play with sassy pants.
1413000	1415000	I'm playing for two MMOs though.
1415000	1421000	But like I mentioned before the show, it's inevitable I'm going to pony up for that expansion anyway.
1421000	1424000	So it's going to happen. It's just a matter of when.
1426000	1429000	Let's see. Going to chat. I'm sorry. I love this comment too much.
1429000	1433000	Back to the Pokemon podcast and what Shane would call it if he hosts it.
1433000	1436000	ActDeafTryingToOneUp, Tarzxf's name says,
1436000	1439000	It can be called Poke-meh.
1439000	1443000	Again, if it's something I care about, I actually am excited to talk about it.
1443000	1446000	Okay, but you're smiling because you know that name is good.
1446000	1450000	No. No it is not. Because that would not be how the podcast would go.
1450000	1456000	Because it would be super fun. Because all I do is talk about Pokemon with other people who just want to talk about Pokemon.
1456000	1460000	You guys don't even know. Like, real life is like this.
1460000	1463000	You guys might think Shane is putting on a face for this show, but no.
1463000	1466000	Real life is like this. Like I might call Shane to be like,
1466000	1471000	Oh Shane, we should meet up for lunch today and go to this place or whatever.
1471000	1477000	He's like, okay, but did you play Pokemon? Because I was playing Pokemon for four hours last night and I caught this new shiny.
1477000	1482000	And do you want a new shiny? Because I have like five copies of this shiny because the one I want is not showing up.
1482000	1486000	And all of a sudden it's like, what happened to lunch plans?
1486000	1488000	Well, we would have talked right through it.
1488000	1492000	And then we meet up for lunch. Oh, while I was driving over here I caught another shiny.
1492000	1495000	What are you doing playing your DS while driving? I need a shiny.
1495000	1497000	Yeah, that is basically how it goes.
1499000	1501000	Logie, how was your gaming week?
1501000	1505000	This week I mainly played South Park, The Sick of Truth.
1505000	1512000	Because I got that as part of the digital pre-order for South Park, The Fractured But Whole.
1512000	1519000	So, that game is so awesome. Like, I never really played through much of it when I had it on Xbox.
1519000	1522000	But I'm pretty much at the end of the game now, I think.
1522000	1529000	I was playing as a Jew character, which really, to be honest, they're all the same except for the different abilities that you get, the special abilities.
1529000	1534000	But, I mean, it's basically all the same. They need the characters you roll.
1534000	1540000	And so, yeah, I like all the twists in there. Like, kind of some of the spoilers in there.
1540000	1549000	There's a scene in there where you're fighting the underpants gnomes, while shrinking down, under your parents having sex above you.
1549000	1558000	And so you see your mom's floppy titties bouncing around, and you have to do a quick time event dodge of your dad's testicles.
1558000	1564000	And there's a portion of the game where you have to give Randy Marsh an abortion.
1564000	1572000	And the music that they have, they have that, it's Christmas time, you know that song.
1572000	1576000	The game is so fucking hilarious. It's just such a great game.
1576000	1579000	If you have a mind that is hellbound.
1579000	1587000	No, seriously, if you like software, and if you want to get it now, I mean, if you want to pre-order the new game, you get it for free as a pre-order, and you can download it immediately.
1587000	1591000	So that's what I did for the PlayStation 4, because I know I want to play the new game when it comes out.
1591000	1594000	And that's a digital only thing, right?
1594000	1595000	That's digital only, yeah.
1595000	1600000	And see, that is a clever way to get people to buy it digitally.
1600000	1610000	To be honest, it's weird. I was so against digital only stuff, and most of the things now I buy from my PlayStation 4 are digital.
1610000	1613000	I hardly, the last game I bought physical was Fallout.
1613000	1618000	And that was just because, I don't remember why it was, it was because of something.
1618000	1621000	Because I didn't want to wait for it to download or something like that.
1621000	1627000	And so I actually went and bought it physical, but everything else has been just digital content.
1627000	1630000	So, I don't know. I'm on board with that.
1630000	1633000	What else was I going to say?
1633000	1639000	Yeah, if you want to pick it up now, because I also picked it up on Steam, because it's eight bucks right now.
1639000	1643000	So I can go, you know, my wife watches TV a lot, and so I can play through it again.
1643000	1647000	Because it is a game, it's not very long, but it's something you'd want to play it through multiple times.
1647000	1651000	Even though I have pretty much done most of the side quest stuff, it's still that good.
1651000	1654000	It's worth playing multiple times.
1655000	1664000	And then, what else? I think I played a little bit more of the Trials of Blood Dragon.
1664000	1670000	It's okay. It's not as like, you know, with the concept of like it's Trials and Blood Dragon,
1670000	1675000	but the other, that should be like the most amazing game ever, but it's just kind of okay.
1675000	1679000	Which is kind of a let down. You expect a lot more from that combination.
1680000	1684000	The other thing too is, I noticed that Goat Simulator has all its DLC now,
1684000	1687000	and I tried to purchase the DLC because I want to play more Goat Simulator,
1687000	1691000	and it fucking crashes. Like, it'll just lock up trying to download content,
1691000	1695000	because you can only purchase it through the app on the PlayStation Store.
1695000	1700000	Like, I can't find the actual DLC, the purchase separately on the PlayStation Store.
1700000	1708000	So that's poorly set up, but yeah, I've been buying stuff in the Steam sale, and I don't know.
1708000	1712000	Not too much though. I bought South Park The Sacred Truth, Golf With Your Friends,
1712000	1714000	because that looked kind of cool, and I like mini golf games.
1714000	1720000	And then I saw this, someone had posted information about the Learn Japanese To Survive hiragana battle.
1720000	1721000	It's a RPG maker game.
1721000	1725000	I put that on my wish list. I saw that come up in my queue, and I thought that sounded really interesting.
1725000	1727000	It's like two bucks or something, so.
1727000	1730000	And I was like, I think I probably really need that for this show.
1730000	1733000	Yeah, I mean, I think it looks pretty cool. I want to...
1733000	1734000	I'm looking for it right now.
1734000	1741000	I had learned hiragana at one time. I'd like a refresher, because it's been a while since I've been in high school, so.
1741000	1745000	But I've been kind of just trying to avoid buying a lot of things,
1745000	1750000	because I have a lot of games, even now my PlayStation 4 library is starting to look like my Steam library.
1753000	1755000	Stoppy in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,
1755000	1757000	I heard about that, it's on my wish list too.
1757000	1758000	I wonder if they...
1758000	1761000	It seems like some games seem to always show up in people's queues,
1761000	1767000	especially during the Steam sale when people are really encouraged to go through those queues if they want trading cards, so.
1767000	1770000	Yeah, I went through the queues, and unfortunately it's like all these games I'm like,
1770000	1772000	that's not going to run on my computer.
1772000	1777000	Like, Grand Theft Auto is marked down as well. It's like, you know, 35 bucks on Steam.
1777000	1783000	And I'm like, I want it, but I can't run it very well, so I'm going to hold off still.
1783000	1785000	It'll be cheap later on as well.
1785000	1788000	Yeah, it's $2.79, so you might as well pick it up.
1789000	1796000	And honestly, even if you're not into the trading cards at all, just go through your queue anyway, and sell them for like 6 cents every day,
1796000	1802000	and then by the end of the sale, you'll have probably 2 bucks to go buy one of these cheapy games if you want.
1802000	1808000	You can shower with your dad for free, thanks to trading cards. That's what you want to do.
1808000	1813000	Apparently Julian is listening right now for any more Pokémon anything.
1814000	1817000	I will talk more Pokémon all the time.
1817000	1818000	When it's his turn.
1818000	1819000	When it's your turn.
1819000	1824000	We're going to teach Julian a life lesson about waiting your turn, and so Shane's going to wait his turn.
1828000	1829000	Anything else, Loki, for your game?
1829000	1835000	That's it. I've been trying to work on my game. I kind of worked a little bit.
1835000	1839000	I typed some more stuff in my design doc, which is a mess.
1839000	1846000	And then, I want to play more Final Fantasy XI, so I'll probably go back and do some of that this week.
1847000	1850000	Slidekick in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
1850000	1854000	Loki can buy things from my PlayStation 4 library if he's running out of disc space.
1854000	1858000	No, I'm not running out of disc space at all, because I'm just buying games.
1858000	1865000	Like, I bought, I want to say Dragon Age Inquisition, because it was down to like 5, 10 dollars.
1865000	1866000	It's amazing.
1866000	1871000	And I bought Need for Speed, the newest one.
1871000	1877000	And I was like, okay, I like those games. I'm probably not going to get around to playing them anytime soon.
1877000	1879000	So, I have a lot of that stuff.
1879000	1881000	I almost bought Mad Max. I'm like, ooh, Mad Max.
1881000	1884000	I'm like, no, I can't buy this. I'm not going to play this.
1884000	1887000	Speaking of having like way more space than you know what to do with it,
1887000	1893000	did I tell you guys I bought a 3 terabyte drive for my main PC, because I was starting to run out of room on one of my drives.
1893000	1898000	And I was like, I don't want to keep uninstalling Steam games, so I'm going to just buy a 3 terabyte drive.
1898000	1900000	Which even, that isn't even as big as they make them.
1900000	1905000	That was like as big as I could get it without it, while it's still kind of like a reasonable price.
1905000	1907000	I'm just giving you the knowing look.
1907000	1909000	Because I just did this, what, a month ago?
1909000	1914000	Put in another terabyte drive, just to accommodate my games.
1914000	1920000	Yeah, no, I nickel into, no, I'm just getting a 3 terabyte drive, and I don't have to worry about this again until like the year 2024.
1920000	1925000	Oh, I've got a 3 terabyte drive hooked up to my computer with all that.
1925000	1929000	Yeah, so trust me, I feel you on the space thing. It eats up the room.
1929000	1932000	Let's have another old person moment for a moment.
1932000	1943000	Remember back, my first PC that I had in junior high school, which I used to connect to Prodigy, which was like my first experience on the internet.
1943000	1945000	We used to call it Buttigy.
1945000	1946000	What's a Prodigy?
1946000	1949000	Oh my god, no, you're not going to play this whole I'm too young to remember this stuff.
1949000	1950000	No, I seriously don't know what that is.
1950000	1952000	Okay, Prodigy, do you remember America Online?
1952000	1954000	Well, yeah, because it had all the disks.
1954000	1959000	Okay, Prodigy was kind of like that, but I think Prodigy was a Sears venture or something.
1959000	1964000	But one of the things that made it very unique is it has a very graphical interface to it.
1964000	1966000	And that's kind of what made it very...
1966000	1967000	So did AOL.
1967000	1973000	Well, Prodigy to me felt like a little bit like what the web was before there was the web.
1973000	1978000	Because Prodigy had like livestock information, if that's what you wanted.
1978000	1981000	It had news updates, it had forums that you could go.
1981000	1986000	But I used to get game tips for Nintendo games on Prodigy. I shit you not.
1986000	1989000	So that was... I know there's people in...
1989000	1993000	Like if anybody else, Bobby Black Wolf is going to know what I'm talking about.
1993000	1995000	Because he's 29 like me.
1995000	1997000	And Bobby, yep, thank you.
1997000	2000000	Bobby actually says Prodigy predated AOL.
2000000	2002000	It started in 1988.
2002000	2006000	My family was a founding member and it gives us Prodigy code.
2006000	2008000	And yes, I remember mine as well.
2008000	2010000	And I actually got the B account in my house.
2010000	2013000	Because my mom was like, what's a Prodigy?
2013000	2015000	What's a... It sounds like Buttigy.
2017000	2020000	I just remember that we got charged a lot of money.
2020000	2023000	Because we submitted a joke on their joke forums.
2023000	2024000	And it was stupid.
2024000	2026000	It was like... Because we were like...
2026000	2028000	You know, kids, we were like 7 years old and stuff.
2028000	2031000	We were just like, yeah, we're going to submit a joke.
2031000	2032000	It'll be so stupid.
2032000	2035000	And like I think it caused money or like we were on a...
2035000	2037000	It ended up calling like a long distance line.
2037000	2039000	And so like, it's like, why did we get this?
2039000	2041000	Why is our phone bill like $60?
2041000	2044000	You know, it's like something ridiculous.
2045000	2048000	I got in so much trouble when the internet web came out.
2048000	2050000	And then I was on it like...
2050000	2052000	No, it was the chat rooms on Prodigy.
2052000	2053000	Oh my God.
2053000	2055000	Oh my God, I had so much trouble.
2055000	2057000	I ran out of such a bill on the chat rooms on Prodigy.
2057000	2058000	One month.
2058000	2062000	I think almost all kids our age who are somewhat nerdy and tech-inclined
2062000	2065000	has a story about getting in trouble.
2065000	2069000	I remember the first BBS that actually had like a link to the internet.
2069000	2072000	So you would log into the BBS and you'd be able to launch a browser
2072000	2074000	and it would just be the internet.
2074000	2078000	I was like, sweet, I don't even need AOL for this.
2078000	2085000	I remember begging and pleading my mother to call a long distance number
2085000	2090000	in the Bay Area so I could connect to the official Sierra BBS
2090000	2094000	so I could download demos of upcoming Sierra games,
2094000	2099000	which would take a good 10 minutes, 15 minutes over the modem.
2099000	2102000	So it was like you're getting charged for a 15-minute phone call.
2102000	2106000	But I had an account on the official Sierra BBS and those were the days.
2106000	2110000	Man, we're dating ourselves so horribly right now.
2110000	2112000	But the one thing I wanted to say about AOL,
2112000	2121000	I thought Quantum Link on Commodore 64 was AOL.
2121000	2125000	I thought either AOL bought them or Quantum Link turned into AOL.
2125000	2128000	So I always thought Quantum Link was like the first.
2128000	2129000	But anyway.
2129000	2134000	I don't know how AOL existed because they would send off those 38 trials
2134000	2137000	like every few weeks or every week,
2137000	2141000	and they didn't limit you to how many times you could use those.
2141000	2143000	So I don't know.
2143000	2145000	Bobby doesn't say this very often in chat.
2145000	2147000	He says, you were right.
2147000	2150000	Steve Case just took down Quantum Link because AOL was doing so well.
2150000	2152000	The only one to focus on PC.
2152000	2154000	Anyway, the whole reason I went down this rabbit hole on this,
2154000	2158000	like, 10-minute tangent is because the hard drive on my original PC
2158000	2161000	that I ran Prodigy on, 40 megabytes.
2161000	2163000	40 megabytes.
2163000	2170000	When I moved out here, and this was in 98, 99, something like that,
2170000	2173000	Dan had a 20-gigabyte hard drive.
2173000	2178000	I was going to say I had one that was an IBM AT, I think it was 20.
2178000	2179000	Pentium 2.
2179000	2180000	It was slow.
2180000	2185000	I don't know, 286 something that had like a 20-megabyte hard drive
2185000	2188000	that I had SimCity on floppy disks for.
2188000	2192000	An episode of this show, depending on how long it runs,
2192000	2194000	is about 90 megabytes.
2194000	2199000	So like an episode of this show wouldn't even fit on my first computer.
2199000	2203000	Back when OLR first started, you guys may not, because we, you know,
2203000	2206000	the podcast thing was a newer technology that didn't come out until later.
2206000	2209000	We were a live internet show before podcasting was around.
2209000	2213000	And in the beginning of OLR, we were, I'm using my quotey fingers,
2213000	2215000	dial-up-friendly radio.
2215000	2219000	So the quality of the stream was honestly kind of shit,
2219000	2221000	but you could listen to it on a dial-up connection.
2221000	2223000	And that was kind of the cool thing about it.
2223000	2227000	And, you know, for a mostly talk-oriented program,
2227000	2230000	it didn't matter that the quality was kind of garbage.
2230000	2234000	But it's interesting how far we've come, even in these 14 years.
2234000	2239000	I'm laughing because Loki just yawned and his tongue is blue from that Slurpee.
2239000	2241000	That Slurpee was awesome.
2241000	2243000	And yes, it will dye your tongue any color.
2243000	2244000	Sorry.
2244000	2245000	It could be worse.
2245000	2248000	I could have had the Coke Slurpee and then my tongue would be brown.
2248000	2249000	All right.
2249000	2253000	Let me talk about My Gaming Week, because I know Shane's dying to talk about Pokemon.
2253000	2254000	So My Gaming Week.
2254000	2256000	That is not what I'm going to start with, though.
2256000	2257000	Spoilers.
2257000	2260000	Well, honestly, in My Gaming Week, I haven't been playing a lot of new stuff.
2260000	2263000	I've been continuing on Path of Exile, which I've still been having fun with.
2263000	2266000	Even further than I have on any of my other characters,
2266000	2268000	because I actually got all the way to Act 2.
2268000	2270000	So that's something.
2270000	2273000	So, yeah, that's been something I've been enjoying.
2273000	2275000	I actually did a couple live streams this week.
2275000	2277000	I've been bringing back my channel.
2277000	2279000	So please consider subscribing to me on Twitch.
2279000	2280000	I'd super appreciate it.
2280000	2283000	Rob Roberts, all one word, is my name on Twitch.
2283000	2284000	And I did a couple streams this week.
2284000	2289000	I did one with Overwatch, which was fun because the last match...
2289000	2290000	Were you watching that stream, Shane?
2290000	2291000	I don't remember.
2291000	2292000	The last match...
2292000	2293000	Yeah, you were doing bad.
2293000	2295000	Yeah, I was doing really bad. Thank you.
2295000	2298000	I was doing really bad, which it's Overwatch, so of course I was doing bad.
2298000	2302000	But the very last match spontaneously became everybody picked Torbjorn.
2302000	2306000	Because it was me, Alan, and Dominic all playing.
2306000	2308000	And I think I started picking Symmetra.
2308000	2310000	And then Dominic was Torbjorn.
2310000	2315000	Some of the other people we were partied with started picking Torbjorn.
2315000	2317000	And so Dominic was like, everybody picked Torbjorn.
2317000	2318000	So we all did.
2318000	2323000	And so it was like, five of us is Torbjorn versus the other team.
2323000	2325000	And we beat them.
2325000	2327000	And they were like high level players too.
2327000	2330000	Got another shiny right now, just had to interrupt.
2330000	2331000	Shut up!
2331000	2333000	Oh my god, it's another female one.
2333000	2335000	I'm going to break my system.
2335000	2336000	We need to...
2336000	2340000	I think we need to go in, because that was one of the things as I was downloading the update.
2340000	2342000	And I haven't gotten the chance to check it out yet, but that...
2342000	2347000	The battle maps that they have now for Minecraft would be kind of fun for a game night.
2347000	2348000	Oh yeah, that would be fun.
2348000	2353000	Because those are always fun to watch on streamers, like the mods that they have for Hunger Games type stuff.
2353000	2356000	But now it being official would be kind of cool.
2356000	2357000	I just wish it was...
2357000	2360000	The cross platform stuff is still not quite there yet.
2360000	2364000	With Xbox you can do it with PC and stuff, but you can't really do that yet.
2364000	2369000	I think a stream like that would only be fun if it was a bunch of people that had no idea what they were doing in Minecraft.
2369000	2373000	So it would have to be like me, Shane, Jamie, Bobby maybe.
2373000	2375000	I know how to do it.
2375000	2379000	It's not necessarily like we're going to be that great at it.
2379000	2383000	Alright, let's see.
2383000	2391000	And then I played Pac-Man 256 on the stream this week as well, just because that game came out on Steam as well as the consoles.
2391000	2395000	And I liked the mobile version, so I was curious if it was going to be worth the $5.
2395000	2399000	And I would say yeah, it's worth the $5 if you enjoy Pac-Man clones.
2400000	2406000	But it's only worth about $5, because it is kind of like the tablet game kind of just ported to Steam.
2406000	2409000	But they did do some extra things with it, like you have the multiplayer mode.
2409000	2413000	And because you paid the $5, they take all the microtransactions out.
2413000	2418000	So there's no waiting for things, there's no energy bars, you get all the skins.
2418000	2422000	So you kind of get a better value on Steam than you do on mobile.
2422000	2424000	So I would say this.
2424000	2428000	Check out the mobile version just to try the game and see if it's something that's up your alley.
2428000	2430000	And if you like it, just get it on Steam or PS4 or whatever.
2430000	2432000	Dan said he played it for four hours.
2432000	2434000	Pac-Man 256? Really? Wow.
2434000	2437000	Isn't it just like, was it Crossy Roads or something like that?
2437000	2439000	It's very, yeah, it's the same company.
2439000	2441000	So there's even a Crossy Road skin in it.
2441000	2444000	So yeah, it's very, very, very similar.
2444000	2446000	But it's fun! That's what's important.
2446000	2452000	And then between that and Final Fantasy XIV and some console things here and there,
2452000	2454000	I even played a little bit of Pokemon to appease Shane.
2454000	2457000	Between all that, that was pretty much my gaming week.
2458000	2461000	All right, well, let's move on with the show. Let's get into news tonight.
2461000	2464000	No, all right. All right, Shane, how was your gaming week?
2464000	2466000	Okay, so we're going to start with non-Pokemon things.
2466000	2467000	All right.
2467000	2471000	First of all, Rhythm Heaven, whatever it's called on 3DS, got that.
2471000	2473000	And kind of disappointed.
2473000	2477000	I've played several of the, like, worlds.
2477000	2480000	The games are really, really short for a Rhythm Heaven game.
2480000	2484000	And I don't see any megamixes.
2484000	2486000	And those were my favorite parts.
2486000	2488000	So I'm kind of bummed.
2488000	2490000	I mean, it is kind of like a greatest hits collection.
2490000	2492000	So there's a lot of cool games.
2492000	2494000	And you can unlock more from the other ones.
2494000	2497000	But just kind of overall disappointed with it.
2497000	2499000	So that's sad.
2499000	2503000	Secondly, I was really amped to play the Resident Evil demo.
2503000	2509000	But a few weeks ago, I lost my PS4 controller and I still can't find it.
2509000	2511000	So I can't play my PS4.
2511000	2512000	It's making me sad also.
2512000	2514000	Now let's talk about Pokemon.
2514000	2523000	So I was up until, like, 8 or 9 this morning trading friend codes to get new Pokemon in X.
2523000	2525000	They have a friend safari thing.
2525000	2526000	That's really fun.
2526000	2528000	This is really the only game I play.
2528000	2530000	There's nothing else that holds my interest.
2530000	2539000	Between my two English copies, I have over, I think, 450 hours on them now.
2539000	2542000	And then I also have my Japanese copies that I'm slowly working through.
2542000	2544000	And I just cannot stop playing these.
2544000	2546000	I'm just hunting shinies.
2546000	2550000	I'm basically just hunting shinies at this point.
2550000	2551000	It's so much fun.
2551000	2552000	Why are you hunting shinies?
2552000	2554000	Because they're different looking.
2554000	2555000	And they're cool because of that.
2555000	2557000	And some of them might be an ugly color.
2557000	2561000	And then if you get a shiny one, it can be blue, depending on what it is.
2561000	2563000	So it's just, it's fun.
2563000	2564000	I like it.
2564000	2566000	Can we take a quick aside to talk about Pokemon Go?
2566000	2570000	Because some news this week is that they are actually ending the, it's not on our show,
2570000	2571000	we're also not ruining anything.
2571000	2574000	But they're actually ending the test cycle for Pokemon Go.
2574000	2575000	It's going to end June 30th.
2575000	2579000	So sadly, if you're not in the test, you're not getting in.
2579000	2580000	I hate to say it.
2580000	2584000	But yeah, because June 30th, everybody's getting kicked out.
2584000	2586000	And they're resetting the game.
2586000	2589000	So the good news is, if you're frustrated that you never got in,
2589000	2591000	you know, they are resetting everybody.
2591000	2594000	So nobody's going to have a jump on you when the actual game launches.
2594000	2597000	Which I was convinced after that E3 thing, I said,
2597000	2599000	no, there's no way they're launching in July.
2599000	2600000	No way.
2600000	2601000	This game's not ready.
2601000	2603000	But now to hear they're pulling the plug on June 30th,
2603000	2606000	I guess they are going to launch in July.
2606000	2608000	I'm kind of surprised at that.
2608000	2612000	Yeah, considering the state of that game, they're not fucking ready yet.
2612000	2618000	Now, to be fair, Ingress was rough when it first launched, too.
2618000	2620000	And it's come a long way.
2620000	2623000	Yeah, but you would think you would learn something between, you know,
2623000	2625000	programming for Ingress versus this.
2625000	2629000	It's like you just kind of, I mean, like, here's the thing.
2629000	2632000	Like, I get it, it's going to be rough around the edges,
2632000	2634000	but we don't even know what the game is yet.
2634000	2636000	There's no real game there.
2636000	2638000	Maybe they didn't want to spoil that.
2638000	2642000	I'm willing to cut them some slack that maybe not everything was in the game
2642000	2645000	because they didn't want people to start theory crafting
2645000	2649000	and doing all this crap until everybody could have at it.
2649000	2653000	So I'm willing to take a chance that there probably is more of an element
2653000	2656000	there that will not be revealed until the game is actually out
2656000	2658000	because Pokémon fans be crazy.
2658000	2660000	Look at that one on the couch.
2660000	2662000	And they would theory craft the shit out of this
2662000	2666000	and figure out all the mid-max if Niantic showed all their cards
2666000	2667000	to the Pokémon Go.
2667000	2670000	So I have a really good feeling, I hope I'm right,
2670000	2673000	that Niantic did hold some stuff back from the test.
2673000	2677000	I'm also kind of curious to see how the microtransactions work
2677000	2680000	because it was nice getting free money every day,
2680000	2684000	the play around with those, but without that...
2684000	2688000	Well, I think the answer is you get, I don't know if you noticed,
2688000	2690000	but when you collect your defender bonus every day,
2690000	2692000	which is how many gyms you're on,
2692000	2694000	you actually get a small amount of that currency.
2694000	2696000	So I think you have your answer.
2696000	2700000	Either you're going to buy it or you have to get it through the gym defense.
2700000	2702000	I don't think that'll change.
2702000	2704000	Let's be real, you guys.
2704000	2707000	Pokémon is a AAA franchise.
2708000	2711000	Shane would try to give it a rating higher than AAA if one existed,
2711000	2715000	but it's just like they're going to charge a premium for this game.
2715000	2717000	Even though it will be free,
2717000	2720000	they're going to make a lot of money off Pokémon.
2720000	2721000	They're going to make...
2721000	2723000	They're going to get a lot of $35 purchases just for the little...
2723000	2725000	Oh yeah, I already have one.
2725000	2727000	I'm not as crazy as he is, but I was like,
2727000	2729000	I want one of those, that looks rad.
2729000	2732000	I don't know, we'll have to see how much I actually play that game,
2732000	2734000	whether I want to drop money for that.
2734000	2738000	The only advantage I see to that is it makes it playing in the car a lot easier
2738000	2740000	because I don't have to look at my phone.
2740000	2742000	I just feel it vibrate, hit the button.
2742000	2743000	I can drive and do that.
2743000	2745000	Or if you don't even want to look at your phone at all,
2745000	2748000	you'll just be able to just look at your wrist or wherever you have it.
2748000	2751000	Now, Akdeft is talking in chat about stupid Pokémon Go
2751000	2753000	not supporting Intel Atom CPUs.
2753000	2755000	I had not heard about this.
2755000	2757000	Yeah, it was in the requirements, I guess,
2757000	2759000	that it's only supporting ARM processors.
2759000	2763000	So if you have that nice Intel Atom-based...
2763000	2766000	Was it the Asus phone or whatever? The Zen phone?
2766000	2767000	Sorry.
2767000	2769000	I did not hear about that. That sucks.
2769000	2771000	I was surprised, though, because they support it for Ingress,
2771000	2773000	so I don't know what the requirement is.
2773000	2776000	Unless they're... I don't know, the only thing I could think of...
2776000	2778000	Pokémon's way more graphic-intensive than Ingress, though.
2778000	2781000	Well, maybe the only other thing I could think of is maybe, like,
2781000	2786000	the Stop Spoofers, because people use PCs and emulators,
2786000	2790000	and if it's not an ARM-based... But you can change... I don't know.
2790000	2792000	Somebody will figure out a way to cheat at it.
2792000	2794000	That's just gonna suck.
2794000	2799000	There's no speed lock in that. It's just their fucking GPS is delayed as shit,
2799000	2802000	so you can't really... It's hard to gauge where you're at,
2802000	2805000	because your GPS is trailing behind where you actually are.
2805000	2806000	Yeah.
2806000	2808000	But there's no speed lock in there. I mean, I used to...
2808000	2812000	You know, spun those Pokéstops as I'm driving by them, so...
2812000	2813000	I don't know.
2813000	2817000	All right. So, Shane, actually, I went on that tangent,
2817000	2820000	because I kind of wanted to ask you, as a hardcore Pokémon fan,
2820000	2822000	where's your head at with Pokémon GO?
2822000	2824000	Is that something you're gonna get really into, or...
2824000	2827000	Well, see, if I get really into it, I would like to capture the Pokémon.
2827000	2830000	I mean, that's what my favorite thing to do in these games are.
2830000	2833000	I don't really do, like, the competitive battling or anything,
2833000	2839000	or, like, you know, raising to make competitive battling Pokémon.
2839000	2842000	I just want to collect the cool ones, and collect them all,
2842000	2846000	so I will very happily do that in Pokémon GO.
2846000	2850000	Unless it gets to be annoying, I won't play a game that's annoying.
2850000	2853000	And I have a really high patience threshold, too,
2853000	2858000	so we'll see what they can do for me in that game.
2858000	2859000	But I think I'll enjoy it.
2859000	2860000	If it's something you like.
2860000	2862000	You have a very low patience threshold for a lot of things, though.
2862000	2864000	Oh, yeah. Yeah, if I don't like it.
2864000	2866000	But for Pokémon, you're gonna cut it a lot of slack, I'm sure.
2866000	2868000	Yeah, or if the outcome's worth it, yeah.
2868000	2872000	Like, playing in this friend safari until I get a male shiny Pawnyard.
2872000	2873000	That's what I'm gonna do.
2873000	2876000	And I'm just gonna have to keep going at it.
2876000	2877000	TigerClawnChat says,
2877000	2881000	Can the Pokémon you find in Pokémon GO be transferred to the new Pokémon games?
2881000	2883000	No.
2883000	2886000	They talked about it at E3,
2886000	2891000	that there's going to be some functionality coming down the line between GO and Sun and Moon.
2891000	2893000	And that is absolutely not it, I guarantee it.
2893000	2894000	I would bet a large sum of money.
2894000	2899000	No, I know it's probably not it, but we don't know, so we can't really say it's not it.
2899000	2906000	I'm confident it's not, because the stats for the Pokémon on the phone are way different than that in the game.
2906000	2909000	It's way easier to catch them, I think, on the phone version.
2909000	2911000	It's not gonna work that way, I guarantee it.
2911000	2917000	Well, also, I mean, there's that, but it's probably easy enough to convert it somehow.
2917000	2924000	But Pokémon GO is just Generation 1, and they just released, not that long ago, Red and Blue,
2924000	2929000	and I think Yellow? I don't know, I don't care about those games, on the 3DS Virtual Console.
2929000	2933000	And you're gonna be able to take those Pokémon into Sun and Moon as well.
2933000	2936000	Yeah, but that's different, because those are still the same type of game.
2936000	2941000	Yeah, but it's not, like, stats and different things have changed since then.
2942000	2948000	So, like, your... who's a good example? I don't know.
2948000	2957000	So, Magnemite is... I don't know what he is in Red and Blue and Yellow, but, you know, he's...
2957000	2961000	Oh, I think he's just Electric in that, but then Steel got introduced in the next generation.
2961000	2968000	Well, if you take a Magnemite into Sun and Moon, he's coming from an Electric only.
2968000	2972000	He'll be Steel and Electric in there, so I don't see why they couldn't just do some sort of conversion.
2972000	2976000	Yeah, I don't know. I think it's gonna be something less interesting, like,
2976000	2982000	you earn some sort of currency or some sort of, like, bonus items or something like that.
2982000	2986000	Yeah, I think that's what... you'll get extra currency or random...
2986000	2991000	Maybe a random Pokémon will unlock, but it's not gonna be the same Pokémon, if that makes sense.
2991000	2997000	Oh my gosh, and speaking of Sun and Moon, I constantly watch the presentation from E3 over and over.
2997000	3001000	Like, I can't stop because it's the only footage I have of the game and it's so beautiful.
3001000	3002000	When do you get more?
3002000	3006000	July 1st, we'll get some new information, so next Friday. This coming Friday.
3006000	3013000	That's awesome. Also, Chad is making us realize that we didn't really explain what a Shiny was.
3013000	3021000	Okay, so a Shiny, nowadays, all it means is it's a Pokémon that you get that is different colored.
3021000	3028000	They are also very rare to get. There are ways to make it easier, but it still takes a lot of dedication to get one.
3028000	3036000	For example, I wanted a Shiny Oshawott. Oshawott is a starter, so the only way to get a Shiny from it
3036000	3043000	is either in a game where you get it as a starter, you keep soft-resetting your system until you get one,
3043000	3047000	which can take thousands of tries, or you hatch an egg.
3047000	3057000	And so, I thought I wouldn't have the patience to soft-reset, and Oshawott's from a game that started about five years ago, Black and White.
3057000	3065000	And ever since that game came out, I wanted a Shiny, so I've been trying to hatch a Shiny Oshawott since 2011.
3065000	3072000	On my birthday this year, I finally got an Oshawott that was Shiny. That is, like, several thousand eggs later.
3072000	3079000	It is fairly ridiculous. But then there's other things, like, when I was adding people on this Friend Safari,
3079000	3087000	you have a pretty good chance in Friend Safari to get Shinies. I was trying to fill out which Pokémon were in this Safari,
3087000	3094000	and on my third run through the grass, I got a Shiny that way. It was one I didn't care about, but I technically care about all of them.
3095000	3106000	So, it's just a different color Pokémon. They used to have, I don't remember if it was better stats, or if they, like, for the competitive side,
3106000	3115000	if they gained their, like, stats quicker, but that got, like, done away with in one of the earlier generations,
3115000	3120000	and now it's just cosmetic, and kind of like, almost like a trophy, I would say.
3120000	3123000	Do all Pokémon have a Shiny, even the Legendaries?
3123000	3129000	Yes, all Pokémon have Shinies. That does not mean you can get Shinies for all of them. Some are called Shiny Locked,
3129000	3139000	so you aren't able to get Shinies of those specific Pokémon. It's mostly the Event Legendaries that you can't get,
3139000	3147000	some of those you can't get Shinies of, but that's, like, you know, 12 out of 721.
3147000	3150000	Gotcha. All right.
3151000	3156000	And I love them. They sparkle when they show up on the field. It's really cool.
3156000	3158000	All right, anything else you want to say about Pokémon?
3158000	3160000	I could just keep talking about it. We can just not do it.
3160000	3165000	Well, then we'd better move on. We're gonna get into the week's news, although actdeft is sad in chat, saying,
3165000	3168000	I've never, ever caught a Shiny Pokémon.
3168000	3170000	Okay, so...
3170000	3174000	Shane, you have, like, 20 extra Shinies you don't need. Give them out. Give them away.
3174000	3180000	I don't know. I have to look at my spreadsheet. I'm up to almost 50 Shinies now that aren't duplicates,
3180000	3184000	but I could give you one, actdeft, if you want. I can give you a Sneasel.
3184000	3189000	But just keep at it. If you care about it, you'll run into one.
3189000	3196000	Make sure you have the National Pokédex filled out so you get the Shiny Charm to make it easier.
3196000	3202000	And once you get one, it'll, like, put that taste in your mouth, and that's all you'll want to do in the game.
3202000	3207000	And just have patience. And do the Friend Safari, because you don't even need the Shiny Charm for that.
3207000	3211000	It's like a 1 in 500 or 800 chance you'll run into one.
3211000	3216000	Hmm. All right. Shiny hunting tips from Shane.
3216000	3220000	All right. We need to get into some gaming news, though, because we're running a little long here.
3220000	3227000	Was my Shiny announcement that I found two since we've started today on the show, not news?
3228000	3232000	It's just sad. That's all. Let's see. We do have some comments from chat.
3232000	3235000	actdeft says, I don't think I have the patience.
3235000	3240000	s200mat says, I think Shane's show should be the Shiny Hoarders podcast.
3240000	3243000	Ziba says, I've only caught two Shiny Pokémon ever.
3243000	3250000	And Sterlok says, the only Shiny I ever found was a Centret at the beginning of Silver before you have access to Pokéballs.
3250000	3256000	Oh, that sucks. That really sucks. I was going to say, Centret's really cute Shiny, but not if you can't catch it.
3257000	3261000	And then Bobby Blackwolf says, I think I've only caught two Pokémon ever.
3261000	3267000	Well, you should get to fixing that. And if you haven't caught any Shinies ever, just don't worry.
3267000	3276000	I've been playing since Red and Blue, and my first Shiny I didn't get until when I had Black when it came out.
3276000	3280000	So that's Generation 5. So just have patience. You'll get it.
3281000	3286000	Alright. Let's see. We're going to get into some news, but just quickly, some housekeeping.
3286000	3289000	Be sure to follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3289000	3292000	We're also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.
3292000	3296000	As far as I know, we don't have any plans to take shows off in the foreseeable future.
3296000	3301000	But we will be gone Labor Day weekend. That's still a long ways out.
3301000	3307000	But that is, of course, Dragon Con 2016, which I'm already making my arrangements to be there in Atlanta.
3308000	3314000	Oh, I also found out this week, I will be at, this isn't until October, but I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest,
3314000	3317000	which is the Final Fantasy XIV convention, kind of like their version.
3317000	3318000	Oh, sad I'm not going.
3318000	3321000	BlizzCon. Yeah, Shane's not going. So what's up with that?
3321000	3328000	Well, I've got Power Morphicon this year. And then literally two days after Power Morphicon,
3328000	3331000	Pokémon World Championships in San Francisco. I'm going to that too.
3331000	3332000	Of course you are. Of course you are.
3332000	3334000	So there is really no time for...
3334000	3337000	You're going to go help us get some video for VOG? Come on, be a correspondent.
3337000	3344000	How am I going to do that when all I'm going to do is like jump in the pile of plush Pokémon toys at the...
3344000	3346000	Can you get a video of that?
3346000	3348000	I can get a video of me being escorted out.
3348000	3351000	Is that like the ball pit, but it's just like a Pokémon pit?
3351000	3356000	I would love that so much. I would hug them all.
3356000	3361000	Is, what's the convention that everybody made fun of? The TumblrCon?
3361000	3362000	Oh, yeah, within the ball pit.
3362000	3363000	DashCon, that's it.
3363000	3367000	Is there going to be like a DashCon where instead of the ball pit, you have a Pokémon pit?
3367000	3369000	Or it could be Pokéball pit.
3369000	3370000	Pick another flavor, by the way.
3370000	3371000	What's that?
3371000	3372000	Pick another flavor.
3372000	3374000	Oh, of cupcake?
3374000	3375000	Yeah.
3375000	3376000	I want to do the peanut butter one next, I think.
3376000	3377000	Okay.
3377000	3379000	Oh my God, I'm getting so full though. This is seriously the last cupcake for now.
3379000	3386000	All right, we got to get into some news for tonight. Starting off with Loki.
3386000	3403000	All right, so Sony has lost the, I guess it's been a pretty long battle for the class action lawsuits against the firmware update that took out the PlayStation 3 Linux that was on the original launch system for the PlayStation 3.
3404000	3410000	You may remember that was update 3.21, 3.21, easy to remember, in 2010.
3410000	3423000	And there was a lawsuit kind of in place saying that people did buy that system for the Linux and because of that, you know, they felt like they lost out on some functionality and, you know, kind of felt cheated.
3423000	3432000	So, people that were impacted by that, there's a couple ways you can get compensated for your sorrows.
3432000	3450000	One is if you feel that you were impacted, you know, and you use Linux and you can prove that you have, you know, used the Linux on there or that you used it, you can actually get $55, but it is going to be a little bit tricky to prove that.
3450000	3459000	Especially like, you know, if you didn't take any screenshots while you had it, I don't know how you'd be able to do that now since, you know, if you patched your system.
3459000	3465000	And then, of course, $9, which will be going to everyone else that owned a PlayStation 3.
3465000	3473000	So, if you can't prove that you used it, but if you felt like it was, you know, I'm kind of...
3473000	3480000	But you have to sign like an affidavit that says, I feel cheated by Sony. I am wronged.
3480000	3482000	Yeah, I'm willing to do that for $9.
3482000	3486000	Yeah, me too.
3486000	3490000	How much are you willing to sell your integrity for? $9? Alright, cool.
3490000	3494000	Oh, I don't know. I've already been the recipient of three class action lawsuits.
3494000	3498000	Oh, that's right. That's right. What did you have to say to get like three cans of Red Bull?
3498000	3504000	I got two cases of Red Bull and I just had to fill that out for myself and for my wife.
3504000	3509000	They eventually came and I drank them in like about a day, so...
3509000	3511000	It's worth it.
3511000	3517000	Stope and Chat with a good point saying, getting the affidavit notarized is probably going to cost $9.
3517000	3520000	Do you have to give them a notarized affidavit?
3520000	3522000	I don't know. If I do, that's not worth it.
3522000	3523000	Oh, that's crappy, yeah.
3523000	3527000	I don't care. It's just... whatever. It's there.
3527000	3534000	So, yeah. You probably would have gotten an email if you're a part of this. I got an email regarding it, so...
3534000	3538000	I didn't. I've had a PS3 since they came out, so...
3538000	3541000	Yeah, I don't remember getting an email about it.
3541000	3544000	I didn't buy it when it first came out, but I definitely remember the other OS option.
3544000	3547000	It should be to your PlayStation Network email, so whatever you have tied to it.
3547000	3551000	Oh, it's my... I have like a spam dump email. It's probably that one.
3551000	3554000	Yeah, so whatever you have tied to that, that's where it's going.
3554000	3556000	So, look out for it there.
3556000	3557000	Alright.
3557000	3561000	I'm disappointed. I mean, it would be nice to have the other OS stuff to just mess with it,
3561000	3564000	especially now that I don't play with my PlayStation 3.
3564000	3566000	It would be kind of cool to mess with that.
3566000	3571000	Yeah. It was... you know, I remember when we talked about that when it first happened,
3571000	3573000	because this show is that old.
3573000	3576000	And I do remember there was a lot of...
3576000	3580000	It seemed like... wasn't there like NASA or like scientists were actually using that feature
3580000	3586000	because the PlayStation 3 for the cost was more of a supercomputer than like the computers at the time?
3586000	3587000	Yeah, like the military was using it.
3587000	3588000	Yeah.
3588000	3589000	In like clusters.
3589000	3593000	And so they were really... I mean, they obviously don't connect those computers to the internet anyway.
3593000	3596000	Yeah, exactly. They wouldn't be updating it, so it wouldn't matter to them.
3596000	3599000	But like still though, it's functionality that you advertise it as...
3599000	3603000	And the whole reason, it's kind of... it's typical Sony, to be honest,
3603000	3605000	because it's just like when the PlayStation 3 came out,
3605000	3608000	rumble, that's so last generation.
3608000	3612000	And that's because they didn't want to pay for the licensing for the rumble feature,
3612000	3614000	and then eventually changed their mind on that.
3614000	3618000	And the Linux being on there, so they could advertise it as a computer system
3618000	3624000	and not as a game system because it gave them some sort of tax break or something.
3624000	3631000	So both of the things they've kind of flopped on are just because of, you know,
3631000	3635000	them trying to get around certain... paying certain things.
3635000	3639000	Well, didn't quite work out for you, now did it?
3639000	3643000	Yeah, you know, Sony made a lot of real...
3643000	3647000	They kind of bungled a lot around the PlayStation 3 launch, you know,
3647000	3649000	but they've come a long way, obviously.
3649000	3650000	Obviously, Sony's come a long way.
3650000	3653000	Now, you know, when it comes to E3,
3653000	3657000	they're the ones that are kind of laughing at everybody else with their presentation.
3657000	3660000	You know, maybe not as much this year as the year before,
3660000	3662000	but, you know, they still did a pretty darn good job this year.
3662000	3666000	But when it first launched, it was just kind of like one disaster after another.
3666000	3668000	So it's like when they removed the other OS thing,
3668000	3670000	it's kind of like they almost didn't think about it.
3670000	3672000	And you kind of wonder if there was like an arrogance about,
3672000	3674000	oh, people aren't going to be able to pirate.
3674000	3677000	It's that whole classic, this is unpiratable.
3677000	3679000	This can't happen, never going to...
3679000	3682000	And it's like you're just challenging people more to make it happen.
3682000	3684000	You are. I mean...
3684000	3686000	Not that it makes piracy right.
3686000	3692000	I'm just saying, you can't be arrogant about your anti-piracy measures necessarily either.
3692000	3697000	Because really the only thing that is working is forcing your game to always be online to play it.
3697000	3702000	And as much as people hate that, it kind of works with anti-piracy mostly.
3702000	3708000	Well, mostly, even Fallen Fantasy XI, though, you're able to find a way to play that online.
3708000	3710000	And, yeah.
3710000	3714000	I don't know if it's one of the stories and maybe a last minute story or something,
3714000	3721000	but they have some information about a way to get around Blue Burst.
3721000	3723000	You can play that offline, too.
3723000	3724000	Really?
3724000	3725000	Yeah.
3725000	3726000	For PSO?
3726000	3727000	Yeah.
3727000	3729000	I miss those days.
3729000	3730000	Blue Burst was pretty good.
3730000	3733000	Dark Sakura, we need to pick up PSO again. That would be fun.
3733000	3734000	I'm down.
3734000	3738000	We should pick up PSO2, though, because that actually is pretty cool.
3738000	3741000	PSO2 is really good and the patches are...
3741000	3745000	I mean, I'd probably say the fan translations are about 90%, right?
3745000	3748000	Why the fuck doesn't Sega just put it out officially in the US?
3748000	3750000	Why do I have to jump through all these fucking hoops?
3750000	3751000	Because they're making us work for them.
3751000	3753000	Especially when it's already in English.
3753000	3754000	God damn it, Sega.
3754000	3756000	Because Sonic, boom.
3756000	3760000	Okay, every time that Sonic the Hedgehog thing to it, you're like, can't we...
3760000	3766000	Okay, somebody set up a bot on Twitter so that every time Donald Trump tweets something,
3766000	3769000	he gets a picture of Hillary that says, delete your account.
3769000	3771000	Somebody set up a bot to do that every time.
3771000	3777000	Can I get a bot made so that every time Sonic the Hedgehog tweets something, it says, PSO2.
3778000	3779000	PSO2.
3779000	3784000	I mean, I really shouldn't probably be encouraging that kind of behavior on Twitter, but you know what?
3784000	3789000	But that bot was funny, though, because it would tweet nonsense to people and people would argue with it,
3789000	3790000	and it's hilarious.
3790000	3794000	Because they'd be arguing with this person that's not really a person,
3794000	3797000	and they're just repeating nonsensical things back to...
3797000	3798000	I mean...
3800000	3801000	Alright, anyway.
3802000	3803000	Hey, it's another week.
3803000	3807000	It must be time for more Nintendo NX rumors.
3807000	3809000	And what's the latest this week?
3809000	3815000	Alright, well this is from a game blog in France that's actually called gameblog.fr.
3815000	3823000	A very large French gaming site saying that Nintendo NX will be on par with PlayStation Neo.
3823000	3828000	Meaning the types of specifications, the chips that are inside and all that.
3828000	3834000	They are saying it will be unveiled in September, around the time of the Tokyo Game Show,
3834000	3836000	but they're not saying at Tokyo Game Show.
3836000	3839000	But that is kind of in line with what most of us are thinking anyway.
3839000	3842000	That Nintendo is going to time their own event around Tokyo Game Show.
3842000	3844000	I don't buy this information at all.
3844000	3845000	Interesting.
3845000	3849000	Well, if the rumor were to stop there, I'd probably go with it,
3849000	3854000	but then it goes on to say, the reports say there will be remasters.
3854000	3857000	Skyward Sword, Mario Kart, and Smash Brothers.
3857000	3861000	Oh my god, Skyward Sword would be so good if we don't have to stand up and play it.
3861000	3866000	There are third-party titles in the works by Square Enix and Capcom.
3866000	3875000	It will be on par with the PlayStation Neo, in spite of Reggie Fils-Aime recently saying the NX is not about specs, but about content.
3875000	3878000	You can be about content and still have good specs.
3878000	3881000	I don't see it being on spec with them.
3881000	3887000	I think it's going to be maybe on spec with maybe a PlayStation 4, which is fine.
3887000	3889000	I mean, if it could be on spec with that.
3889000	3897000	I don't think it might even match that, but if they're looking at doing a portable system, I don't see how that's possible.
3897000	3904000	I mean, I don't see how they're going to be able to keep the battery life there and have it run with that kind of graphics horsepower,
3904000	3910000	and it being a portable form factor, I don't see that happening.
3910000	3917000	I feel like there's going to be something that makes the resolution lower on the handheld, that it takes less power or something.
3917000	3926000	I don't know. I mean, I don't know all the ins and outs about it, but I feel like the Vita is capable of producing graphics that are on par,
3926000	3931000	probably with a PlayStation 3, if not even a little bit more.
3931000	3935000	And you can do that on a Vita, as far as the handheld side of things goes.
3935000	3945000	Now, with the console living room base itself or whatever it is, we're just assuming it is a handheld and a console, but I don't see it.
3945000	3949000	Nintendo's got to do something with their handhelds, and that's been way too quiet.
3949000	3950000	Well, here's why we would think that.
3950000	3960000	It's because if they're, and I'm sure you're going to get into this, but a certain form factor for their games,
3960000	3965000	why would you switch to that if you're now not trying to cut down on the size of the system?
3965000	3972000	I mean, there's no reason why you wouldn't switch away from a certain format that everybody uses to go that route. I don't understand.
3972000	3976000	Well, let me go ahead and mention that, because I think this is right along the lines of what you're thinking about right now.
3976000	3980000	So, yet again, the cartridge rumor gaining a lot of steam.
3980000	3988000	Not only did it get mentioned in some GameStop conference call, where they actually were talking about physical media,
3988000	3996000	that it's going to be involved with the NX, but recently in the trademark office, the trademark was filed for Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild,
3996000	4002000	and in the trademark documents, it actually said video game cartridge.
4002000	4010000	It should be noted that the Wii U games that get registered for trademarks don't say that, but the 3DS games do.
4010000	4016000	So, this indicates that there is going to be a cartridge for Zelda Breath of the Wild.
4016000	4025000	Now, when I say cartridge, I think a lot of people still, in their minds, think of the big gray things that went with the old school Nintendo and the Super Nintendo.
4025000	4029000	Like, even though you say cartridges do not have to be that big anymore.
4029000	4034000	Like, cartridges can be like a 3DS game, like a little card that goes in your camera. That could be a cartridge.
4034000	4040000	So, it seems like NX is probably going towards cartridge.
4040000	4045000	Like, the rumor that it's gaining a lot more steam, that that is where it's going with NX.
4045000	4050000	Although, you know digital will still be available as well. They will love to sell you games digitally.
4050000	4051000	Well, yeah, I'm sure.
4051000	4054000	They can give you a 32GB hard drive to put them all on.
4054000	4062000	Yeah, exactly. I have two games on my Wii U, and I already have to pop in a USB drive to put in Smash, which is stupid.
4062000	4069000	It's sad. My 3DS has 64GB in it, which is double what my Wii U has.
4069000	4071000	It's my portable system.
4073000	4079000	Here's the thing about the NX and the cost and all that, is that Nintendo doesn't sell things at a loss.
4079000	4085000	So, the specs have to match the price that they're going for, and Nintendo usually tries...
4085000	4089000	Nintendo's not going to try to sell a $400 living room system.
4089000	4093000	I would say the most they're going to try to sell a living room system for is $300.
4094000	4099000	Because what Wii U was $250, and then $300 for the one you really wanted?
4099000	4101000	I thought it was $350 for that one.
4101000	4102000	Was it?
4102000	4107000	I don't know. Like, I'm worried because they don't get it.
4107000	4114000	A lot of things they don't seem to get until like way later. Like, they didn't get digital downloads and storage and everything.
4114000	4120000	That's why the system's launched with 32GB in it. It's like, oh, people don't need it. No one does that.
4120000	4128000	I mean, it's just so nonchalant, like oblivious to gaming trends or the trends of their own industry.
4128000	4135000	Which makes me wonder, like, that's why I don't think this thing would be up to spec to like a PlayStation Neo.
4135000	4138000	Because they wouldn't think to do that.
4140000	4144000	I still think it will be at least the PlayStation 4 level, though.
4144000	4155000	I think it'll be beyond PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but I don't know if it'll be as far along as these second generations, mid-generation upgrades or whatever we're calling it.
4155000	4160000	I was going to say, kind of along the lines of the PlayStation Neo, too, since I don't see what we're going to be talking about later.
4160000	4172000	But they, I guess, Digital Foundry or whatever, they looked at some of the specs or whatever for the PlayStation Neo or some of the information they have from like chip manufacturers or something like that.
4172000	4182000	Basically, the card that's in that system is going to be comparable to, it's spec-wise, almost identical to the R480 that's coming out.
4182000	4190000	So they're brand new Radeon cards that are basically spec-wise. For Nvidia, it's almost like a GTX 980.
4190000	4198000	So the thing with that, though, and one of the reasons they're saying that, that might be one of the reasons that that card is so cheap coming out.
4198000	4206000	Because Sony has purchased so many of those chips, it's allowed them to offset the cost of the actual card to bring down the cost to consumers.
4206000	4210000	But if that's the case, then the price of that system could be low, too.
4210000	4220000	They could actually put that system out maybe for $399 and have a higher-end system that's basically almost on par with what's being sold right now, which would be pretty cool.
4220000	4229000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Sound Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, frog.
4229000	4236000	Alright, well, you know what? We still don't know until Nintendo finally frickin' says something official, so we'll just keep waiting!
4236000	4242000	They probably won't say anything until the day it comes out. They'll just drop it. Didn't they do that with Saturn or whatever?
4242000	4246000	Yeah, and it's been like every gamer's dream that that's going to happen again.
4246000	4248000	No, I don't want it to happen. I think that's dumb.
4248000	4250000	The Saturn also didn't...
4250000	4254000	It's not. There's no way that's going to happen, and I'll tell you why.
4254000	4267000	Because we live in the age of the internet, and the reason that won't happen anymore is because in order to do a launch like that, you have to ship consoles to stores, which means you have to communicate with stores, which means you have to do ordering and planning and blah blah blah blah blah.
4267000	4277000	And that shit leaks like fucking crazy, so there's no way that no one's going to know what's going to happen because it'll get fucking leaked out by some GameStop employee immediately.
4278000	4287000	Doesn't, like when Apple do releases, they also have their own retail chain, so they're usually able to keep a lid on it a lot easier.
4287000	4294000	I was going to say, they don't usually get it out the same day, but they can be like, you can get it three days from now.
4294000	4305000	And that can happen sometimes too. I remember Microsoft, we wouldn't know until, oh hey, they're launching a slim console, we get the setup information that day of the announcement at E3, that type of thing.
4305000	4315000	So that's possible, but then again, we were a distributor and we're kind of like second tier to their direct partners, so who knows, they probably got the information a lot sooner than we did.
4315000	4321000	So I think though, like a major system launch, you're going to know about it beforehand.
4323000	4328000	Alright, well let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4328000	4336000	Well, some long-standing, yet kind of stupid questions about Sonic the Hedgehog have been answered.
4336000	4356000	And these were answered by, hold on just a second, okay it was answered by the head of Sonic Team, Tashaki Iizuka, who answered these very stupid questions, some of them were stupid.
4357000	4362000	So we'll go ahead and start. Where does Sonic keep all of his rings? The answer, I'm not sure.
4362000	4363000	In his butt.
4363000	4371000	In his butt. And now the big one though is answering why Eggman, if it's Eggman or Robotnik.
4371000	4374000	It's clearly not his butt, because you can't put a ring in your butt.
4374000	4375000	Some people do.
4375000	4379000	It would go run his cock. It would go, he's going to have a jingling cock as he's running from-
4379000	4381000	He's got some sparkly bangles.
4382000	4389000	It's like playing ring toss as a kid where you try to throw the ring around the big pole. Right, Shane?
4389000	4392000	No, we're not talking about this.
4392000	4404000	Anyway, of course, and it's something that most of us knew anyway, Robotnik in the US and everywhere else in the world was originally called Eggman in Japan.
4405000	4416000	So they actually, because of the sort of divide on there, what they did is he went and said, okay, fine, his name is officially Robotnik, but everyone calls him Eggman. That's his nickname.
4416000	4421000	And so Eggman is the official name from all the rest of the games out.
4421000	4424000	The rings on his wang and the egg in his butt.
4424000	4431000	So, they also were talking about Sonic wearing a scarf for Sonic Boom.
4431000	4437000	It said that it's just a way to differentiate between the different versions of Sonic.
4437000	4441000	Like, listen, Sonic Boom sucks, okay? That's all you need.
4441000	4446000	We don't know what the fuck we're doing. Why does he have a million bandages on? I don't know.
4446000	4449000	Other question is, why is Knuckles so gullible?
4449000	4455000	Well, he was made somewhat gullible so that he would believe Eggman instead of believe Sonic.
4455000	4460000	And then, of course, get extra angry that he was tricked and want revenge.
4460000	4465000	It's like they came up with all these designs for characters and had, like, no fucking backstory at all.
4468000	4472000	So there was another one about Tails dying a lot in the classic games.
4472000	4478000	Like, he doesn't just die. He just comes back and hangs out. He doesn't die a lot.
4478000	4485000	The whole point is that Sonic wouldn't be alone during the gameplay, plus the fact that you had the two mothers.
4485000	4494000	They refer to him as someone that your younger brother can play as Tails and do whatever he wants to.
4494000	4495000	But not your younger sister.
4495000	4497000	But not your younger sister, apparently.
4497000	4504000	It's more about teamwork and cooperation so that younger kids could play along with their siblings.
4505000	4510000	And then, my favorite question. Why do whales hate Sonic so much?
4510000	4512000	That's a good question.
4512000	4518000	The sea is that killer whale's home. That is why he chased Sonic. To keep his home.
4518000	4521000	Another one was the supersonic comparison to Goku.
4521000	4527000	And he was like, um, he's not really a fan. He's not cosplaying.
4527000	4533000	And then talking about the chaoa, they don't show up in other games because they need fresh, pure water to live in.
4533000	4535000	Like I said, dumb questions.
4535000	4543000	Listen, there's no way that supersonic is anywhere near the same as, you know, a Super Saiyan in Dragon Ball.
4543000	4549000	It's not like he has to collect a certain amount of orb-like items in order to transform into this character.
4549000	4551000	That doesn't happen at all.
4551000	4553000	Well, they don't have to collect any orbs in Dragon Ball Z.
4553000	4558000	Whatever. I don't know. It's Sonic. It doesn't make any sense.
4558000	4560000	It's built into their DNA.
4560000	4565000	It doesn't fucking make any sense. It's Sonic. It was a platformer game that they just made some characters.
4565000	4569000	Very minimal backstory. That's it. Now you're fucking asking stupid questions.
4569000	4578000	This honestly reminded me of the kind of bullshit nonsense that they were asking during that fucking Pokemon Go thing.
4578000	4581000	Where they had two super fans of Pokemon Go.
4582000	4586000	And this is like, where does he keep all his rings?
4586000	4589000	No one's gonna fucking ask that or gives a shit about that.
4589000	4594000	It's like, why did you fucking make a werehog? That seems like a really poor design decision.
4594000	4599000	Can't you just ask us about the rings or the scarves?
4602000	4610000	You can see like with the scarves thing, he goes really fast. Therefore, he gets cold. Done. Perfect.
4610000	4613000	Or they just want to show off the physics with the scarves.
4613000	4621000	Yeah, it makes more fucking sense than like, I don't know. Just, what the fuck is on the screen right now?
4621000	4624000	What the hell is this thing that stoppie-linked me in the chatroom saying,
4624000	4628000	do you want to know what Rob the Hedgehog looks like? And that's what I got.
4628000	4636000	And, um, no. No! No. Anyways, all to no.
4636000	4643000	You know what's actually funny thing about that Tails thing? I want to say that, um, what was it?
4643000	4647000	They did a really funny video about that one time about Tails being immortal.
4647000	4652000	It was one of those Dorkly videos. Go check that out. It's hilarious.
4653000	4656000	Dark Sakura, what would you have asked Sonic the Hedgehog?
4657000	4660000	Why haven't you been in a good game recently?
4662000	4664000	What do you think the answer would be?
4664000	4668000	But Sonic Boom! No bitch.
4669000	4674000	Alright, if that's it for Sonic, we'll move on to the next story. Lowkey.
4675000	4682000	Alright, this is kind of ridiculous, but I guess we hear about this at PAX and E3.
4682000	4688000	I think we've seen this at E3 before, but apparently someone tried to steal the demo for Zelda Breath of the Wild.
4689000	4695000	And, um, apparently what happened was there was somebody that was actually...
4695000	4705000	I don't even know how they were able to bring a PC in, hook it up to the demo pod, and somehow try to copy the files over for that.
4705000	4711000	They used some sort of URL trick that tricks the system into running unauthorized code.
4712000	4720000	And somehow, they say that they were successful to be able to copy stuff, but they copied the wrong files.
4722000	4723000	So yeah.
4723000	4728000	So wait, they could have stolen the demo, but they actually copied the wrong files?
4728000	4729000	They apparently copied the wrong files.
4729000	4732000	That's some kind of sweet poetic justice, isn't it?
4733000	4741000	So, um, yeah. Well, A, how did these people get past E3's screening process? It always blows my mind.
4741000	4745000	Well, it's like, isn't someone watching those people play this demo?
4745000	4753000	Okay, it's like a fucking fortress for us to get into E3, but then you hear about these thieves got into E3, like no problem, and it's like, oh my god.
4753000	4760000	The people watching are always just, or almost always just like a hired set of people that don't actually work for the company.
4760000	4762000	So, they're just there to...
4762000	4767000	Yeah, but they mean like, I mean, I'm sure that it gives like, hey, if they're trying to mess with this, you know, kind of hey, let us know?
4767000	4769000	I mean, I think it's a little suspicious.
4769000	4770000	All those people don't care.
4770000	4782000	For example, when I worked for Nintendo and we did the E3 demo where we had like Mario Kart and Wind Waker, we were given help through a third-party company.
4782000	4786000	The person I got did not care at all.
4786000	4788000	Like, they were just standing around doing nothing.
4788000	4796000	So, if you're hiring a whole bunch of people that are like that, then I could see this happening very easily.
4796000	4798000	That's silly.
4798000	4808000	Wait, was this one of those scenarios possibly where like, the killer is calling from in the house, meaning the person who was hired by Nintendo to help with the show tried to steal the demo?
4808000	4810000	Because that would be a very elaborate way to do it.
4810000	4812000	That'd be funny. I doubt it.
4812000	4819000	I don't know about funny, but it would be kind of one of those like, oh, shit, like that's a pretty James Bond way to steal a demo.
4819000	4826000	But, you know, with all the hype that this game has, it'd be interesting.
4826000	4830000	Anyway, don't steal things. It's not nice.
4830000	4837000	Going to the next story, which is about Yacht Club games, because I think, isn't like today also Shovel Knight's birthday?
4837000	4838000	I think it's two years old.
4838000	4845000	Yeah, I think it's a anniversary for Shovel Knight, which, you know, a lot of y'all love Shovel Knight, and rightfully so.
4845000	4848000	And they've been adding, you know, content into Shovel Knight.
4848000	4852000	So, it would be curious what Yacht Club might do next.
4852000	4857000	And they actually created a poll that is very simply, what game should we make next?
4857000	4866000	And what's great about this is that it actually is saying a Zelda, a Metroid, Shovel Kart, or Shovel Knight 2.
4866000	4869000	A Metroid.
4869000	4876000	Yeah, I would love to see a Metroid as well, but wouldn't like a Shovel Knight 2 kind of be an inevitable thing as well?
4876000	4878000	Or a Metroid game.
4878000	4881000	Yeah, I'm like, can't you guys do more than one game?
4881000	4885000	I mean, not to be off topic, but have you seen the demo for Bloodstained?
4885000	4888000	I haven't. I heard the backers.
4888000	4891000	Oh my god, I've watched a lot of streams of it. I mean, it's not that long of a demo.
4891000	4894000	It's pretty amazing.
4894000	4899000	I'm definitely a lot better looking than Mighty No. 9 right now.
4899000	4907000	I was gonna say, you know, well, Mighty No. 9, like I know the big wave tends to be going against that game right now.
4907000	4910000	Especially what I see on Twitter and the critics and all that.
4910000	4917000	But like I know, and I was mentioning this earlier in the show, like our pal Captain Spike over at Game Buoy seemed to really enjoy it.
4917000	4919000	I haven't played it yet, so I can't tell you one way or the other.
4919000	4921000	Or at Ranger Pride. You know, he has that show too.
4921000	4923000	Oh, that's right. Yeah, there's that little thing too.
4923000	4925000	But that show's not as good as Game Buoy.
4927000	4929000	I'm just messing.
4929000	4936000	But with Mighty No. 9, you know, there are some people out there who are like, you know what, the internet is shitting on this too much.
4936000	4941000	Like it doesn't deserve all this backlash it's getting. It's not a bad game.
4941000	4949000	So, but regardless of all that, it does seem like a lot of people are very cautious about Kickstarters and all this stuff.
4949000	4954000	Because Mighty No. 9 may have kind of damaged Kickstarted games.
4954000	4959000	But it's kind of nice to hear that Bloodstained maybe could reverse that.
4959000	4960000	Yeah.
4960000	4964000	From a lot of what, you know, the feedback is very positive on that.
4964000	4966000	So it's like you might have a good Kickstarter story out there.
4966000	4970000	Yeah, it's just disappointing just kind of how that game turned out.
4970000	4981000	Because even looking at some of the footage that they showed before, the concept footage from Comcept, it was just like a very...
4981000	4986000	It doesn't even look as nice as the original kind of idea that they had.
4986000	4995000	I feel like from what I've watched of it being played, and from what I've heard, because I've heard it's not a terrible game, it's just kind of average.
4995000	5000000	It's also based in Unreal 3. I mean, they're using a fucking old engine for that.
5000000	5008000	But I think the big problem with that game, from what I've seen, is that it's billed as like the spiritual successor to Mega Man.
5008000	5014000	Where it looks like the main part of that is just that you fight robot bosses and get their abilities.
5014000	5021000	They did a lot of tweaking and like adding stuff that kind of takes it away from the Mega Man sort of experience.
5021000	5029000	And so, whereas Bloodstained, I mean that's basically Symphony of the Night or any other Castlevania games after Symphony of the Night that played the same way.
5029000	5037000	And it's beautiful, and they're not trying to do something that takes it so far out of that sort of genre there.
5037000	5043000	Whereas Mighty No. 9, from what I've seen and heard, kind of does drift too far away from the Mega Man formula.
5043000	5050000	I'm fine with it drifting away from the Mega Man formula, but it's just kind of not good looking. I don't know.
5050000	5056000	I watched a lot of different streams for it. I have no interest in picking it up. Whereas I was pretty excited about it when it was Kickstaring it.
5056000	5058000	I'm glad I didn't back it.
5058000	5064000	And seriously, what the fuck is up with the stupid end credits? The end credits are fucking four hours long.
5064000	5067000	The game is less than four hours long.
5067000	5070000	Well, when you promise you're going to put everybody's name in the credits.
5070000	5075000	But it's not! It's like the Mighty No. backer number blah blah blah, you know, something.
5075000	5078000	And that's it. It's just fucking stupid.
5078000	5085000	You know what? They put every single backer in fucking the end of Kung Fury, and that didn't take fucking four hours long.
5085000	5090000	And I know that there was probably around the same number of backers.
5091000	5097000	I mean, there's got to be a better way than running that for four fucking hours. No one's going to watch that shit.
5097000	5101000	No, they're just looking through to find themselves. That's all.
5101000	5105000	That's what I did with Shadowgate. I just ran through to find myself.
5106000	5113000	People usually do like what I did with the ending of the first Mass Effect after the song ended and the credits were still going.
5113000	5115000	I just went to go to the bathroom.
5115000	5118000	Yeah, I got up to make a sandwich, you know, get ready for the next game.
5118000	5121000	Oh, but Mass Effect 1 credits have the best song.
5121000	5124000	I said after the song was over because the credits kept going.
5124000	5126000	Oh yeah, it does.
5126000	5130000	Alright, well before we get to release dates, let's do another story from Jamie.
5130000	5144000	Well, this is something about Capcom, especially about Resident Evil 7, also known as, I guess, PT-like, as the trailer indicates.
5144000	5146000	It's not even close.
5146000	5148000	Nothing is PT.
5148000	5149000	No.
5149000	5159000	So anyway, they are taking out certain things that we expected in the previous ones.
5159000	5161000	They're removing the quick time events.
5161000	5173000	There are no quick time events in this particular game, but they are going back to the roots of horror and exploration so that those are the primary focus.
5173000	5185000	There's still puzzle solving, still resource management, enemy combat, but none of those things that just don't work for the series.
5185000	5192000	So, hopefully we'll be able to see if it's any good.
5192000	5197000	And one thing that they did specify is that they haven't turned it into a ghost story.
5197000	5201000	It's just going to make sense by the time you get to the ending.
5202000	5205000	Shane, it sounds like you weren't super impressed by the demo.
5205000	5210000	I never got around to playing it because I felt that you would be very mad at me if I played it when you weren't around.
5210000	5213000	No, I just wanted to hear you scream.
5213000	5221000	It's just, I read that they said that they started this demo and this concept before PT was announced or whatever.
5221000	5223000	Even though I don't believe that.
5224000	5231000	It's just, everybody's trying to copy what PT did and some have better success than others.
5231000	5241000	And this Resident Evil demo, it's got some pretty creepy sounds that come out of nowhere, but on the whole it is not scary.
5241000	5247000	It's kind of just annoying. There's items in it that you have no use for in the demo.
5248000	5256000	It's not like stuff hasn't been figured out. Everything has been figured out about that demo according to stuff that Capcom has said.
5256000	5262000	So it's like, why did you put this item in here? There's no great big mystery like there is in PT.
5262000	5271000	PT set up a great atmosphere. It's very scary. This Resident Evil demo doesn't deliver on either of those fronts.
5272000	5277000	It's a shame because that trailer during Sony's press conference was really exciting.
5277000	5281000	And even starting out the game watching it was pretty exciting.
5281000	5285000	But then it just kind of goes nowhere and is not that great.
5285000	5290000	Yeah, it was one of the few trailers that are in there that was like, what? That's Resident Evil?
5290000	5293000	Yeah, I was like, oh, somebody picked up PT.
5293000	5299000	I called that it was Call of Duty when I saw that because it just looks like it should be Call of Duty.
5299000	5308000	But no, I don't know. I just don't feel like they are going to be making a good game.
5318000	5327000	That's fine and I don't disagree. But if you're going to make it like PT, make it good enough to live up to that.
5327000	5335000	Don't phone it in in a way. They tried to obviously go for something very realistic looking like PT did.
5335000	5345000	And a lot of stuff in there does not look nearly as good as PT which came out two years ago or whatever at this point.
5345000	5352000	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things that will be coming out a lot sooner than Resident Evil 7 or PT for that matter.
5353000	5362000	This week we've got 7 Days to Die on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, God Eater Resurrection on PlayStation 4 and Vita,
5362000	5369000	Grand Kingdom on PlayStation 4 and Vita, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Eyes of Heaven on PlayStation 4,
5369000	5382000	Lego's Star Wars The Force Awakens on PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U, and 3DS on all those wonderful platforms,
5382000	5390000	Prison Architect on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the remaster of Resident Evil 5 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
5391000	5399000	Star Ocean Integrity and Faithlessness on PlayStation 4, Terraria finally coming out on Wii U,
5399000	5408000	The Technomancer on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Zero Time Dilemma on Vita and 3DS,
5408000	5419000	Inside on Xbox One, and then finally BoxBox Boy and 3DS, Super Robot Wars Original Generation,
5419000	5424000	The Moon Dwellers on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, and Zero Time Dilemma on PC.
5425000	5440000	Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there on the release date of June 30th would be the next release date.
5440000	5446000	We have on PlayStation 4 Super Robot Wars OG The Moon Dwellers in regular and limited edition.
5446000	5451000	The Walking Dead Season 2 gets its release, which is brought to you by Square Enix over in Japan, which I think is interesting.
5451000	5457000	Also some best editions for Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition.
5457000	5465000	There's also a limited edition of Dragon's Dogma Online Season 2. That is all on the PlayStation 4 this week.
5465000	5474000	On the Wii U this week, nothing in Japan. It's kind of a dry period for the Wii U, as most weeks tend to be.
5475000	5484000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, Zatai Kaiku Gakuen comes out this week, as well as Zero Escape Toki no Dilemma comes out.
5484000	5495000	And lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week, there's a Shovel Knight Amiibo set coming out this week, and Zero Escape Toki no Dilemma is also out on the 3DS.
5495000	5503000	So there you go. There's also a bunch of accessories with Kirby Robobo on it, so you can look for that.
5503000	5509000	A lot of stuff releasing for that game, although I believe that game has already come out in Japan, as it has here.
5509000	5511000	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
5511000	5517000	On the 28th, we have Prison Architect for PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360, and bless you.
5517000	5519000	Thank you.
5519000	5527000	On June 30th, we have Box Box Boy for 3DS, and the incredible adventures of Van Helsing 2 for Xbox One.
5527000	5529000	And that is all.
5529000	5534000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
5534000	5536000	So this is kind of neat.
5536000	5549000	Oculus has finally removed some of its DRM from their VR, not really their games, but the actual Oculus drivers that they have running.
5549000	5558000	Before they had something in place where it basically would not allow you to run certain apps to actually be able to revive,
5558000	5564000	which allow you to run those Oculus games on non-Oculus systems.
5564000	5571000	So now with that, they've removed the DRM, and I guess now you can do that again.
5571000	5578000	So that was part of Oculus Runtime 1.5. They added that check.
5578000	5581000	I guess they realized they were not going to get around people.
5582000	5588000	It's nice. I understand they're still going to have their Oculus exclusives and stuff.
5588000	5598000	I hope we get to a point some point soon where they treat those devices more like monitors than they do actual gaming platforms.
5598000	5603000	And just open it up for everybody, because you're going to get more games that way.
5604000	5613000	Let's see, going to chat, Bobby Blackwolf, our resident VR expert here at VOG Network, says there's still DRM, it's just not a hardware check anymore.
5613000	5615000	SteamVR is already open.
5616000	5620000	So, no more is it trying to ensure that you're playing with...
5620000	5623000	Yeah, you have like an Oculus Rift and stuff. Yeah, that's what I meant.
5623000	5625000	Basically locking it down.
5625000	5632000	Hey, are you a fan of the new Mortal Kombat game and how it brings all these horror...
5632000	5634000	No!
5634000	5636000	No, you're not a fan of Jason.
5636000	5638000	I think it's dumb.
5638000	5642000	They're cool, but it's a little weird sometimes. That's all they kind of fill it in with.
5642000	5652000	I like the mythos of Mortal Kombat itself. Don't drag in things from our entertainment industry like horror slasher monster guys.
5652000	5659000	Unless, of course, you want to add PBS characters into that, like Barney and Caillou and stuff.
5659000	5660000	Mr. Rogers?
5660000	5662000	Well, Mr. Rogers might be a little sensitive.
5662000	5663000	King Friday?
5663000	5664000	King Friday.
5665000	5667000	Noah Lane, she was a bitch.
5669000	5675000	Put a Lane in there and let's see, Oscar the Grouch. I like this.
5675000	5676000	Oscar the Grouch?
5676000	5677000	Bob Ross.
5679000	5681000	He's going to beat the devil out of you.
5681000	5682000	Yes, he is.
5682000	5683000	That'd be awesome.
5684000	5687000	Dar Sager, would you play this fight? Would you play PBS fighters?
5688000	5691000	Who would be your character in PBS fighters?
5691000	5696000	If you could do PBS fighters, technically any of the Doctor Who cast could be involved.
5696000	5698000	From the 80s and 70s.
5698000	5699000	Okay.
5699000	5703000	Maybe back to the 60s. I don't know if they started with the 60s series on PBS.
5703000	5708000	But the fourth Doctor would just give everyone Jelly Babies as a taunt.
5708000	5711000	And then land the TARDIS on them. I don't know.
5711000	5716000	I'm changing my answer then. If we're taking any PBS show, I'm going to roll with Math Man.
5717000	5718000	From Square One.
5718000	5720000	Okay, I was thinking of that.
5720000	5722000	Or one of the people from Math Net.
5722000	5726000	But then I thought of one even better, and I want to be the chief from Carmen Sandiego.
5726000	5727000	You see, I thought about that.
5727000	5728000	Yes!
5728000	5731000	Or one of the villains. I'll be Double Trouble.
5731000	5733000	You should just be Carmen Sandiego.
5734000	5735000	Or...
5735000	5736000	For Rockapella.
5737000	5738000	Or...
5738000	5743000	Because a lot of British TV shows, you could just land the entirety of Faulty Towers on it.
5744000	5747000	Loki, did you think of a character you'd want to be in PBS Fighters?
5748000	5750000	No, I haven't really thought of anything.
5750000	5754000	But if you want to be funny, you could do a character from Are You Being Served?
5755000	5759000	No, I think for a PBS fighting game, let's see.
5759000	5760000	I would pick...
5761000	5768000	I don't know. Do you guys think that PBS Fighters from Ed Boon may be an actual OLR dream game?
5768000	5770000	Wait, I know I watched it on Amazon.
5770000	5772000	I think so. I vote for PBS Fighters as a dream game.
5772000	5774000	PBS Fighters is a seconded.
5774000	5775000	Alright.
5775000	5779000	I watched it on Amazon, but isn't Downton Abbey on PBS? Can I please be Maggie Smith?
5779000	5781000	Yes, Downton Abbey is on PBS.
5781000	5782000	I love Downton Abbey, oh my god.
5782000	5784000	All she has to do is stand there and make snarky quips.
5784000	5785000	God, everybody would die so quick.
5786000	5789000	Alright, it's official. PBS Fighters is an OLR dream game.
5789000	5793000	Oh, I don't know who to main now. Am I going to be Math Man or Maggie Smith?
5793000	5795000	I don't even feel like reading this story anymore.
5795000	5799000	People who know how to do stuff in Moogen, it could happen.
5800000	5806000	Alright, well anyway, I guess this subpar idea that Ed Boon is tossing around there...
5806000	5809000	This story is worthless. Just move on. We made it better.
5809000	5816000	Alright, look, somebody asked if he would do a fighting game with all the horror movie franchise icons,
5816000	5821000	and he was like, you know, fan feedback, but if the demand is there, we're always listening.
5821000	5822000	I would play it.
5823000	5824000	I would still play it too.
5824000	5829000	The answer is yes, we'd like to do that, but licensing costs money, so yeah.
5829000	5836000	But think about it now though. You've already seen certain types of characters in Killer Instinct.
5836000	5847000	If they can make an onryo in Killer Instinct work, then that instantly gives us an entire series of Japanese horror flick series.
5847000	5849000	So, it could happen.
5849000	5850000	It could happen.
5850000	5855000	SSG100Matt says, I had a friend that was on Carmen Sandiego.
5855000	5858000	She made it to the end, but she didn't catch Carmen, so she could...
5858000	5865000	Did she get fucking stuck with the Africa map or like one of the ones that's like impossible that nobody could ever beat?
5865000	5868000	Because yeah, that's horrible.
5868000	5872000	But, I would like to ask this question since we're talking about game shows.
5872000	5877000	How am I now 38 years old and I've never been on a game show?
5877000	5879000	You technically were.
5879000	5880000	When?
5880000	5882000	You were in the Audience of the Price is Right.
5882000	5885000	Okay, I was in the Audience of the Price is Right for two episodes, but I wasn't picked.
5885000	5887000	But I saw you on TV.
5887000	5889000	I recorded that shit for you.
5889000	5890000	That was a lot.
5890000	5893000	Okay, guys, that was before OLR when that happened.
5893000	5895000	That was a long time ago.
5895000	5896000	I recorded that for you.
5896000	5899000	Well, technically, I mean, we've been on the news.
5899000	5901000	I mean, that's sort of...
5901000	5902000	That's not game show.
5902000	5904000	I was in a deleted scene of RuPaul's Drag Race.
5904000	5907000	So, if you do consider Drag Race a game show, I guess I was.
5907000	5910000	But I wasn't a contestant.
5910000	5912000	Not that season.
5914000	5917000	But, did you know that one of the things our show...
5917000	5920000	Not that I should be reminding listeners of other things they can listen to live,
5920000	5922000	but our show right now...
5922000	5925000	Like, fuck Game of Thrones. I know everybody's losing their shit.
5925000	5928000	No, I can't look at Twitter right now because it's apparently a really good episode.
5928000	5930000	Fuck that show.
5930000	5932000	I don't watch the show, but I read the spoilers.
5932000	5934000	Oh my god!
5934000	5936000	Okay, that's it. We're not talking about it.
5936000	5938000	Stop. I watch the show.
5938000	5941000	Hold the door for a minute. I'm not done with the conversation.
5941000	5943000	I see what you did there.
5943000	5945000	That was super lame.
5945000	5947000	That's like an old person joke.
5947000	5948000	Fuck off.
5948000	5951000	But, we're up against on ABC tonight.
5951000	5954000	There is a three-hour block.
5954000	5959000	The first hour, Celebrity Family Feud, which really is just the Steve Harvey show.
5959000	5963000	We all know that, you know, we never thought Richard Dawson could be topped,
5963000	5965000	but Steve Harvey does an amazing job.
5965000	5974000	Hour two is the $100,000 pyramid with Michael Stram, from Kelly and Michael.
5974000	5976000	He's not there anymore, so...
5976000	5979000	Well, yeah, he's not there anymore. He's doing the $100,000 pyramid.
5979000	5981000	The $100,000... Not the $100,000 pyramid.
5981000	5983000	The $100,000 pyramid.
5983000	5990000	That was gross.
5990000	5992000	I don't mind it now.
5992000	5994000	The $100,000 period hosted by Maury Povich.
5994000	5996000	You are not the father.
5996000	6002000	And then lastly, the third hour is the match game with Alec Baldwin.
6002000	6004000	Who are the celebrities?
6004000	6008000	I think the first episode is Rosie O'Donnell is one of them.
6008000	6010000	I'm sure Gilbert Gottfried's in there somewhere.
6010000	6014000	The one that caught my eye was Titus Bergeron from...
6014000	6017000	What's his name? Titus... The guy from... Kimmy Schmidt.
6017000	6018000	Nice.
6018000	6021000	Yeah, I think you're thinking Tom Bergeron when you said that.
6021000	6022000	No, Titus...
6022000	6023000	No, I know, but...
6023000	6025000	No, that's the name of the show.
6025000	6026000	No, I know, but the last...
6026000	6027000	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
6027000	6030000	I'm going to stand here and be clueless because I've never watched that.
6030000	6033000	Oh my god, you need to be watching that show.
6033000	6035000	Oh, Alan's here! Hi, Alan!
6035000	6037000	Hello, I just walked through the door with groceries
6037000	6040000	and I overheard you talking about Steve Harvey's Family Feud.
6040000	6042000	The subtitle of that is just...
6042000	6044000	It should just be called White People Are Nasty.
6044000	6049000	Because it's just some white mom being, like, an erection
6049000	6051000	and then it's on the board and Steve Harvey goes to church.
6051000	6053000	Like, that's what the show is.
6053000	6054000	Yeah, but that shit is funny.
6054000	6056000	Like, every time somebody shares that on Facebook,
6056000	6058000	I laugh and I laugh and I laugh.
6058000	6059000	It's great.
6059000	6061000	Alright, anyway...
6062000	6067000	So, anyway, my whole point of that was why haven't I been on a game show yet?
6067000	6069000	I need that to happen.
6069000	6070000	I think that should be my dream.
6070000	6073000	Before I'm 40, I need to be on a game show.
6073000	6075000	Move to Burbank.
6076000	6077000	Bye, Rob.
6077000	6078000	Alright.
6078000	6081000	Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?
6083000	6084000	Let's go back to a simpler time.
6084000	6087000	Let's go back to a year when I was on The Price is Right
6087000	6089000	in the audience
6089000	6092000	with a tag that said my legal name on it
6092000	6095000	because you couldn't use your middle name
6095000	6097000	because of reasons if you won the prize.
6097000	6100000	Anyway, it's a classic game of the week
6100000	6102000	and Dark Sakura chooses a game that she thinks,
6102000	6106000	Hey, look, you brats in your fucking Mighty No. 9.
6106000	6107000	Yeah.
6107000	6110000	You need to go back to Mighty No. of the year 2000 and play this.
6110000	6112000	You need to wave your hands around and do stuff.
6112000	6114000	Wave your hands like you just don't care.
6114000	6115000	Oh, I'm so excited to hear this.
6115000	6120000	Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
6120000	6123000	The classic game of the week is Dance Maniacs.
6123000	6126000	Because I think I've done for most anniversary shows,
6126000	6128000	I picked a Bimani game.
6128000	6129000	I was like, you're on a Bimani kick lately.
6129000	6130000	You just did one last week.
6130000	6133000	I did Papa Music because I play Papa Music.
6133000	6135000	So I picked Dance Maniacs.
6135000	6137000	Oh, I almost picked Diablo.
6137000	6138000	But...
6138000	6140000	Yeah, it's an anniversary show.
6140000	6141000	This is a better choice.
6141000	6142000	Do Diablo next week.
6142000	6143000	Maybe.
6143000	6147000	Now I'm going to forget all about Diablo and just do nothing but Bimani.
6147000	6149000	So, Dance Maniacs.
6149000	6152000	It was from, of course, a Bimani game.
6152000	6155000	It was published by Konami when they didn't suck.
6155000	6157000	And it uses...
6157000	6161000	Most of the songs come from the Dance Mania series of music.
6161000	6163000	And it has plenty in common with DDR.
6163000	6165000	It came out in March 2000.
6165000	6169000	And it was a fairly unique kind of game when it came out.
6169000	6177000	I like to think of this as the weird grandparent of Para Para Paradise.
6177000	6178000	I'm sorry.
6178000	6181000	Every time I hear this song, which is in Dance Maniacs...
6181000	6182000	I love this song.
6182000	6183000	Okay, but I think of Sister Act.
6183000	6184000	Me too.
6184000	6186000	Every single time without fail.
6186000	6190000	Especially since the video for it is all doves flying into sunshine.
6190000	6192000	It's fucking Sister Act.
6192000	6194000	I reject it as a Bimani song.
6194000	6196000	It's always a Sister Act soundtrack song.
6196000	6197000	Okay.
6197000	6198000	Sorry.
6198000	6201000	You've got eight different sensors.
6201000	6204000	You've got a set of four on top and a set of four in the middle.
6204000	6210000	And so you can do two player side by side on each of the little diagonals.
6210000	6213000	You can play in center mode for solo.
6213000	6214000	And then...
6214000	6215000	Which is how I prefer to play.
6215000	6219000	Or you can do two player at the same time.
6219000	6222000	So, basically...
6222000	6226000	And there's also doubles play where you can use all eight sensors.
6227000	6229000	So they're all predefined courses.
6229000	6231000	You have different options for difficulty.
6231000	6234000	And quite a few songs to choose from.
6234000	6239000	But you also have some other goodies in there too.
6239000	6241000	Like picking...
6244000	6246000	I just lost my train of thought.
6246000	6249000	I'm sorry, the extra modes came in second mix.
6249000	6253000	But I will go back to the first mix.
6253000	6255000	It doesn't stick in with that one.
6255000	6260000	So the way that you play, you have the pink lanes for the upper sensors.
6260000	6262000	And the blue ones for the under.
6262000	6264000	And so you have to go...
6264000	6267000	You know, basically the pink ones are for...
6267000	6269000	You go high for the blue ones, you go low.
6269000	6273000	I mean, just watch a video of someone playing it and looking really dumb.
6273000	6275000	There are some people though who can do it really awesome.
6275000	6277000	Who like will use their legs and everything.
6277000	6278000	It's pretty neat.
6278000	6279000	You had to when you had to hit three at once?
6279000	6280000	Well, yeah.
6280000	6281000	Some of them.
6281000	6282000	That was some knees right there.
6282000	6284000	Yep.
6284000	6289000	And so you either finish all the songs in the course or you die.
6289000	6291000	Like meet the key to it.
6291000	6295000	Now in second mix we got marathon mode.
6295000	6298000	Which only had songs that were in second mix.
6298000	6304000	And so basically you just had to continuously keep your bar up.
6304000	6309000	Convos with at least a thousand will show fever after the number of combos.
6310000	6315000	And then there was also the second mix Append Jay Paradise.
6315000	6319000	And it included the songs from first mix with it.
6319000	6322000	But you could only choose three of those titles in the marathon mode.
6322000	6324000	So...
6324000	6329000	And the marathon courses could be up to...
6329000	6331000	25 I think it was.
6331000	6334000	But it could be set by the operator of the arcade.
6334000	6336000	How long marathon mode lasted.
6336000	6337000	So...
6337000	6340000	And of course it gets hard.
6340000	6344000	I think I've only made it like seven songs in on marathon.
6344000	6349000	This YouTube that you have up has somebody going for 25 stages.
6349000	6350000	Yeah.
6350000	6351000	It's over a half hour.
6351000	6352000	I've made it like...
6352000	6353000	I think in a full combo.
6353000	6355000	I've made like 20 minutes in some of the marathon modes.
6355000	6360000	And then the thing with Dance Maniacs is it hurts if you mess up.
6360000	6363000	Like you break your wrist and your hands.
6363000	6365000	I've hit my hands way too many times on the sensors.
6365000	6366000	I actually have...
6366000	6369000	Like I was trying to build a home brew Dance Maniacs cabinet one time.
6369000	6370000	So I have some of the sensors.
6370000	6374000	And those suckers are fucking solid metal.
6374000	6375000	It's just...
6375000	6378000	You can kill somebody with one of those sensors.
6378000	6380000	Also I fucking love this song.
6380000	6381000	Which one is it?
6381000	6382000	Mind Parasite.
6382000	6384000	I had to repost it on my Facebook.
6384000	6387000	Dance Maniacs has some of the best music.
6387000	6390000	Whether it be Crossover or from the Dance Maniacs.
6390000	6391000	It's got Body.
6391000	6393000	It's got Gorgeous 2012.
6393000	6394000	It has Wanda.
6394000	6395000	It's got Sky High.
6395000	6399000	It's got cool remixes of Upside Down and Boom Boom Dollar.
6399000	6400000	Oh the music is so good.
6400000	6402000	I still laugh about Sky High.
6402000	6407000	Because when I was in high school we had the sheet music for that marching band.
6407000	6408000	And I remember...
6408000	6409000	Oh did I say...
6409000	6410000	I didn't mean Sky High.
6410000	6411000	I'm sorry.
6411000	6412000	It has Hot Limit.
6412000	6413000	I don't think it has Sky High.
6413000	6414000	Hot...
6414000	6415000	No.
6415000	6416000	Sky High was solo wasn't it?
6416000	6417000	Sky High...
6417000	6418000	Depends on which Sky High.
6418000	6420000	I thought they had Sky High in one of them.
6420000	6422000	There were two songs called Sky High.
6422000	6426000	I'm thinking of the one that was the remake of the 70s song.
6426000	6427000	That one.
6427000	6429000	Yeah that's the remake of the 70s song.
6429000	6431000	Is that in Dance Maniacs?
6431000	6433000	I meant to say Hot Limit.
6433000	6434000	I know that.
6434000	6436000	Hot Limit and Wanda is what I meant to say.
6436000	6441000	Well anyway the music pretty much as we have gone over and over.
6441000	6444000	Pretty much came from all the Dance Mania series.
6444000	6452000	They had to deal with Toshiba, EMI to basically freely license any track they wanted to.
6452000	6458000	And then of course they had the Bimani core ones too.
6458000	6463000	So Dance Maniacs first released in 2000 with 26 songs.
6463000	6469000	Dance Maniacs second mix had 28 new songs and 25 from the original Dance Maniacs.
6469000	6470000	So 53 total.
6470000	6474000	The only song that did not come over was My Sharona by DJ Mico.
6474000	6487000	Dance Maniacs second mix appended JParadise added 14 new songs that were a good portion from Dance Mania JParadise.
6487000	6494000	And then they had a secret song Paranoia Jazzy Groove plus Trip Machine Climax Dead End Sink Edit.
6494000	6497000	Plus Dead End Sink Edit.
6497000	6498000	So I'm getting all crazy.
6498000	6507000	But these were only in there as I believe custom made steps.
6507000	6510000	And then of course there was the Korean released Dance Freaks.
6510000	6513000	They came out in 2000 with 33 songs.
6513000	6521000	There were the original 26 plus 7 licensed Korean songs that were particular to that version.
6521000	6523000	Some of them are really good songs. I'm looking at them right now.
6523000	6525000	Cause I recognize them from Pump.
6526000	6529000	I don't see Sky High by the way.
6529000	6532000	I meant to say Hot Limit. I don't know why I said Sky High.
6532000	6535000	But I'm looking at the soundtrack or the list right now.
6535000	6544000	This game had probably the best percentages of amazing songs compared to crappy songs.
6544000	6547000	Sanctus? Come on.
6547000	6550000	And what else did I see on here?
6550000	6551000	Quickening?
6551000	6553000	This is the one that gave us Together in Forever.
6553000	6554000	What?
6554000	6559000	So it also gave us, I think Together in Forever was only in this one for the longest time.
6559000	6561000	Has Johnny John-Ahh?
6561000	6562000	Yeah.
6562000	6563000	So good.
6563000	6567000	And we had some of the great stuff from Beatmania.
6567000	6569000	From the early Beatmania.
6569000	6571000	Quickening.
6571000	6575000	We had different remixes of the other Bimani these days.
6575000	6576000	Doctor Love.
6576000	6584000	There were the remixes of, I'm thinking of Matsuri.
6584000	6588000	Happy Hopper was like another of my favorites in this one.
6588000	6590000	But it always gave me a headache.
6590000	6593000	But you had Virtual Mind and Paranoia and just all kinds of stuff.
6593000	6595000	Mobo Mogu is in here?
6595000	6597000	Yep. Mobo Mogu. Tokyo already.
6597000	6600000	But you know, that was like a lot of my favorite Para Para music.
6601000	6606000	So I really think that this could seriously be considered the immediate precursor to Para Para Paradise.
6606000	6608000	There's so much Eurobeat in here.
6608000	6610000	So much Super Eurobeat.
6610000	6612000	We make some dumb Dariram.
6612000	6614000	It used to be like my DDR song too.
6614000	6616000	I miss this game a lot.
6616000	6618000	Do you think I could buy a machine for cheap?
6618000	6620000	My friend bought one for pretty cheap.
6620000	6621000	Really?
6621000	6622000	Yeah, he has one.
6622000	6623000	I might buy one. What do you think?
6623000	6624000	I want one.
6624000	6627000	Yeah, and then just make sure that you have good hand insurance.
6628000	6629000	I was going to say...
6629000	6631000	Wear boxing gloves when you play.
6631000	6633000	There's a Facebook group.
6633000	6635000	It's Shonagan's Arcade.
6635000	6637000	They do a lot of like, here's a machine.
6637000	6642000	They had a fucking DDR Extreme for $350 in the Bay Area.
6642000	6644000	What was wrong with it?
6644000	6647000	I was like, I think one of the sides was messed up.
6647000	6649000	But it's probably simple to fix.
6653000	6656000	Alright, well, DarkSocker, anything else you want to say about Dance Maniacs?
6657000	6659000	I hope I like this song too.
6659000	6663000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6663000	6665000	Dance Maniacs.
6666000	6669000	Alright, that's going to do it for this first half of the show.
6669000	6670000	We've got plenty more show to come.
6670000	6672000	We're going to do some rapid fire news when we get back.
6672000	6674000	Yes, a FUCL Question of the Week and Listless.
6674000	6676000	Okay, y'all ready for the Listless topic this week?
6676000	6679000	So you can be brainstorming during the break.
6679000	6680000	Or should I tease them?
6680000	6681000	Should I give it when we get back?
6681000	6682000	Do you think...
6682000	6685000	Tease them a little. Give them a little pinch.
6685000	6690000	Alright, tonight's topic will be about Konami.
6690000	6694000	And I'm going to tell you specifically what when we come back.
6694000	6696000	With more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6702000	6705000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6705000	6712000	Live tonight on June the 26th of 2016 with episode number 647 of our show.
6713000	6716000	Our 14th anniversary show already in progress.
6716000	6719000	Myself, DarkSakura, and Loki here as always.
6719000	6722000	Joined by one of our most frequent contributors here on the show.
6722000	6724000	Shane is joining us in the studio tonight.
6724000	6728000	And of course while the show is going on, he is on his 3DS doing what?
6728000	6729000	Shiny hunting.
6729000	6730000	Looking for shinies.
6730000	6733000	I need my shiny Pawnyard that's a male.
6733000	6735000	And you've already found what, two during the show, right?
6735000	6737000	Two female shiny Pawnyards.
6737000	6740000	And that just makes me want to punch a baby.
6743000	6746000	Oh Shane, Shane, Shane. Alright.
6746000	6751000	You don't understand, when he evolves he looks like a Mega Man character.
6751000	6755000	And I want a blue Mega Man character so bad.
6755000	6758000	You're right, I don't understand.
6758000	6762000	He looks like a cross between like Metal Man, Quick Man, and Flash Man at that point.
6762000	6768000	I'm still trying to collect all eight badges as I go through Alpha Sapphire.
6768000	6772000	Hey, I'm further than I've been in a Pokemon game before.
6772000	6775000	But you're still not even close to done.
6775000	6778000	Well guys, do you know what Shane said to me?
6778000	6784000	Is that if I beat a Pokemon game, and like it, which that's easy to lie about.
6784000	6786000	No, I can tell.
6786000	6790000	Then Shane will go to the next Rocky Horror Picture Show.
6790000	6791000	Yes I will.
6791000	6794000	Because I know it's an empty threat.
6795000	6798000	Which we did one of those last night, by the way.
6798000	6800000	I don't get a chance.
6800000	6803000	Oh and see, had you beaten Pokemon and liked it, I could have gone last night.
6803000	6807000	It was a fight. They did a Disney hybrid crossover show. It was really funny.
6807000	6810000	I don't know because I wasn't there because you didn't beat Pokemon.
6810000	6812000	I just need to do a PBS crossover show.
6812000	6815000	Oh my god, do a Allen Abbey one and I'll probably just go for the fun of it.
6815000	6818000	They're trying to think of what theme they want to do for next year.
6818000	6820000	So maybe that's one I'm going to pitch.
6820000	6823000	Why not characters from your childhood?
6824000	6826000	Call it ruin my childhood.
6826000	6828000	Ruin my childhood night.
6829000	6831000	I love it.
6831000	6837000	Alright, let us get some rapid fire news done and then we're going to get to our list list tonight.
6837000	6839000	Let's do rapid fire first.
6839000	6847000	Alright, so this should come no surprise to you, but Res Infinite has been confirmed to be releasing on October 13th.
6847000	6850000	Which is the launch date for the PlayStation VR.
6850000	6854000	I mean, it is a launch title, so I guess that makes sense.
6854000	6857000	I definitely will be checking this out.
6857000	6864000	I missed, they were doing some new, what is it, PlayStation VR tests over at some of the local Best Buys.
6864000	6869000	And they expanded it from like 10 locations or wherever they had to like 300 or something.
6869000	6873000	And so there was one actually nearby, but I did not make it out to it.
6873000	6878000	I mean, they're going on again too because I know the GameStop near me is doing it again.
6878000	6880000	The Best Buy near me is doing it again.
6880000	6882000	So there's going to be more chances at least.
6882000	6887000	Yeah, I just want to check it out. I mean, I already have it pre-ordered, but it would be kind of cool just to see how it is.
6887000	6888000	Oh, it's so good.
6888000	6898000	I'm just curious to compare it to the Oculus Rift DK2 that I've got and the Gear VR and just kind of see what theirs looks like.
6899000	6900000	That's it.
6900000	6906000	But yeah, so definitely one of the games I'll probably be picking up at launch.
6906000	6909000	They're also saying, of course, there's new content, which is that Area X.
6909000	6911000	No idea what that means.
6911000	6919000	You know what other game I kind of wish they would also release as well is, what is it, Child of Eden along with that.
6919000	6925000	You know, maybe if Rez sells well enough, they'll do that because I don't think a lot of people got to experience Child of Eden.
6926000	6932000	Because who wanted to play it with a Kinect? Because I tried it, I didn't like it.
6932000	6937000	I had eBay bucks because you buy stuff on eBay or sell stuff and you buy stuff on eBay and they give you eBay bucks.
6937000	6942000	And I have like $5 to spend before it expired like that day.
6942000	6945000	And I was like, crap, I got to get something for $5.
6945000	6947000	So I searched for games for $5.
6947000	6958000	Child of Eden. Sorry, yes. Child of Eden DLC code for $5. Best $5 I've ever spent.
6958000	6966000	I have the PS3 one at home and I don't remember even playing it because I think at that point I was just like, I want to play Rez.
6966000	6970000	But if I could play it in 3D in VR, I would be super excited.
6970000	6973000	Definitely a nice Rez-ish type of game.
6974000	6978000	I'm looking forward to more Rez, but I'd like more games like that as well.
6979000	6981000	Rez in VR is really trippy. You'll have a good time.
6981000	6983000	Yeah, definitely. It'll be cool.
6983000	6992000	And this is kind of disappointing because, you know, I love Criterion and I was kind of curious to see what this was since they're not making, you know, a Burnout game.
6992000	7000000	But Criterion's, you know, they have that kind of extreme sports type game that was supposed to be coming out that they're developing.
7000000	7007000	And unfortunately, that's not going to happen because EA has canceled the project.
7007000	7015000	Yeah, so, you know, while they basically moved on from a previous project that they've spoken about and they aren't pursuing it,
7015000	7023000	they are continuing to build new ideas and experiment with new IP for EA in addition to continuing to collaborate with other studios.
7024000	7030000	But honestly, the reason for that apparently was that they're working on more Star Wars stuff.
7031000	7039000	Which I'm like, I like Star Wars, but I like Burnout a whole fuck ton more than Star Wars.
7039000	7042000	So I would appreciate them doing something more allow-
7042000	7046000	Let's get, we're going to get burnt out on the Star Wars shit after a while.
7046000	7048000	Yeah, I might ration the Star Wars shit a little more.
7049000	7052000	Because I'm starting to get, I'm already kind of burnt out on it.
7053000	7061000	Well, something that we as gamers don't seem to ever get burned out on is Pac-Man games since, you know, one was just released this week.
7061000	7065000	But, you know, although Pac-Man 256 is, you know, it's okay for five bucks.
7065000	7069000	I would be very excited if this series, in fact, is continuing.
7069000	7072000	And apparently it is Pac-Man Championship Edition.
7072000	7080000	That's right, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 has apparently been spotted on a South Korea video games rating board website.
7080000	7086000	And sometimes these rating boards things do tend to spill the secrets on what's about to be released.
7086000	7091000	Well, the sequel would be for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7091000	7097000	And I got to say that Pac-Man Championship Deluxe, great soundtrack for one.
7097000	7099000	And I hope, I hope they get the same people doing the soundtrack again.
7099000	7102000	And just such a fun Pac-Man game.
7102000	7109000	I really like, you know, going back to play the old Pac-Man, it's one of those things that I can just play in short bursts.
7109000	7113000	And it's kind of like, oh, yay, nostalgia. But, you know, I can't really play it for a long, long, long time.
7113000	7118000	But Championship Edition is that good. I love Championship Edition.
7118000	7122000	And stopping in the chat room is actually saying it's Championship Edition DX 2.
7122000	7126000	Which would make sense because DX was kind of the souped up version.
7126000	7129000	And so that's the one that would deserve a sequel.
7129000	7131000	So I hope it's true. I hope it happens.
7131000	7135000	Another plug and play console, speaking of retro stuff.
7135000	7140000	I'm going to be bringing Data East and Capcom Arcade Games home.
7140000	7146000	Something called, I guess, the Generations Plug and Play Console. It's by Retro-Bit.
7146000	7149000	It's going to have 60 classic games on it.
7149000	7153000	You know the plug and play things, right? It's like the joystick. You just plug it right in your TV.
7153000	7159000	1942 and 1943, Captain Commando, Ghosts and Goblins, Gun.Smoke.
7159000	7161000	Not to be confused with the TV show.
7161000	7167000	Higemaru, Knights of the Round, Sun Sun, Ring King. That's awesome.
7167000	7170000	These are some real great classics.
7170000	7176000	So we'll have to see if that is a worthy package, what the price is on that. I'm not sure.
7176000	7180000	It will have both composite and HDMI outputs.
7180000	7185000	And the controller is apparently a Sega Genesis 6 button style controller.
7185000	7188000	So, yeah, I'll be curious how much that's going to cost.
7188000	7191000	I'd like to check that out. It will be fun.
7191000	7193000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
7193000	7198000	For one thing, Bondo, sorry, Bonda, Bondo.
7198000	7206000	Yeah, no, Bondi Namco has trademarks for amazing Katamari in Japan.
7206000	7210000	Well, Bondo is actually for fixing cars.
7210000	7216000	But they also, well, that's amazing Katamari Damacy in Europe.
7216000	7224000	And, of course, for Japan, Subarashiki Kana Katamari Damacy in Japan.
7224000	7229000	And then they have also trademarked amazing Katamari, filed on June 14th.
7229000	7231000	Ooh.
7231000	7241000	And then Wolfenstein The New Order developer, this is Machine Games, did a Quake level.
7241000	7244000	Like, old Quake.
7245000	7247000	Like Nine Inch Nails soundtrack Quake.
7247000	7251000	Yeah. So, you can get a copy of Quake.
7251000	7256000	Or if you don't already have it, or if you already have it, you import it into your Steam library.
7256000	7260000	You download the episode package, extract it into the Quake folder.
7260000	7264000	You right click on Quake in your Steam library, select properties.
7264000	7271000	And then your launch option should be, you type minus game space D-O-P-A into the prompt.
7271000	7274000	And so, it's just called DOPA.
7274000	7275000	There you go.
7275000	7279000	Awesome. Nice little hidden thing all these years later.
7279000	7282000	Well, hidden, it's brand new.
7282000	7287000	Well, no, no, I mean, like, you know, but you have to do that whole command line thing to get in there, I guess.
7287000	7289000	No, the command line thing's just in Steam anyway.
7289000	7290000	Oh.
7290000	7294000	It's, you can always set your game properties for things that you don't want to open, like windowed versus unwindowed.
7294000	7298000	Or for running particular games with cheats or scripts.
7298000	7301000	You can tell them where to run them, so.
7301000	7306000	I don't really fool around with that stuff enough, but that makes, I know you use mods in some of your, like Dragon Age-ing, so that makes sense.
7306000	7312000	Well, and I import a lot of game, non-Steam games into my Steam library regularly, so.
7312000	7313000	Ah.
7313000	7315000	All right, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.
7323000	7326000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7326000	7331000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
7331000	7336000	This week, it's the one show a year we can be self-referential, because it's our birthday.
7336000	7338000	So we get to make it all about us.
7338000	7344000	So we ask the listeners simply, what do you want to see more of on our show in the future?
7344000	7346000	That was the FUGL question of the week.
7346000	7355000	And we also want to take an opportunity, of course, to thank everybody just for their support, you know, whether they've been here since episode one, Dark Tetsuya, or since, you know, 14 minutes ago.
7355000	7358000	So a big thanks to everybody for their support over the years.
7358000	7363000	So let's go to the answers on Facebook.
7363000	7365000	What do you want to see more of on OLR in the future?
7365000	7383000	Raginator says, I'd like to see a return of an accompanying video stream to the show, plus more talk about bacon, more Loki rants, and more sky, which is funny because he put skydive fits, which is kind of funny because skydive, but I think he meant to say diva fits.
7384000	7391000	Critical Myth says, I'd love to see a return of the various game shows that used to be a more regular fixture.
7391000	7393000	Well, boy, you're going to be excited tonight.
7393000	7397000	Blaze says, bring back the ferret.
7397000	7404000	It has been a very long, I think the ferret is out of juice and is sitting on top of my pile of books.
7404000	7407000	That's right, the ferret, the battery inside the ferret finally died.
7407000	7412000	It's living at my house, hanging out with my hot duffel boyfriend plushies and Monokuma.
7412000	7418000	Well, I'm sure you you're quite versed in sewing, so you could just cut that sucker open, change the batteries.
7418000	7420000	Why are you so sure I'm well versed in sewing?
7420000	7422000	Because you're making a costume.
7422000	7424000	Yeah, you always talk about cosplay.
7424000	7426000	I'm paying other people to sew shit for me.
7426000	7432000	I was going to say, but you've made like doll clothing and stuff like that. I don't think you can just staple that shit together.
7432000	7435000	I've stapled doll clothing together to make it.
7435000	7441000	You were trying to trap him into saying a woman, huh? You were trying to thinking it was that line of thinking. You talk about costuming a lot, though.
7441000	7446000	That's not what I'm thinking. Shit, my wife doesn't know how to fucking sew anything, so I never make that assumption.
7446000	7452000	I've sewn plushies and I can sew buttons on, but I was like, I'm not going to cut that thing open.
7452000	7459000	I have stapled those ferrets back because I did find some a long time ago that were sold.
7459000	7464000	I'm going on Amazon right now and looking for what are they called? Scoosies?
7464000	7469000	Scoosies, yeah. And I did find some, like a KV that was like, you know, discounted those things.
7469000	7475000	And all the batteries were dead, so I just cut them open, replaced the batteries, and we have like four of them. I don't know where they went.
7475000	7478000	Alright, let's see more answers over here.
7478000	7484000	Kane.I.Am in Facebook says, more Secret of Evermore and Chrono Trigger.
7484000	7487000	But seriously, just more of you all having fun.
7487000	7492000	Well maybe, I need to find a cartridge for Secret of Evermore and then I could do a live stream. That would be fun.
7492000	7493000	I have it.
7493000	7496000	People have done Chrono Trigger. I mean, whatever, but Secret of Evermore.
7496000	7497000	I have it.
7497000	7499000	Oh really? You should bring it over. It'd be fun.
7499000	7500000	Alright.
7500000	7512000	Andy R says, needs more listless, which by the way, I know it sounds like list list is what the segment sounds like, but it's actually called list less.
7512000	7517000	But when you say it really fast, I totally understand most people, but there actually is a pun there.
7517000	7524000	The segment's called list less, which by the, I don't know if you guys may or may not know this. It might be on the wiki.
7524000	7525000	I don't know. I haven't checked that in a while.
7525000	7536000	But list less is like the one segment that dates all the way back to my college radio show that I did like when I was in college.
7536000	7538000	So a very long time ago, but we would actually do this segment.
7538000	7542000	It wasn't about gaming topics, but we do it about like movies and other things.
7542000	7546000	So yeah, it's the one thing that's kind of lived on since that era.
7546000	7555000	Let's see. Retertainment in chat says, I can't think of anything good. Then again, I don't host a podcast, so I might not have any good ideas.
7555000	7563000	As far as bad ideas, an all emoji show. I can give everybody the middle finger emoji right now. There it is.
7563000	7564000	Yeah.
7564000	7565000	Alright.
7565000	7570000	Dark Tetsuya says, I think I agree with critical miss comment. More of the classic games, things we used to do.
7570000	7577000	Like there was a short lived one on the show, Orange Crush. I forgot about that one. That involved classic video game trivia.
7577000	7582000	Maybe we could come up with some new ones. I'd also like to second the vote for The Return of the Ferret.
7582000	7585000	Interesting. A lot of votes for game shows in that segment.
7585000	7589000	But also, I do want to not leave out Google Plus because we have a couple answers over there.
7589000	7596000	DNL replied on Google Plus. You saw her recently, didn't you? Dark soccer. I'm very jealous.
7596000	7602000	DNL says, first off, congrats on 14 wonderful years of OLR.
7602000	7605000	Every segment you guys do is awesome. Thank you.
7605000	7612000	But if I had to make a suggestion, I would say that I would love to hear reviews on game themed food and drinks.
7612000	7618000	I didn't know there was really enough of that out there. I suppose there's a lot of licensing for that stuff.
7618000	7625000	We did just have a 20 minute opening tonight about soda. So maybe that satisfied that a little bit. I don't know.
7625000	7628000	What game themed food and drinks is out there?
7628000	7634000	There's all those shots that people are making based off of video games and characters and whatnot.
7634000	7638000	I guess I'm just not seeing enough of that. I also don't do the energy drinks at all.
7638000	7642000	There's also the Skyrim cookbook. Isn't that a thing now?
7642000	7643000	I don't know.
7643000	7647000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says you can name the segment Geek Cuisine.
7647000	7654000	I think another show is actually already doing that. But that is also not specifically gaming related stuff.
7654000	7657000	I don't think these things are called skoozies.
7657000	7664000	The pod culture gang will do things like the Lays potato chips and things that are kind of in the pop culture stuff.
7664000	7666000	I'm finding ferret house toys.
7666000	7672000	One more from actdeft who says congrats guys. The road to the OLR quiceniera begins.
7672000	7677000	What I would like to see more of on the show, what you're doing right now is pretty much what I like.
7677000	7682000	If it isn't broken, don't fix it. But maybe more videos or streams of you guys would be nice.
7682000	7683000	That's another vote for video.
7683000	7687000	Rob, I found a penguin wearing a shirt that says I love ferret.
7687000	7689000	That's random.
7689000	7691000	It made me think of you immediately.
7691000	7696000	Alright, well thank you guys very much for the feedback on the Fugu question of the week.
7696000	7702000	Now several of you guys mentioned that you wanted to see more game shows.
7702000	7706000	So guess what you guys? I have some really good news for you tonight.
7706000	7713000	It's time to play Listless.
7713000	7718000	We haven't done this in quite a while, so here's the way Listless works.
7718000	7728000	Is that we are going to, by a highly scientific process, come up with the top three answers on a certain topic.
7728000	7732000	And this is going to be thanks in part to your vote.
7732000	7739000	So if you are listening live, I would encourage you to join our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
7739000	7747000	because you will be able to participate and actually vote on the responses and see this play out live over at live.vognetwork.com.
7747000	7751000	And you can actually, we'll start to fill out the board right there on the website and you can see this play out live.
7751000	7757000	So here's how it works. All of us here in studio will put our top three answers on the board.
7757000	7763000	Then we go to the elimination round where each host will take off one answer from the board.
7763000	7766000	It's painful, but it has to be done.
7766000	7776000	Under the renovation rules, if somebody loses two answers, their third answer becomes immune and cannot be eliminated from the board.
7776000	7782000	After we have our final eight, then we will go around and let you guys vote on your number one, your number two picks.
7782000	7786000	Again, you need to be logged into the VoG website at vognetwork.com and then you'll be able to vote.
7786000	7789000	Are you all ready for this week's topic?
7789000	7790000	Sure.
7790000	7802000	Here we go. The list we will be building tonight is ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again.
7802000	7809000	As you might remember, in the early days of this show, we used to be very much about DDR and BeatMania.
7809000	7812000	And you know what? Konami got a lot of free publicity out of this show.
7812000	7817000	But in recent years, things have changed a little bit.
7817000	7824000	Konami and we don't necessarily hype their stuff as much as we used to.
7824000	7825000	What stuff?
7825000	7826000	Well, there you go.
7826000	7835000	So what are the ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?
7835000	7845000	Now, if you guys have some suggestions in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sometimes the host will turn to chat and look there for some answers.
7845000	7847000	We're going to let our guest start tonight.
7847000	7849000	Shane is joining us.
7849000	7850000	Can't I just be last?
7850000	7851000	Nope, you get to be first.
7851000	7853000	But I don't have a good one yet.
7853000	7855000	Well, you've only had like 30 minutes to prepare.
7855000	7864000	So, Shane, what is your number three answer for what is the best way that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?
7864000	7867000	Konami sponsors the show and gives you guys a lot of money.
7867000	7871000	There, that's a garbage answer. Go ahead and throw it out.
7871000	7873000	Because I don't have enough time to come up with a better...
7873000	7876000	Well, no, my number one's really good. I'm still working on it.
7876000	7881000	For what it's worth, Konami giving us a lot of money is a decent...
7881000	7886000	I mean, I like money. I don't know about Dark Soccer and Loki, but I really like money.
7886000	7891000	They may just pay you in pachinko machines, but...
7891000	7897000	Alright, so there it is. There it is on the list. Konami sponsors us and gives us lots of money.
7897000	7901000	Alright, let's move on to... who do I have next on the board?
7901000	7903000	It looks like Loki is next on the board.
7903000	7912000	Loki, what is your number three answer for ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?
7912000	7916000	I just realized it's not live, so they actually can't see the board yet. There we go. Now you can see the board.
7916000	7919000	Loki, what is your number three answer?
7919000	7923000	If they actually gave a shit about Bomani again.
7923000	7926000	If they actually gave a shit about Bomani again?
7926000	7932000	Yeah, because they don't give a shit about anything unless it's pachinko.
7932000	7938000	What about, like, Sound Voltex and Musica and some of these other things that they're putting out now?
7938000	7942000	I don't see that coming out over here. I don't see that coming in the console.
7942000	7946000	Alright, fair enough. There it is. If they actually gave a shit about Bomani again. That is true.
7946000	7950000	Where's the 2DX home version? Like anything after Empress.
7950000	7953000	They have that PC one that's in Japan only.
7953000	7956000	Yeah, Japan only. There it is.
7956000	7963000	Alright, let's see. My number three answer is, speaking about pachinko, which is the easy joke here.
7963000	7967000	Take all the pachinko machines out back and shoot them.
7967000	7971000	That was my number three answer. Just take them out back, put them out of their misery.
7971000	7974000	Because we are sick of hearing about that shit.
7974000	7982000	There it is. Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer for ways that Konami can get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?
7982000	7989000	Since I'm not doing these in any particular order, I'm gonna say have them go, just kidding about P.T.
7993000	7995000	So the whole thing was a lie.
7995000	7997000	An elaborate hoax.
7997000	8002000	It's all an elaborate hoax. And that Death Stranding thing, that was just a side fun thing.
8002000	8004000	It was just part of the hoax.
8004000	8008000	Yeah. That was just a reason to show Norman Reedus' ass. That's all it was.
8008000	8010000	Covered in baby hands.
8010000	8011000	Creepy.
8011000	8014000	That was just a way to write the M. Pregg fanfic.
8014000	8018000	That's where the baby in the sink came from.
8019000	8020000	Wow.
8020000	8022000	It talks like the radio announcer.
8023000	8028000	Alright. There it is. So, so far we have Konami gives us money.
8028000	8032000	Give a shit about my money again, kill the pachinko machines, and just kidding about P.T.
8032000	8035000	Let's go to our number two answer. Shane.
8036000	8047000	I'm going to say that Konami, making so much money off of their pachinko machines and their fitness clubs, decides to buy out all the major publishers.
8052000	8058000	So it's like a strategical move where Konami gets us to talk about Konami by buying everybody else.
8058000	8060000	Exactly.
8062000	8067000	That's a pretty clever move. Maybe that's Konami's long term goal. Maybe that's what it is.
8067000	8073000	You have nothing to talk about except for us because we are everybody. That's what it is.
8073000	8078000	So there it is. It's on the list. Konami buys all the other publishers.
8078000	8080000	Loki, what's your number two answer?
8082000	8085000	Konami puts a bullet in the fucking head of Frogger.
8091000	8093000	So a public execution of Frogger.
8093000	8095000	Public execution of Frogger. Absolutely.
8098000	8100000	What do you have against Frogger?
8101000	8107000	They're like pimping that shit. I guess it is their fucking Pac-Man or whatever, but it's just so uninteresting.
8107000	8109000	I don't give a shit about your fucking Frogger games.
8110000	8112000	Alright. There it is.
8113000	8115000	DarkTetsuya suggests run over him with a semi-truck.
8116000	8119000	And Stoppy's saying, didn't George Costanza already kill Frogger?
8119000	8121000	There was that.
8121000	8125000	Alright, my number two answer, and you know what, this is long overdue.
8125000	8135000	And something I think I would be willing to at least dedicate an episode to Konami if they would just apologize publicly for Beaten Groovy.
8135000	8142000	I want a public apology for Beaten Groovy. Like literally, what the hell were you thinking?
8142000	8145000	There it is. My number two answer on the list.
8145000	8147000	DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?
8148000	8154000	Konami revives the YY World series, as in W-A-I-W-A-I.
8154000	8159000	Basically it was the series where you played as characters who could go into different Konami games.
8159000	8162000	You know, like little mini-game levels.
8162000	8167000	I would probably pee a little bit if they brought back that series.
8167000	8170000	Because the concept was fun and they didn't do enough with it.
8170000	8176000	Could you imagine now with the current games that we have, and maybe doing it as an exploring game?
8176000	8179000	I would talk about Konami all the time.
8179000	8183000	Because what if you could explore Silent Hill on one level next.
8183000	8188000	And the next thing you know you're like, you know, running through the castle, Dracula's castle.
8188000	8190000	And you know, just think about it.
8190000	8194000	So OrangeRideInChat kind of frames it as Konami NES Remix.
8194000	8196000	No.
8196000	8197000	No?
8197000	8199000	No, it's not, it's...
8199000	8202000	No, it would be an exploring game. It wouldn't be like NES Remix.
8202000	8203000	Alright.
8203000	8205000	Like a platforming game.
8205000	8210000	Now that you bring up exploring game, I almost wish I'd made a reference to Goonies 2 on my list somewhere.
8210000	8211000	I guess it's not too late.
8211000	8213000	Goonies 2 would be included in my game.
8213000	8214000	Okay, that's fair.
8214000	8216000	So actually, DarkSaga, I'll give you props.
8216000	8219000	That's a fairly serious answer.
8219000	8220000	Yes.
8220000	8222000	In a week full of fuckery.
8222000	8223000	Yes.
8223000	8224000	Alright.
8224000	8226000	We'll see how it fares.
8226000	8230000	Alright, let's go around and do the number one answers.
8230000	8232000	So here we go.
8232000	8234000	What are the number one answers?
8234000	8237000	Shane, number one way that Konami could get the show to talk about Konami again.
8237000	8246000	Konami has like a shareholder revolt and ousts the current CEO and replaces them with Mr. Spanky from DDRPC.
8251000	8253000	Is he wearing a suit jacket over that leather?
8253000	8257000	No, why? No, he has like a fancy ball gag.
8258000	8259000	Okay.
8259000	8263000	I had to shorten your answer, Shane, to just Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.
8264000	8265000	Okay.
8265000	8268000	That's a good answer. I like that. From DDRPC.
8268000	8272000	I had to go look him up to see what he looked like again just to make sure he was okay.
8272000	8274000	I'm like, can you even Google that anymore?
8274000	8278000	No, you can. They have like an archived, the old DDRPC sites archived.
8278000	8279000	Alright.
8279000	8280000	So you can look at it.
8280000	8281000	Awesome. Awesome.
8281000	8282000	Alright.
8282000	8287000	Of course, when you type in Mr. Spanky DDR, the first thing that comes up is the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki.
8287000	8290000	Yeah, I saw that. I was like, that's not going to help me, I don't think.
8290000	8292000	So I had to keep digging.
8292000	8294000	That's kind of, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
8294000	8298000	Have we become that meta where like we have become Mr. Spanky?
8298000	8301000	Mr. Spanky, you live here now.
8302000	8303000	Is that what's happened?
8303000	8304000	Yes.
8304000	8306000	The new home of Mr. Spanky.
8307000	8308000	Alright.
8308000	8310000	Loki, what is your number one answer?
8310000	8316000	I would like to see all the Bimani, or a new Bimani game, like a new Dance Dance Revolution or whatever,
8316000	8319000	come to Steam with some sort of like Rock Band Network support.
8319000	8325000	So basically, you know, indie artists can upload their own songs.
8326000	8328000	So it's fresh tracks all the time.
8328000	8333000	So a new Bimani game comes out on Steam and has the Rock Band Network type of functionality with it.
8333000	8336000	That's, again, a fairly serious answer.
8336000	8337000	Especially from Loki.
8337000	8339000	Because they wouldn't have to do anything.
8339000	8341000	How is my answer not serious?
8343000	8344000	It's absolutely serious.
8344000	8347000	Because Mr. Spanky isn't a real person? I don't know.
8347000	8349000	I don't think their CEO is either.
8349000	8350000	We don't know that.
8350000	8352000	We don't know that.
8352000	8353000	Alright.
8353000	8356000	Anyhow, it's what one of the employees does on Friday night.
8356000	8362000	Alright, anyhow, my number one answer is actually kind of similar to what Loki had,
8362000	8365000	but I think it's different enough to necessitate its own answer.
8365000	8368000	And it is simply, you know, and I'm surprised you didn't say this, Loki,
8368000	8370000	because it's something you've been begging about for years.
8370000	8373000	And that is, just give us the rights to DDR.
8373000	8375000	Give us the rights to DDR.
8375000	8377000	We'll fucking fix it for you.
8377000	8379000	We're gonna make the game the fans want.
8379000	8382000	Just get all those patents, send them our way.
8382000	8385000	We'll give Kyle Ward a lot of money to help us out.
8385000	8389000	A lot of money that we don't have, but we'll promise him anyway.
8389000	8390000	We'll do a Kickstarter.
8390000	8391000	That's right, that's fucking right.
8391000	8393000	We'll do a Kickstarter.
8393000	8394000	There you go.
8394000	8396000	To pay that man's salary, and our salary, of course,
8396000	8398000	because, you know, we're gonna make a new DDR game.
8398000	8399000	It's gonna be fucking rad.
8399000	8400000	And there you go.
8400000	8403000	Give us the rights to DDR, my number one answer.
8404000	8407000	Last but not least, Dark Soccer.
8407000	8411000	I just want to point out, you get one more thing to put on this board,
8411000	8412000	and then that's it.
8412000	8414000	Every other answer is worthless.
8414000	8416000	We're down to these.
8416000	8417000	Okay.
8417000	8418000	Twelve answers.
8418000	8420000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what are you putting on the list?
8421000	8423000	Super Konami Fighter.
8424000	8428000	A fighting game with characters from all of the good franchises.
8428000	8430000	You can go back to Goemon.
8430000	8432000	You can go back to Adventure Island.
8432000	8435000	You can go to freaking Tokimeki Memorial,
8435000	8439000	which was their long-running dating sim series.
8439000	8441000	I've got a laserdisc of the anime.
8441000	8442000	I get dibs on Pyramid Head.
8442000	8443000	Okay.
8443000	8444000	Alright.
8444000	8445000	Okay.
8445000	8446000	Alright.
8446000	8448000	Yeah, you could have the Red Pyramid.
8448000	8452000	You could have, you know, even that stupid kid with the,
8452000	8455000	you could have the dog from Silent Hill 2.
8456000	8457000	He'd just bark at you.
8458000	8461000	By the way, when we get the rights to DDR,
8461000	8463000	there's totally going to be a dog ending.
8464000	8466000	We also have to have the Silent Hill No Uta.
8467000	8468000	From the one from 3.
8468000	8470000	Yeah, it has to have a UFO ending too.
8470000	8473000	Silent Hill No Uta.
8473000	8478000	Alright, let's recap the list before the all-important elimination round.
8478000	8479000	Yes, Bayou Billy will be in it.
8479000	8480000	Here it is.
8480000	8482000	What is the best way that Konami could get this show
8482000	8484000	to talk about nothing but Konami products again?
8484000	8487000	Konami sponsors us and gives us lots of money
8487000	8489000	if they actually gave a shit about Bomani again.
8489000	8492000	Take all the pachinko machines out back and shoot them.
8492000	8494000	Just kidding about PT.
8494000	8496000	Konami buys all the other publishers.
8496000	8498000	Put a bullet in the head of Frogger.
8498000	8500000	Apologize publicly for Beaten Groovy.
8501000	8503000	Revive the YY series.
8504000	8506000	Sorry, Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.
8506000	8510000	A new Bomani game comes to Steam with Rock Band Network-like support.
8510000	8512000	Give us the rights to DDR.
8512000	8515000	And Super Konami Fighter.
8515000	8520000	Some of the answers from our chat room that didn't make the cut for these final 12.
8520000	8522000	SJ100Matt says,
8522000	8525000	Announce that the Konami board has been eating crayons this whole time
8525000	8527000	supplied by Ken Kutaragi.
8527000	8529000	That's a very good answer. I like that.
8529000	8530000	Let's see.
8530000	8531000	Stoppy says,
8531000	8534000	Konami surrenders on the deck of the USS Missouri.
8534000	8535000	VidPower saying,
8535000	8540000	Konami needs to use their number 573 in some way, shape, or form again.
8540000	8543000	That'll be our DDR game. 573rd mix.
8543000	8545000	The number of bullets you put in the Frogger's head.
8545000	8546000	Alright.
8546000	8548000	You know what? This is tough.
8548000	8551000	This is really tough because all these answers are good,
8551000	8554000	but this is fucking science, people.
8554000	8557000	So for science, we must eliminate some answers.
8557000	8559000	Shane, we start with you.
8559000	8562000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8562000	8564000	Just because I don't trust them,
8564000	8566000	and I wouldn't believe it's sincere,
8566000	8568000	they can't just apologize and get away with it.
8569000	8571000	So is the apologize for beating Groovy?
8571000	8573000	Yeah. No, no, no, no.
8573000	8574000	I thought they had...
8574000	8576000	Oh, yeah. Yeah, apologize for beating Groovy. Sorry.
8576000	8577000	Because you know what?
8577000	8580000	They would say that, but they'd be crossing their fingers
8580000	8583000	or like snickering behind your back as soon as you turn around
8583000	8585000	because they're like, we totally put that out there
8585000	8588000	and people paid us like $3 to play it.
8588000	8591000	So we made like our entire annual income just then.
8591000	8592000	Oh, alright.
8592000	8595000	I am kind of mad that that's one of my answers
8595000	8596000	that you just eliminated from the list.
8596000	8597000	Oh, I'm sure mine will be gone too.
8597000	8601000	However, your rationale actually kind of works,
8601000	8605000	and I don't admit that like ever, Shane, ever.
8605000	8607000	It's my birthday, and I'm saying something nice about you.
8607000	8608000	What's up with that?
8608000	8610000	Alright, it is stricken from the list.
8610000	8611000	It's because I got you tacos.
8611000	8613000	That's true. You did get me tacos.
8613000	8616000	Alright, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8616000	8618000	Let's see here.
8619000	8625000	I would say taking all the pachinko machines out back
8625000	8630000	and shooting them just because I don't think there's a point to it.
8630000	8632000	I mean, no one really likes pachinko anyways,
8632000	8634000	so no need to kill them.
8634000	8637000	Boy, you fucking assholes just one-two'd my list right out the door,
8637000	8638000	but there it is.
8638000	8639000	That means my final-
8639000	8640000	I didn't do anything.
8640000	8642000	And you agreed with my logic, so-
8642000	8645000	My final answer, give us the rights to DDR,
8645000	8648000	now has immunity and cannot be eliminated by myself,
8648000	8650000	which I wouldn't have done it anyway, or Dark Soccer.
8650000	8651000	I can't touch it.
8651000	8654000	So, my turn to strike something from the list.
8654000	8656000	I'm going to actually-
8656000	8660000	I believe this answer to be redundant compared to some other answers on the board,
8660000	8665000	so by that logic, I'm going to eliminate if they actually gave a shit about Bomani again
8665000	8670000	because by giving a new Bomani game or giving us the rights to DDR,
8670000	8672000	that would be giving a shit about Bomani again.
8672000	8674000	Technically, they wouldn't be giving a shit, they would just be like,
8674000	8676000	here, you give the shit.
8676000	8678000	You give the shit because I'm too late.
8678000	8681000	Well, regardless, my logic made sense in my head,
8681000	8683000	so it is stricken from the list.
8683000	8686000	Last but not least, Dark Sakura,
8686000	8689000	which of these is not worthy of the list?
8689000	8692000	I'm going to take the Frogger one off,
8692000	8694000	because Frogger doesn't deserve to get shot,
8694000	8697000	Frogger deserves obscurity.
8697000	8700000	So that all we remember is me playing the original game,
8700000	8704000	all we remember is me playing the original Frogger on roller skates.
8704000	8706000	I have very good memories of Frogger.
8706000	8708000	All that has happened is the new Frogger comes out from Konami,
8708000	8710000	and it's Frog Fractions 2.
8710000	8713000	Where is that game? Shouldn't it have been out by now?
8713000	8716000	Now that's the logic to keep Frogger around,
8716000	8719000	is that secretly he's the star of Frog Fractions 2.
8719000	8721000	It would be Frogger Fractions.
8721000	8724000	Alright, well there it is, it has been stricken from the list.
8724000	8728000	Wow, Loki and I got fucked this week, didn't we?
8728000	8731000	But that is the scientific process of listless,
8731000	8732000	and these are the things that happen.
8732000	8736000	So Dark Sakura and Shane walk away unscathed.
8736000	8738000	I don't know how that happened, but here it is.
8738000	8741000	So here's the list that you can vote on now.
8741000	8743000	I want to point this out.
8743000	8746000	Over at live.vognetwork.com, you click your first answer,
8746000	8748000	then your second answer, then you submit.
8748000	8752000	You get to vote for two, and your first answer does get more points.
8752000	8755000	So click one, two, and then submit.
8755000	8760000	So, once again, here are the choices that you have to vote for,
8760000	8762000	the final list of eight.
8762000	8765000	Konami sponsors us and gives us lots of money.
8765000	8768000	Konami buys all the other publishers.
8768000	8769000	Why didn't I eliminate that one?
8769000	8771000	That was the one I was going to eliminate.
8771000	8772000	Oh well.
8772000	8775000	Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.
8775000	8779000	A new Bomani game comes to Steam with Rock Band Network.
8779000	8781000	Give us the rights to DDR.
8781000	8784000	Just kidding about PT.
8784000	8790000	Revive the YY series and Super Konami Fighter.
8790000	8797000	You can vote now over at live.vognetwork.com.
8797000	8800000	We're tabulating the votes as we speak,
8800000	8804000	and we will get to the answers a little bit later.
8804000	8807000	But in the meantime, we're going to do a few more news stories
8807000	8810000	while the voting is open for about five more minutes.
8810000	8812000	So let's get back into some news. Loki.
8812000	8814000	All right, I touched on this a little bit earlier,
8814000	8817000	but basically it's a rumor coming out from,
8817000	8820000	or I should say Digital Foundry has looked at the specs,
8820000	8825000	basically saying the Neo GPU matches that of the RX 480
8825000	8828000	from Radeon or ATI.
8828000	8831000	I don't know if they're Radeon or ATI this week.
8831000	8832000	It's hard to follow that.
8832000	8836000	But basically it's also worth noting the clock speeds
8836000	8840000	and the resultant teraflops aside,
8840000	8844000	the specs for the RX 480 are point-for-point match
8844000	8848000	for the GPU in Sony's upcoming PlayStation Neo,
8848000	8853000	all but confirming that Sony mid-gen console refresh
8853000	8855000	uses both Polaris technology
8855000	8861000	and a new 14-nanometer FinFET chip manufacturing process.
8861000	8865000	So because of this, the theory is that their new console
8865000	8867000	is not going to be super expensive
8867000	8869000	because the chip would have been more affordable.
8869000	8871000	So we will see.
8871000	8873000	And I think isn't that supposed to be coming out this year,
8873000	8876000	that their refresh is supposed to be sometime around October,
8876000	8878000	so we should hear about that.
8878000	8882000	I'm guessing maybe in August for the European...
8882000	8883000	The Gamescom?
8883000	8884000	Gamescom, yeah.
8884000	8885000	Maybe.
8885000	8887000	I was going to say, you would think that's the type of thing
8887000	8888000	that Sony holds for their own thing,
8888000	8891000	but that's not until December, so maybe not.
8891000	8893000	But Gamescom, they usually make announcements of stuff.
8893000	8894000	Yeah, that's true.
8894000	8897000	Maybe they're holding back for that.
8897000	8898000	All right.
8898000	8900000	Let's head over to...
8900000	8902000	I want to actually check in before I get to this news story.
8902000	8905000	Shane, are you working on your Pokemon spreadsheet right now?
8905000	8907000	I see you like typing and...
8907000	8908000	No.
8908000	8912000	I am adding more people so I can get more Friends Safaris
8912000	8915000	because I still have a few spots open on my Friends list,
8915000	8916000	which goes up to 100.
8916000	8917000	I'm at 80...
8917000	8918000	No, I'm sorry.
8918000	8919000	I'm at 90 now.
8919000	8921000	Are you adding OLR people or is this all Reddit?
8921000	8922000	This is all Reddit.
8922000	8923000	So there's actually a Reddit...
8923000	8926000	Specifically dedicated for Friends Safari stuff.
8926000	8928000	So there's other sick people like you in the world.
8928000	8929000	It's not sick.
8929000	8933000	It's beautiful.
8933000	8934000	All right.
8934000	8937000	Let's move on to a story about Mass Effect Andromeda.
8937000	8940000	And Mass Effect Andromeda apparently going to be kind of moving away
8940000	8943000	from what we know as the Paragon and Renegade system.
8943000	8946000	You know, if you played the original Mass Effect trilogy,
8946000	8949000	it was usually pretty obvious the choices you were going to make
8949000	8953000	were either going to be Paragon, which is kind of good guy.
8953000	8954000	I'm using my quotey fingers.
8954000	8957000	And then Renegade, which was kind of bad guy.
8957000	8960000	Although, some would argue that Renegade is still a good guy.
8960000	8964000	However, all that aside, apparently the choices are not going to be
8964000	8967000	so obvious in Mass Effect Andromeda.
8967000	8971000	This is according to Mac Walters, who's the game's Creative Director,
8971000	8973000	who's saying in a quote,
8973000	8976000	I think in general, with all this sophistication of games
8976000	8979000	or engaging of any kind of entertainment right now,
8979000	8983000	gamers are looking for more of those shades of gray.
8983000	8986000	And then he went on to talk about how the old system was kind of a part
8986000	8989000	of what made Shepard, Shepard.
8989000	8991000	And I guess now when we're talking about,
8991000	8994000	I guess it's going to be Ryder now in the future,
8994000	8996000	saying I think now we're moving away from that.
8996000	9001000	We've been looking for other ways to engage more of those shades of gray,
9001000	9004000	less about it being obviously being right or wrong,
9004000	9008000	and more about giving people a sense of choice.
9008000	9010000	So that could be very interesting.
9010000	9012000	Shane, you're a super fan of Mass Effect.
9012000	9015000	What do you think about the fact that Paragon and Renegade,
9015000	9018000	it's not going to be so obvious and maybe there isn't really a good guy,
9018000	9019000	bad guy thing going on?
9019000	9021000	In theory, I think that's a good idea.
9021000	9026000	But I was so hardcore Paragon that I don't know how I'm going to adjust
9026000	9030000	because I kind of want the clear-cut path,
9030000	9035000	and I don't know how my Paragon mind will be able to handle it
9035000	9038000	if I make a decision that I feel is Paragon,
9038000	9041000	and it ruins things for people.
9041000	9045000	So good idea. I don't know how it will work out in practice.
9045000	9047000	Darsakra, what about you?
9047000	9050000	What is your thoughts on this Paragon-Renegade thing shifting?
9050000	9053000	Because I know you're a big Mass Effect-y person too.
9053000	9055000	I think it'll be cool. I'd like to see how it plays out.
9055000	9060000	I definitely would like a little bit more of a subtlety to the thing.
9060000	9064000	I really liked in Inquisition how they worked it in,
9064000	9068000	that even certain decisions still had some pretty crazy consequences
9068000	9070000	when it came to the final DLC.
9070000	9076000	I'm not going to spoil. It's already been out forever.
9076000	9079000	So just Iron Bull, I'll leave it at that.
9079000	9085000	But other things, I would love to see a lot more consequences,
9085000	9088000	even for very minor things. So I'm looking forward to it.
9088000	9092000	All right, I'm very curious to see how it plays out as well.
9092000	9095000	All right, before we get to our listless results for tonight,
9095000	9099000	again, the topic which you can vote on now at live.vognetware.com,
9099000	9100000	for those of you listening live.
9100000	9104000	Ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again.
9104000	9106000	Because you know when this show started 14 years ago,
9106000	9110000	we were really dedicated to the obsession in our lives at the time,
9110000	9112000	which was DDR, BeatMania.
9112000	9115000	Not to say that that obsession is gone, because when I went to round one,
9115000	9117000	it was like I'm 20.
9117000	9118000	It was in heaven.
9118000	9121000	Yeah, I'm in my 20s again, having a blast.
9121000	9123000	I don't know if you've been over here, but locally,
9123000	9127000	the drive-in apparently has a lot of Shonnigan's machines.
9127000	9128000	The drive-in?
9128000	9129000	The drive-in, yeah.
9129000	9132000	Isn't that the guy that had all the stuff at Scandia?
9132000	9134000	Yeah, he had all the stuff at Scandia.
9134000	9137000	He has his garage and everything, but I think he has his machines over there.
9139000	9140000	So you're saying...
9140000	9141000	So that would be like a...
9141000	9143000	Not to give away my address on the air,
9143000	9146000	but not even like a mile from my house is where all this shit is at.
9146000	9149000	That would be like a DJ Max Technica and like 2DX?
9149000	9150000	I think they've got...
9150000	9152000	I know they have a Dance Dance Revolution,
9152000	9154000	but I was looking at...
9154000	9155000	Well, like a DDRX...
9155000	9157000	Shane's like twitching over there.
9157000	9160000	He's going to use his little iPad Uber thing
9160000	9162000	to look up the phone number to the drive-in
9162000	9165000	and be like, I need you to tell me everything in your arcade right now.
9165000	9167000	I just want to go there right now.
9167000	9170000	Let me just take a look here, because I was browsing,
9170000	9173000	because I just realized I haven't looked at the buy-sell-trade thing for a while,
9173000	9174000	because that's where I saw the...
9174000	9178000	You know, Shane, I have a three-day weekend next weekend
9178000	9180000	with the 4th of July and everything.
9180000	9182000	Maybe we should go to round one.
9182000	9185000	I bet my friends in San Jose would like to hang out.
9185000	9187000	There's a possibility that I'd be down for that.
9187000	9188000	Yeah, I'm not positive.
9188000	9191000	Maybe we could make Jamie come with us somehow.
9191000	9192000	You know who would know?
9192000	9194000	They have so many UFO catchers that are amazing.
9194000	9197000	You know who would know, because he frequents it quite a bit,
9197000	9199000	is Jonas would know what's there.
9199000	9201000	Where's that guy? I miss that guy.
9201000	9207000	But yeah, he made a comment about passing 17's double in DDRX3 and before,
9207000	9209000	but I don't know.
9209000	9212000	I think they still have the machines there.
9212000	9215000	That's where he had them at one time.
9215000	9217000	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
9217000	9218000	We want to get to some of your feedback,
9218000	9221000	because we do want to make sure we have time to open up the phone lines.
9221000	9224000	A username, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
9224000	9225000	They're not open yet.
9225000	9228000	We've got to get through just a few more things, including the mailbag,
9228000	9230000	because every week you guys email us.
9230000	9235000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails,
9235000	9237000	and Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag
9237000	9242000	and find some fan mail worthy of reading here right now.
9242000	9244000	Dark Soccer, what's in the mailbag this week?
9244000	9246000	The first one comes from Robert M.
9246000	9250000	I could be very wrong, but I'm sure the online Flash escape room games
9250000	9253000	predate the physical escape rooms and serve as their inspiration.
9253000	9255000	I agree.
9255000	9258000	I did one of the physical rooms with my brother and his wife
9258000	9262000	and a small group of relative strangers last November for my birthday.
9262000	9266000	The biggest obstacle I encountered was said strangers trying combinations on the locks,
9266000	9268000	not lining up the tumblers exactly right,
9268000	9271000	and throwing out correct solutions as a result.
9271000	9275000	I hope I'm able to rent a session later with just the three of us some time.
9275000	9278000	I'm also really looking forward to episode 100 of Guys on a Show,
9278000	9282000	hoping Extrofer is still all right.
9282000	9284000	Yeah, Extrofer's been sick the past couple weeks.
9284000	9285000	That's why that show's been on hold,
9285000	9290000	but I am trying to get a pretty awesome guest for this coming week,
9290000	9293000	so hopefully we'll be back on that this week.
9293000	9296000	And last email. Hello, guys.
9296000	9298000	Martin the Belgian here.
9298000	9301000	I'm glad that you're specifying that you are the Belgian.
9301000	9303000	The. Actually, real quick before we get to the Belgian,
9303000	9304000	I just wanted to check in with Shane,
9304000	9308000	because Shane was the one that brought up all the escape room stuff on last week's show.
9308000	9309000	So what's the latest on that?
9309000	9311000	Why haven't we been to an escape room yet?
9311000	9312000	It's been like a whole week.
9312000	9315000	Because I don't know, and I want to go to one so bad.
9315000	9318000	One of my local friends posted a picture from an escape room here locally,
9318000	9322000	and I actually asked, like, my friend is obsessed with escape rooms now.
9322000	9323000	Is this one any good?
9323000	9325000	And he's like, well, it's the only one I've been to, but we had fun.
9325000	9329000	I still believe that the one in Elk Grove is supposed to be the best in the area.
9329000	9330000	I still want to go to that one.
9330000	9331000	We'll see. We'll see. All right.
9331000	9335000	Sorry, Dark Soccer. Let's go back to the Belgian.
9335000	9338000	Congratulations on your 14th birthday.
9338000	9340000	I've been listening for a good bit of this 14 years,
9340000	9343000	and I always enjoy your banter to lighten up my day.
9343000	9346000	The show really feels like a get-together with friends,
9346000	9349000	and we, the listeners, feel like a part of that group of friends, I think.
9349000	9352000	I just had a question for you regarding E3 this year.
9352000	9355000	What did you think of the VR games that were shown?
9355000	9358000	I will tell you this, me, I don't really care about VR.
9358000	9360000	So that's me.
9360000	9363000	But I want to point out, I think part of what plays into that for you
9363000	9368000	is not like that you're just being like, I just hate everything.
9368000	9370000	I do hate everything.
9370000	9373000	But you have the whole, like, if you play a first-person shooter, you get motion sick.
9373000	9374000	Yeah, I get motion sick.
9374000	9376000	So you have a lot of concerns about VR.
9376000	9378000	And I can't wear my glasses.
9378000	9380000	Didn't you play that one at GX3?
9380000	9382000	I did, and it was okay.
9382000	9384000	But I couldn't play it for very, very long.
9384000	9387000	It was bizarre VR.
9387000	9391000	When I get my PlayStation VR, though, you will try Rez at least once, right?
9391000	9392000	I'm sure.
9392000	9395000	All right, so the door is open to crack, you guys, just so you know.
9395000	9396000	I'll try it.
9396000	9397000	All right, there you go.
9397000	9399000	I just can't wear any mascara because it's expensive.
9399000	9402000	Personally, I was pretty excited for VR,
9402000	9404000	but now that the headsets are actually out,
9404000	9407000	I have seen very little games that seem worth playing.
9407000	9411000	I was expecting most publishers at E3 to have a big push for VR,
9411000	9414000	especially Sony with their headset coming later this year,
9414000	9416000	and so the games shown were very underwhelming.
9416000	9419000	It seems like their heart isn't in it.
9419000	9423000	Whenever a VR game was shown, it was always a VR experience,
9423000	9425000	Star Wars, Batman, et cetera,
9425000	9427000	and that didn't seem like a full-fledged title.
9427000	9430000	So my feeling is that VR is already on its way out,
9430000	9433000	kind of like 3D TVs came and went.
9433000	9435000	Nobody I know has it or wants it.
9435000	9439000	It is too expensive, and the games just aren't there.
9439000	9441000	What are your thoughts?
9441000	9446000	I know Rob preordered a PSVR, but are you still excited for it?
9448000	9449000	Yes.
9449000	9452000	I do not like bouncing off the walls.
9452000	9454000	Here's the thing with VR.
9454000	9458000	It's a lot harder to get hyped for something
9458000	9462000	that you can't exactly experience through a live stream the same way.
9462000	9467000	The only way to really get hyped about VR is to get in there and do it.
9467000	9470000	So I understand that I could go to Best Buy and all this stuff
9470000	9473000	and wait in a line or whatever and all this stuff,
9473000	9476000	but I kind of, I don't really want to do that.
9476000	9478000	I've got other things I've got to do during the day.
9478000	9482000	I know enough about VR from what I have done
9482000	9485000	that I think I will enjoy it.
9485000	9488000	But until I'm really able to play those games myself for the first time,
9488000	9492000	I can't truly say I am like jazzed about it, you know?
9492000	9496000	But I am optimistic, I think would be a good word.
9496000	9497000	I think that's the word.
9497000	9499000	I'm optimistic that I'm going to have a really good time with VR
9499000	9504000	because my experience with VR to this point has been very, very positive.
9504000	9506000	You know, Bobby obviously very into VR,
9506000	9510000	so every year when I go to Atlanta, he shows me whatever toys he's got,
9510000	9513000	which has always been a way for me to kind of stay on the edge of that.
9513000	9515000	And then, you know, that one year we were at E3
9515000	9518000	and kind of got to see the PlayStation VR in that very, very first year.
9518000	9520000	That was an awesome experience.
9520000	9522000	So I'm optimistic about it,
9522000	9525000	but it's really hard for me to get into the specifics
9525000	9528000	until I'm really able to get in there and do it for myself.
9528000	9530000	And that is a very hard sell at E3,
9530000	9533000	and I think that's why you're going to see more and more of this
9533000	9535000	come to the store and play it.
9535000	9537000	But that's also hard to do
9537000	9539000	because you don't want people to steal the fucking VR headsets.
9539000	9543000	Because if people are going to try to steal the Zelda demo at E3,
9543000	9545000	you know people are going to try to steal these headsets
9545000	9547000	before they're even out.
9547000	9548000	Possibly.
9548000	9550000	Thanks as always for the show.
9550000	9554000	If I wasn't so hungover today, I would raise a toast to another 14 years.
9554000	9556000	Your friend, Martin.
9556000	9557000	You can use sparkling cider,
9557000	9560000	but thank you very, very, very much for those kind words
9560000	9562000	in the very beginning of the email.
9562000	9563000	Was that it for emails this week?
9563000	9564000	That's it.
9564000	9565000	All right, that's it.
9565000	9566000	Let's do the FUs of the week,
9566000	9569000	and then I want to say this is the absolute last chance
9569000	9571000	to vote in the list list.
9571000	9574000	The list list will be closing for votes in about one minute.
9574000	9577000	So in the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9577000	9600000	FU to, I guess not being enough over my digestion issues,
9600000	9605000	to enjoy delicious cupcakes, because now I hurt like a lot.
9606000	9610000	Also, FU to people who vote for Trump,
9610000	9618000	and FU to people who don't use their turn signals in traffic.
9618000	9621000	So yeah, that's it.
9621000	9623000	Loki, how about you, FUs of the week?
9623000	9628000	I guess just, I don't know, I don't really have a whole,
9628000	9632000	FU to not having a lot of time or being tired at night
9632000	9636000	to both play a lot of games and program and stuff.
9636000	9638000	I'm really trying.
9638000	9642000	My body is fighting against me, so it probably doesn't help
9642000	9643000	that I've been staying up till one in the morning
9643000	9645000	to play the South Park game every day,
9645000	9647000	so that might be a little bit of a contributing factor
9647000	9650000	when I'm waking up at 5.45.
9652000	9654000	All right, Shane, do you have an FU of the week
9654000	9655000	you want to get out?
9655000	9656000	Several.
9656000	9660000	FU to vitamin D deficiencies.
9660000	9664000	Apparently pretty awful now that I'm getting it corrected.
9664000	9669000	FU to having an ulcer so bad I had to get a scope down my throat,
9669000	9675000	and FU to the yen to dollar conversion now
9675000	9680000	makes importing things not as great.
9680000	9682000	Import stuff from the UK.
9682000	9685000	Well, no, because...
9685000	9686000	FU'd all that.
9686000	9687000	Yeah.
9687000	9689000	But now when Pokemon Sun and Moon come out,
9689000	9694000	those are going to be almost $50 games to import,
9694000	9696000	and I didn't want that.
9696000	9698000	I liked it better when it wasn't so terrible.
9698000	9701000	AkumaJP in chat says, yay for me, though.
9701000	9706000	We get stuff dirt cheap from our neck of the woods.
9706000	9708000	You want us to send you Pop-Tarts?
9708000	9710000	It'd probably cost you a quarter.
9710000	9713000	Although for AkumaJP, we'd send them for free.
9713000	9716000	All right, my FU of the week.
9716000	9717000	I don't really have a lot.
9717000	9719000	So my FU of the week goes to, oh, my God,
9719000	9721000	I've been binge eating way too much this weekend,
9721000	9723000	and Dark Sakura's cupcakes haven't helped.
9723000	9725000	However, it is my birthday.
9725000	9727000	How did that cookie cupcake not help?
9727000	9729000	Because of that frosting in the middle was amazing.
9729000	9731000	Yeah, and the peanut butter one was really fucking good, too,
9731000	9734000	and I still kind of want to try one of the lemonade ones.
9734000	9737000	But, oh, my God, I need to stop eating,
9737000	9741000	and then I sit here and go, why am I so pudgy?
9741000	9743000	It's because I can't stop eating.
9743000	9745000	I want to blame Dark Sakura, but I can't.
9745000	9746000	I mean, it is my birthday.
9746000	9748000	I get to be a fatty if I want.
9748000	9750000	Right, Dark Sakura?
9750000	9751000	Yeah.
9751000	9752000	That's right. All right.
9752000	9753000	Have more.
9753000	9755000	There's exactly four cupcakes left.
9755000	9756000	Have more.
9756000	9757000	All right.
9757000	9760000	Are we ready to hear tonight's listless results?
9760000	9761000	Yars.
9761000	9762000	Here we go.
9762000	9765000	Tonight's listless results.
9765000	9768000	Again, the topic this week,
9768000	9773000	what is the best way that Konami could get this show
9773000	9777000	to talk about nothing but Konami products again?
9777000	9780000	I got to say, it's interesting,
9780000	9781000	because the last time we did this,
9781000	9783000	we had a hell of a tie as well,
9783000	9786000	and this week we have a three-way tie
9786000	9788000	for the number one answer.
9788000	9790000	It's a three-way tie for the number one answer,
9790000	9792000	and it's just the points worked out that way.
9792000	9793000	Even though several people voted,
9793000	9795000	that's just the way the points worked out.
9795000	9798000	So we'll do a runner-up answer tonight
9798000	9800000	and then the three-way tie for number one.
9800000	9804000	So the runner-up tonight for how can Konami get us
9804000	9806000	to talk about Konami again,
9806000	9810000	Super Konami Fighter will be the way to do it.
9810000	9812000	What about PBS Cross Konami?
9812000	9813000	All right, I'll let it go.
9813000	9814000	I'll let it go.
9814000	9816000	All right, Super Konami Fighter.
9816000	9817000	There it is.
9817000	9818000	Runner-up tonight.
9818000	9820000	And then the three-way tie tonight is?
9820000	9821000	What?
9821000	9824000	Three-way tie for number one.
9824000	9826000	Give us the rights to DDR.
9826000	9827000	Woo.
9827000	9828000	Yeah.
9828000	9829000	I agree with that.
9829000	9830000	Let's do that.
9830000	9834000	A new Bimani game comes to Steam with Rock Band Network.
9834000	9835000	I'd take that as well.
9835000	9837000	Those answers are kind of close,
9837000	9839000	because if we did DDR, that's what we'd do.
9839000	9840000	Right, Loki?
9840000	9841000	Yeah, probably.
9841000	9842000	Right, Daisakura?
9842000	9843000	Steam support?
9843000	9844000	Hell yeah.
9844000	9845000	Max 2, just because?
9845000	9846000	Totes.
9846000	9847000	All right.
9847000	9851000	And last but not least, tied for number one tonight,
9851000	9855000	Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.
9855000	9857000	I knew that would be up there.
9857000	9859000	There it is.
9859000	9862000	Your list list tonight, the definitive list.
9862000	9870000	That's easily four ways right there that could earn our love all over again.
9870000	9872000	Get on it.
9872000	9874000	Thanks for participating with that tonight, everybody.
9874000	9878000	I wonder how much money it would take to get those rights from them.
9878000	9879000	A lot.
9879000	9882000	Yeah, I don't think they'll part with any of their IPs,
9882000	9885000	even though they're not using them anymore except for pachinko machines.
9885000	9887000	When it's kind of all you got.
9887000	9890000	So does this mean Konami is basically going to turn into a patent troll?
9890000	9892000	Well, here's the thing.
9892000	9895000	The Bimani games in the arcade are still going,
9895000	9897000	so they wouldn't give up DDR.
9897000	9899000	Well, here's the thing about those patents, though.
9899000	9902000	Their patents are going to be up in a couple years anyways,
9902000	9905000	because they patent all that stuff back in the 90s,
9905000	9908000	and it's only good for, like, 20 years.
9908000	9917000	So all those stupid things that they have on, like, patent for lining up arrow,
9917000	9921000	the beat, like any sort of rhythm game type of patents,
9921000	9925000	those will be expired.
9925000	9927000	Hopefully.
9927000	9929000	So we just have to wait.
9929000	9933000	All right, just a couple more stories, then we're going to get to the phone lines.
9933000	9935000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9935000	9936000	But first, Loki.
9936000	9938000	So this is kind of neat.
9938000	9946000	RZA, who's a hip-hop artist, is actually making a new album based off of Atari game music.
9946000	9948000	I'm not sure what that would sound like.
9948000	9951000	I guess using those as, it almost sounds like almost like a Megaran thing,
9951000	9958000	where you have the game music and then you kind of rap over it or something.
9958000	9959000	Cool.
9959000	9965000	They're going to have some songs based off of Asteroids, Centipede, Pong, and others.
9965000	9971000	And I guess he actually worked on, or he did some voiceover stuff for Getting Up,
9971000	9977000	Contents Under Pressure, that Mark Echo game that came out that Atari published.
9977000	9978000	Neat.
9978000	9980000	I'm kind of curious to see what that sounds like.
9980000	9983000	Yeah, it's nice to see Atari in the news again.
9983000	9989000	Well, that and, like, you know, was it the new album Turbografx-16 or something like that,
9989000	9991000	that they're supposed to be making?
9991000	9996000	The Kanye West thing, but I don't think it was supposed to be public.
9996000	9998000	I mean, it was a title only type of thing.
9998000	10000000	I don't think it ever really happened.
10000000	10004000	I think it's just one of those, like, Kanye got on Twitter when he was drunk and started typing things,
10004000	10006000	and he didn't really mean it.
10006000	10010000	But I will say, have you heard about his latest video?
10010000	10015000	He did a video for that song Famous where he talks about how he made Taylor Swift famous and all this stuff.
10015000	10022000	And, like, all the video is are these wax figures of naked celebrities in bed together.
10022000	10027000	And so, but they're celebrities like Donald Trump, but they're fully naked, like Donald Trump.
10027000	10028000	Caitlyn Jenner.
10028000	10035000	And Caitlyn Jenner, Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, like, all these random people and Kanye West in bed together.
10035000	10040000	And I'm just like, like, every time Kanye West does something, like a video or something,
10040000	10044000	and Dark Soccer could appreciate this, my reaction to this video, my reaction to everything Kanye West does,
10044000	10047000	this bitch.
10047000	10050000	Right, Dark Soccer?
10050000	10054000	Kanye West, this bitch.
10054000	10056000	Well, he is a bitch.
10056000	10060000	So they had, did they have his full wax statue in bed with, like, a fish or something like that?
10060000	10064000	No, no, not with these other celebrities, with Taylor Swift.
10064000	10068000	But there's no such of a, no sort of aquatic life in bed with him as well?
10068000	10073000	No, unless they were all merpeople, which is very possible, and you couldn't, because of the blanket, you couldn't see.
10073000	10075000	Because the rumor is that he is a gay fish.
10075000	10078000	Yeah, I, you've been playing too much of that goddamn South Park game.
10078000	10080000	Alright.
10080000	10090000	No, it's actually, what was it, they have, there's a gag in there, remember from the, the episode, what was it, where Tom Cruise wasn't coming out of the closet?
10090000	10096000	So, actually, you can go up into, you know, the kid's closet, and you knock on the door or whatever, he's like, I'm not coming out!
10096000	10098000	That's funny.
10098000	10100000	Ah, boy. Alright.
10100000	10103000	Hey, something not on the Steam sale to close our news this week.
10103000	10109000	This is not on sale as part of the Steam sale, but some folks spending money on this anyway.
10109000	10112000	It's from a game called Haydenlands.
10112000	10119000	It's an interactive fiction game, it's kind of like the old school adventure game type of thing, like Zork or something like that, those old adventure games.
10120000	10126000	There's no graphics you type your commands in, so like when I say Zork, I mean old school adventure games.
10126000	10144000	Well, there is no hints or a walkthrough with the game, but for £27 DLC, you can actually get a certificate, it's a PDF certificate, that says,
10144000	10152000	You, the player, promise to finish the game without looking at any hints or a walkthrough on the Steam forums or anywhere else on the internet.
10152000	10158000	That's it. You're buying a £27 PDF file.
10158000	10162000	You can sign it, hang it on the wall, that's it.
10162000	10164000	And no one will give a shit.
10164000	10172000	Now, this is interesting though, because when you actually start to read, because the developer actually did an FAQ on it, and so he actually answered some questions.
10172000	10177000	Yes, you get the certificate in PDF format, and what the heck, I'll throw in a JPEG too.
10177000	10179000	It's just a certificate.
10179000	10186000	Here's the thing, and then somebody says, I don't need to buy the certificate, I can just make that promise for free, and the developer responds, absolutely.
10186000	10192000	But it might be easier to stick to that promise once you've laid down some cash on it.
10192000	10194000	Just a thought, it's up to you.
10194000	10201000	So it's kind of one of those psychological things where it's like, well if you pay this kind of money for it, you're actually going to stick to it.
10201000	10211000	Kind of interesting, but he actually went out and said, some folks were commenting, of course as people do on Steam, and the developer actually said,
10211000	10218000	thanks, I was hoping that people would be amused, and I hope some people will put down money for it of course, but it's not a requirement.
10218000	10226000	So some people actually seeing the potential hidden genius in this, but it just also goes to show, if you don't like something, don't fucking buy it.
10227000	10233000	But if this guy can even sell one PDF file, it's probably worth the time you put into making it.
10233000	10236000	Very interesting, needless to say.
10236000	10239000	Oh my gosh, you know my friend Safari Reddit I'm on?
10239000	10240000	Yeah.
10240000	10245000	Just got my good friend Danny to get on it now too, and he's super pumped to do all this like I was.
10245000	10248000	It's contagious, your nerdy is contagious.
10248000	10250000	Well no, cause he is just as big-
10250000	10253000	It's also this stupid power of persuasion thing you have.
10253000	10263000	Well, he also is a huge fan of Pokemon, when X and Y came out, we literally spent the night at Walmart, cause they were the only people selling it at midnight,
10263000	10273000	and then we went back to his place while his wife was sleeping, and just stayed up until 9 the next morning playing X and Y, because that's what we do.
10273000	10278000	Why are you going on Reddit anyway? Don't you know what they say?
10278000	10282000	We're goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit.
10282000	10287000	Cause that song's not taking into account this Pokemon friend Safari sub.
10288000	10294000	We're gonna go to the phones, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, let's get to it.
10294000	10298000	The phone's already ringing, people know. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10298000	10300000	Hey, this is Bobby, I haven't talked to you enough tonight.
10300000	10304000	Hey, Bobby, well, you know, it's not often enough we have you on this side of things.
10304000	10309000	Like, you know, we get on your show, you're very good to have us on your show, really, pretty much every week.
10309000	10314000	But, you know, you're usually not up late enough to be on our show, just kidding.
10314000	10316000	What's on your mind?
10316000	10321000	So, well, A, never go on Reddit. Just wanted to pass that out there.
10321000	10327000	So, no, I actually, because you had the emailer that was talking about VR and how it's already on the way out.
10328000	10336000	And I know, I've been around in the VR development community since it reemerged about three years ago.
10336000	10346000	And I wanted to point out, basically, my advice to him, if he cares about my advice, is that wait another year or two.
10346000	10353000	The problem is, nobody seriously took VR, like, nobody took VR seriously until Facebook bought Oculus.
10354000	10361000	And it takes years to create a full-fledged $60 AAA game, period.
10361000	10368000	And so, no company was willing to put that kind of effort into something until about two years ago.
10368000	10376000	And so, it's going to be another couple years before we get those AAA full-length titles that aren't, quote-unquote, experiences.
10376000	10382000	So, it's not that they're not taking it seriously. They're taking it very seriously, and it's just been too quick.
10383000	10390000	You can kind of see where gamers kind of jump to these conclusions about a lot of hardware, though, right?
10390000	10395000	Like, after the Wii kind of died and the Kinect kind of fizzled out.
10395000	10400000	You can kind of see where gamers, like, feel like they already see the end coming, right?
10400000	10409000	Right. Oh, yeah. But, I mean, what I see, what I've seen and how far we've come development-wise in the past three years,
10409000	10416000	I see it getting better. And it's just, right now, like, when I saw the prices for the current PC hardware,
10416000	10420000	I said, this is not going to be the year that everybody figures out if they want VR or not.
10420000	10426000	We're still another year or two away before we actually see if a, quote-unquote, killer app comes out.
10426000	10430000	Because that doesn't exist. Our Wii Sports does not exist yet.
10431000	10436000	You do make a very, very, very good point, though, about the whole fact that, you know, when Facebook kind of came on board,
10437000	10445000	the game changed a little bit because I think it also shows, and this is very important, is that VR can exist for things that aren't just games.
10445000	10449000	And you really, I mean, there's a lot that's not just games that happens on VR.
10449000	10457000	And you even see some of this integration already happening on Facebook with the whole fact that you can look at the 360-degree experiences on your desktop.
10457000	10460000	Well, you know all that crap's going to be in the VR, too.
10460000	10472000	And so, it's really just a matter of time before people are broadcasting concerts and stuff and all these events and places to be through their Facebook feeds to your Oculus.
10472000	10481000	Well, and the thing is, like, even if VR gaming doesn't pan out, which I don't think that's, you know, I think it's going to pan out. I think it's going to be great.
10481000	10488000	The thing is, VR has finally gotten affordable enough. It's not going away specifically because of what you just said.
10488000	10495000	Because there are other uses of VR in, you know, business applications, you know, real estate developers.
10495000	10500000	Or even, like, architects would actually build a 3D model and walk around it in VR and see what they're doing.
10500000	10507000	I actually have some friends that, I work with a company here in Atlanta called ATLVR.
10507000	10512000	I've actually, like, broadcast from their meetup events, and I work with them throughout the year to do other meetup events.
10512000	10523000	And one of the things they've done is they took Gear VRs to a local VA hospital, and they had a 360-degree video of a church service.
10523000	10532000	And these are people that have not been able to leave the hospital. They have not been able to go to church, to one of these church services for the past however many years.
10532000	10540000	And they actually put them in this 360-degree video, in their wheelchairs or whatever, into this church service, and there were actual tears.
10540000	10551000	That is never going away. That is not the fate of 3D TV. So even if we don't play games with it, VR is not going away anymore.
10551000	10557000	I think that story is exactly how you tell somebody in two minutes how VR is here to stay. It really is.
10557000	10562000	That's what I'm here for. Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
10562000	10569000	Thank you very much, Bobby. Appreciate it. And thank you, God, you've been such a support over the show for well over ten years now.
10569000	10576000	And again, I don't know if people realize, we probably still wouldn't be a live radio show if it wasn't for you.
10576000	10582000	Well, I was a big fan right before I started and continue to be a big fan.
10582000	10589000	Stoppy asked in chat, am I going to cry when I experience VR porn? The problem there is that they haven't figured out the perspective, so all the women are giant.
10590000	10605000	Yeah, all the VR porn I've seen is kind of all the... are they going to be able to get past the whole fact that you're the person sitting on the couch and the other person is doing all the work? They're not really going to be able to get past that, right?
10605000	10614000	I'm sure that there are going to be USB devices that'll help. But I don't know if they're there yet.
10614000	10617000	Bobby doesn't want to have this conversation, you guys.
10617000	10626000	They've already got that stuff. It's out there. Of course it is. I think they probably had the USB devices before they had the actual VR stuff.
10626000	10633000	They do, and here's the thing. How about this? I'll tell you a little bit about Bobby's past here exclusively on the show.
10634000	10645000	My father was also a software developer. It's where I got a lot of the stuff and a lot of my genes and why I wanted to be a software developer and actually a game programmer when I grew up.
10645000	10654000	That didn't happen, but I became a software developer. But he worked with probably the largest adult BBS SysOp in the Atlanta area in the 80s.
10654000	10664000	He actually did work on some of the early webcam stuff for some of the adult entertainment venues here in the Atlanta area with this other person.
10664000	10672000	This other person is still in the adult entertainment industry literally doing those USB devices and syncing them up with videos.
10672000	10680000	He's been doing that for many years. It is so funny every time you post a picture up on Facebook of him in the big fur coat with these young women.
10680000	10689000	He's this old dude now because he was my dad's age. I do know a little more than I probably should.
10689000	10693000	Are you saying that porn is in your blood?
10693000	10696000	It is.
10696000	10705000	That's why we keep you around, Bobby Blackwell. Thank you so much for your support over the years. I appreciate you being here to set us on the right path when it comes to VR.
10705000	10706000	Thank you for having me.
10706000	10708000	You're welcome. Take care, buddy.
10708000	10710000	Take care. Bye bye.
10710000	10715000	1877 Game OLR is the phone number or you can call us on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.
10715000	10718000	Oh my God. The anniversary show. It's lighting up tonight.
10718000	10720000	Hi, Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10720000	10722000	Hey, hey everyone. It's Rama.
10722000	10724000	Hey, Rama. How you doing, buddy?
10724000	10727000	Good, good, good. Do you see me pretty good?
10727000	10732000	I do. I can see you're wearing your VOG shirt tonight, actually. I see that. You look lovely.
10732000	10736000	Thank you. It's a special occasion. You'll have to have the matching hat as well.
10736000	10740000	Oh my God, that's cute. He's got kitty ears, if you guys can't tell.
10740000	10741000	That's the best.
10741000	10750000	And there's actually, I love this, you may not even realize this, but behind Rama, there's a shirt hanging on the closet door that's actually a Rama shirt.
10750000	10752000	It's appropriate.
10752000	10756000	It's the characters from the game Rama One Half Hard Battle.
10756000	10758000	Nice. Love it. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10758000	10764000	Well, it's been 14 years, right?
10765000	10767000	Way too fucking long, right?
10767000	10772000	Well, I think you motherfuckers need a drink.
10775000	10789000	And I didn't forget about Shane, so I have here tequila, rum, vodka.
10789000	10791000	I love vodka.
10791000	10797000	And the official alcoholic beverage of VOG and OLR, thanks to Brad.
10797000	10801000	Fireball! Ah, yes. Yes.
10801000	10802000	Yes.
10802000	10805000	Gotta love Brad from Pod Culture for that.
10805000	10806000	Where's the Kraken?
10806000	10813000	Wait a minute, you said there was something for Shane. Where's your white wine? Because he only drinks Real Housewives of Blank County wine.
10813000	10819000	Well, he is going to have to ask Mako-chan to do that because she handles the wine and the Kraken is still in the fridge.
10819000	10823000	Kraken is the best stuff ever. It makes every soda taste like cookies.
10823000	10825000	I can just drink water. I'm good.
10825000	10829000	Shane, I have a bottle of the Shenine at my house, I think.
10829000	10832000	I still have not finished mine yet.
10832000	10836000	You know, with the three-day weekend next weekend, I think we need to have like a late party. We need to go to round one.
10836000	10837000	Who has a three-day weekend?
10837000	10839000	Yeah, who are these people that get three-day weekends?
10839000	10842000	Oh, sorry about it. Sorry about your lives.
10843000	10844000	Wait, we do have to work out.
10844000	10847000	Well, if he was talking, I wouldn't have gotten the Kraken.
10847000	10857000	Ah, yes. Release the Kraken. So, here he is. He's opening the bottle, pouring himself. A little shot. Did you actually mix that with the Fireball?
10857000	10858000	He might have.
10858000	10863000	I'm doing a shot for each one for each of you. That's what I'm going to do.
10867000	10868000	I love it.
10868000	10876000	I think the conversion, since you don't have wine, would be four shots for my one wine glass that I would have.
10876000	10880000	Oh, Rama just took a shot. That was the Fireball he just took, right?
10880000	10881000	That was the Kraken.
10881000	10882000	Oh, that was the Kraken. Sorry.
10882000	10883000	It was for Jamie.
10883000	10884000	Oh, the Kraken's amazing.
10887000	10891000	Now is the tequila. This is for Loki.
10893000	10894000	There it is.
10897000	10905000	We are watching. I know this isn't the most exciting radio thing, but I do want to point out he is on video and he really is taking these shots live.
10906000	10907000	Next up.
10907000	10908000	Next up.
10908000	10913000	SSG100Matt says, good thing you didn't do a shot for each year. The show has been around. Could be done.
10914000	10916000	Don't test me. I'll do it.
10916000	10918000	Do not test me.
10918000	10926000	We do have staffers here at Anime Jam Session that can do shots of tequila from start to finish and still stand there.
10926000	10927000	Wow.
10927000	10928000	Yes.
10928000	10933000	Not me. I have zero alcohol tolerance. You give me one of those shots and I'm going to get silly.
10933000	10935000	Rob turns bright red and glows in the dark.
10935000	10940000	I guess it's a good thing you didn't come into town for Pride yesterday. All the alcohol.
10940000	10943000	Oh, yeah. Pride's always on my birthday. Pride always ruins my birthday.
10943000	10946000	There it is. Another shot. What was that? Was that the rum?
10946000	10947000	That was the vodka.
10947000	10950000	Vodka. I like vodka.
10950000	10953000	And now here is the whiskey.
10954000	10956000	And the last shot glass.
10959000	10961000	He's pouring the whiskey. Oh, you're almost out.
10962000	10965000	Oh, Rama. You're finishing it off.
10966000	10974000	Well, I save these for special occasions because when we party in the rooms at conventions, I do take the booze home.
10974000	10975000	I mean.
10975000	10977000	As any smart person should.
10977000	10981000	There are some articles we cover on Anime Jam Session that make me want to get up and drink.
10983000	10986000	Even though this is not full, I will continue with the tradition.
10986000	10994000	Here's to you. Here's to me. The best of friends will ever be. If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you. And here's to me.
10995000	10996000	Amen.
10997000	10999000	Four shots. Rama just did back to back.
10999000	11001000	I still like the other one.
11001000	11002000	Huh.
11002000	11007000	Here's to us. Who's like us? Damn few. And they're all dead.
11008000	11010000	I have to remember that one.
11012000	11015000	I think it actually got re-quoted in Mass Effect 3 at some point.
11015000	11023000	We just used to end. We actually used to end our D&D sessions with that as a toast, followed by Have Fun Storm in the Castle.
11025000	11026000	That's funny.
11027000	11037000	Well, Rama, you have been a huge, huge, huge support of our show over the years. I don't know where we'd be without you. You were the one that got Reggie Fils-Aime on this show, even if it was for 30 seconds.
11038000	11039000	I tried, but like I said.
11039000	11040000	But it was exclusive.
11040000	11050000	If it wasn't for all of you, I wouldn't be doing this podcasting. I don't know. I would probably still be going to conventions, taking pictures or something. I probably wouldn't be expanding.
11050000	11058000	So, you know, you and Travis kind of gave me another outlook for conventions to do more things and have more fun.
11059000	11068000	Well, that is the highest honor we could get because you guys have accomplished so much over there with Anime Jam Session and kind of doing your thing there on the anime scene.
11068000	11076000	They know Rama at conventions. They do. He famous. They don't know me at PAX, but they know him at anime cons.
11077000	11082000	Well, yeah, you know. Are you trying to make me blush, Mr. Rob Roberts?
11083000	11084000	I wouldn't be able to tell if you were.
11087000	11091000	That's racist. But it's okay because I'm not offended.
11092000	11095000	Oh my god, you can already tell the liquor's starting to hit him. I love it.
11095000	11098000	Rob is an old man now, so racism kind of just creeps in.
11099000	11101000	I'm not grandpa. I'm not grandpa.
11102000	11108000	You have to understand, I was with a friend today. We went to Pride and we was at the parade for almost five hours.
11109000	11119000	And, you know, I couldn't go by myself without, you know, a canister with some alcoholic beverage with me so I can, you know, myself.
11119000	11129000	And I did not realize how long the parade is because normally after about two or three hours, we go to a bar in downtown Manhattan and just kind of unwind, but five hours. Wow.
11130000	11132000	The dikes on bikes alone take like 90 minutes.
11134000	11139000	He didn't even see them. I didn't think they were at the front or at the end. I was like, uhhhh.
11140000	11144000	I don't think you'll ever see more boobs in your life than the dikes on bikes. You gotta get out there.
11145000	11148000	Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go so we can try to squeeze in a couple more collars before we're done for the night.
11149000	11150000	But thank you.
11151000	11152000	Rob, one more thing before I get out of here.
11153000	11154000	Stay fabulous, darling.
11155000	11160000	I will. And of course, Rama, you know I say this from the bottom of my heart, with love, stay black.
11161000	11162000	Alright, you got it.
11163000	11164000	Alright. Take care, my friend.
11165000	11166000	You too.
11167000	11171000	Alright, bye. I'm just waiting for the angry email that comes into the show. You guys are fucking racist.
11171000	11175000	You have to understand, that is an inside joke that dates back a long time.
11176000	11177000	It's Dan's fault.
11178000	11179000	It is Dan's fault.
11180000	11181000	It is my husband's fault.
11182000	11183000	Alright, but we got another call coming in because the calls are coming back to back tonight.
11184000	11185000	Everything is my husband's fault.
11186000	11187000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?
11188000	11189000	Hey, this is MXC in the chat room or Marcus.
11190000	11193000	Well, hey, good to hear from you. I don't think you call in very often, do you?
11194000	11195000	Yeah, never.
11196000	11197000	Oh, first timer.
11198000	11199000	Yep.
11199000	11202000	Thank you for sacrificing your phone call virginity to us.
11203000	11204000	That's right.
11205000	11210000	Well, I wanted to call in and say congrats on your 14th anniversary, guys. It's pretty intense.
11211000	11212000	Thank you.
11213000	11217000	And I thought this was a funny coincidence. I started listening to your show when I was 14.
11218000	11219000	Oh, fuck. Here we go.
11221000	11222000	How old are you now?
11223000	11224000	26.
11225000	11226000	Oh my god.
11226000	11228000	Oh, you sweet summer child.
11229000	11230000	I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Someone had to.
11231000	11235000	Oh, that was, so you might, I'm going to guess at 14 and you were listening to this show.
11236000	11238000	If you've been listening, that's still, that's still a while to be listening to the show.
11239000	11240000	You must have been a big DDR player back in the day.
11241000	11242000	Absolutely.
11243000	11244000	That's where I found the show.
11245000	11246000	That's where it is. My signature on DDR Freak or something.
11247000	11248000	Yeah.
11249000	11250000	Love it.
11251000	11252000	DDR Freak, man. Making signatures was my freaking hobby.
11253000	11254000	Yeah, you still...
11254000	11255000	You still talk about icons on LiveJournal.
11256000	11257000	Yeah.
11258000	11265000	You know, I still have my LiveJournal with my icons from maybe about five years ago, six years ago, last time I used it.
11266000	11270000	ActDeftInChat says, I was 24 when I started listening. LOL.
11271000	11272000	Me too. I was 24 when the show started.
11273000	11279000	So, actually, no, I was 23 for the very first episode because it was three days before my 24th birthday.
11280000	11281000	So...
11281000	11284000	Yeah, I was, I was still in my twenties.
11285000	11286000	Yeah. And then, so...
11287000	11288000	I know. Here we are.
11289000	11290000	I'm sorry, guys.
11291000	11292000	No, it's all right. It's all right.
11293000	11294000	That's okay. I got carded the other day, so I'm happy.
11295000	11297000	Well, thank you for being around still all these years. That's, that's amazing.
11298000	11300000	Especially considering, you know, we've kind of drifted away from the music game stuff a little bit.
11301000	11305000	That's awesome that, you know, um, a lot of folks have still stuck with us. I really appreciate that.
11305000	11312000	Yeah, it's just a lot of fun each week, you know, hear you guys chatting about, well, video games and food a lot.
11313000	11314000	But it's also pretty fun.
11315000	11316000	You want a cupcake? Come get it.
11317000	11319000	We have some raspberry lemon ones that are pretty good.
11320000	11321000	Oh, that sounds delicious.
11322000	11323000	All right. Oh, well.
11324000	11327000	A little bit of a distance. Well, um, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
11327000	11335000	Um, I mean, I don't know. Are you guys, I know you've been to GamerX and MagFest. Any plans for conventions?
11336000	11337000	I know you're going also to Final Fantasy FanFest.
11338000	11339000	GamerX is coming up in September.
11340000	11343000	Yeah, I feel like there's like way small time.
11344000	11350000	But I guess because GamerX was in December last year, it is actually shorter this year because they're bumping it back up to the fall.
11350000	11357000	So, yeah, Vaga Network is actually sponsoring GamerX again. So, Dark Soccer and I at least for sure will be there.
11358000	11361000	I don't know about Shane. I know Loki usually can't do the con thing because of family.
11362000	11363000	Is Shane doing GamerX?
11364000	11369000	I don't know. Maybe. It just, I mean, depends on when it is.
11370000	11372000	It's the last weekend of September leading in October.
11373000	11374000	Shane, do you need to do a Blue Ranger costume?
11375000	11378000	Um, I wouldn't know which Blue Ranger to go as.
11378000	11380000	I don't think I want Shane wearing spandex.
11381000	11382000	You should do Mega Blue.
11383000	11387000	No, if I was going to wear something, it was going to be Gundam from Danganronpa.
11388000	11389000	Oh, you should totally do that.
11390000	11394000	But I don't think, I don't know if I'm going to go, so I'm a TBA.
11395000	11397000	I'll help you make the costume though. That would be awesome.
11398000	11400000	I know Shane's doing Power Morph Cons.
11401000	11402000	Power Morph Con and Pokemon Worlds.
11403000	11404000	Shane, I will make you the hamsters.
11405000	11406000	I want real hamsters.
11406000	11410000	My convention calendar for the rest of this year, I'm doing Dragon Con absolutely for sure.
11411000	11414000	That is a given. And then of course Fan Fest is booked and stamped and ready to go.
11415000	11417000	And I will do GamerX as well since VOG Network is sponsoring that.
11418000	11421000	That's three cons for the rest of the year. That's pretty much going to fill up my year.
11422000	11425000	And then I am looking at MAG Fest for next year as well. I had such a great time this year.
11426000	11429000	I can't see how MAG Fest is not going to be a regular thing moving forward.
11430000	11433000	Awesome. Yeah, I definitely want to go to MAG Fest again.
11433000	11435000	That's like insanely good.
11436000	11439000	Yeah, and I feel like it's just going to get better. I want to do a panel at MAG Fest this year though now.
11440000	11442000	Now that I've kind of had a taste of it, it's like I want more.
11443000	11444000	It'll be a lot of fun.
11445000	11449000	Alright, well thank you so much for calling into the show. I really appreciate it.
11450000	11452000	And please come up and say hello if we end up at one of these cons.
11453000	11454000	Yeah, I definitely will.
11455000	11456000	Alright, awesome. Thank you so much for listening.
11457000	11458000	Hey, thanks for the show.
11459000	11460000	Take care. Thanks for being here.
11461000	11462000	Bye.
11463000	11467000	I know MAG Fest wasn't in January. That's kind of where I'm at as well because it's like, ugh.
11468000	11470000	I don't want to get snowed in.
11471000	11473000	Alright, we'll try to squeeze in one more call here.
11474000	11478000	The phones are on fire tonight, you guys. I'm really sorry. I'm not going to be able to get to everybody because it's already 9.30.
11479000	11480000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
11481000	11482000	Hey, it's Sturlock.
11483000	11484000	Hey, Sturlock, buddy. What's on your mind tonight?
11485000	11489000	Not too much. Just wanted to call and wish you guys a happy birthday and you as well, Rob.
11489000	11493000	Thank you. I really appreciate that. Thanks for your support over the years. I know you've been listening for a few years.
11494000	11497000	I've been listening for about half the show's life now, I guess.
11498000	11501000	A pretty freaking impressive amount of dedication. I really appreciate that.
11502000	11503000	2007, I think.
11504000	11505000	Wow, and here you are.
11506000	11507000	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
11508000	11517000	Oh, not a whole lot. I'm both kind of excited and sad about Pokemon Sun and Moon.
11517000	11520000	You were talking about this a little bit in chat, and I think Shane should hear this.
11521000	11523000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
11524000	11525000	He said he's excited.
11526000	11527000	No, I heard.
11528000	11529000	Alright, Shane would like you to explain yourself.
11530000	11531000	Yes, please.
11532000	11539000	I've been playing, for people who don't know, but I think most people know at this point, I'm a blind gamer.
11539000	11549000	Blind since birth. I've been playing games with varying degrees of success, pretty much forever.
11550000	11556000	And I've actually been playing Pokemon since Red, Blue, and Yellow.
11557000	11564000	And one thing that really makes Pokemon playable, one is its awesome sound design.
11565000	11569000	And the other thing is the grid-based movement.
11570000	11575000	And it seems with Sun and Moon, they're probably ditching the grid.
11576000	11577000	Yes, I can see that.
11578000	11588000	I'm holding out hope that it works like sixth gen, where you can still use the grid if you use the G-pad, but I have my doubts, but yeah.
11588000	11594000	What about the grid makes it…
11595000	11600000	Because everything is relative. Nothing changes as you're moving.
11601000	11609000	You know how unlike a lot of 3D-based games, you're not really moving in straight lines.
11610000	11614000	You're constantly having to fiddle with the camera to keep going in a straight line.
11614000	11627000	If you're not messing with the camera at all, it's changing constantly, so you're not moving relatively.
11628000	11641000	If you move up and then you move back down, because everything's on an angle, you're not going to move the exact opposite direction.
11641000	11654000	And that's why the grid is so nice. Everything is just relative. North is always north, south is always south, that kind of thing.
11655000	11658000	And everything being tile-based.
11658000	11669000	That is kind of unfortunate, but at the same time I realize that this series has to change.
11670000	11685000	I kind of look at it as like, you know what, I have the old games and I still enjoy the hell out of the old games, and I'll just watch playthroughs of the new stuff.
11685000	11694000	I think it's reasonable to hold out hope, though. Prepare for the worst, but hopefully you'll still get the best.
11695000	11707000	The idea that the D-Pad can still work will hopefully pan out, because they probably don't focus on that type of stuff in the big showy trailers and the stuff they're really trying to show.
11707000	11718000	Especially if they're trying to express freedom in Pokemon games, they're not going to really focus on that. But I really hope Nintendo doesn't leave people behind as they grow, so to speak.
11718000	11736000	Yeah, and it's just like, the way the games were designed in the past, it's almost like, I don't know, it's almost like, I know this isn't the case, but it's almost as if they almost knew that blind people were playing these games.
11737000	11742000	Just by the way they designed things and the way the sound design works.
11742000	11746000	You played Gen 6 then, right?
11747000	11748000	Yeah.
11749000	11751000	So what about the gym where you're on roller skates?
11752000	11754000	That was a lot of trial and error.
11755000	11757000	That was a lot of...
11758000	11766000	Because with that, that still kind of worked if you...
11767000	11780000	But you had to be very careful to make sure that you weren't going up or down as you were, you know what I mean, like you were moving in straight lines basically with the circle pad.
11781000	11787000	So it was a lot of trial and error, that gym is kind of a giant pain.
11788000	11790000	Lumio City is another...
11791000	11792000	What's that?
11793000	11795000	It's a giant pain in general, just so you know.
11796000	11801000	Oh, Lumio City, I've heard people that are sighted even hate that place.
11802000	11803000	Yeah, that's pretty terrible too.
11804000	11809000	That one I literally had to have someone, just because of like...
11810000	11817000	Literally the perspective is so different in that place that conventional movement is impossible.
11819000	11826000	So I literally had to have someone sighted write literal step-by-step directions through that fucking place.
11827000	11830000	So I could get through the parts where it was required.
11831000	11839000	Well, my fingers crossed for you, my friend, that Nintendo is able to make the games accessible.
11840000	11847000	And I think you've always been a really good reminder when you call into the show, giving us your perspective, that games need to be accessible.
11848000	11852000	And that way everybody who is a fan of games can really enjoy them, and accessibility is really, really important.
11853000	11856000	So hopefully Nintendo will get you back one way or the other.
11857000	11862000	Yeah, definitely. Also, Jamie, you're gonna have...
11863000	11868000	Yeah, thanks for getting Mind Paradise stuck in my head now. I'm gonna be listening to that thing on repeat.
11869000	11871000	It is seriously one of the best songs.
11872000	11873000	It's great.
11874000	11879000	We were just sitting here in the studio during the break talking about how that Dance Maniacs game had really, really had some of the best songs with it. It was amazing.
11880000	11888000	I didn't realize that Cat's Eye was from... because you guys have played that many times over the years in breaks.
11889000	11890000	Cat's Eye also made it into 4th Mix.
11891000	11896000	Yeah, it was also in 4th Mix Plus, I think. So it was a Bamani song that was in multiple games.
11897000	11899000	It gets played twice as much.
11900000	11901000	That's good stuff.
11902000	11904000	Well, my friend, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up tonight's show, but thanks so much for the call. I really appreciate it.
11905000	11908000	Yeah, no problem. Happy birthday to, like I said, to you and the show.
11909000	11911000	Thank you very much. Appreciate it, buddy. Take care. Have a great week.
11912000	11913000	Thank you.
11914000	11919000	Alright, thank you to those that called in tonight. I'm very sorry to those that didn't get through. It was ringing off the hook tonight.
11920000	11926000	Please consider sending an email. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send an email. Make Dark Sakura work next week.
11927000	11930000	That is gonna do it, however, though, for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11931000	11935000	Before we roll the credits, I wanna make sure we check in for any last minute stories with Loki. I don't know if we have anything here.
11936000	11946000	Yeah, I was just gonna mention that the Dolphin emulator has reached 5.0 and there's been a ton of updates done to it where a lot of games will run much better and all that sort of thing.
11947000	11954000	So, if you wanna check it out, I wanna say it's at, I think, Dolphin-EMU.org. Let's go check it out.
11955000	11959000	I'm actually thinking about downloading it because I, I don't know, the fuck of it.
11960000	11961000	Awesome.
11962000	11963000	That's it.
11963000	11971000	Alright. Well, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting it for the past 14 years.
11972000	11977000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, as we always say every week, tell a friend or two or 15 about the show.
11978000	11984000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can only put those voices out there if they show up.
11985000	11991000	Word of mouth is really all we've had. We don't have a million dollar website backing us up. We don't have celebrity power or any of that stuff.
11991000	11997000	So, word of mouth is really what we got and thank you guys so much. You guys have some very kind things and stay in chat there.
11998000	12004000	SG100Matt saying thank you guys and Gal for all your hard work over these 14 years. Thank you guys for showing up every week and giving us a reason to do it.
12005000	12008000	ActDef saying thanks to you guys. Keep doing such great work. Thank you.
12009000	12015000	RobertM saying anyone in the audience gotten Drawful 2. I fucking forgot that came out this week. I gotta, did you know that?
12016000	12017000	That Drawful 2 came out?
12017000	12028000	Yeah, but I feel like I haven't played enough Drawful to really care about Drawful 2. I would like some more Quiplash and some more Bomb Corp.
12029000	12030000	Well, they have a Party Pack 3 coming so.
12031000	12032000	Yeah, by doubt there's a new Bomb Corp in it.
12033000	12036000	But I bet a new You Don't Know Jack is in it. I'm hoping. I'm hoping.
12037000	12038000	More Bomb Corp. So good.
12039000	12045000	Alright, we'll see. We'll see. Alright, that is gonna do it for our show this week. We do have to go around of course and get everybody's final thought.
12045000	12048000	Hey Shane, thanks for being here and spending the special show with us.
12049000	12050000	You're welcome.
12051000	12053000	Appreciate it. Have fun with Pokemon. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
12054000	12063000	No, if you like Power Rangers, please listen to my show and my pending Pokemon thing that I'm beginning to start working on kind of.
12064000	12071000	Alright, good luck with that. My final thought, I'll go first. My final thought tonight is, you know, I was really stressed about this weekend.
12071000	12078000	Not really with this show alone, but it was just kind of like this in addition to Rocky last night, in addition to other stuff I had going on yesterday.
12079000	12083000	I was like, oh my God, I had so much stress this weekend. But this weekend actually was pretty rad.
12084000	12088000	So I'm actually kind of like, oh, I'm sad. I have to go back to the real world and work tomorrow and all that.
12089000	12095000	But, oh well, got to pay the bills. And I have 4th of July next week to look forward to, so that'll be a thing.
12096000	12097000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
12097000	12104000	So as I mentioned last week, I'm supposed to be driving a Lamborghini in a racetrack on Saturday.
12105000	12112000	So if it's anything like I drive in Forza Horizon, this may be the last show that I'm alive on. So it's been nice knowing you.
12113000	12117000	You'll be fine. Let us know how that goes though. I hope there's some video or something.
12118000	12120000	Yeah, I don't have any GoPro cameras or anything to take. That'd be awesome.
12121000	12122000	You need to find one, borrow one.
12123000	12126000	And last but certainly never least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
12127000	12132000	Reject false icons. Also, Taco.
12133000	12139000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back next week for even more.
12140000	12145000	As was said in a comment earlier, as the road to the OLR quiceniera begins.
12146000	12149000	Have a wonderful week everybody. Happy gaming. We'll see you next time.
