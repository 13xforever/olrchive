00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, Orange Lounge Radio celebrates its 14th birthday and Rob Roberts a little bit more than his 14th birthday!

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Raise your glasses and cheers to the longest running video game live show in podcast and internet history!

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000

Orange Lounge Radio

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
And Rob Roberts

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hi my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live with this tonight, episode number 647 for this June the 26th of 2016.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
I gotta say, usually every week I listen to Jason's intro just so I have an idea, kind of like what's leading into the show.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
This week I didn't so that is actually really, for some reason I just didn't listen to it this week.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
And that was actually a nice surprise. Thank you Jason.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining you guys here as we have every week for the past 14 years since June 23rd, 2002.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Back then we used to talk about everything that was going on with music gaming.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
Things like Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania, Parappa the Rappa, Bust a Move or Groove depending on what side of the pond you were on.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
And all those types of things and then here we are all these years later as video game fans talking about the thing that we really love, video games.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
And we used to, after we would play DDR at the arcade, we'd go to the, I've told this story like 500 times in the past year but I'm gonna tell it again.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It's because you're old and that's what they do.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Hey, you be quiet until I introduce you. After 14 years you should know the rules by now.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And I'll get off your lawn, that's fine.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
So we would go to the cafe that was in the parking lot and we would eat and sit around and talk smack about DDR games in general.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
And that's what we'd like to do here on our show that we've created.

01:58.000 --> 02:07.000
And here we are 14 years later, me, Rob Roberts on Twitter at SkySKIE and joining me by my side for these 14 years.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
My longest relationship ever with a woman.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
How are you?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm full of roughage.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Yes, I had my usual subway stop.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, where they actually know you now. It's like the Cheers bar, right? But you come through the door.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
She asks about my cosplay.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Does she? That's great.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
That's awesome. How is your cosplay? You're working on something for Gamer X, right?

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
It is, but it's also coming along kind of slowly.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
And I'm gonna be pulling a Jiggly Caliente with the corset.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Sometimes you gotta do whatever you gotta do to make it work.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, just if you don't know the reference, just look it up.

02:50.000 --> 03:02.000
Thank you very much. I have not loaded up Steam yet, but I know you let me know that it is not only the 14 year, but as Jason said in the intro, it does happen to be my actual birthday today.

03:02.000 --> 03:12.000
And you actually on Steam bought me a Steam controller, which is awesome because I can't wait to check that out and see if I really can play Civ on the TV with one of those.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
And then you bought me Shower with Your Dad Simulator, right?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, because you're worth 69 cents.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm worth 69 cents, which is funny for that game.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
No, I laughed my ass off. I saw my buddy Derek playing that when we were visiting him when we went to the Ingress thing in Tucson.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
So yeah, that game looks hilarious. I put it on my wish list.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
And Jamie is making the Shower with Your Dad wishes come true. Thank you. I appreciate that.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Enjoy!

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
All right.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
You should fetch the goodies while you introduce the others.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Oh yes, and you brought some goodies to the show tonight. You guys are spoiling me tonight.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, they're also for the anniversary show.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I have to share a birthday with my baby.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
It's like having your birthday on Easter.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And it's like having a baby in a throuple.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm gonna go get the cupcakes now.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
So say hello to our third over there, Techmaster Loki.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Hello.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I'm doing fine.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Let Shane take your usual spot on the show.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
That shit gets really hot. And it's summer, so that's why I'm sitting on this show.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Hey, you can't talk to me until you introduce me.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Be quiet. I can talk about you. I just don't want to hear you speak as long as possible.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Where you're sitting now is right by the AC vent.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, that's also. But yeah, it's basically that couch, whereas it is comfortable, it is also very warm.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And so, this is not the weather for me to sit on that couch.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It's just like, ah, it's too bad.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
That couch used to be mine, and I can attest to this.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
This is one of the first triple degree days we've had in SAC in a while, too, right?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
A couple weeks.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
We did in May, and then it got cooler again, and then it didn't.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I forgot. Can you blame me?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
So, cupcakes.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay, so live joining us in chat since I want to introduce these guys every week in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
We do have a live chat room where the question is being asked by William Murderface,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
the fuck is a throuple?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That's a relationship between three people.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I know it's not something you hear about every day, but it's when three people are-

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It's like a couple.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It's a couple, but there's three.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
There's three.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Derek Barry, Nebraska Thunderfuck, and that other guy.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
It's like if three people throw up at the same time, they throuple.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I suppose, I suppose.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
So, in a way, we're a throuple, but it's not that kind of throuple.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
It's a platonic throuple is what we have here at Orange Lounge Radio

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
because I've joked that this show is our baby that we've had in a throuple,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
and our baby's turning 14 years old today.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Old enough to be obnoxious and going through puberty.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
No, no, they can start doing- well, the puberty part, yes.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
They can drive in Mississippi.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
They can be obnoxious far before that.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
But, old enough to mow the goddamn lawn.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
And old enough to complain and not do it anyways.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Hey, Loki, by the way, I want to say a big thank you.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
You guys are giving me a present today.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Loki got me on PlayStation 4.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
He actually bought me a copy of Fallout 4

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
because my copy that I had on Xbox One mysteriously vanished

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
after I only had it for a week, which was a bummer,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
but I suppose I didn't really deserve it.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So, Loki actually got me a copy of Fallout 4 on PlayStation 4, which is awesome.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Alan will be very happy to hear that because he's been trying to get me to play that.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
And hey, the mod should be starting anytime soon, so we'll have mods.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And also, he handed this to me and said,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Now you don't have a fucking excuse. He gave me a copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 4.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You gotta play it. It's awesome.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
I will check it out. I'm excited to check out all the souped-up graphics and all that stuff.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm going to chat again for some more comments.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Misty in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
I think I prefer triad, but I'm also more used to hearing it.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
Oh, I guess I didn't know it was one of those things like soda and pop and just calling it coke.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I didn't know it was one of those things where it had different names.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Some people just say threesome.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah, I guess so. I'd always heard throuple.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Some people say Friday nights.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
Anyhow, as if it's any surprise at this point, also joining us tonight is Shane.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
There is filling in the middle of this cupcake.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Is there really?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
Now, you know how fucking unprofessional it is to eat while you're trying to talk on air because people don't want to hear that.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm just saying.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Bitch, this is us. Professionalism is nothing.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
I'll take the microphone into the bathroom if I need to.

07:52.000 --> 08:00.000
Please don't. Which, by the way, speaking of professionalism on broadcasting, congrats on Ranger Pride.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I know you guys have been doing very well over there with your show.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Thank you. We didn't have a show this week.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
When you bothered to show up, you did very well.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Okay, so one week I was traveling and then this week we didn't have it.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And we're coming back next week just fine.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
It's funny because if you look at the schedule for guys on the show, it's been really, really bad lately.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah, I know.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
If you guys didn't know, Xtra had shingles.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And he posted about that on Twitter, so it's not like it's private or anything.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
But yeah, so that's why we've been out for a couple weeks.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
That's always a distinct possibility of me because I have never had chicken buns.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Oh my god.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Same.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But you know what? I'm fucking immune.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Let's hope. Let's hope.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm too afraid. I've never had it either.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I thought there was a point where if you don't get it by a certain age, you're not going to get it.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
No, it just gets worse.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
It works.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh shit.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
No, not necessarily.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Because my uncle had chicken pox when he was a kid and he had shingles as an adult.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
And then on top of that though, I think they do have, well I know they have basically,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
you can get a couple shots and then be immune to chicken pox.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
But fuck that. I ain't getting any more shots.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I am just going to play my odds.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
Okay, and I do want to respond to something in chat because my little comment about soda and pop and coke from earlier is now going on in chat.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And I want to make this clear. Don't ever call it pop in front of me.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah, that is a sound. That's not a drink.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah, that's what bubblegum does.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
And when you say pop, yeah, exactly. That's what I think of.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, gum is nasty anyway.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I have the same reaction. So don't call it pop around me.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
It's soda or it's coke or it's fizzy drink. I don't care. Just don't call it P-O-P.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Because I think that's P-O-O-P.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I've just learned to be specific.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Now in Alabama, everything is a fucking coke. It's a southern thing.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Everything is a coke.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I'd like a coke.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Alright, well you have this, this, and this.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I said I wanted a coke.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So anyway.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
But I have preferred just saying, may I have a non-caffeinated cola?

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
If I want a non-caffeinated cola beverage.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
Being from California for, you know, the beginning of my life and then moving to Kansas.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
They called it pop there and I always called it soda and I would correct them every single time.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
The entire time I lived there.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
You're doing the Lord's work.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I know. I was.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Thank you.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
You're welcome.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Alright.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Specifically for you.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
And to answer Slag Kick's question, I do not call all sodas cokes. I quit that habit really quickly because it annoyed me.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I'm a very specific person.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
I hate having to go to restaurants and you get that awkward, yeah I'd like a coke, oh we have Pepsi.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
So I always have to go, I'd like a coke or a Pepsi.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Just your cola beverage please.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, I think her idea of doing cola actually works really well.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
That's what I do. May I have a cola beverage?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Which instantly crosses out Dr. Pepper, root beer, and any of the clear beverages.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Now one of these days I hope I actually get asked.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
If I say I want a cola, I hope somebody says, does that mean you want RC Cola?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Because I'll be like, fuck yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
But I have yet to ever find a restaurant that has RC Cola.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
You've never heard of RC Cola?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
No one's gonna have RC Cola on tap.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I beg to differ.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I can fucking dream, thank you very much.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I found RC Cola on tap.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
If you say cola, why would that exclude like Dr. Pepper?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because Dr. Pepper is technically not considered a cola.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
What is it?

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
It's a soda, but they could not, it actually was a legal reason that they could not call it a cola to prevent some type of competition thing with Coca Cola.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Here's the other with you.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
When I lived in Chico, um, when I went to school up there, which is, Chico's a town that's like two hours north of here, that's a big college town.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
They didn't have Dr. Pepper like anywhere, it was all Dr. Thunder, which I thought was so weird, and I never understood that.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
That, isn't that like the Walmart brand?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You would think?

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
It is like, it's like a knockoff brand or something.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Is it like Mr. Pibb?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I may actually have the name wrong, but it was Dr. Something Else.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Mr. Pibb, Dr. Pepper is, you know.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Mr. Pibb was okay, but-

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I like Mr. Pibb.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
He didn't go to, he didn't get his doctor and he's just Mr. Pibb.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Even though this stuff tastes like shit, I go nuts when I find Tab.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
Because the cans have never changed since like the 70s, and I'm like, I'm drinking history.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
I think college towns have some weird like, contract with places like that, because like you said, they didn't have Dr. Pepper, they had Dr. Thunder.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
My college town had Mr. Pibb, and Dr. Pepper was nowhere to be found in that town.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
I will point out, they're talking, again, I'm like, why are we talking about soda on our video game show?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But I suppose, well, you know, when you play games, you do drink a lot of soda, so everybody has an opinion on this.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Or if you're up until nine in the morning sharing friend codes, and you have to stay awake for the rest of the day.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Like your night last night?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
But Pepsi is still far superior anyway.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
So in chat, they're talking about this whole Coke thing.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
I do want to point out, I did find the one place in Atlanta that didn't have Coke, and that had Pepsi instead of Coke.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And I gotta say, like, because I actually prefer Pepsi to Coke.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Was it an Oasis in the desert?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It was the Hard Rock Cafe, believe it or not.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It has Pepsi and not Coke. And I was floored.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
I tend to like Pepsi more, but when you get some of these places that have the perfect ratio of syrup and the carbonated water.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Like I went to this Mizuki sushi place by my house.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Holy crap, that soda was fucking awesome.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It was just the perfect amount of syrup in there.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
It's just, give me more of that. I don't care what it is, just keep giving it to me.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Bobby said they burned that place to the ground.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
Here's the weird thing. I like Pepsi, but if I go diet, I way prefer Coke Zero.

13:16.000 --> 13:24.000
See, Misty's got it right. I loved back when I was visiting Alabama, I could find Cheerwine at the grocery store, and it made me happy.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
And now, thankfully, the BevMo or something near my house gets Diet Cheerwine in.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
But I can't drink it because of the caffeine. It is very caffeinated.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I miss caffeine so freaking much.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And Dungeon Buster, trying to bring it back to game, says the best cola is Nuka Cola.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
Let's see, also our pals, Slagkick from Gamebooey.org, joining us in chat tonight.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Hi, Slagkick.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
I hear on this week's show, they're going to have a discussion about Mighty No. 9.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Because, you know, that game has been getting a lot of flack on the interwebs.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
But my understanding is that Captain Spike over on that show actually says it is not that bad and y'all need to shut up.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
So that'll be on Gamebooey.org this week, so stay tuned for that on Tuesday.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
But Slagkick, Dr. Slagkick, I suppose, because he's found the answer here.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
Dr. Pepper was a frequent player in the 1990s antitrust history of the United States.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
As a part of these activities, economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that Dr. Pepper is a pepper-flavored drink and not a cola.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Pepper does not taste like pepper.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
That is stupid.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I like Dr. Pepper, though.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I never found a pepper that tasted like that.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
No.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Whatever.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
All right, anyhow, so it is our 14-year anniversary show, so, you know, this is crazy.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
As of June 23rd, 2002 was our very first episode, and now here we are 14 years later.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
You know, you kind of hit a point, just like you do with your regular birthdays, because today happens to be my actual birthday.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
And I would say everything after 21 was just kind of, eh, right?

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Kind of like after 21, it's like, oh, hey, it's my birthday, eh, you know, big deal.

15:08.000 --> 15:15.000
And I think we're kind of getting to that point with the podcast, but it's so awesome that you guys have been supporting us for all these years.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
And I think if nothing else, this is a chance for us to kind of step back and just be like, oh, my gosh, like, you know, we've done this for so long,

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
and it's because of the support of you guys out there and the awesome community that we have.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
You know, we don't have the largest community. We're not the most listened to video game podcast, that's for sure, by any means.

15:34.000 --> 15:43.000
But we have, I would argue, the most loyal, if not one of the most loyal podcasts, followings out there.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
And so I just, I really appreciate you guys that do turn out for the show and listen.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
It's funny because once in a while somebody will tell me, oh, OLR, gosh, I haven't listened to that in years.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I need to come back and listen to that again or something, so, but I'm still always like, they told it.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
We just need to start serving beer and wine like Barnes and Noble and then we'll bring them back.

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
What a genius idea, right? Hey, Jamie, let's go get drunk and read. Doesn't that sound like fun?

16:09.000 --> 16:17.000
That sounds like tons of fun. It's like, go wild, you know, move into the philosophy section.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
I'm going to drink until Twilight's good.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't think there's enough liquor in the back.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says, not to mention all the podcasts you guys have influenced too.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
That is honestly the most ultimate compliment I think the show can get.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Is that, you know, you influenced me to do my own gaming podcast or whatever it is.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
That's always like the most awesome compliment we can get.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
Or when we inspire our loud friend who interrupts people to do a Power Rangers podcast.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
That's always very, I'm just messing with you.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Whatever.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
So William Cranston, you know, what do you think? I don't really see him as Zoran, but whatever.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh, um, what's his real name? I forgot.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Brian Cranston.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Brian, yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Not William, William.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
We'll talk about it this week on our show, but I am fine. I mean, who saw Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa?

17:11.000 --> 17:18.000
But I love Elizabeth Banks, so she's just the right amount of crazy and loud.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
It's just the, the costumes just don't look right.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
In the pictures we've seen from the set, the Red Ranger suit actually looks good.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
The pictures that they've shown, like publicity stills, I don't like those ones.

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
But I think once we see it in real action and not these like over, I don't know, over digitally enhanced pictures.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I think a lot of people's opinions will change.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
I feel like I'm going to get dragged to see the Power Rangers movie by somebody who show her name nameless.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
And so I'll end up having to see it even though I know like next to nothing about it.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I mean, like it sounds interesting. I just, you know, I don't know.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
I've never seen some of the Power Ranger movies in theaters, which I don't know why, because I didn't really like Power Rangers.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But somehow I did watch them in theaters.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
I never saw the second one to this day. I haven't seen the second movie, but I saw the first one in theaters.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I liked it when I was a kid.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I saw it in a theater.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
Ragenator in chat says, just to think, in a few years, you three will hear fans that can say,

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Hey, I started listening to you when I started kindergarten. Now I'm married with children.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
You realize we're kind of already getting those emails, except it's like junior high school and now I'm married.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
And I'm always like, wow, I feel so old right now.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
But no, it is really flattering when we get emails like that.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm very thankful for that.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
But it's just like, wow, this really has been going on for a very long time.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
Before we get into our gaming weeks and news and all that, Shane, I know you are a really, really big fan of Pokemon.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
In fact, I almost feel like I should call Annie's intervention because you actually showed me this spreadsheet that you put together for all the Pokemon.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, I need it. I need it. It's important.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Okay. Can you explain why you need a spreadsheet for Pokemon and what it's doing for you?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I don't see why this isn't just part of our gaming weeks.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Because it falls under gaming.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Well, whatever.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I'll talk about this, but I'll probably talk about it when we get to our gaming weeks anyway.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
So I made a spreadsheet because I need to know which Pokemon I need technically for what they call a living dex.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
Which means you actually, and I'm using quote marks here, physically have that Pokemon in your bank or your boxes.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
And then on that same spreadsheet, I'm marking off which ones I have shinies for also.

19:35.000 --> 19:44.000
So I've got some functions because I'm using Google Docs and keeping track of everything that way.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
And I've got color coding and it's super awesome. And I don't know why we're talking about it now.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Fine. We'll talk about the shiny collecting and all that later when we get to gaming weeks.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
But in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com, Slidekick says,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Shane and I should do a Pokecast. Hmm.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
There is talk in my head already about something like that.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
What do you guys think? Do you think Shane should have his own show about Pokemon?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Even though he already has one about Power Rangers?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
That sometimes turns into Pokemon.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Because me and Spike both love Pokemon.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
You should do the ultimate crossover of PokeRangers.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
Our topic for this week's episode has to do with Pokemon and Power Rangers together.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
So it kind of works out that way.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
One of these days, I swear, we all need to end up in the same room.

20:32.000 --> 20:43.000
All of us folks at VoG and we're going to do that super show that's like the orange PokeRanger blackwolf buoy.org sistahood show or something.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
It'll be a lot of fun.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
Anyway, also in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com, some folks wanting a copy of this spreadsheet that you're putting together.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Misty says, dude, Shane, can I have a copy?

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah, I can. I can send it over. Rob can collect all of the like emails and I can just...

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
Did you think that maybe this tool, this spreadsheet already existed out there before you actually...

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
Well, it probably does. I mean, it's pretty simple. Just make a spreadsheet.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
It's not fancy. I mean, besides the random functions I have on there and it's like two of them.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
TarZXF. I know that guy. I can't believe he's listening tonight. How you doing?

21:22.000 --> 21:30.000
TarZXF has known me a very, very long time, you guys. He's known me probably longer than anybody else.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
It says in chat, can the show be named Pokey Whatever?

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
No, because when it's something I care about, I'm super excited to talk about it.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
Alright, let's get into the types of video games that we've been playing this week because I know Shane wants to talk more about shiny collecting.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
But I'm going to make them wait. As we do, how is your gaming week starting with Dark Soccer? What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

21:56.000 --> 22:04.000
I finally picked up Stardew Valley. Haven't played it yet. I also just picked up Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Such a good game.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I watched Rob finish it.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
That game's great.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I also...

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Did you already have the ending spoiled? Oh no.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah, it's fine.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Go to the rapture.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Stop it.

22:17.000 --> 22:27.000
I also picked up... I think it's Forbidden Planet that looks a lot like a Sonic clone. So it already is really pretty.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen that one.

22:29.000 --> 22:41.000
So as for stuff I've actually played, I broke out Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer again so that I could design a house for...

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
Who did I do? Oh, I did one for Catan and his entire freaking family.

22:49.000 --> 22:57.000
And then I did... What else did I play? I'm actually way behind on Danganronpa 2.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh my gosh.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I know I need to play some more but I couldn't.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I want to talk about themes.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Well, I already have had a lot spoiled for me so it's okay.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
I've been playing World of Warcraft. I hit 100. That's about it.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
Jamie's really trying to tempt me to roll on World of Warcraft again just so y'all know.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
I need someone to play with. Remember all the adventures?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
But now I have Shower with your dad to play.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
But remember all of the adventures?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
It was fun. It was good.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
And Sakurina's a decent enough level. She could play with sassy pants.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm playing for two MMOs though.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
But like I mentioned before the show, it's inevitable I'm going to pony up for that expansion anyway.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
So it's going to happen. It's just a matter of when.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Let's see. Going to chat. I'm sorry. I love this comment too much.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Back to the Pokemon podcast and what Shane would call it if he hosts it.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
ActDeafTryingToOneUp, Tarzxf's name says,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
It can be called Poke-meh.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
Again, if it's something I care about, I actually am excited to talk about it.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Okay, but you're smiling because you know that name is good.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
No. No it is not. Because that would not be how the podcast would go.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
Because it would be super fun. Because all I do is talk about Pokemon with other people who just want to talk about Pokemon.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
You guys don't even know. Like, real life is like this.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
You guys might think Shane is putting on a face for this show, but no.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Real life is like this. Like I might call Shane to be like,

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
Oh Shane, we should meet up for lunch today and go to this place or whatever.

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
He's like, okay, but did you play Pokemon? Because I was playing Pokemon for four hours last night and I caught this new shiny.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
And do you want a new shiny? Because I have like five copies of this shiny because the one I want is not showing up.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
And all of a sudden it's like, what happened to lunch plans?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Well, we would have talked right through it.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
And then we meet up for lunch. Oh, while I was driving over here I caught another shiny.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
What are you doing playing your DS while driving? I need a shiny.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah, that is basically how it goes.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Logie, how was your gaming week?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
This week I mainly played South Park, The Sick of Truth.

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
Because I got that as part of the digital pre-order for South Park, The Fractured But Whole.

25:12.000 --> 25:19.000
So, that game is so awesome. Like, I never really played through much of it when I had it on Xbox.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
But I'm pretty much at the end of the game now, I think.

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
I was playing as a Jew character, which really, to be honest, they're all the same except for the different abilities that you get, the special abilities.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
But, I mean, it's basically all the same. They need the characters you roll.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
And so, yeah, I like all the twists in there. Like, kind of some of the spoilers in there.

25:40.000 --> 25:49.000
There's a scene in there where you're fighting the underpants gnomes, while shrinking down, under your parents having sex above you.

25:49.000 --> 25:58.000
And so you see your mom's floppy titties bouncing around, and you have to do a quick time event dodge of your dad's testicles.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
And there's a portion of the game where you have to give Randy Marsh an abortion.

26:04.000 --> 26:12.000
And the music that they have, they have that, it's Christmas time, you know that song.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
The game is so fucking hilarious. It's just such a great game.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
If you have a mind that is hellbound.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
No, seriously, if you like software, and if you want to get it now, I mean, if you want to pre-order the new game, you get it for free as a pre-order, and you can download it immediately.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
So that's what I did for the PlayStation 4, because I know I want to play the new game when it comes out.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
And that's a digital only thing, right?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
That's digital only, yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
And see, that is a clever way to get people to buy it digitally.

26:40.000 --> 26:50.000
To be honest, it's weird. I was so against digital only stuff, and most of the things now I buy from my PlayStation 4 are digital.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
I hardly, the last game I bought physical was Fallout.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
And that was just because, I don't remember why it was, it was because of something.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Because I didn't want to wait for it to download or something like that.

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
And so I actually went and bought it physical, but everything else has been just digital content.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
So, I don't know. I'm on board with that.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
What else was I going to say?

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah, if you want to pick it up now, because I also picked it up on Steam, because it's eight bucks right now.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
So I can go, you know, my wife watches TV a lot, and so I can play through it again.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
Because it is a game, it's not very long, but it's something you'd want to play it through multiple times.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Even though I have pretty much done most of the side quest stuff, it's still that good.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
It's worth playing multiple times.

27:35.000 --> 27:44.000
And then, what else? I think I played a little bit more of the Trials of Blood Dragon.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
It's okay. It's not as like, you know, with the concept of like it's Trials and Blood Dragon,

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
but the other, that should be like the most amazing game ever, but it's just kind of okay.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Which is kind of a let down. You expect a lot more from that combination.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
The other thing too is, I noticed that Goat Simulator has all its DLC now,

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
and I tried to purchase the DLC because I want to play more Goat Simulator,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
and it fucking crashes. Like, it'll just lock up trying to download content,

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
because you can only purchase it through the app on the PlayStation Store.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
Like, I can't find the actual DLC, the purchase separately on the PlayStation Store.

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
So that's poorly set up, but yeah, I've been buying stuff in the Steam sale, and I don't know.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
Not too much though. I bought South Park The Sacred Truth, Golf With Your Friends,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
because that looked kind of cool, and I like mini golf games.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
And then I saw this, someone had posted information about the Learn Japanese To Survive hiragana battle.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
It's a RPG maker game.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
I put that on my wish list. I saw that come up in my queue, and I thought that sounded really interesting.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
It's like two bucks or something, so.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
And I was like, I think I probably really need that for this show.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah, I mean, I think it looks pretty cool. I want to...

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm looking for it right now.

28:54.000 --> 29:01.000
I had learned hiragana at one time. I'd like a refresher, because it's been a while since I've been in high school, so.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
But I've been kind of just trying to avoid buying a lot of things,

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
because I have a lot of games, even now my PlayStation 4 library is starting to look like my Steam library.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Stoppy in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I heard about that, it's on my wish list too.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I wonder if they...

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
It seems like some games seem to always show up in people's queues,

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
especially during the Steam sale when people are really encouraged to go through those queues if they want trading cards, so.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Yeah, I went through the queues, and unfortunately it's like all these games I'm like,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
that's not going to run on my computer.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
Like, Grand Theft Auto is marked down as well. It's like, you know, 35 bucks on Steam.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
And I'm like, I want it, but I can't run it very well, so I'm going to hold off still.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
It'll be cheap later on as well.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, it's $2.79, so you might as well pick it up.

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
And honestly, even if you're not into the trading cards at all, just go through your queue anyway, and sell them for like 6 cents every day,

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
and then by the end of the sale, you'll have probably 2 bucks to go buy one of these cheapy games if you want.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
You can shower with your dad for free, thanks to trading cards. That's what you want to do.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
Apparently Julian is listening right now for any more Pokémon anything.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
I will talk more Pokémon all the time.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
When it's his turn.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
When it's your turn.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
We're going to teach Julian a life lesson about waiting your turn, and so Shane's going to wait his turn.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Anything else, Loki, for your game?

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
That's it. I've been trying to work on my game. I kind of worked a little bit.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
I typed some more stuff in my design doc, which is a mess.

30:39.000 --> 30:46.000
And then, I want to play more Final Fantasy XI, so I'll probably go back and do some of that this week.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Slidekick in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Loki can buy things from my PlayStation 4 library if he's running out of disc space.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
No, I'm not running out of disc space at all, because I'm just buying games.

30:58.000 --> 31:05.000
Like, I bought, I want to say Dragon Age Inquisition, because it was down to like 5, 10 dollars.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
It's amazing.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
And I bought Need for Speed, the newest one.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
And I was like, okay, I like those games. I'm probably not going to get around to playing them anytime soon.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So, I have a lot of that stuff.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I almost bought Mad Max. I'm like, ooh, Mad Max.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I'm like, no, I can't buy this. I'm not going to play this.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Speaking of having like way more space than you know what to do with it,

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
did I tell you guys I bought a 3 terabyte drive for my main PC, because I was starting to run out of room on one of my drives.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
And I was like, I don't want to keep uninstalling Steam games, so I'm going to just buy a 3 terabyte drive.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Which even, that isn't even as big as they make them.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
That was like as big as I could get it without it, while it's still kind of like a reasonable price.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I'm just giving you the knowing look.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Because I just did this, what, a month ago?

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
Put in another terabyte drive, just to accommodate my games.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
Yeah, no, I nickel into, no, I'm just getting a 3 terabyte drive, and I don't have to worry about this again until like the year 2024.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
Oh, I've got a 3 terabyte drive hooked up to my computer with all that.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah, so trust me, I feel you on the space thing. It eats up the room.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Let's have another old person moment for a moment.

32:12.000 --> 32:23.000
Remember back, my first PC that I had in junior high school, which I used to connect to Prodigy, which was like my first experience on the internet.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
We used to call it Buttigy.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
What's a Prodigy?

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Oh my god, no, you're not going to play this whole I'm too young to remember this stuff.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
No, I seriously don't know what that is.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Okay, Prodigy, do you remember America Online?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Well, yeah, because it had all the disks.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
Okay, Prodigy was kind of like that, but I think Prodigy was a Sears venture or something.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
But one of the things that made it very unique is it has a very graphical interface to it.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
And that's kind of what made it very...

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
So did AOL.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Well, Prodigy to me felt like a little bit like what the web was before there was the web.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
Because Prodigy had like livestock information, if that's what you wanted.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
It had news updates, it had forums that you could go.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
But I used to get game tips for Nintendo games on Prodigy. I shit you not.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
So that was... I know there's people in...

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Like if anybody else, Bobby Black Wolf is going to know what I'm talking about.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Because he's 29 like me.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
And Bobby, yep, thank you.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Bobby actually says Prodigy predated AOL.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It started in 1988.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
My family was a founding member and it gives us Prodigy code.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And yes, I remember mine as well.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And I actually got the B account in my house.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
Because my mom was like, what's a Prodigy?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
What's a... It sounds like Buttigy.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I just remember that we got charged a lot of money.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
Because we submitted a joke on their joke forums.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
And it was stupid.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It was like... Because we were like...

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
You know, kids, we were like 7 years old and stuff.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
We were just like, yeah, we're going to submit a joke.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
It'll be so stupid.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
And like I think it caused money or like we were on a...

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It ended up calling like a long distance line.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And so like, it's like, why did we get this?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Why is our phone bill like $60?

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
You know, it's like something ridiculous.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
I got in so much trouble when the internet web came out.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And then I was on it like...

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
No, it was the chat rooms on Prodigy.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Oh my God.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Oh my God, I had so much trouble.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I ran out of such a bill on the chat rooms on Prodigy.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
One month.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
I think almost all kids our age who are somewhat nerdy and tech-inclined

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
has a story about getting in trouble.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
I remember the first BBS that actually had like a link to the internet.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
So you would log into the BBS and you'd be able to launch a browser

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and it would just be the internet.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
I was like, sweet, I don't even need AOL for this.

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
I remember begging and pleading my mother to call a long distance number

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
in the Bay Area so I could connect to the official Sierra BBS

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
so I could download demos of upcoming Sierra games,

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
which would take a good 10 minutes, 15 minutes over the modem.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
So it was like you're getting charged for a 15-minute phone call.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
But I had an account on the official Sierra BBS and those were the days.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Man, we're dating ourselves so horribly right now.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
But the one thing I wanted to say about AOL,

35:12.000 --> 35:21.000
I thought Quantum Link on Commodore 64 was AOL.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
I thought either AOL bought them or Quantum Link turned into AOL.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
So I always thought Quantum Link was like the first.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
But anyway.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
I don't know how AOL existed because they would send off those 38 trials

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
like every few weeks or every week,

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
and they didn't limit you to how many times you could use those.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
So I don't know.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Bobby doesn't say this very often in chat.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
He says, you were right.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Steve Case just took down Quantum Link because AOL was doing so well.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
The only one to focus on PC.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Anyway, the whole reason I went down this rabbit hole on this,

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
like, 10-minute tangent is because the hard drive on my original PC

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
that I ran Prodigy on, 40 megabytes.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
40 megabytes.

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
When I moved out here, and this was in 98, 99, something like that,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Dan had a 20-gigabyte hard drive.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
I was going to say I had one that was an IBM AT, I think it was 20.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Pentium 2.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
It was slow.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
I don't know, 286 something that had like a 20-megabyte hard drive

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
that I had SimCity on floppy disks for.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
An episode of this show, depending on how long it runs,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
is about 90 megabytes.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
So like an episode of this show wouldn't even fit on my first computer.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
Back when OLR first started, you guys may not, because we, you know,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
the podcast thing was a newer technology that didn't come out until later.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
We were a live internet show before podcasting was around.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
And in the beginning of OLR, we were, I'm using my quotey fingers,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
dial-up-friendly radio.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
So the quality of the stream was honestly kind of shit,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
but you could listen to it on a dial-up connection.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
And that was kind of the cool thing about it.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
And, you know, for a mostly talk-oriented program,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
it didn't matter that the quality was kind of garbage.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
But it's interesting how far we've come, even in these 14 years.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
I'm laughing because Loki just yawned and his tongue is blue from that Slurpee.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
That Slurpee was awesome.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And yes, it will dye your tongue any color.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Sorry.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
It could be worse.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I could have had the Coke Slurpee and then my tongue would be brown.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
All right.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Let me talk about My Gaming Week, because I know Shane's dying to talk about Pokemon.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
So My Gaming Week.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
That is not what I'm going to start with, though.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Spoilers.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Well, honestly, in My Gaming Week, I haven't been playing a lot of new stuff.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I've been continuing on Path of Exile, which I've still been having fun with.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Even further than I have on any of my other characters,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
because I actually got all the way to Act 2.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
So that's something.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
So, yeah, that's been something I've been enjoying.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I actually did a couple live streams this week.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I've been bringing back my channel.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So please consider subscribing to me on Twitch.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
I'd super appreciate it.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Rob Roberts, all one word, is my name on Twitch.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
And I did a couple streams this week.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
I did one with Overwatch, which was fun because the last match...

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Were you watching that stream, Shane?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
I don't remember.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
The last match...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah, you were doing bad.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah, I was doing really bad. Thank you.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
I was doing really bad, which it's Overwatch, so of course I was doing bad.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
But the very last match spontaneously became everybody picked Torbjorn.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Because it was me, Alan, and Dominic all playing.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And I think I started picking Symmetra.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
And then Dominic was Torbjorn.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
Some of the other people we were partied with started picking Torbjorn.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
And so Dominic was like, everybody picked Torbjorn.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
So we all did.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
And so it was like, five of us is Torbjorn versus the other team.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And we beat them.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And they were like high level players too.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Got another shiny right now, just had to interrupt.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Shut up!

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Oh my god, it's another female one.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I'm going to break my system.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
We need to...

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
I think we need to go in, because that was one of the things as I was downloading the update.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And I haven't gotten the chance to check it out yet, but that...

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
The battle maps that they have now for Minecraft would be kind of fun for a game night.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Oh yeah, that would be fun.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
Because those are always fun to watch on streamers, like the mods that they have for Hunger Games type stuff.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
But now it being official would be kind of cool.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I just wish it was...

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
The cross platform stuff is still not quite there yet.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
With Xbox you can do it with PC and stuff, but you can't really do that yet.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
I think a stream like that would only be fun if it was a bunch of people that had no idea what they were doing in Minecraft.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
So it would have to be like me, Shane, Jamie, Bobby maybe.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I know how to do it.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
It's not necessarily like we're going to be that great at it.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
Alright, let's see.

39:43.000 --> 39:51.000
And then I played Pac-Man 256 on the stream this week as well, just because that game came out on Steam as well as the consoles.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
And I liked the mobile version, so I was curious if it was going to be worth the $5.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
And I would say yeah, it's worth the $5 if you enjoy Pac-Man clones.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
But it's only worth about $5, because it is kind of like the tablet game kind of just ported to Steam.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
But they did do some extra things with it, like you have the multiplayer mode.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
And because you paid the $5, they take all the microtransactions out.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
So there's no waiting for things, there's no energy bars, you get all the skins.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
So you kind of get a better value on Steam than you do on mobile.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So I would say this.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
Check out the mobile version just to try the game and see if it's something that's up your alley.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
And if you like it, just get it on Steam or PS4 or whatever.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Dan said he played it for four hours.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Pac-Man 256? Really? Wow.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
Isn't it just like, was it Crossy Roads or something like that?

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
It's very, yeah, it's the same company.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
So there's even a Crossy Road skin in it.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
So yeah, it's very, very, very similar.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But it's fun! That's what's important.

40:46.000 --> 40:52.000
And then between that and Final Fantasy XIV and some console things here and there,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I even played a little bit of Pokemon to appease Shane.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
Between all that, that was pretty much my gaming week.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
All right, well, let's move on with the show. Let's get into news tonight.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
No, all right. All right, Shane, how was your gaming week?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Okay, so we're going to start with non-Pokemon things.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
All right.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
First of all, Rhythm Heaven, whatever it's called on 3DS, got that.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And kind of disappointed.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
I've played several of the, like, worlds.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
The games are really, really short for a Rhythm Heaven game.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
And I don't see any megamixes.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And those were my favorite parts.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
So I'm kind of bummed.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I mean, it is kind of like a greatest hits collection.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
So there's a lot of cool games.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And you can unlock more from the other ones.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
But just kind of overall disappointed with it.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
So that's sad.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
Secondly, I was really amped to play the Resident Evil demo.

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
But a few weeks ago, I lost my PS4 controller and I still can't find it.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
So I can't play my PS4.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
It's making me sad also.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Now let's talk about Pokemon.

41:54.000 --> 42:03.000
So I was up until, like, 8 or 9 this morning trading friend codes to get new Pokemon in X.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
They have a friend safari thing.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
That's really fun.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
This is really the only game I play.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
There's nothing else that holds my interest.

42:10.000 --> 42:19.000
Between my two English copies, I have over, I think, 450 hours on them now.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And then I also have my Japanese copies that I'm slowly working through.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And I just cannot stop playing these.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I'm just hunting shinies.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm basically just hunting shinies at this point.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
It's so much fun.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Why are you hunting shinies?

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Because they're different looking.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
And they're cool because of that.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And some of them might be an ugly color.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
And then if you get a shiny one, it can be blue, depending on what it is.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So it's just, it's fun.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
I like it.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Can we take a quick aside to talk about Pokemon Go?

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Because some news this week is that they are actually ending the, it's not on our show,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
we're also not ruining anything.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
But they're actually ending the test cycle for Pokemon Go.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
It's going to end June 30th.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
So sadly, if you're not in the test, you're not getting in.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I hate to say it.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
But yeah, because June 30th, everybody's getting kicked out.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And they're resetting the game.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
So the good news is, if you're frustrated that you never got in,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
you know, they are resetting everybody.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
So nobody's going to have a jump on you when the actual game launches.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Which I was convinced after that E3 thing, I said,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
no, there's no way they're launching in July.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
No way.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
This game's not ready.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
But now to hear they're pulling the plug on June 30th,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I guess they are going to launch in July.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I'm kind of surprised at that.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
Yeah, considering the state of that game, they're not fucking ready yet.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
Now, to be fair, Ingress was rough when it first launched, too.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
And it's come a long way.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
Yeah, but you would think you would learn something between, you know,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
programming for Ingress versus this.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
It's like you just kind of, I mean, like, here's the thing.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Like, I get it, it's going to be rough around the edges,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
but we don't even know what the game is yet.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
There's no real game there.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Maybe they didn't want to spoil that.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm willing to cut them some slack that maybe not everything was in the game

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
because they didn't want people to start theory crafting

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
and doing all this crap until everybody could have at it.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
So I'm willing to take a chance that there probably is more of an element

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
there that will not be revealed until the game is actually out

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
because Pokémon fans be crazy.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Look at that one on the couch.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
And they would theory craft the shit out of this

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
and figure out all the mid-max if Niantic showed all their cards

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
to the Pokémon Go.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
So I have a really good feeling, I hope I'm right,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
that Niantic did hold some stuff back from the test.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm also kind of curious to see how the microtransactions work

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
because it was nice getting free money every day,

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
the play around with those, but without that...

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
Well, I think the answer is you get, I don't know if you noticed,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
but when you collect your defender bonus every day,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
which is how many gyms you're on,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
you actually get a small amount of that currency.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
So I think you have your answer.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
Either you're going to buy it or you have to get it through the gym defense.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't think that'll change.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Let's be real, you guys.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Pokémon is a AAA franchise.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Shane would try to give it a rating higher than AAA if one existed,

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
but it's just like they're going to charge a premium for this game.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Even though it will be free,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
they're going to make a lot of money off Pokémon.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
They're going to make...

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
They're going to get a lot of $35 purchases just for the little...

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Oh yeah, I already have one.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I'm not as crazy as he is, but I was like,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I want one of those, that looks rad.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
I don't know, we'll have to see how much I actually play that game,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
whether I want to drop money for that.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
The only advantage I see to that is it makes it playing in the car a lot easier

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
because I don't have to look at my phone.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I just feel it vibrate, hit the button.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
I can drive and do that.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Or if you don't even want to look at your phone at all,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
you'll just be able to just look at your wrist or wherever you have it.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Now, Akdeft is talking in chat about stupid Pokémon Go

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
not supporting Intel Atom CPUs.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I had not heard about this.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Yeah, it was in the requirements, I guess,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
that it's only supporting ARM processors.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
So if you have that nice Intel Atom-based...

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
Was it the Asus phone or whatever? The Zen phone?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Sorry.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I did not hear about that. That sucks.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I was surprised, though, because they support it for Ingress,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
so I don't know what the requirement is.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Unless they're... I don't know, the only thing I could think of...

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Pokémon's way more graphic-intensive than Ingress, though.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Well, maybe the only other thing I could think of is maybe, like,

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
the Stop Spoofers, because people use PCs and emulators,

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
and if it's not an ARM-based... But you can change... I don't know.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Somebody will figure out a way to cheat at it.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That's just gonna suck.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
There's no speed lock in that. It's just their fucking GPS is delayed as shit,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
so you can't really... It's hard to gauge where you're at,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
because your GPS is trailing behind where you actually are.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
But there's no speed lock in there. I mean, I used to...

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
You know, spun those Pokéstops as I'm driving by them, so...

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
I don't know.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
All right. So, Shane, actually, I went on that tangent,

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
because I kind of wanted to ask you, as a hardcore Pokémon fan,

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
where's your head at with Pokémon GO?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Is that something you're gonna get really into, or...

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
Well, see, if I get really into it, I would like to capture the Pokémon.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
I mean, that's what my favorite thing to do in these games are.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
I don't really do, like, the competitive battling or anything,

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
or, like, you know, raising to make competitive battling Pokémon.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
I just want to collect the cool ones, and collect them all,

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
so I will very happily do that in Pokémon GO.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
Unless it gets to be annoying, I won't play a game that's annoying.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
And I have a really high patience threshold, too,

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
so we'll see what they can do for me in that game.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
But I think I'll enjoy it.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
If it's something you like.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
You have a very low patience threshold for a lot of things, though.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, if I don't like it.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
But for Pokémon, you're gonna cut it a lot of slack, I'm sure.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Yeah, or if the outcome's worth it, yeah.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
Like, playing in this friend safari until I get a male shiny Pawnyard.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
That's what I'm gonna do.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
And I'm just gonna have to keep going at it.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
TigerClawnChat says,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
Can the Pokémon you find in Pokémon GO be transferred to the new Pokémon games?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
No.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
They talked about it at E3,

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
that there's going to be some functionality coming down the line between GO and Sun and Moon.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
And that is absolutely not it, I guarantee it.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
I would bet a large sum of money.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
No, I know it's probably not it, but we don't know, so we can't really say it's not it.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
I'm confident it's not, because the stats for the Pokémon on the phone are way different than that in the game.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
It's way easier to catch them, I think, on the phone version.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It's not gonna work that way, I guarantee it.

48:31.000 --> 48:37.000
Well, also, I mean, there's that, but it's probably easy enough to convert it somehow.

48:37.000 --> 48:44.000
But Pokémon GO is just Generation 1, and they just released, not that long ago, Red and Blue,

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
and I think Yellow? I don't know, I don't care about those games, on the 3DS Virtual Console.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
And you're gonna be able to take those Pokémon into Sun and Moon as well.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Yeah, but that's different, because those are still the same type of game.

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
Yeah, but it's not, like, stats and different things have changed since then.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
So, like, your... who's a good example? I don't know.

49:08.000 --> 49:17.000
So, Magnemite is... I don't know what he is in Red and Blue and Yellow, but, you know, he's...

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
Oh, I think he's just Electric in that, but then Steel got introduced in the next generation.

49:21.000 --> 49:28.000
Well, if you take a Magnemite into Sun and Moon, he's coming from an Electric only.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
He'll be Steel and Electric in there, so I don't see why they couldn't just do some sort of conversion.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
Yeah, I don't know. I think it's gonna be something less interesting, like,

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
you earn some sort of currency or some sort of, like, bonus items or something like that.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, I think that's what... you'll get extra currency or random...

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
Maybe a random Pokémon will unlock, but it's not gonna be the same Pokémon, if that makes sense.

49:51.000 --> 49:57.000
Oh my gosh, and speaking of Sun and Moon, I constantly watch the presentation from E3 over and over.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Like, I can't stop because it's the only footage I have of the game and it's so beautiful.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
When do you get more?

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
July 1st, we'll get some new information, so next Friday. This coming Friday.

50:06.000 --> 50:13.000
That's awesome. Also, Chad is making us realize that we didn't really explain what a Shiny was.

50:13.000 --> 50:21.000
Okay, so a Shiny, nowadays, all it means is it's a Pokémon that you get that is different colored.

50:21.000 --> 50:28.000
They are also very rare to get. There are ways to make it easier, but it still takes a lot of dedication to get one.

50:28.000 --> 50:36.000
For example, I wanted a Shiny Oshawott. Oshawott is a starter, so the only way to get a Shiny from it

50:36.000 --> 50:43.000
is either in a game where you get it as a starter, you keep soft-resetting your system until you get one,

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
which can take thousands of tries, or you hatch an egg.

50:47.000 --> 50:57.000
And so, I thought I wouldn't have the patience to soft-reset, and Oshawott's from a game that started about five years ago, Black and White.

50:57.000 --> 51:05.000
And ever since that game came out, I wanted a Shiny, so I've been trying to hatch a Shiny Oshawott since 2011.

51:05.000 --> 51:12.000
On my birthday this year, I finally got an Oshawott that was Shiny. That is, like, several thousand eggs later.

51:12.000 --> 51:19.000
It is fairly ridiculous. But then there's other things, like, when I was adding people on this Friend Safari,

51:19.000 --> 51:27.000
you have a pretty good chance in Friend Safari to get Shinies. I was trying to fill out which Pokémon were in this Safari,

51:27.000 --> 51:34.000
and on my third run through the grass, I got a Shiny that way. It was one I didn't care about, but I technically care about all of them.

51:35.000 --> 51:46.000
So, it's just a different color Pokémon. They used to have, I don't remember if it was better stats, or if they, like, for the competitive side,

51:46.000 --> 51:55.000
if they gained their, like, stats quicker, but that got, like, done away with in one of the earlier generations,

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
and now it's just cosmetic, and kind of like, almost like a trophy, I would say.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
Do all Pokémon have a Shiny, even the Legendaries?

52:03.000 --> 52:09.000
Yes, all Pokémon have Shinies. That does not mean you can get Shinies for all of them. Some are called Shiny Locked,

52:09.000 --> 52:19.000
so you aren't able to get Shinies of those specific Pokémon. It's mostly the Event Legendaries that you can't get,

52:19.000 --> 52:27.000
some of those you can't get Shinies of, but that's, like, you know, 12 out of 721.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Gotcha. All right.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
And I love them. They sparkle when they show up on the field. It's really cool.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
All right, anything else you want to say about Pokémon?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I could just keep talking about it. We can just not do it.

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
Well, then we'd better move on. We're gonna get into the week's news, although actdeft is sad in chat, saying,

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
I've never, ever caught a Shiny Pokémon.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Okay, so...

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
Shane, you have, like, 20 extra Shinies you don't need. Give them out. Give them away.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
I don't know. I have to look at my spreadsheet. I'm up to almost 50 Shinies now that aren't duplicates,

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
but I could give you one, actdeft, if you want. I can give you a Sneasel.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
But just keep at it. If you care about it, you'll run into one.

53:09.000 --> 53:16.000
Make sure you have the National Pokédex filled out so you get the Shiny Charm to make it easier.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
And once you get one, it'll, like, put that taste in your mouth, and that's all you'll want to do in the game.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
And just have patience. And do the Friend Safari, because you don't even need the Shiny Charm for that.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
It's like a 1 in 500 or 800 chance you'll run into one.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
Hmm. All right. Shiny hunting tips from Shane.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
All right. We need to get into some gaming news, though, because we're running a little long here.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
Was my Shiny announcement that I found two since we've started today on the show, not news?

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
It's just sad. That's all. Let's see. We do have some comments from chat.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
actdeft says, I don't think I have the patience.

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
s200mat says, I think Shane's show should be the Shiny Hoarders podcast.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
Ziba says, I've only caught two Shiny Pokémon ever.

54:03.000 --> 54:10.000
And Sterlok says, the only Shiny I ever found was a Centret at the beginning of Silver before you have access to Pokéballs.

54:10.000 --> 54:16.000
Oh, that sucks. That really sucks. I was going to say, Centret's really cute Shiny, but not if you can't catch it.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
And then Bobby Blackwolf says, I think I've only caught two Pokémon ever.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
Well, you should get to fixing that. And if you haven't caught any Shinies ever, just don't worry.

54:27.000 --> 54:36.000
I've been playing since Red and Blue, and my first Shiny I didn't get until when I had Black when it came out.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
So that's Generation 5. So just have patience. You'll get it.

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
Alright. Let's see. We're going to get into some news, but just quickly, some housekeeping.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
Be sure to follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
We're also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
As far as I know, we don't have any plans to take shows off in the foreseeable future.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
But we will be gone Labor Day weekend. That's still a long ways out.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
But that is, of course, Dragon Con 2016, which I'm already making my arrangements to be there in Atlanta.

55:08.000 --> 55:14.000
Oh, I also found out this week, I will be at, this isn't until October, but I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest,

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
which is the Final Fantasy XIV convention, kind of like their version.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Oh, sad I'm not going.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
BlizzCon. Yeah, Shane's not going. So what's up with that?

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
Well, I've got Power Morphicon this year. And then literally two days after Power Morphicon,

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Pokémon World Championships in San Francisco. I'm going to that too.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
Of course you are. Of course you are.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
So there is really no time for...

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
You're going to go help us get some video for VOG? Come on, be a correspondent.

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
How am I going to do that when all I'm going to do is like jump in the pile of plush Pokémon toys at the...

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Can you get a video of that?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I can get a video of me being escorted out.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Is that like the ball pit, but it's just like a Pokémon pit?

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
I would love that so much. I would hug them all.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
Is, what's the convention that everybody made fun of? The TumblrCon?

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Oh, yeah, within the ball pit.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
DashCon, that's it.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Is there going to be like a DashCon where instead of the ball pit, you have a Pokémon pit?

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Or it could be Pokéball pit.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Pick another flavor, by the way.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
What's that?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Pick another flavor.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Oh, of cupcake?

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Yeah.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I want to do the peanut butter one next, I think.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Okay.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Oh my God, I'm getting so full though. This is seriously the last cupcake for now.

56:19.000 --> 56:26.000
All right, we got to get into some news for tonight. Starting off with Loki.

56:26.000 --> 56:43.000
All right, so Sony has lost the, I guess it's been a pretty long battle for the class action lawsuits against the firmware update that took out the PlayStation 3 Linux that was on the original launch system for the PlayStation 3.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
You may remember that was update 3.21, 3.21, easy to remember, in 2010.

56:50.000 --> 57:03.000
And there was a lawsuit kind of in place saying that people did buy that system for the Linux and because of that, you know, they felt like they lost out on some functionality and, you know, kind of felt cheated.

57:03.000 --> 57:12.000
So, people that were impacted by that, there's a couple ways you can get compensated for your sorrows.

57:12.000 --> 57:30.000
One is if you feel that you were impacted, you know, and you use Linux and you can prove that you have, you know, used the Linux on there or that you used it, you can actually get $55, but it is going to be a little bit tricky to prove that.

57:30.000 --> 57:39.000
Especially like, you know, if you didn't take any screenshots while you had it, I don't know how you'd be able to do that now since, you know, if you patched your system.

57:39.000 --> 57:45.000
And then, of course, $9, which will be going to everyone else that owned a PlayStation 3.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
So, if you can't prove that you used it, but if you felt like it was, you know, I'm kind of...

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
But you have to sign like an affidavit that says, I feel cheated by Sony. I am wronged.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Yeah, I'm willing to do that for $9.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
Yeah, me too.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
How much are you willing to sell your integrity for? $9? Alright, cool.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
Oh, I don't know. I've already been the recipient of three class action lawsuits.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
Oh, that's right. That's right. What did you have to say to get like three cans of Red Bull?

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
I got two cases of Red Bull and I just had to fill that out for myself and for my wife.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
They eventually came and I drank them in like about a day, so...

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It's worth it.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
Stope and Chat with a good point saying, getting the affidavit notarized is probably going to cost $9.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
Do you have to give them a notarized affidavit?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I don't know. If I do, that's not worth it.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Oh, that's crappy, yeah.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
I don't care. It's just... whatever. It's there.

58:47.000 --> 58:54.000
So, yeah. You probably would have gotten an email if you're a part of this. I got an email regarding it, so...

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
I didn't. I've had a PS3 since they came out, so...

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
Yeah, I don't remember getting an email about it.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
I didn't buy it when it first came out, but I definitely remember the other OS option.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
It should be to your PlayStation Network email, so whatever you have tied to it.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
Oh, it's my... I have like a spam dump email. It's probably that one.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, so whatever you have tied to that, that's where it's going.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So, look out for it there.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Alright.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
I'm disappointed. I mean, it would be nice to have the other OS stuff to just mess with it,

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
especially now that I don't play with my PlayStation 3.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
It would be kind of cool to mess with that.

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
Yeah. It was... you know, I remember when we talked about that when it first happened,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
because this show is that old.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
And I do remember there was a lot of...

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
It seemed like... wasn't there like NASA or like scientists were actually using that feature

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
because the PlayStation 3 for the cost was more of a supercomputer than like the computers at the time?

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Yeah, like the military was using it.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Yeah.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
In like clusters.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
And so they were really... I mean, they obviously don't connect those computers to the internet anyway.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
Yeah, exactly. They wouldn't be updating it, so it wouldn't matter to them.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
But like still though, it's functionality that you advertise it as...

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And the whole reason, it's kind of... it's typical Sony, to be honest,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
because it's just like when the PlayStation 3 came out,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
rumble, that's so last generation.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And that's because they didn't want to pay for the licensing for the rumble feature,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and then eventually changed their mind on that.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And the Linux being on there, so they could advertise it as a computer system

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and not as a game system because it gave them some sort of tax break or something.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So both of the things they've kind of flopped on are just because of, you know,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
them trying to get around certain... paying certain things.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Well, didn't quite work out for you, now did it?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Yeah, you know, Sony made a lot of real...

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
They kind of bungled a lot around the PlayStation 3 launch, you know,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
but they've come a long way, obviously.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Obviously, Sony's come a long way.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Now, you know, when it comes to E3,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
they're the ones that are kind of laughing at everybody else with their presentation.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
You know, maybe not as much this year as the year before,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
but, you know, they still did a pretty darn good job this year.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
But when it first launched, it was just kind of like one disaster after another.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So it's like when they removed the other OS thing,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
it's kind of like they almost didn't think about it.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And you kind of wonder if there was like an arrogance about,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
oh, people aren't going to be able to pirate.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's that whole classic, this is unpiratable.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
This can't happen, never going to...

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And it's like you're just challenging people more to make it happen.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You are. I mean...

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Not that it makes piracy right.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm just saying, you can't be arrogant about your anti-piracy measures necessarily either.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Because really the only thing that is working is forcing your game to always be online to play it.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And as much as people hate that, it kind of works with anti-piracy mostly.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Well, mostly, even Fallen Fantasy XI, though, you're able to find a way to play that online.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And, yeah.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I don't know if it's one of the stories and maybe a last minute story or something,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.000
but they have some information about a way to get around Blue Burst.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
You can play that offline, too.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Really?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Yeah.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
For PSO?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I miss those days.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Blue Burst was pretty good.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Dark Sakura, we need to pick up PSO again. That would be fun.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I'm down.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
We should pick up PSO2, though, because that actually is pretty cool.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
PSO2 is really good and the patches are...

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I mean, I'd probably say the fan translations are about 90%, right?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Why the fuck doesn't Sega just put it out officially in the US?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Why do I have to jump through all these fucking hoops?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Because they're making us work for them.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Especially when it's already in English.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
God damn it, Sega.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Because Sonic, boom.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Okay, every time that Sonic the Hedgehog thing to it, you're like, can't we...

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Okay, somebody set up a bot on Twitter so that every time Donald Trump tweets something,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
he gets a picture of Hillary that says, delete your account.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Somebody set up a bot to do that every time.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Can I get a bot made so that every time Sonic the Hedgehog tweets something, it says, PSO2.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
PSO2.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I mean, I really shouldn't probably be encouraging that kind of behavior on Twitter, but you know what?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
But that bot was funny, though, because it would tweet nonsense to people and people would argue with it,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and it's hilarious.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Because they'd be arguing with this person that's not really a person,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and they're just repeating nonsensical things back to...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I mean...

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Alright, anyway.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Hey, it's another week.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It must be time for more Nintendo NX rumors.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And what's the latest this week?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Alright, well this is from a game blog in France that's actually called gameblog.fr.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000
A very large French gaming site saying that Nintendo NX will be on par with PlayStation Neo.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Meaning the types of specifications, the chips that are inside and all that.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
They are saying it will be unveiled in September, around the time of the Tokyo Game Show,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
but they're not saying at Tokyo Game Show.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But that is kind of in line with what most of us are thinking anyway.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That Nintendo is going to time their own event around Tokyo Game Show.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I don't buy this information at all.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Interesting.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Well, if the rumor were to stop there, I'd probably go with it,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
but then it goes on to say, the reports say there will be remasters.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Skyward Sword, Mario Kart, and Smash Brothers.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Oh my god, Skyward Sword would be so good if we don't have to stand up and play it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
There are third-party titles in the works by Square Enix and Capcom.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:35.000
It will be on par with the PlayStation Neo, in spite of Reggie Fils-Aime recently saying the NX is not about specs, but about content.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
You can be about content and still have good specs.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I don't see it being on spec with them.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I think it's going to be maybe on spec with maybe a PlayStation 4, which is fine.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I mean, if it could be on spec with that.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I don't think it might even match that, but if they're looking at doing a portable system, I don't see how that's possible.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I mean, I don't see how they're going to be able to keep the battery life there and have it run with that kind of graphics horsepower,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and it being a portable form factor, I don't see that happening.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I feel like there's going to be something that makes the resolution lower on the handheld, that it takes less power or something.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I don't know. I mean, I don't know all the ins and outs about it, but I feel like the Vita is capable of producing graphics that are on par,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
probably with a PlayStation 3, if not even a little bit more.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And you can do that on a Vita, as far as the handheld side of things goes.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Now, with the console living room base itself or whatever it is, we're just assuming it is a handheld and a console, but I don't see it.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Nintendo's got to do something with their handhelds, and that's been way too quiet.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Well, here's why we would think that.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It's because if they're, and I'm sure you're going to get into this, but a certain form factor for their games,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
why would you switch to that if you're now not trying to cut down on the size of the system?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I mean, there's no reason why you wouldn't switch away from a certain format that everybody uses to go that route. I don't understand.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Well, let me go ahead and mention that, because I think this is right along the lines of what you're thinking about right now.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So, yet again, the cartridge rumor gaining a lot of steam.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Not only did it get mentioned in some GameStop conference call, where they actually were talking about physical media,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.000
that it's going to be involved with the NX, but recently in the trademark office, the trademark was filed for Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and in the trademark documents, it actually said video game cartridge.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It should be noted that the Wii U games that get registered for trademarks don't say that, but the 3DS games do.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So, this indicates that there is going to be a cartridge for Zelda Breath of the Wild.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Now, when I say cartridge, I think a lot of people still, in their minds, think of the big gray things that went with the old school Nintendo and the Super Nintendo.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Like, even though you say cartridges do not have to be that big anymore.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Like, cartridges can be like a 3DS game, like a little card that goes in your camera. That could be a cartridge.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So, it seems like NX is probably going towards cartridge.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Like, the rumor that it's gaining a lot more steam, that that is where it's going with NX.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Although, you know digital will still be available as well. They will love to sell you games digitally.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Well, yeah, I'm sure.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
They can give you a 32GB hard drive to put them all on.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, exactly. I have two games on my Wii U, and I already have to pop in a USB drive to put in Smash, which is stupid.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
It's sad. My 3DS has 64GB in it, which is double what my Wii U has.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
It's my portable system.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Here's the thing about the NX and the cost and all that, is that Nintendo doesn't sell things at a loss.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So, the specs have to match the price that they're going for, and Nintendo usually tries...

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Nintendo's not going to try to sell a $400 living room system.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I would say the most they're going to try to sell a living room system for is $300.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Because what Wii U was $250, and then $300 for the one you really wanted?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I thought it was $350 for that one.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Was it?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I don't know. Like, I'm worried because they don't get it.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
A lot of things they don't seem to get until like way later. Like, they didn't get digital downloads and storage and everything.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000
That's why the system's launched with 32GB in it. It's like, oh, people don't need it. No one does that.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I mean, it's just so nonchalant, like oblivious to gaming trends or the trends of their own industry.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Which makes me wonder, like, that's why I don't think this thing would be up to spec to like a PlayStation Neo.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Because they wouldn't think to do that.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I still think it will be at least the PlayStation 4 level, though.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I think it'll be beyond PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but I don't know if it'll be as far along as these second generations, mid-generation upgrades or whatever we're calling it.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I was going to say, kind of along the lines of the PlayStation Neo, too, since I don't see what we're going to be talking about later.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But they, I guess, Digital Foundry or whatever, they looked at some of the specs or whatever for the PlayStation Neo or some of the information they have from like chip manufacturers or something like that.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Basically, the card that's in that system is going to be comparable to, it's spec-wise, almost identical to the R480 that's coming out.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So they're brand new Radeon cards that are basically spec-wise. For Nvidia, it's almost like a GTX 980.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So the thing with that, though, and one of the reasons they're saying that, that might be one of the reasons that that card is so cheap coming out.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Because Sony has purchased so many of those chips, it's allowed them to offset the cost of the actual card to bring down the cost to consumers.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
But if that's the case, then the price of that system could be low, too.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:20.000
They could actually put that system out maybe for $399 and have a higher-end system that's basically almost on par with what's being sold right now, which would be pretty cool.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Sound Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, frog.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Alright, well, you know what? We still don't know until Nintendo finally frickin' says something official, so we'll just keep waiting!

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
They probably won't say anything until the day it comes out. They'll just drop it. Didn't they do that with Saturn or whatever?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Yeah, and it's been like every gamer's dream that that's going to happen again.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
No, I don't want it to happen. I think that's dumb.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
The Saturn also didn't...

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's not. There's no way that's going to happen, and I'll tell you why.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Because we live in the age of the internet, and the reason that won't happen anymore is because in order to do a launch like that, you have to ship consoles to stores, which means you have to communicate with stores, which means you have to do ordering and planning and blah blah blah blah blah.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And that shit leaks like fucking crazy, so there's no way that no one's going to know what's going to happen because it'll get fucking leaked out by some GameStop employee immediately.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Doesn't, like when Apple do releases, they also have their own retail chain, so they're usually able to keep a lid on it a lot easier.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I was going to say, they don't usually get it out the same day, but they can be like, you can get it three days from now.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And that can happen sometimes too. I remember Microsoft, we wouldn't know until, oh hey, they're launching a slim console, we get the setup information that day of the announcement at E3, that type of thing.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So that's possible, but then again, we were a distributor and we're kind of like second tier to their direct partners, so who knows, they probably got the information a lot sooner than we did.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So I think though, like a major system launch, you're going to know about it beforehand.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Alright, well let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Well, some long-standing, yet kind of stupid questions about Sonic the Hedgehog have been answered.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And these were answered by, hold on just a second, okay it was answered by the head of Sonic Team, Tashaki Iizuka, who answered these very stupid questions, some of them were stupid.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So we'll go ahead and start. Where does Sonic keep all of his rings? The answer, I'm not sure.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
In his butt.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000
In his butt. And now the big one though is answering why Eggman, if it's Eggman or Robotnik.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
It's clearly not his butt, because you can't put a ring in your butt.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Some people do.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It would go run his cock. It would go, he's going to have a jingling cock as he's running from-

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
He's got some sparkly bangles.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:09.000
It's like playing ring toss as a kid where you try to throw the ring around the big pole. Right, Shane?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
No, we're not talking about this.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Anyway, of course, and it's something that most of us knew anyway, Robotnik in the US and everywhere else in the world was originally called Eggman in Japan.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:36.000
So they actually, because of the sort of divide on there, what they did is he went and said, okay, fine, his name is officially Robotnik, but everyone calls him Eggman. That's his nickname.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And so Eggman is the official name from all the rest of the games out.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
The rings on his wang and the egg in his butt.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.000
So, they also were talking about Sonic wearing a scarf for Sonic Boom.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It said that it's just a way to differentiate between the different versions of Sonic.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Like, listen, Sonic Boom sucks, okay? That's all you need.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
We don't know what the fuck we're doing. Why does he have a million bandages on? I don't know.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Other question is, why is Knuckles so gullible?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Well, he was made somewhat gullible so that he would believe Eggman instead of believe Sonic.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And then, of course, get extra angry that he was tricked and want revenge.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It's like they came up with all these designs for characters and had, like, no fucking backstory at all.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So there was another one about Tails dying a lot in the classic games.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Like, he doesn't just die. He just comes back and hangs out. He doesn't die a lot.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The whole point is that Sonic wouldn't be alone during the gameplay, plus the fact that you had the two mothers.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:54.000
They refer to him as someone that your younger brother can play as Tails and do whatever he wants to.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
But not your younger sister.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
But not your younger sister, apparently.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It's more about teamwork and cooperation so that younger kids could play along with their siblings.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And then, my favorite question. Why do whales hate Sonic so much?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
That's a good question.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
The sea is that killer whale's home. That is why he chased Sonic. To keep his home.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Another one was the supersonic comparison to Goku.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And he was like, um, he's not really a fan. He's not cosplaying.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And then talking about the chaoa, they don't show up in other games because they need fresh, pure water to live in.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Like I said, dumb questions.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Listen, there's no way that supersonic is anywhere near the same as, you know, a Super Saiyan in Dragon Ball.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's not like he has to collect a certain amount of orb-like items in order to transform into this character.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
That doesn't happen at all.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Well, they don't have to collect any orbs in Dragon Ball Z.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Whatever. I don't know. It's Sonic. It doesn't make any sense.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It's built into their DNA.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It doesn't fucking make any sense. It's Sonic. It was a platformer game that they just made some characters.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Very minimal backstory. That's it. Now you're fucking asking stupid questions.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:18.000
This honestly reminded me of the kind of bullshit nonsense that they were asking during that fucking Pokemon Go thing.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Where they had two super fans of Pokemon Go.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And this is like, where does he keep all his rings?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
No one's gonna fucking ask that or gives a shit about that.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It's like, why did you fucking make a werehog? That seems like a really poor design decision.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Can't you just ask us about the rings or the scarves?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.000
You can see like with the scarves thing, he goes really fast. Therefore, he gets cold. Done. Perfect.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Or they just want to show off the physics with the scarves.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Yeah, it makes more fucking sense than like, I don't know. Just, what the fuck is on the screen right now?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
What the hell is this thing that stoppie-linked me in the chatroom saying,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
do you want to know what Rob the Hedgehog looks like? And that's what I got.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And, um, no. No! No. Anyways, all to no.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You know what's actually funny thing about that Tails thing? I want to say that, um, what was it?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
They did a really funny video about that one time about Tails being immortal.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It was one of those Dorkly videos. Go check that out. It's hilarious.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Dark Sakura, what would you have asked Sonic the Hedgehog?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Why haven't you been in a good game recently?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
What do you think the answer would be?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
But Sonic Boom! No bitch.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Alright, if that's it for Sonic, we'll move on to the next story. Lowkey.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Alright, this is kind of ridiculous, but I guess we hear about this at PAX and E3.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I think we've seen this at E3 before, but apparently someone tried to steal the demo for Zelda Breath of the Wild.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And, um, apparently what happened was there was somebody that was actually...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I don't even know how they were able to bring a PC in, hook it up to the demo pod, and somehow try to copy the files over for that.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
They used some sort of URL trick that tricks the system into running unauthorized code.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And somehow, they say that they were successful to be able to copy stuff, but they copied the wrong files.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So yeah.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
So wait, they could have stolen the demo, but they actually copied the wrong files?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
They apparently copied the wrong files.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
That's some kind of sweet poetic justice, isn't it?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000
So, um, yeah. Well, A, how did these people get past E3's screening process? It always blows my mind.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Well, it's like, isn't someone watching those people play this demo?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Okay, it's like a fucking fortress for us to get into E3, but then you hear about these thieves got into E3, like no problem, and it's like, oh my god.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:20.000
The people watching are always just, or almost always just like a hired set of people that don't actually work for the company.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
So, they're just there to...

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Yeah, but they mean like, I mean, I'm sure that it gives like, hey, if they're trying to mess with this, you know, kind of hey, let us know?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I mean, I think it's a little suspicious.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
All those people don't care.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:42.000
For example, when I worked for Nintendo and we did the E3 demo where we had like Mario Kart and Wind Waker, we were given help through a third-party company.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
The person I got did not care at all.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Like, they were just standing around doing nothing.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So, if you're hiring a whole bunch of people that are like that, then I could see this happening very easily.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
That's silly.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Wait, was this one of those scenarios possibly where like, the killer is calling from in the house, meaning the person who was hired by Nintendo to help with the show tried to steal the demo?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Because that would be a very elaborate way to do it.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That'd be funny. I doubt it.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I don't know about funny, but it would be kind of one of those like, oh, shit, like that's a pretty James Bond way to steal a demo.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000
But, you know, with all the hype that this game has, it'd be interesting.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Anyway, don't steal things. It's not nice.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Going to the next story, which is about Yacht Club games, because I think, isn't like today also Shovel Knight's birthday?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I think it's two years old.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Yeah, I think it's a anniversary for Shovel Knight, which, you know, a lot of y'all love Shovel Knight, and rightfully so.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And they've been adding, you know, content into Shovel Knight.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
So, it would be curious what Yacht Club might do next.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And they actually created a poll that is very simply, what game should we make next?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And what's great about this is that it actually is saying a Zelda, a Metroid, Shovel Kart, or Shovel Knight 2.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
A Metroid.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Yeah, I would love to see a Metroid as well, but wouldn't like a Shovel Knight 2 kind of be an inevitable thing as well?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Or a Metroid game.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yeah, I'm like, can't you guys do more than one game?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I mean, not to be off topic, but have you seen the demo for Bloodstained?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I haven't. I heard the backers.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Oh my god, I've watched a lot of streams of it. I mean, it's not that long of a demo.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
It's pretty amazing.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I'm definitely a lot better looking than Mighty No. 9 right now.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I was gonna say, you know, well, Mighty No. 9, like I know the big wave tends to be going against that game right now.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Especially what I see on Twitter and the critics and all that.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000
But like I know, and I was mentioning this earlier in the show, like our pal Captain Spike over at Game Buoy seemed to really enjoy it.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I haven't played it yet, so I can't tell you one way or the other.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Or at Ranger Pride. You know, he has that show too.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Oh, that's right. Yeah, there's that little thing too.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But that show's not as good as Game Buoy.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I'm just messing.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:16.000
But with Mighty No. 9, you know, there are some people out there who are like, you know what, the internet is shitting on this too much.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Like it doesn't deserve all this backlash it's getting. It's not a bad game.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
So, but regardless of all that, it does seem like a lot of people are very cautious about Kickstarters and all this stuff.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Because Mighty No. 9 may have kind of damaged Kickstarted games.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
But it's kind of nice to hear that Bloodstained maybe could reverse that.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
From a lot of what, you know, the feedback is very positive on that.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So it's like you might have a good Kickstarter story out there.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah, it's just disappointing just kind of how that game turned out.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Because even looking at some of the footage that they showed before, the concept footage from Comcept, it was just like a very...

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000
It doesn't even look as nice as the original kind of idea that they had.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I feel like from what I've watched of it being played, and from what I've heard, because I've heard it's not a terrible game, it's just kind of average.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's also based in Unreal 3. I mean, they're using a fucking old engine for that.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:28.000
But I think the big problem with that game, from what I've seen, is that it's billed as like the spiritual successor to Mega Man.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Where it looks like the main part of that is just that you fight robot bosses and get their abilities.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
They did a lot of tweaking and like adding stuff that kind of takes it away from the Mega Man sort of experience.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And so, whereas Bloodstained, I mean that's basically Symphony of the Night or any other Castlevania games after Symphony of the Night that played the same way.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And it's beautiful, and they're not trying to do something that takes it so far out of that sort of genre there.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Whereas Mighty No. 9, from what I've seen and heard, kind of does drift too far away from the Mega Man formula.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I'm fine with it drifting away from the Mega Man formula, but it's just kind of not good looking. I don't know.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I watched a lot of different streams for it. I have no interest in picking it up. Whereas I was pretty excited about it when it was Kickstaring it.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I'm glad I didn't back it.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And seriously, what the fuck is up with the stupid end credits? The end credits are fucking four hours long.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
The game is less than four hours long.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Well, when you promise you're going to put everybody's name in the credits.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
But it's not! It's like the Mighty No. backer number blah blah blah, you know, something.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And that's it. It's just fucking stupid.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
You know what? They put every single backer in fucking the end of Kung Fury, and that didn't take fucking four hours long.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And I know that there was probably around the same number of backers.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I mean, there's got to be a better way than running that for four fucking hours. No one's going to watch that shit.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
No, they're just looking through to find themselves. That's all.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
That's what I did with Shadowgate. I just ran through to find myself.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
People usually do like what I did with the ending of the first Mass Effect after the song ended and the credits were still going.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I just went to go to the bathroom.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Yeah, I got up to make a sandwich, you know, get ready for the next game.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Oh, but Mass Effect 1 credits have the best song.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I said after the song was over because the credits kept going.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Oh yeah, it does.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Alright, well before we get to release dates, let's do another story from Jamie.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Well, this is something about Capcom, especially about Resident Evil 7, also known as, I guess, PT-like, as the trailer indicates.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's not even close.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Nothing is PT.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
No.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:59.000
So anyway, they are taking out certain things that we expected in the previous ones.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
They're removing the quick time events.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:13.000
There are no quick time events in this particular game, but they are going back to the roots of horror and exploration so that those are the primary focus.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:25.000
There's still puzzle solving, still resource management, enemy combat, but none of those things that just don't work for the series.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
So, hopefully we'll be able to see if it's any good.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And one thing that they did specify is that they haven't turned it into a ghost story.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
It's just going to make sense by the time you get to the ending.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Shane, it sounds like you weren't super impressed by the demo.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I never got around to playing it because I felt that you would be very mad at me if I played it when you weren't around.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
No, I just wanted to hear you scream.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's just, I read that they said that they started this demo and this concept before PT was announced or whatever.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Even though I don't believe that.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It's just, everybody's trying to copy what PT did and some have better success than others.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:21.000
And this Resident Evil demo, it's got some pretty creepy sounds that come out of nowhere, but on the whole it is not scary.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
It's kind of just annoying. There's items in it that you have no use for in the demo.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It's not like stuff hasn't been figured out. Everything has been figured out about that demo according to stuff that Capcom has said.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So it's like, why did you put this item in here? There's no great big mystery like there is in PT.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:51.000
PT set up a great atmosphere. It's very scary. This Resident Evil demo doesn't deliver on either of those fronts.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It's a shame because that trailer during Sony's press conference was really exciting.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
And even starting out the game watching it was pretty exciting.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
But then it just kind of goes nowhere and is not that great.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Yeah, it was one of the few trailers that are in there that was like, what? That's Resident Evil?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yeah, I was like, oh, somebody picked up PT.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I called that it was Call of Duty when I saw that because it just looks like it should be Call of Duty.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But no, I don't know. I just don't feel like they are going to be making a good game.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:47.000
That's fine and I don't disagree. But if you're going to make it like PT, make it good enough to live up to that.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Don't phone it in in a way. They tried to obviously go for something very realistic looking like PT did.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And a lot of stuff in there does not look nearly as good as PT which came out two years ago or whatever at this point.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things that will be coming out a lot sooner than Resident Evil 7 or PT for that matter.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:22.000
This week we've got 7 Days to Die on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, God Eater Resurrection on PlayStation 4 and Vita,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Grand Kingdom on PlayStation 4 and Vita, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Eyes of Heaven on PlayStation 4,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Lego's Star Wars The Force Awakens on PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U, and 3DS on all those wonderful platforms,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Prison Architect on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the remaster of Resident Evil 5 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Star Ocean Integrity and Faithlessness on PlayStation 4, Terraria finally coming out on Wii U,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000
The Technomancer on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Zero Time Dilemma on Vita and 3DS,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Inside on Xbox One, and then finally BoxBox Boy and 3DS, Super Robot Wars Original Generation,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
The Moon Dwellers on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, and Zero Time Dilemma on PC.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out what is coming out over there on the release date of June 30th would be the next release date.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
We have on PlayStation 4 Super Robot Wars OG The Moon Dwellers in regular and limited edition.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
The Walking Dead Season 2 gets its release, which is brought to you by Square Enix over in Japan, which I think is interesting.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Also some best editions for Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000
There's also a limited edition of Dragon's Dogma Online Season 2. That is all on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:14.000
On the Wii U this week, nothing in Japan. It's kind of a dry period for the Wii U, as most weeks tend to be.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:24.000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Zatai Kaiku Gakuen comes out this week, as well as Zero Escape Toki no Dilemma comes out.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And lastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week, there's a Shovel Knight Amiibo set coming out this week, and Zero Escape Toki no Dilemma is also out on the 3DS.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:43.000
So there you go. There's also a bunch of accessories with Kirby Robobo on it, so you can look for that.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.000
A lot of stuff releasing for that game, although I believe that game has already come out in Japan, as it has here.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
On the 28th, we have Prison Architect for PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360, and bless you.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Thank you.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:07.000
On June 30th, we have Box Box Boy for 3DS, and the incredible adventures of Van Helsing 2 for Xbox One.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And that is all.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So this is kind of neat.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Oculus has finally removed some of its DRM from their VR, not really their games, but the actual Oculus drivers that they have running.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Before they had something in place where it basically would not allow you to run certain apps to actually be able to revive,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
which allow you to run those Oculus games on non-Oculus systems.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So now with that, they've removed the DRM, and I guess now you can do that again.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:58.000
So that was part of Oculus Runtime 1.5. They added that check.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I guess they realized they were not going to get around people.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It's nice. I understand they're still going to have their Oculus exclusives and stuff.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I hope we get to a point some point soon where they treat those devices more like monitors than they do actual gaming platforms.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And just open it up for everybody, because you're going to get more games that way.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Let's see, going to chat, Bobby Blackwolf, our resident VR expert here at VOG Network, says there's still DRM, it's just not a hardware check anymore.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
SteamVR is already open.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So, no more is it trying to ensure that you're playing with...

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Yeah, you have like an Oculus Rift and stuff. Yeah, that's what I meant.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Basically locking it down.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Hey, are you a fan of the new Mortal Kombat game and how it brings all these horror...

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
No!

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
No, you're not a fan of Jason.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I think it's dumb.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
They're cool, but it's a little weird sometimes. That's all they kind of fill it in with.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I like the mythos of Mortal Kombat itself. Don't drag in things from our entertainment industry like horror slasher monster guys.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Unless, of course, you want to add PBS characters into that, like Barney and Caillou and stuff.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Mr. Rogers?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Well, Mr. Rogers might be a little sensitive.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
King Friday?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
King Friday.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Noah Lane, she was a bitch.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Put a Lane in there and let's see, Oscar the Grouch. I like this.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Oscar the Grouch?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Bob Ross.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
He's going to beat the devil out of you.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Yes, he is.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
That'd be awesome.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Dar Sager, would you play this fight? Would you play PBS fighters?

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Who would be your character in PBS fighters?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000
If you could do PBS fighters, technically any of the Doctor Who cast could be involved.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
From the 80s and 70s.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Okay.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Maybe back to the 60s. I don't know if they started with the 60s series on PBS.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
But the fourth Doctor would just give everyone Jelly Babies as a taunt.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And then land the TARDIS on them. I don't know.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I'm changing my answer then. If we're taking any PBS show, I'm going to roll with Math Man.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
From Square One.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Okay, I was thinking of that.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Or one of the people from Math Net.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
But then I thought of one even better, and I want to be the chief from Carmen Sandiego.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
You see, I thought about that.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Yes!

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Or one of the villains. I'll be Double Trouble.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
You should just be Carmen Sandiego.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Or...

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
For Rockapella.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Or...

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Because a lot of British TV shows, you could just land the entirety of Faulty Towers on it.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Loki, did you think of a character you'd want to be in PBS Fighters?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
No, I haven't really thought of anything.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But if you want to be funny, you could do a character from Are You Being Served?

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
No, I think for a PBS fighting game, let's see.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I would pick...

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I don't know. Do you guys think that PBS Fighters from Ed Boon may be an actual OLR dream game?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Wait, I know I watched it on Amazon.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I think so. I vote for PBS Fighters as a dream game.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
PBS Fighters is a seconded.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Alright.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I watched it on Amazon, but isn't Downton Abbey on PBS? Can I please be Maggie Smith?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Yes, Downton Abbey is on PBS.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I love Downton Abbey, oh my god.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
All she has to do is stand there and make snarky quips.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
God, everybody would die so quick.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Alright, it's official. PBS Fighters is an OLR dream game.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Oh, I don't know who to main now. Am I going to be Math Man or Maggie Smith?

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't even feel like reading this story anymore.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
People who know how to do stuff in Moogen, it could happen.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Alright, well anyway, I guess this subpar idea that Ed Boon is tossing around there...

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
This story is worthless. Just move on. We made it better.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Alright, look, somebody asked if he would do a fighting game with all the horror movie franchise icons,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
and he was like, you know, fan feedback, but if the demand is there, we're always listening.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I would play it.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I would still play it too.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
The answer is yes, we'd like to do that, but licensing costs money, so yeah.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:16.000
But think about it now though. You've already seen certain types of characters in Killer Instinct.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:27.000
If they can make an onryo in Killer Instinct work, then that instantly gives us an entire series of Japanese horror flick series.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
So, it could happen.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
It could happen.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000
SSG100Matt says, I had a friend that was on Carmen Sandiego.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
She made it to the end, but she didn't catch Carmen, so she could...

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Did she get fucking stuck with the Africa map or like one of the ones that's like impossible that nobody could ever beat?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Because yeah, that's horrible.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
But, I would like to ask this question since we're talking about game shows.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000
How am I now 38 years old and I've never been on a game show?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
You technically were.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
When?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
You were in the Audience of the Price is Right.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Okay, I was in the Audience of the Price is Right for two episodes, but I wasn't picked.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
But I saw you on TV.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I recorded that shit for you.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
That was a lot.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Okay, guys, that was before OLR when that happened.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
That was a long time ago.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I recorded that for you.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Well, technically, I mean, we've been on the news.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I mean, that's sort of...

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That's not game show.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I was in a deleted scene of RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So, if you do consider Drag Race a game show, I guess I was.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
But I wasn't a contestant.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Not that season.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But, did you know that one of the things our show...

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Not that I should be reminding listeners of other things they can listen to live,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
but our show right now...

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Like, fuck Game of Thrones. I know everybody's losing their shit.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
No, I can't look at Twitter right now because it's apparently a really good episode.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Fuck that show.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I don't watch the show, but I read the spoilers.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Oh my god!

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Okay, that's it. We're not talking about it.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Stop. I watch the show.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Hold the door for a minute. I'm not done with the conversation.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I see what you did there.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That was super lame.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That's like an old person joke.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Fuck off.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
But, we're up against on ABC tonight.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
There is a three-hour block.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
The first hour, Celebrity Family Feud, which really is just the Steve Harvey show.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
We all know that, you know, we never thought Richard Dawson could be topped,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
but Steve Harvey does an amazing job.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Hour two is the $100,000 pyramid with Michael Stram, from Kelly and Michael.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
He's not there anymore, so...

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Well, yeah, he's not there anymore. He's doing the $100,000 pyramid.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
The $100,000... Not the $100,000 pyramid.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
The $100,000 pyramid.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.000
That was gross.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I don't mind it now.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
The $100,000 period hosted by Maury Povich.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
You are not the father.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And then lastly, the third hour is the match game with Alec Baldwin.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Who are the celebrities?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I think the first episode is Rosie O'Donnell is one of them.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I'm sure Gilbert Gottfried's in there somewhere.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
The one that caught my eye was Titus Bergeron from...

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
What's his name? Titus... The guy from... Kimmy Schmidt.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Nice.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah, I think you're thinking Tom Bergeron when you said that.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
No, Titus...

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
No, I know, but...

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
No, that's the name of the show.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
No, I know, but the last...

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I'm going to stand here and be clueless because I've never watched that.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Oh my god, you need to be watching that show.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Oh, Alan's here! Hi, Alan!

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Hello, I just walked through the door with groceries

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
and I overheard you talking about Steve Harvey's Family Feud.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
The subtitle of that is just...

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It should just be called White People Are Nasty.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Because it's just some white mom being, like, an erection

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
and then it's on the board and Steve Harvey goes to church.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Like, that's what the show is.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Yeah, but that shit is funny.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Like, every time somebody shares that on Facebook,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I laugh and I laugh and I laugh.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It's great.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Alright, anyway...

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So, anyway, my whole point of that was why haven't I been on a game show yet?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I need that to happen.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I think that should be my dream.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Before I'm 40, I need to be on a game show.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Move to Burbank.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Bye, Rob.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Alright.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Let's go back to a simpler time.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Let's go back to a year when I was on The Price is Right

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
in the audience

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
with a tag that said my legal name on it

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
because you couldn't use your middle name

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
because of reasons if you won the prize.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Anyway, it's a classic game of the week

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and Dark Sakura chooses a game that she thinks,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Hey, look, you brats in your fucking Mighty No. 9.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Yeah.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
You need to go back to Mighty No. of the year 2000 and play this.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You need to wave your hands around and do stuff.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Wave your hands like you just don't care.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Oh, I'm so excited to hear this.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
The classic game of the week is Dance Maniacs.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Because I think I've done for most anniversary shows,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I picked a Bimani game.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I was like, you're on a Bimani kick lately.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You just did one last week.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I did Papa Music because I play Papa Music.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
So I picked Dance Maniacs.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Oh, I almost picked Diablo.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
But...

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Yeah, it's an anniversary show.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
This is a better choice.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Do Diablo next week.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Maybe.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Now I'm going to forget all about Diablo and just do nothing but Bimani.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So, Dance Maniacs.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It was from, of course, a Bimani game.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
It was published by Konami when they didn't suck.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And it uses...

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Most of the songs come from the Dance Mania series of music.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And it has plenty in common with DDR.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
It came out in March 2000.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
And it was a fairly unique kind of game when it came out.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I like to think of this as the weird grandparent of Para Para Paradise.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm sorry.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Every time I hear this song, which is in Dance Maniacs...

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I love this song.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Okay, but I think of Sister Act.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Me too.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Every single time without fail.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Especially since the video for it is all doves flying into sunshine.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
It's fucking Sister Act.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I reject it as a Bimani song.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
It's always a Sister Act soundtrack song.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Okay.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Sorry.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You've got eight different sensors.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
You've got a set of four on top and a set of four in the middle.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And so you can do two player side by side on each of the little diagonals.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
You can play in center mode for solo.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And then...

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Which is how I prefer to play.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Or you can do two player at the same time.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So, basically...

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
And there's also doubles play where you can use all eight sensors.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So they're all predefined courses.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
You have different options for difficulty.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And quite a few songs to choose from.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
But you also have some other goodies in there too.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Like picking...

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I just lost my train of thought.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I'm sorry, the extra modes came in second mix.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But I will go back to the first mix.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
It doesn't stick in with that one.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
So the way that you play, you have the pink lanes for the upper sensors.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And the blue ones for the under.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And so you have to go...

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
You know, basically the pink ones are for...

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
You go high for the blue ones, you go low.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I mean, just watch a video of someone playing it and looking really dumb.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
There are some people though who can do it really awesome.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Who like will use their legs and everything.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It's pretty neat.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
You had to when you had to hit three at once?

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Well, yeah.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Some of them.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
That was some knees right there.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Yep.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And so you either finish all the songs in the course or you die.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Like meet the key to it.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Now in second mix we got marathon mode.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Which only had songs that were in second mix.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And so basically you just had to continuously keep your bar up.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Convos with at least a thousand will show fever after the number of combos.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000
And then there was also the second mix Append Jay Paradise.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And it included the songs from first mix with it.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
But you could only choose three of those titles in the marathon mode.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
So...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
And the marathon courses could be up to...

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
25 I think it was.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
But it could be set by the operator of the arcade.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
How long marathon mode lasted.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So...

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And of course it gets hard.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I think I've only made it like seven songs in on marathon.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
This YouTube that you have up has somebody going for 25 stages.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
It's over a half hour.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I've made it like...

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I think in a full combo.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I've made like 20 minutes in some of the marathon modes.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
And then the thing with Dance Maniacs is it hurts if you mess up.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Like you break your wrist and your hands.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I've hit my hands way too many times on the sensors.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I actually have...

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Like I was trying to build a home brew Dance Maniacs cabinet one time.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
So I have some of the sensors.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
And those suckers are fucking solid metal.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
It's just...

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
You can kill somebody with one of those sensors.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Also I fucking love this song.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Which one is it?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Mind Parasite.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I had to repost it on my Facebook.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Dance Maniacs has some of the best music.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Whether it be Crossover or from the Dance Maniacs.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
It's got Body.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It's got Gorgeous 2012.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
It has Wanda.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
It's got Sky High.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
It's got cool remixes of Upside Down and Boom Boom Dollar.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Oh the music is so good.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I still laugh about Sky High.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Because when I was in high school we had the sheet music for that marching band.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And I remember...

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Oh did I say...

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I didn't mean Sky High.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I'm sorry.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
It has Hot Limit.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I don't think it has Sky High.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Hot...

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
No.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Sky High was solo wasn't it?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Sky High...

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Depends on which Sky High.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I thought they had Sky High in one of them.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
There were two songs called Sky High.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I'm thinking of the one that was the remake of the 70s song.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
That one.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Yeah that's the remake of the 70s song.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Is that in Dance Maniacs?

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I meant to say Hot Limit.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I know that.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Hot Limit and Wanda is what I meant to say.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Well anyway the music pretty much as we have gone over and over.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Pretty much came from all the Dance Mania series.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:32.000
They had to deal with Toshiba, EMI to basically freely license any track they wanted to.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000
And then of course they had the Bimani core ones too.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
So Dance Maniacs first released in 2000 with 26 songs.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Dance Maniacs second mix had 28 new songs and 25 from the original Dance Maniacs.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So 53 total.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The only song that did not come over was My Sharona by DJ Mico.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Dance Maniacs second mix appended JParadise added 14 new songs that were a good portion from Dance Mania JParadise.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And then they had a secret song Paranoia Jazzy Groove plus Trip Machine Climax Dead End Sink Edit.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Plus Dead End Sink Edit.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So I'm getting all crazy.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:27.000
But these were only in there as I believe custom made steps.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And then of course there was the Korean released Dance Freaks.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
They came out in 2000 with 33 songs.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:41.000
There were the original 26 plus 7 licensed Korean songs that were particular to that version.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Some of them are really good songs. I'm looking at them right now.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Cause I recognize them from Pump.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I don't see Sky High by the way.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I meant to say Hot Limit. I don't know why I said Sky High.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
But I'm looking at the soundtrack or the list right now.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:04.000
This game had probably the best percentages of amazing songs compared to crappy songs.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Sanctus? Come on.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
And what else did I see on here?

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Quickening?

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
This is the one that gave us Together in Forever.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
What?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000
So it also gave us, I think Together in Forever was only in this one for the longest time.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Has Johnny John-Ahh?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Yeah.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
So good.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
And we had some of the great stuff from Beatmania.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
From the early Beatmania.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Quickening.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000
We had different remixes of the other Bimani these days.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Doctor Love.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:44.000
There were the remixes of, I'm thinking of Matsuri.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Happy Hopper was like another of my favorites in this one.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
But it always gave me a headache.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000
But you had Virtual Mind and Paranoia and just all kinds of stuff.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Mobo Mogu is in here?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Yep. Mobo Mogu. Tokyo already.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
But you know, that was like a lot of my favorite Para Para music.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
So I really think that this could seriously be considered the immediate precursor to Para Para Paradise.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
There's so much Eurobeat in here.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So much Super Eurobeat.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
We make some dumb Dariram.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
It used to be like my DDR song too.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I miss this game a lot.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Do you think I could buy a machine for cheap?

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
My friend bought one for pretty cheap.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Really?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Yeah, he has one.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I might buy one. What do you think?

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I want one.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Yeah, and then just make sure that you have good hand insurance.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I was going to say...

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Wear boxing gloves when you play.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
There's a Facebook group.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It's Shonagan's Arcade.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
They do a lot of like, here's a machine.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000
They had a fucking DDR Extreme for $350 in the Bay Area.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
What was wrong with it?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I was like, I think one of the sides was messed up.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
But it's probably simple to fix.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Alright, well, DarkSocker, anything else you want to say about Dance Maniacs?

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I hope I like this song too.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Dance Maniacs.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Alright, that's going to do it for this first half of the show.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
We've got plenty more show to come.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
We're going to do some rapid fire news when we get back.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Yes, a FUCL Question of the Week and Listless.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Okay, y'all ready for the Listless topic this week?

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
So you can be brainstorming during the break.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Or should I tease them?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Should I give it when we get back?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Do you think...

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Tease them a little. Give them a little pinch.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Alright, tonight's topic will be about Konami.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And I'm going to tell you specifically what when we come back.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Live tonight on June the 26th of 2016 with episode number 647 of our show.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Our 14th anniversary show already in progress.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Myself, DarkSakura, and Loki here as always.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Joined by one of our most frequent contributors here on the show.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Shane is joining us in the studio tonight.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And of course while the show is going on, he is on his 3DS doing what?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Shiny hunting.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Looking for shinies.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I need my shiny Pawnyard that's a male.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And you've already found what, two during the show, right?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Two female shiny Pawnyards.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And that just makes me want to punch a baby.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Oh Shane, Shane, Shane. Alright.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
You don't understand, when he evolves he looks like a Mega Man character.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
And I want a blue Mega Man character so bad.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
You're right, I don't understand.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
He looks like a cross between like Metal Man, Quick Man, and Flash Man at that point.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I'm still trying to collect all eight badges as I go through Alpha Sapphire.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Hey, I'm further than I've been in a Pokemon game before.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But you're still not even close to done.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Well guys, do you know what Shane said to me?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Is that if I beat a Pokemon game, and like it, which that's easy to lie about.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
No, I can tell.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Then Shane will go to the next Rocky Horror Picture Show.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Yes I will.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Because I know it's an empty threat.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Which we did one of those last night, by the way.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I don't get a chance.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Oh and see, had you beaten Pokemon and liked it, I could have gone last night.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
It was a fight. They did a Disney hybrid crossover show. It was really funny.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I don't know because I wasn't there because you didn't beat Pokemon.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I just need to do a PBS crossover show.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Oh my god, do a Allen Abbey one and I'll probably just go for the fun of it.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
They're trying to think of what theme they want to do for next year.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
So maybe that's one I'm going to pitch.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Why not characters from your childhood?

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Call it ruin my childhood.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Ruin my childhood night.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I love it.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Alright, let us get some rapid fire news done and then we're going to get to our list list tonight.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Let's do rapid fire first.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Alright, so this should come no surprise to you, but Res Infinite has been confirmed to be releasing on October 13th.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Which is the launch date for the PlayStation VR.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I mean, it is a launch title, so I guess that makes sense.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I definitely will be checking this out.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I missed, they were doing some new, what is it, PlayStation VR tests over at some of the local Best Buys.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And they expanded it from like 10 locations or wherever they had to like 300 or something.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
And so there was one actually nearby, but I did not make it out to it.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I mean, they're going on again too because I know the GameStop near me is doing it again.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
The Best Buy near me is doing it again.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So there's going to be more chances at least.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Yeah, I just want to check it out. I mean, I already have it pre-ordered, but it would be kind of cool just to see how it is.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Oh, it's so good.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I'm just curious to compare it to the Oculus Rift DK2 that I've got and the Gear VR and just kind of see what theirs looks like.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
That's it.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000
But yeah, so definitely one of the games I'll probably be picking up at launch.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
They're also saying, of course, there's new content, which is that Area X.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
No idea what that means.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:19.000
You know what other game I kind of wish they would also release as well is, what is it, Child of Eden along with that.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000
You know, maybe if Rez sells well enough, they'll do that because I don't think a lot of people got to experience Child of Eden.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Because who wanted to play it with a Kinect? Because I tried it, I didn't like it.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.000
I had eBay bucks because you buy stuff on eBay or sell stuff and you buy stuff on eBay and they give you eBay bucks.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
And I have like $5 to spend before it expired like that day.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And I was like, crap, I got to get something for $5.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
So I searched for games for $5.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Child of Eden. Sorry, yes. Child of Eden DLC code for $5. Best $5 I've ever spent.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I have the PS3 one at home and I don't remember even playing it because I think at that point I was just like, I want to play Rez.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
But if I could play it in 3D in VR, I would be super excited.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Definitely a nice Rez-ish type of game.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I'm looking forward to more Rez, but I'd like more games like that as well.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Rez in VR is really trippy. You'll have a good time.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Yeah, definitely. It'll be cool.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And this is kind of disappointing because, you know, I love Criterion and I was kind of curious to see what this was since they're not making, you know, a Burnout game.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:40.000
But Criterion's, you know, they have that kind of extreme sports type game that was supposed to be coming out that they're developing.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:47.000
And unfortunately, that's not going to happen because EA has canceled the project.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Yeah, so, you know, while they basically moved on from a previous project that they've spoken about and they aren't pursuing it,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:03.000
they are continuing to build new ideas and experiment with new IP for EA in addition to continuing to collaborate with other studios.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000
But honestly, the reason for that apparently was that they're working on more Star Wars stuff.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Which I'm like, I like Star Wars, but I like Burnout a whole fuck ton more than Star Wars.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
So I would appreciate them doing something more allow-

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Let's get, we're going to get burnt out on the Star Wars shit after a while.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Yeah, I might ration the Star Wars shit a little more.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Because I'm starting to get, I'm already kind of burnt out on it.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Well, something that we as gamers don't seem to ever get burned out on is Pac-Man games since, you know, one was just released this week.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
But, you know, although Pac-Man 256 is, you know, it's okay for five bucks.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I would be very excited if this series, in fact, is continuing.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
And apparently it is Pac-Man Championship Edition.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:00.000
That's right, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 has apparently been spotted on a South Korea video games rating board website.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.000
And sometimes these rating boards things do tend to spill the secrets on what's about to be released.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Well, the sequel would be for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And I got to say that Pac-Man Championship Deluxe, great soundtrack for one.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And I hope, I hope they get the same people doing the soundtrack again.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And just such a fun Pac-Man game.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I really like, you know, going back to play the old Pac-Man, it's one of those things that I can just play in short bursts.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
And it's kind of like, oh, yay, nostalgia. But, you know, I can't really play it for a long, long, long time.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000
But Championship Edition is that good. I love Championship Edition.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
And stopping in the chat room is actually saying it's Championship Edition DX 2.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Which would make sense because DX was kind of the souped up version.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
And so that's the one that would deserve a sequel.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
So I hope it's true. I hope it happens.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Another plug and play console, speaking of retro stuff.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I'm going to be bringing Data East and Capcom Arcade Games home.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Something called, I guess, the Generations Plug and Play Console. It's by Retro-Bit.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
It's going to have 60 classic games on it.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
You know the plug and play things, right? It's like the joystick. You just plug it right in your TV.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:19.000
1942 and 1943, Captain Commando, Ghosts and Goblins, Gun.Smoke.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Not to be confused with the TV show.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Higemaru, Knights of the Round, Sun Sun, Ring King. That's awesome.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.000
These are some real great classics.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:36.000
So we'll have to see if that is a worthy package, what the price is on that. I'm not sure.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
It will have both composite and HDMI outputs.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And the controller is apparently a Sega Genesis 6 button style controller.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
So, yeah, I'll be curious how much that's going to cost.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I'd like to check that out. It will be fun.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:58.000
For one thing, Bondo, sorry, Bonda, Bondo.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Yeah, no, Bondi Namco has trademarks for amazing Katamari in Japan.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Well, Bondo is actually for fixing cars.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:16.000
But they also, well, that's amazing Katamari Damacy in Europe.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And, of course, for Japan, Subarashiki Kana Katamari Damacy in Japan.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
And then they have also trademarked amazing Katamari, filed on June 14th.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Ooh.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And then Wolfenstein The New Order developer, this is Machine Games, did a Quake level.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Like, old Quake.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Like Nine Inch Nails soundtrack Quake.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Yeah. So, you can get a copy of Quake.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Or if you don't already have it, or if you already have it, you import it into your Steam library.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
You download the episode package, extract it into the Quake folder.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000
You right click on Quake in your Steam library, select properties.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And then your launch option should be, you type minus game space D-O-P-A into the prompt.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And so, it's just called DOPA.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
There you go.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Awesome. Nice little hidden thing all these years later.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Well, hidden, it's brand new.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Well, no, no, I mean, like, you know, but you have to do that whole command line thing to get in there, I guess.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
No, the command line thing's just in Steam anyway.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Oh.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.000
It's, you can always set your game properties for things that you don't want to open, like windowed versus unwindowed.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Or for running particular games with cheats or scripts.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
You can tell them where to run them, so.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I don't really fool around with that stuff enough, but that makes, I know you use mods in some of your, like Dragon Age-ing, so that makes sense.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Well, and I import a lot of game, non-Steam games into my Steam library regularly, so.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Ah.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
All right, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000
This week, it's the one show a year we can be self-referential, because it's our birthday.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
So we get to make it all about us.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.000
So we ask the listeners simply, what do you want to see more of on our show in the future?

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
That was the FUGL question of the week.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And we also want to take an opportunity, of course, to thank everybody just for their support, you know, whether they've been here since episode one, Dark Tetsuya, or since, you know, 14 minutes ago.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
So a big thanks to everybody for their support over the years.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
So let's go to the answers on Facebook.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
What do you want to see more of on OLR in the future?

02:02:45.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Raginator says, I'd like to see a return of an accompanying video stream to the show, plus more talk about bacon, more Loki rants, and more sky, which is funny because he put skydive fits, which is kind of funny because skydive, but I think he meant to say diva fits.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Critical Myth says, I'd love to see a return of the various game shows that used to be a more regular fixture.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Well, boy, you're going to be excited tonight.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Blaze says, bring back the ferret.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It has been a very long, I think the ferret is out of juice and is sitting on top of my pile of books.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
That's right, the ferret, the battery inside the ferret finally died.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.000
It's living at my house, hanging out with my hot duffel boyfriend plushies and Monokuma.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Well, I'm sure you you're quite versed in sewing, so you could just cut that sucker open, change the batteries.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Why are you so sure I'm well versed in sewing?

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Because you're making a costume.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Yeah, you always talk about cosplay.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I'm paying other people to sew shit for me.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I was going to say, but you've made like doll clothing and stuff like that. I don't think you can just staple that shit together.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I've stapled doll clothing together to make it.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:01.000
You were trying to trap him into saying a woman, huh? You were trying to thinking it was that line of thinking. You talk about costuming a lot, though.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000
That's not what I'm thinking. Shit, my wife doesn't know how to fucking sew anything, so I never make that assumption.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I've sewn plushies and I can sew buttons on, but I was like, I'm not going to cut that thing open.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I have stapled those ferrets back because I did find some a long time ago that were sold.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I'm going on Amazon right now and looking for what are they called? Scoosies?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Scoosies, yeah. And I did find some, like a KV that was like, you know, discounted those things.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And all the batteries were dead, so I just cut them open, replaced the batteries, and we have like four of them. I don't know where they went.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Alright, let's see more answers over here.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Kane.I.Am in Facebook says, more Secret of Evermore and Chrono Trigger.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
But seriously, just more of you all having fun.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Well maybe, I need to find a cartridge for Secret of Evermore and then I could do a live stream. That would be fun.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I have it.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
People have done Chrono Trigger. I mean, whatever, but Secret of Evermore.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I have it.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Oh really? You should bring it over. It'd be fun.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Alright.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Andy R says, needs more listless, which by the way, I know it sounds like list list is what the segment sounds like, but it's actually called list less.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000
But when you say it really fast, I totally understand most people, but there actually is a pun there.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:24.000
The segment's called list less, which by the, I don't know if you guys may or may not know this. It might be on the wiki.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I don't know. I haven't checked that in a while.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:36.000
But list less is like the one segment that dates all the way back to my college radio show that I did like when I was in college.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
So a very long time ago, but we would actually do this segment.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
It wasn't about gaming topics, but we do it about like movies and other things.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
So yeah, it's the one thing that's kind of lived on since that era.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Let's see. Retertainment in chat says, I can't think of anything good. Then again, I don't host a podcast, so I might not have any good ideas.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:03.000
As far as bad ideas, an all emoji show. I can give everybody the middle finger emoji right now. There it is.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Yeah.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Alright.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I think I agree with critical miss comment. More of the classic games, things we used to do.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Like there was a short lived one on the show, Orange Crush. I forgot about that one. That involved classic video game trivia.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Maybe we could come up with some new ones. I'd also like to second the vote for The Return of the Ferret.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Interesting. A lot of votes for game shows in that segment.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000
But also, I do want to not leave out Google Plus because we have a couple answers over there.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:36.000
DNL replied on Google Plus. You saw her recently, didn't you? Dark soccer. I'm very jealous.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:42.000
DNL says, first off, congrats on 14 wonderful years of OLR.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Every segment you guys do is awesome. Thank you.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:52.000
But if I had to make a suggestion, I would say that I would love to hear reviews on game themed food and drinks.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I didn't know there was really enough of that out there. I suppose there's a lot of licensing for that stuff.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:05.000
We did just have a 20 minute opening tonight about soda. So maybe that satisfied that a little bit. I don't know.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000
What game themed food and drinks is out there?

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:14.000
There's all those shots that people are making based off of video games and characters and whatnot.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I guess I'm just not seeing enough of that. I also don't do the energy drinks at all.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000
There's also the Skyrim cookbook. Isn't that a thing now?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I don't know.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says you can name the segment Geek Cuisine.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I think another show is actually already doing that. But that is also not specifically gaming related stuff.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I don't think these things are called skoozies.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:44.000
The pod culture gang will do things like the Lays potato chips and things that are kind of in the pop culture stuff.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
I'm finding ferret house toys.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:52.000
One more from actdeft who says congrats guys. The road to the OLR quiceniera begins.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
What I would like to see more of on the show, what you're doing right now is pretty much what I like.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:02.000
If it isn't broken, don't fix it. But maybe more videos or streams of you guys would be nice.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
That's another vote for video.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Rob, I found a penguin wearing a shirt that says I love ferret.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
That's random.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
It made me think of you immediately.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Alright, well thank you guys very much for the feedback on the Fugu question of the week.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Now several of you guys mentioned that you wanted to see more game shows.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
So guess what you guys? I have some really good news for you tonight.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:33.000
It's time to play Listless.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000
We haven't done this in quite a while, so here's the way Listless works.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Is that we are going to, by a highly scientific process, come up with the top three answers on a certain topic.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000
And this is going to be thanks in part to your vote.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:59.000
So if you are listening live, I would encourage you to join our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:07.000
because you will be able to participate and actually vote on the responses and see this play out live over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
And you can actually, we'll start to fill out the board right there on the website and you can see this play out live.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.000
So here's how it works. All of us here in studio will put our top three answers on the board.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Then we go to the elimination round where each host will take off one answer from the board.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
It's painful, but it has to be done.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Under the renovation rules, if somebody loses two answers, their third answer becomes immune and cannot be eliminated from the board.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.000
After we have our final eight, then we will go around and let you guys vote on your number one, your number two picks.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Again, you need to be logged into the VoG website at vognetwork.com and then you'll be able to vote.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Are you all ready for this week's topic?

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Sure.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Here we go. The list we will be building tonight is ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:09.000
As you might remember, in the early days of this show, we used to be very much about DDR and BeatMania.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And you know what? Konami got a lot of free publicity out of this show.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
But in recent years, things have changed a little bit.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Konami and we don't necessarily hype their stuff as much as we used to.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
What stuff?

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Well, there you go.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:35.000
So what are the ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Now, if you guys have some suggestions in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com, sometimes the host will turn to chat and look there for some answers.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
We're going to let our guest start tonight.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Shane is joining us.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Can't I just be last?

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Nope, you get to be first.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
But I don't have a good one yet.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Well, you've only had like 30 minutes to prepare.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:04.000
So, Shane, what is your number three answer for what is the best way that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Konami sponsors the show and gives you guys a lot of money.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000
There, that's a garbage answer. Go ahead and throw it out.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Because I don't have enough time to come up with a better...

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Well, no, my number one's really good. I'm still working on it.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
For what it's worth, Konami giving us a lot of money is a decent...

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I mean, I like money. I don't know about Dark Soccer and Loki, but I really like money.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.000
They may just pay you in pachinko machines, but...

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Alright, so there it is. There it is on the list. Konami sponsors us and gives us lots of money.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Alright, let's move on to... who do I have next on the board?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
It looks like Loki is next on the board.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Loki, what is your number three answer for ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
I just realized it's not live, so they actually can't see the board yet. There we go. Now you can see the board.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Loki, what is your number three answer?

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:03.000
If they actually gave a shit about Bomani again.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000
If they actually gave a shit about Bomani again?

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Yeah, because they don't give a shit about anything unless it's pachinko.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:18.000
What about, like, Sound Voltex and Musica and some of these other things that they're putting out now?

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I don't see that coming out over here. I don't see that coming in the console.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Alright, fair enough. There it is. If they actually gave a shit about Bomani again. That is true.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Where's the 2DX home version? Like anything after Empress.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000
They have that PC one that's in Japan only.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Yeah, Japan only. There it is.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Alright, let's see. My number three answer is, speaking about pachinko, which is the easy joke here.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Take all the pachinko machines out back and shoot them.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000
That was my number three answer. Just take them out back, put them out of their misery.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Because we are sick of hearing about that shit.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:02.000
There it is. Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer for ways that Konami can get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Since I'm not doing these in any particular order, I'm gonna say have them go, just kidding about P.T.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
So the whole thing was a lie.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
An elaborate hoax.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000
It's all an elaborate hoax. And that Death Stranding thing, that was just a side fun thing.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
It was just part of the hoax.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Yeah. That was just a reason to show Norman Reedus' ass. That's all it was.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Covered in baby hands.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Creepy.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
That was just a way to write the M. Pregg fanfic.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000
That's where the baby in the sink came from.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Wow.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
It talks like the radio announcer.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Alright. There it is. So, so far we have Konami gives us money.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Give a shit about my money again, kill the pachinko machines, and just kidding about P.T.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Let's go to our number two answer. Shane.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I'm going to say that Konami, making so much money off of their pachinko machines and their fitness clubs, decides to buy out all the major publishers.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:18.000
So it's like a strategical move where Konami gets us to talk about Konami by buying everybody else.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Exactly.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
That's a pretty clever move. Maybe that's Konami's long term goal. Maybe that's what it is.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.000
You have nothing to talk about except for us because we are everybody. That's what it is.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000
So there it is. It's on the list. Konami buys all the other publishers.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Loki, what's your number two answer?

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Konami puts a bullet in the fucking head of Frogger.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
So a public execution of Frogger.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Public execution of Frogger. Absolutely.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
What do you have against Frogger?

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000
They're like pimping that shit. I guess it is their fucking Pac-Man or whatever, but it's just so uninteresting.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I don't give a shit about your fucking Frogger games.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Alright. There it is.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
DarkTetsuya suggests run over him with a semi-truck.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
And Stoppy's saying, didn't George Costanza already kill Frogger?

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
There was that.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Alright, my number two answer, and you know what, this is long overdue.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:35.000
And something I think I would be willing to at least dedicate an episode to Konami if they would just apologize publicly for Beaten Groovy.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I want a public apology for Beaten Groovy. Like literally, what the hell were you thinking?

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
There it is. My number two answer on the list.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Konami revives the YY World series, as in W-A-I-W-A-I.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Basically it was the series where you played as characters who could go into different Konami games.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
You know, like little mini-game levels.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I would probably pee a little bit if they brought back that series.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Because the concept was fun and they didn't do enough with it.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Could you imagine now with the current games that we have, and maybe doing it as an exploring game?

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000
I would talk about Konami all the time.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Because what if you could explore Silent Hill on one level next.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And the next thing you know you're like, you know, running through the castle, Dracula's castle.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
And you know, just think about it.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
So OrangeRideInChat kind of frames it as Konami NES Remix.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
No.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
No?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
No, it's not, it's...

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.000
No, it would be an exploring game. It wouldn't be like NES Remix.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Alright.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Like a platforming game.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Now that you bring up exploring game, I almost wish I'd made a reference to Goonies 2 on my list somewhere.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I guess it's not too late.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Goonies 2 would be included in my game.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Okay, that's fair.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
So actually, DarkSaga, I'll give you props.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.000
That's a fairly serious answer.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Yes.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
In a week full of fuckery.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Yes.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Alright.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
We'll see how it fares.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Alright, let's go around and do the number one answers.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
So here we go.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
What are the number one answers?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Shane, number one way that Konami could get the show to talk about Konami again.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Konami has like a shareholder revolt and ousts the current CEO and replaces them with Mr. Spanky from DDRPC.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Is he wearing a suit jacket over that leather?

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000
No, why? No, he has like a fancy ball gag.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Okay.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000
I had to shorten your answer, Shane, to just Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Okay.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
That's a good answer. I like that. From DDRPC.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.000
I had to go look him up to see what he looked like again just to make sure he was okay.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I'm like, can you even Google that anymore?

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000
No, you can. They have like an archived, the old DDRPC sites archived.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Alright.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
So you can look at it.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Awesome. Awesome.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Alright.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Of course, when you type in Mr. Spanky DDR, the first thing that comes up is the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Yeah, I saw that. I was like, that's not going to help me, I don't think.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
So I had to keep digging.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
That's kind of, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Have we become that meta where like we have become Mr. Spanky?

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Mr. Spanky, you live here now.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Is that what's happened?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Yes.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
The new home of Mr. Spanky.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Alright.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Loki, what is your number one answer?

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I would like to see all the Bimani, or a new Bimani game, like a new Dance Dance Revolution or whatever,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
come to Steam with some sort of like Rock Band Network support.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000
So basically, you know, indie artists can upload their own songs.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
So it's fresh tracks all the time.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
So a new Bimani game comes out on Steam and has the Rock Band Network type of functionality with it.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000
That's, again, a fairly serious answer.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Especially from Loki.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Because they wouldn't have to do anything.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
How is my answer not serious?

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
It's absolutely serious.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Because Mr. Spanky isn't a real person? I don't know.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
I don't think their CEO is either.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
We don't know that.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
We don't know that.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Alright.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Anyhow, it's what one of the employees does on Friday night.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Alright, anyhow, my number one answer is actually kind of similar to what Loki had,

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000
but I think it's different enough to necessitate its own answer.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And it is simply, you know, and I'm surprised you didn't say this, Loki,

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
because it's something you've been begging about for years.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
And that is, just give us the rights to DDR.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Give us the rights to DDR.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
We'll fucking fix it for you.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
We're gonna make the game the fans want.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Just get all those patents, send them our way.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
We'll give Kyle Ward a lot of money to help us out.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
A lot of money that we don't have, but we'll promise him anyway.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
We'll do a Kickstarter.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
That's right, that's fucking right.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
We'll do a Kickstarter.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
There you go.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
To pay that man's salary, and our salary, of course,

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
because, you know, we're gonna make a new DDR game.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
It's gonna be fucking rad.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000
And there you go.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Give us the rights to DDR, my number one answer.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Last but not least, Dark Soccer.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
I just want to point out, you get one more thing to put on this board,

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:12.000
and then that's it.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Every other answer is worthless.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
We're down to these.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Okay.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Twelve answers.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what are you putting on the list?

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Super Konami Fighter.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.000
A fighting game with characters from all of the good franchises.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
You can go back to Goemon.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
You can go back to Adventure Island.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000
You can go to freaking Tokimeki Memorial,

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.000
which was their long-running dating sim series.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
I've got a laserdisc of the anime.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
I get dibs on Pyramid Head.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Okay.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Alright.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Okay.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Alright.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Yeah, you could have the Red Pyramid.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
You could have, you know, even that stupid kid with the,

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.000
you could have the dog from Silent Hill 2.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
He'd just bark at you.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
By the way, when we get the rights to DDR,

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
there's totally going to be a dog ending.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
We also have to have the Silent Hill No Uta.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.000
From the one from 3.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Yeah, it has to have a UFO ending too.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Silent Hill No Uta.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Alright, let's recap the list before the all-important elimination round.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Yes, Bayou Billy will be in it.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Here it is.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
What is the best way that Konami could get this show

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
to talk about nothing but Konami products again?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Konami sponsors us and gives us lots of money

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
if they actually gave a shit about Bomani again.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Take all the pachinko machines out back and shoot them.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Just kidding about PT.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Konami buys all the other publishers.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Put a bullet in the head of Frogger.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Apologize publicly for Beaten Groovy.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Revive the YY series.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Sorry, Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.000
A new Bomani game comes to Steam with Rock Band Network-like support.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Give us the rights to DDR.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000
And Super Konami Fighter.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Some of the answers from our chat room that didn't make the cut for these final 12.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
SJ100Matt says,

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Announce that the Konami board has been eating crayons this whole time

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
supplied by Ken Kutaragi.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
That's a very good answer. I like that.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Let's see.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Stoppy says,

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Konami surrenders on the deck of the USS Missouri.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
VidPower saying,

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Konami needs to use their number 573 in some way, shape, or form again.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.000
That'll be our DDR game. 573rd mix.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
The number of bullets you put in the Frogger's head.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Alright.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
You know what? This is tough.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000
This is really tough because all these answers are good,

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000
but this is fucking science, people.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
So for science, we must eliminate some answers.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Shane, we start with you.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Just because I don't trust them,

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
and I wouldn't believe it's sincere,

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
they can't just apologize and get away with it.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
So is the apologize for beating Groovy?

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I thought they had...

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, apologize for beating Groovy. Sorry.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Because you know what?

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.000
They would say that, but they'd be crossing their fingers

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000
or like snickering behind your back as soon as you turn around

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
because they're like, we totally put that out there

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000
and people paid us like $3 to play it.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
So we made like our entire annual income just then.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Oh, alright.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000
I am kind of mad that that's one of my answers

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
that you just eliminated from the list.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Oh, I'm sure mine will be gone too.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:21.000
However, your rationale actually kind of works,

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.000
and I don't admit that like ever, Shane, ever.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
It's my birthday, and I'm saying something nice about you.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.000
What's up with that?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Alright, it is stricken from the list.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
It's because I got you tacos.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
That's true. You did get me tacos.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Alright, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Let's see here.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I would say taking all the pachinko machines out back

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
and shooting them just because I don't think there's a point to it.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I mean, no one really likes pachinko anyways,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
so no need to kill them.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Boy, you fucking assholes just one-two'd my list right out the door,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000
but there it is.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
That means my final-

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I didn't do anything.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And you agreed with my logic, so-

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.000
My final answer, give us the rights to DDR,

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
now has immunity and cannot be eliminated by myself,

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
which I wouldn't have done it anyway, or Dark Soccer.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I can't touch it.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000
So, my turn to strike something from the list.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I'm going to actually-

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
I believe this answer to be redundant compared to some other answers on the board,

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
so by that logic, I'm going to eliminate if they actually gave a shit about Bomani again

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.000
because by giving a new Bomani game or giving us the rights to DDR,

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
that would be giving a shit about Bomani again.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Technically, they wouldn't be giving a shit, they would just be like,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
here, you give the shit.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
You give the shit because I'm too late.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Well, regardless, my logic made sense in my head,

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
so it is stricken from the list.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Last but not least, Dark Sakura,

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I'm going to take the Frogger one off,

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
because Frogger doesn't deserve to get shot,

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Frogger deserves obscurity.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:00.000
So that all we remember is me playing the original game,

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000
all we remember is me playing the original Frogger on roller skates.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I have very good memories of Frogger.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
All that has happened is the new Frogger comes out from Konami,

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
and it's Frog Fractions 2.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Where is that game? Shouldn't it have been out by now?

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Now that's the logic to keep Frogger around,

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
is that secretly he's the star of Frog Fractions 2.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
It would be Frogger Fractions.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Alright, well there it is, it has been stricken from the list.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Wow, Loki and I got fucked this week, didn't we?

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
But that is the scientific process of listless,

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
and these are the things that happen.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.000
So Dark Sakura and Shane walk away unscathed.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I don't know how that happened, but here it is.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
So here's the list that you can vote on now.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I want to point this out.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com, you click your first answer,

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
then your second answer, then you submit.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
You get to vote for two, and your first answer does get more points.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
So click one, two, and then submit.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.000
So, once again, here are the choices that you have to vote for,

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
the final list of eight.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Konami sponsors us and gives us lots of money.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Konami buys all the other publishers.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Why didn't I eliminate that one?

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
That was the one I was going to eliminate.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Oh well.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000
A new Bomani game comes to Steam with Rock Band Network.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Give us the rights to DDR.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Just kidding about PT.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Revive the YY series and Super Konami Fighter.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:37.000
You can vote now over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
We're tabulating the votes as we speak,

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
and we will get to the answers a little bit later.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
But in the meantime, we're going to do a few more news stories

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
while the voting is open for about five more minutes.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
So let's get back into some news. Loki.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
All right, I touched on this a little bit earlier,

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:57.000
but basically it's a rumor coming out from,

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000
or I should say Digital Foundry has looked at the specs,

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:05.000
basically saying the Neo GPU matches that of the RX 480

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000
from Radeon or ATI.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I don't know if they're Radeon or ATI this week.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
It's hard to follow that.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
But basically it's also worth noting the clock speeds

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:20.000
and the resultant teraflops aside,

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000
the specs for the RX 480 are point-for-point match

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.000
for the GPU in Sony's upcoming PlayStation Neo,

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.000
all but confirming that Sony mid-gen console refresh

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
uses both Polaris technology

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.000
and a new 14-nanometer FinFET chip manufacturing process.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000
So because of this, the theory is that their new console

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
is not going to be super expensive

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
because the chip would have been more affordable.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
So we will see.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
And I think isn't that supposed to be coming out this year,

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
that their refresh is supposed to be sometime around October,

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
so we should hear about that.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I'm guessing maybe in August for the European...

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
The Gamescom?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Gamescom, yeah.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Maybe.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I was going to say, you would think that's the type of thing

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
that Sony holds for their own thing,

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000
but that's not until December, so maybe not.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
But Gamescom, they usually make announcements of stuff.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Maybe they're holding back for that.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000
All right.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Let's head over to...

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
I want to actually check in before I get to this news story.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Shane, are you working on your Pokemon spreadsheet right now?

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I see you like typing and...

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
No.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.000
I am adding more people so I can get more Friends Safaris

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000
because I still have a few spots open on my Friends list,

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
which goes up to 100.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I'm at 80...

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
No, I'm sorry.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
I'm at 90 now.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Are you adding OLR people or is this all Reddit?

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000
This is all Reddit.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
So there's actually a Reddit...

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Specifically dedicated for Friends Safari stuff.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
So there's other sick people like you in the world.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000
It's not sick.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.000
It's beautiful.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
All right.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Let's move on to a story about Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000
And Mass Effect Andromeda apparently going to be kind of moving away

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000
from what we know as the Paragon and Renegade system.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000
You know, if you played the original Mass Effect trilogy,

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
it was usually pretty obvious the choices you were going to make

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000
were either going to be Paragon, which is kind of good guy.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I'm using my quotey fingers.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
And then Renegade, which was kind of bad guy.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Although, some would argue that Renegade is still a good guy.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
However, all that aside, apparently the choices are not going to be

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
so obvious in Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.000
This is according to Mac Walters, who's the game's Creative Director,

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
who's saying in a quote,

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I think in general, with all this sophistication of games

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000
or engaging of any kind of entertainment right now,

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000
gamers are looking for more of those shades of gray.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
And then he went on to talk about how the old system was kind of a part

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
of what made Shepard, Shepard.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And I guess now when we're talking about,

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000
I guess it's going to be Ryder now in the future,

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
saying I think now we're moving away from that.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:01.000
We've been looking for other ways to engage more of those shades of gray,

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:04.000
less about it being obviously being right or wrong,

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000
and more about giving people a sense of choice.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
So that could be very interesting.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Shane, you're a super fan of Mass Effect.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000
What do you think about the fact that Paragon and Renegade,

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000
it's not going to be so obvious and maybe there isn't really a good guy,

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000
bad guy thing going on?

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
In theory, I think that's a good idea.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:26.000
But I was so hardcore Paragon that I don't know how I'm going to adjust

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
because I kind of want the clear-cut path,

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:35.000
and I don't know how my Paragon mind will be able to handle it

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000
if I make a decision that I feel is Paragon,

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
and it ruins things for people.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.000
So good idea. I don't know how it will work out in practice.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Darsakra, what about you?

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:50.000
What is your thoughts on this Paragon-Renegade thing shifting?

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Because I know you're a big Mass Effect-y person too.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I think it'll be cool. I'd like to see how it plays out.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I definitely would like a little bit more of a subtlety to the thing.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I really liked in Inquisition how they worked it in,

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000
that even certain decisions still had some pretty crazy consequences

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
when it came to the final DLC.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I'm not going to spoil. It's already been out forever.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000
So just Iron Bull, I'll leave it at that.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:25.000
But other things, I would love to see a lot more consequences,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:28.000
even for very minor things. So I'm looking forward to it.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:32.000
All right, I'm very curious to see how it plays out as well.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
All right, before we get to our listless results for tonight,

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000
again, the topic which you can vote on now at live.vognetware.com,

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
for those of you listening live.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Ways that Konami could get this show to talk about nothing but Konami products again.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Because you know when this show started 14 years ago,

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000
we were really dedicated to the obsession in our lives at the time,

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
which was DDR, BeatMania.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Not to say that that obsession is gone, because when I went to round one,

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
it was like I'm 20.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
It was in heaven.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Yeah, I'm in my 20s again, having a blast.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
I don't know if you've been over here, but locally,

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:07.000
the drive-in apparently has a lot of Shonnigan's machines.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000
The drive-in?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000
The drive-in, yeah.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Isn't that the guy that had all the stuff at Scandia?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Yeah, he had all the stuff at Scandia.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000
He has his garage and everything, but I think he has his machines over there.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000
So you're saying...

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000
So that would be like a...

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Not to give away my address on the air,

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.000
but not even like a mile from my house is where all this shit is at.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
That would be like a DJ Max Technica and like 2DX?

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I think they've got...

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I know they have a Dance Dance Revolution,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
but I was looking at...

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Well, like a DDRX...

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Shane's like twitching over there.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.000
He's going to use his little iPad Uber thing

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
to look up the phone number to the drive-in

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
and be like, I need you to tell me everything in your arcade right now.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
I just want to go there right now.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Let me just take a look here, because I was browsing,

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:53.000
because I just realized I haven't looked at the buy-sell-trade thing for a while,

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000
because that's where I saw the...

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:58.000
You know, Shane, I have a three-day weekend next weekend

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
with the 4th of July and everything.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Maybe we should go to round one.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I bet my friends in San Jose would like to hang out.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
There's a possibility that I'd be down for that.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Yeah, I'm not positive.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Maybe we could make Jamie come with us somehow.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
You know who would know?

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
They have so many UFO catchers that are amazing.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.000
You know who would know, because he frequents it quite a bit,

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
is Jonas would know what's there.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Where's that guy? I miss that guy.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000
But yeah, he made a comment about passing 17's double in DDRX3 and before,

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
but I don't know.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I think they still have the machines there.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000
That's where he had them at one time.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000
We want to get to some of your feedback,

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000
because we do want to make sure we have time to open up the phone lines.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
A username, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000
They're not open yet.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:48.000
We've got to get through just a few more things, including the mailbag,

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
because every week you guys email us.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails,

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
and Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000
and find some fan mail worthy of reading here right now.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Dark Soccer, what's in the mailbag this week?

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
The first one comes from Robert M.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.000
I could be very wrong, but I'm sure the online Flash escape room games

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
predate the physical escape rooms and serve as their inspiration.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I agree.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.000
I did one of the physical rooms with my brother and his wife

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.000
and a small group of relative strangers last November for my birthday.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000
The biggest obstacle I encountered was said strangers trying combinations on the locks,

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
not lining up the tumblers exactly right,

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:31.000
and throwing out correct solutions as a result.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:35.000
I hope I'm able to rent a session later with just the three of us some time.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000
I'm also really looking forward to episode 100 of Guys on a Show,

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.000
hoping Extrofer is still all right.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Yeah, Extrofer's been sick the past couple weeks.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
That's why that show's been on hold,

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000
but I am trying to get a pretty awesome guest for this coming week,

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
so hopefully we'll be back on that this week.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And last email. Hello, guys.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Martin the Belgian here.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I'm glad that you're specifying that you are the Belgian.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
The. Actually, real quick before we get to the Belgian,

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I just wanted to check in with Shane,

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:08.000
because Shane was the one that brought up all the escape room stuff on last week's show.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.000
So what's the latest on that?

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Why haven't we been to an escape room yet?

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000
It's been like a whole week.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Because I don't know, and I want to go to one so bad.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
One of my local friends posted a picture from an escape room here locally,

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
and I actually asked, like, my friend is obsessed with escape rooms now.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Is this one any good?

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
And he's like, well, it's the only one I've been to, but we had fun.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.000
I still believe that the one in Elk Grove is supposed to be the best in the area.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I still want to go to that one.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
We'll see. We'll see. All right.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Sorry, Dark Soccer. Let's go back to the Belgian.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Congratulations on your 14th birthday.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I've been listening for a good bit of this 14 years,

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:43.000
and I always enjoy your banter to lighten up my day.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
The show really feels like a get-together with friends,

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.000
and we, the listeners, feel like a part of that group of friends, I think.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000
I just had a question for you regarding E3 this year.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
What did you think of the VR games that were shown?

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
I will tell you this, me, I don't really care about VR.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
So that's me.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000
But I want to point out, I think part of what plays into that for you

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.000
is not like that you're just being like, I just hate everything.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
I do hate everything.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000
But you have the whole, like, if you play a first-person shooter, you get motion sick.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Yeah, I get motion sick.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
So you have a lot of concerns about VR.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
And I can't wear my glasses.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Didn't you play that one at GX3?

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I did, and it was okay.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
But I couldn't play it for very, very long.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.000
It was bizarre VR.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.000
When I get my PlayStation VR, though, you will try Rez at least once, right?

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
I'm sure.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000
All right, so the door is open to crack, you guys, just so you know.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I'll try it.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
All right, there you go.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I just can't wear any mascara because it's expensive.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Personally, I was pretty excited for VR,

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
but now that the headsets are actually out,

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000
I have seen very little games that seem worth playing.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.000
I was expecting most publishers at E3 to have a big push for VR,

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
especially Sony with their headset coming later this year,

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
and so the games shown were very underwhelming.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000
It seems like their heart isn't in it.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Whenever a VR game was shown, it was always a VR experience,

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Star Wars, Batman, et cetera,

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
and that didn't seem like a full-fledged title.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
So my feeling is that VR is already on its way out,

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
kind of like 3D TVs came and went.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Nobody I know has it or wants it.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000
It is too expensive, and the games just aren't there.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
What are your thoughts?

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.000
I know Rob preordered a PSVR, but are you still excited for it?

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Yes.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:32.000
I do not like bouncing off the walls.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Here's the thing with VR.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:38.000
It's a lot harder to get hyped for something

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000
that you can't exactly experience through a live stream the same way.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.000
The only way to really get hyped about VR is to get in there and do it.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000
So I understand that I could go to Best Buy and all this stuff

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000
and wait in a line or whatever and all this stuff,

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000
but I kind of, I don't really want to do that.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
I've got other things I've got to do during the day.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.000
I know enough about VR from what I have done

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.000
that I think I will enjoy it.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000
But until I'm really able to play those games myself for the first time,

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I can't truly say I am like jazzed about it, you know?

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000
But I am optimistic, I think would be a good word.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.000
I think that's the word.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I'm optimistic that I'm going to have a really good time with VR

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:24.000
because my experience with VR to this point has been very, very positive.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
You know, Bobby obviously very into VR,

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000
so every year when I go to Atlanta, he shows me whatever toys he's got,

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000
which has always been a way for me to kind of stay on the edge of that.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
And then, you know, that one year we were at E3

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.000
and kind of got to see the PlayStation VR in that very, very first year.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
That was an awesome experience.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
So I'm optimistic about it,

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000
but it's really hard for me to get into the specifics

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000
until I'm really able to get in there and do it for myself.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
And that is a very hard sell at E3,

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.000
and I think that's why you're going to see more and more of this

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
come to the store and play it.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
But that's also hard to do

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
because you don't want people to steal the fucking VR headsets.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Because if people are going to try to steal the Zelda demo at E3,

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
you know people are going to try to steal these headsets

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
before they're even out.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Possibly.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Thanks as always for the show.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.000
If I wasn't so hungover today, I would raise a toast to another 14 years.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Your friend, Martin.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000
You can use sparkling cider,

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000
but thank you very, very, very much for those kind words

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
in the very beginning of the email.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Was that it for emails this week?

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000
That's it.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
All right, that's it.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Let's do the FUs of the week,

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000
and then I want to say this is the absolute last chance

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
to vote in the list list.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.000
The list list will be closing for votes in about one minute.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.000
So in the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:40:00.000
FU to, I guess not being enough over my digestion issues,

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.000
to enjoy delicious cupcakes, because now I hurt like a lot.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Also, FU to people who vote for Trump,

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:18.000
and FU to people who don't use their turn signals in traffic.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000
So yeah, that's it.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Loki, how about you, FUs of the week?

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:28.000
I guess just, I don't know, I don't really have a whole,

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:32.000
FU to not having a lot of time or being tired at night

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000
to both play a lot of games and program and stuff.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I'm really trying.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.000
My body is fighting against me, so it probably doesn't help

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000
that I've been staying up till one in the morning

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
to play the South Park game every day,

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
so that might be a little bit of a contributing factor

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000
when I'm waking up at 5.45.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
All right, Shane, do you have an FU of the week

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.000
you want to get out?

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Several.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.000
FU to vitamin D deficiencies.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Apparently pretty awful now that I'm getting it corrected.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:09.000
FU to having an ulcer so bad I had to get a scope down my throat,

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:15.000
and FU to the yen to dollar conversion now

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.000
makes importing things not as great.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Import stuff from the UK.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Well, no, because...

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000
FU'd all that.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Yeah.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
But now when Pokemon Sun and Moon come out,

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000
those are going to be almost $50 games to import,

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
and I didn't want that.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
I liked it better when it wasn't so terrible.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.000
AkumaJP in chat says, yay for me, though.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.000
We get stuff dirt cheap from our neck of the woods.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
You want us to send you Pop-Tarts?

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
It'd probably cost you a quarter.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Although for AkumaJP, we'd send them for free.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000
All right, my FU of the week.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000
I don't really have a lot.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
So my FU of the week goes to, oh, my God,

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I've been binge eating way too much this weekend,

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
and Dark Sakura's cupcakes haven't helped.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
However, it is my birthday.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
How did that cookie cupcake not help?

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Because of that frosting in the middle was amazing.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Yeah, and the peanut butter one was really fucking good, too,

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.000
and I still kind of want to try one of the lemonade ones.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
But, oh, my God, I need to stop eating,

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.000
and then I sit here and go, why am I so pudgy?

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
It's because I can't stop eating.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
I want to blame Dark Sakura, but I can't.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000
I mean, it is my birthday.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
I get to be a fatty if I want.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Right, Dark Sakura?

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Yeah.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000
That's right. All right.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Have more.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
There's exactly four cupcakes left.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Have more.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000
All right.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Are we ready to hear tonight's listless results?

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Yars.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Here we go.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Tonight's listless results.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Again, the topic this week,

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.000
what is the best way that Konami could get this show

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000
to talk about nothing but Konami products again?

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.000
I got to say, it's interesting,

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:01.000
because the last time we did this,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
we had a hell of a tie as well,

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000
and this week we have a three-way tie

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
for the number one answer.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
It's a three-way tie for the number one answer,

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
and it's just the points worked out that way.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Even though several people voted,

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
that's just the way the points worked out.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.000
So we'll do a runner-up answer tonight

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
and then the three-way tie for number one.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.000
So the runner-up tonight for how can Konami get us

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
to talk about Konami again,

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Super Konami Fighter will be the way to do it.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
What about PBS Cross Konami?

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.000
All right, I'll let it go.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.000
I'll let it go.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
All right, Super Konami Fighter.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000
There it is.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Runner-up tonight.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
And then the three-way tie tonight is?

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000
What?

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Three-way tie for number one.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Give us the rights to DDR.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Woo.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Yeah.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000
I agree with that.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Let's do that.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000
A new Bimani game comes to Steam with Rock Band Network.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
I'd take that as well.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Those answers are kind of close,

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
because if we did DDR, that's what we'd do.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Right, Loki?

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Yeah, probably.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Right, Daisakura?

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Steam support?

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Hell yeah.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Max 2, just because?

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Totes.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.000
All right.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000
And last but not least, tied for number one tonight,

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Mr. Spanky becomes CEO.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
I knew that would be up there.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
There it is.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Your list list tonight, the definitive list.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:30.000
That's easily four ways right there that could earn our love all over again.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Get on it.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Thanks for participating with that tonight, everybody.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.000
I wonder how much money it would take to get those rights from them.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000
A lot.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Yeah, I don't think they'll part with any of their IPs,

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.000
even though they're not using them anymore except for pachinko machines.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
When it's kind of all you got.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.000
So does this mean Konami is basically going to turn into a patent troll?

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Well, here's the thing.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:55.000
The Bimani games in the arcade are still going,

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
so they wouldn't give up DDR.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Well, here's the thing about those patents, though.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Their patents are going to be up in a couple years anyways,

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.000
because they patent all that stuff back in the 90s,

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.000
and it's only good for, like, 20 years.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:17.000
So all those stupid things that they have on, like, patent for lining up arrow,

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:21.000
the beat, like any sort of rhythm game type of patents,

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.000
those will be expired.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Hopefully.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
So we just have to wait.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:33.000
All right, just a couple more stories, then we're going to get to the phone lines.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.000
But first, Loki.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
So this is kind of neat.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:46.000
RZA, who's a hip-hop artist, is actually making a new album based off of Atari game music.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I'm not sure what that would sound like.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I guess using those as, it almost sounds like almost like a Megaran thing,

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:58.000
where you have the game music and then you kind of rap over it or something.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Cool.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:05.000
They're going to have some songs based off of Asteroids, Centipede, Pong, and others.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:11.000
And I guess he actually worked on, or he did some voiceover stuff for Getting Up,

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Contents Under Pressure, that Mark Echo game that came out that Atari published.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Neat.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
I'm kind of curious to see what that sounds like.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Yeah, it's nice to see Atari in the news again.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Well, that and, like, you know, was it the new album Turbografx-16 or something like that,

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
that they're supposed to be making?

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:36.000
The Kanye West thing, but I don't think it was supposed to be public.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
I mean, it was a title only type of thing.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
I don't think it ever really happened.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.000
I think it's just one of those, like, Kanye got on Twitter when he was drunk and started typing things,

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
and he didn't really mean it.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000
But I will say, have you heard about his latest video?

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.000
He did a video for that song Famous where he talks about how he made Taylor Swift famous and all this stuff.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And, like, all the video is are these wax figures of naked celebrities in bed together.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.000
And so, but they're celebrities like Donald Trump, but they're fully naked, like Donald Trump.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Caitlyn Jenner.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:15.000
And Caitlyn Jenner, Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, like, all these random people and Kanye West in bed together.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:20.000
And I'm just like, like, every time Kanye West does something, like a video or something,

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.000
and Dark Soccer could appreciate this, my reaction to this video, my reaction to everything Kanye West does,

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
this bitch.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Right, Dark Soccer?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Kanye West, this bitch.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Well, he is a bitch.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.000
So they had, did they have his full wax statue in bed with, like, a fish or something like that?

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:44.000
No, no, not with these other celebrities, with Taylor Swift.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.000
But there's no such of a, no sort of aquatic life in bed with him as well?

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:53.000
No, unless they were all merpeople, which is very possible, and you couldn't, because of the blanket, you couldn't see.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Because the rumor is that he is a gay fish.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Yeah, I, you've been playing too much of that goddamn South Park game.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Alright.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:10.000
No, it's actually, what was it, they have, there's a gag in there, remember from the, the episode, what was it, where Tom Cruise wasn't coming out of the closet?

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:16.000
So, actually, you can go up into, you know, the kid's closet, and you knock on the door or whatever, he's like, I'm not coming out!

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
That's funny.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Ah, boy. Alright.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Hey, something not on the Steam sale to close our news this week.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000
This is not on sale as part of the Steam sale, but some folks spending money on this anyway.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.000
It's from a game called Haydenlands.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:39.000
It's an interactive fiction game, it's kind of like the old school adventure game type of thing, like Zork or something like that, those old adventure games.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:46.000
There's no graphics you type your commands in, so like when I say Zork, I mean old school adventure games.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Well, there is no hints or a walkthrough with the game, but for £27 DLC, you can actually get a certificate, it's a PDF certificate, that says,

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:12.000
You, the player, promise to finish the game without looking at any hints or a walkthrough on the Steam forums or anywhere else on the internet.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:18.000
That's it. You're buying a £27 PDF file.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:22.000
You can sign it, hang it on the wall, that's it.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
And no one will give a shit.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Now, this is interesting though, because when you actually start to read, because the developer actually did an FAQ on it, and so he actually answered some questions.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Yes, you get the certificate in PDF format, and what the heck, I'll throw in a JPEG too.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
It's just a certificate.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Here's the thing, and then somebody says, I don't need to buy the certificate, I can just make that promise for free, and the developer responds, absolutely.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:52.000
But it might be easier to stick to that promise once you've laid down some cash on it.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Just a thought, it's up to you.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:01.000
So it's kind of one of those psychological things where it's like, well if you pay this kind of money for it, you're actually going to stick to it.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Kind of interesting, but he actually went out and said, some folks were commenting, of course as people do on Steam, and the developer actually said,

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:18.000
thanks, I was hoping that people would be amused, and I hope some people will put down money for it of course, but it's not a requirement.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:26.000
So some people actually seeing the potential hidden genius in this, but it just also goes to show, if you don't like something, don't fucking buy it.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:33.000
But if this guy can even sell one PDF file, it's probably worth the time you put into making it.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Very interesting, needless to say.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Oh my gosh, you know my friend Safari Reddit I'm on?

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Yeah.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Just got my good friend Danny to get on it now too, and he's super pumped to do all this like I was.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.000
It's contagious, your nerdy is contagious.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Well no, cause he is just as big-

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000
It's also this stupid power of persuasion thing you have.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Well, he also is a huge fan of Pokemon, when X and Y came out, we literally spent the night at Walmart, cause they were the only people selling it at midnight,

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:13.000
and then we went back to his place while his wife was sleeping, and just stayed up until 9 the next morning playing X and Y, because that's what we do.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Why are you going on Reddit anyway? Don't you know what they say?

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:22.000
We're goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit, never goin' Reddit.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Cause that song's not taking into account this Pokemon friend Safari sub.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:34.000
We're gonna go to the phones, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, let's get to it.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:38.000
The phone's already ringing, people know. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Hey, this is Bobby, I haven't talked to you enough tonight.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Hey, Bobby, well, you know, it's not often enough we have you on this side of things.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Like, you know, we get on your show, you're very good to have us on your show, really, pretty much every week.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:54.000
But, you know, you're usually not up late enough to be on our show, just kidding.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
What's on your mind?

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:01.000
So, well, A, never go on Reddit. Just wanted to pass that out there.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:07.000
So, no, I actually, because you had the emailer that was talking about VR and how it's already on the way out.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:16.000
And I know, I've been around in the VR development community since it reemerged about three years ago.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:26.000
And I wanted to point out, basically, my advice to him, if he cares about my advice, is that wait another year or two.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:33.000
The problem is, nobody seriously took VR, like, nobody took VR seriously until Facebook bought Oculus.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:41.000
And it takes years to create a full-fledged $60 AAA game, period.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:48.000
And so, no company was willing to put that kind of effort into something until about two years ago.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:56.000
And so, it's going to be another couple years before we get those AAA full-length titles that aren't, quote-unquote, experiences.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:02.000
So, it's not that they're not taking it seriously. They're taking it very seriously, and it's just been too quick.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:10.000
You can kind of see where gamers kind of jump to these conclusions about a lot of hardware, though, right?

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Like, after the Wii kind of died and the Kinect kind of fizzled out.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:20.000
You can kind of see where gamers, like, feel like they already see the end coming, right?

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Right. Oh, yeah. But, I mean, what I see, what I've seen and how far we've come development-wise in the past three years,

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I see it getting better. And it's just, right now, like, when I saw the prices for the current PC hardware,

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I said, this is not going to be the year that everybody figures out if they want VR or not.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:46.000
We're still another year or two away before we actually see if a, quote-unquote, killer app comes out.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Because that doesn't exist. Our Wii Sports does not exist yet.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:56.000
You do make a very, very, very good point, though, about the whole fact that, you know, when Facebook kind of came on board,

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:05.000
the game changed a little bit because I think it also shows, and this is very important, is that VR can exist for things that aren't just games.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000
And you really, I mean, there's a lot that's not just games that happens on VR.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:17.000
And you even see some of this integration already happening on Facebook with the whole fact that you can look at the 360-degree experiences on your desktop.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Well, you know all that crap's going to be in the VR, too.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:32.000
And so, it's really just a matter of time before people are broadcasting concerts and stuff and all these events and places to be through their Facebook feeds to your Oculus.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Well, and the thing is, like, even if VR gaming doesn't pan out, which I don't think that's, you know, I think it's going to pan out. I think it's going to be great.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:48.000
The thing is, VR has finally gotten affordable enough. It's not going away specifically because of what you just said.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Because there are other uses of VR in, you know, business applications, you know, real estate developers.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Or even, like, architects would actually build a 3D model and walk around it in VR and see what they're doing.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I actually have some friends that, I work with a company here in Atlanta called ATLVR.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.000
I've actually, like, broadcast from their meetup events, and I work with them throughout the year to do other meetup events.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:23.000
And one of the things they've done is they took Gear VRs to a local VA hospital, and they had a 360-degree video of a church service.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:32.000
And these are people that have not been able to leave the hospital. They have not been able to go to church, to one of these church services for the past however many years.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:40.000
And they actually put them in this 360-degree video, in their wheelchairs or whatever, into this church service, and there were actual tears.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:51.000
That is never going away. That is not the fate of 3D TV. So even if we don't play games with it, VR is not going away anymore.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:57.000
I think that story is exactly how you tell somebody in two minutes how VR is here to stay. It really is.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:02.000
That's what I'm here for. Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:09.000
Thank you very much, Bobby. Appreciate it. And thank you, God, you've been such a support over the show for well over ten years now.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:16.000
And again, I don't know if people realize, we probably still wouldn't be a live radio show if it wasn't for you.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Well, I was a big fan right before I started and continue to be a big fan.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Stoppy asked in chat, am I going to cry when I experience VR porn? The problem there is that they haven't figured out the perspective, so all the women are giant.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Yeah, all the VR porn I've seen is kind of all the... are they going to be able to get past the whole fact that you're the person sitting on the couch and the other person is doing all the work? They're not really going to be able to get past that, right?

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:54.000
I'm sure that there are going to be USB devices that'll help. But I don't know if they're there yet.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Bobby doesn't want to have this conversation, you guys.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:06.000
They've already got that stuff. It's out there. Of course it is. I think they probably had the USB devices before they had the actual VR stuff.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:13.000
They do, and here's the thing. How about this? I'll tell you a little bit about Bobby's past here exclusively on the show.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:25.000
My father was also a software developer. It's where I got a lot of the stuff and a lot of my genes and why I wanted to be a software developer and actually a game programmer when I grew up.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:34.000
That didn't happen, but I became a software developer. But he worked with probably the largest adult BBS SysOp in the Atlanta area in the 80s.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:44.000
He actually did work on some of the early webcam stuff for some of the adult entertainment venues here in the Atlanta area with this other person.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:52.000
This other person is still in the adult entertainment industry literally doing those USB devices and syncing them up with videos.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:58:00.000
He's been doing that for many years. It is so funny every time you post a picture up on Facebook of him in the big fur coat with these young women.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:09.000
He's this old dude now because he was my dad's age. I do know a little more than I probably should.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Are you saying that porn is in your blood?

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:16.000
It is.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:25.000
That's why we keep you around, Bobby Blackwell. Thank you so much for your support over the years. I appreciate you being here to set us on the right path when it comes to VR.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Thank you for having me.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
You're welcome. Take care, buddy.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Take care. Bye bye.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:35.000
1877 Game OLR is the phone number or you can call us on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Oh my God. The anniversary show. It's lighting up tonight.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Hey, hey everyone. It's Rama.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Hey, Rama. How you doing, buddy?

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Good, good, good. Do you see me pretty good?

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:52.000
I do. I can see you're wearing your VOG shirt tonight, actually. I see that. You look lovely.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Thank you. It's a special occasion. You'll have to have the matching hat as well.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Oh my God, that's cute. He's got kitty ears, if you guys can't tell.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.000
That's the best.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:10.000
And there's actually, I love this, you may not even realize this, but behind Rama, there's a shirt hanging on the closet door that's actually a Rama shirt.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
It's appropriate.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:16.000
It's the characters from the game Rama One Half Hard Battle.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Nice. Love it. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Well, it's been 14 years, right?

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Way too fucking long, right?

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Well, I think you motherfuckers need a drink.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:49.000
And I didn't forget about Shane, so I have here tequila, rum, vodka.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
I love vodka.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:57.000
And the official alcoholic beverage of VOG and OLR, thanks to Brad.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Fireball! Ah, yes. Yes.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Yes.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Gotta love Brad from Pod Culture for that.

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Where's the Kraken?

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:13.000
Wait a minute, you said there was something for Shane. Where's your white wine? Because he only drinks Real Housewives of Blank County wine.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Well, he is going to have to ask Mako-chan to do that because she handles the wine and the Kraken is still in the fridge.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Kraken is the best stuff ever. It makes every soda taste like cookies.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
I can just drink water. I'm good.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Shane, I have a bottle of the Shenine at my house, I think.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.000
I still have not finished mine yet.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:36.000
You know, with the three-day weekend next weekend, I think we need to have like a late party. We need to go to round one.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:37.000
Who has a three-day weekend?

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Yeah, who are these people that get three-day weekends?

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Oh, sorry about it. Sorry about your lives.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Wait, we do have to work out.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.000
Well, if he was talking, I wouldn't have gotten the Kraken.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Ah, yes. Release the Kraken. So, here he is. He's opening the bottle, pouring himself. A little shot. Did you actually mix that with the Fireball?

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:58.000
He might have.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:03.000
I'm doing a shot for each one for each of you. That's what I'm going to do.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:08.000
I love it.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:16.000
I think the conversion, since you don't have wine, would be four shots for my one wine glass that I would have.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Oh, Rama just took a shot. That was the Fireball he just took, right?

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
That was the Kraken.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Oh, that was the Kraken. Sorry.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:23.000
It was for Jamie.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Oh, the Kraken's amazing.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Now is the tequila. This is for Loki.

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:34.000
There it is.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:45.000
We are watching. I know this isn't the most exciting radio thing, but I do want to point out he is on video and he really is taking these shots live.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Next up.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:48.000
Next up.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:53.000
SSG100Matt says, good thing you didn't do a shot for each year. The show has been around. Could be done.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Don't test me. I'll do it.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Do not test me.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:06.000
We do have staffers here at Anime Jam Session that can do shots of tequila from start to finish and still stand there.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:07.000
Wow.

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Yes.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.000
Not me. I have zero alcohol tolerance. You give me one of those shots and I'm going to get silly.

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Rob turns bright red and glows in the dark.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:20.000
I guess it's a good thing you didn't come into town for Pride yesterday. All the alcohol.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Oh, yeah. Pride's always on my birthday. Pride always ruins my birthday.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:26.000
There it is. Another shot. What was that? Was that the rum?

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:27.000
That was the vodka.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.000
Vodka. I like vodka.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.000
And now here is the whiskey.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
And the last shot glass.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
He's pouring the whiskey. Oh, you're almost out.

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.000
Oh, Rama. You're finishing it off.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:54.000
Well, I save these for special occasions because when we party in the rooms at conventions, I do take the booze home.

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:55.000
I mean.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
As any smart person should.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.000
There are some articles we cover on Anime Jam Session that make me want to get up and drink.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Even though this is not full, I will continue with the tradition.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Here's to you. Here's to me. The best of friends will ever be. If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you. And here's to me.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:16.000
Amen.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
Four shots. Rama just did back to back.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
I still like the other one.

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Huh.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Here's to us. Who's like us? Damn few. And they're all dead.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
I have to remember that one.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.000
I think it actually got re-quoted in Mass Effect 3 at some point.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:43.000
We just used to end. We actually used to end our D&D sessions with that as a toast, followed by Have Fun Storm in the Castle.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.000
That's funny.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:57.000
Well, Rama, you have been a huge, huge, huge support of our show over the years. I don't know where we'd be without you. You were the one that got Reggie Fils-Aime on this show, even if it was for 30 seconds.

03:03:58.000 --> 03:03:59.000
I tried, but like I said.

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:00.000
But it was exclusive.

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:10.000
If it wasn't for all of you, I wouldn't be doing this podcasting. I don't know. I would probably still be going to conventions, taking pictures or something. I probably wouldn't be expanding.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:18.000
So, you know, you and Travis kind of gave me another outlook for conventions to do more things and have more fun.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Well, that is the highest honor we could get because you guys have accomplished so much over there with Anime Jam Session and kind of doing your thing there on the anime scene.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:36.000
They know Rama at conventions. They do. He famous. They don't know me at PAX, but they know him at anime cons.

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:42.000
Well, yeah, you know. Are you trying to make me blush, Mr. Rob Roberts?

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.000
I wouldn't be able to tell if you were.

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:51.000
That's racist. But it's okay because I'm not offended.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:55.000
Oh my god, you can already tell the liquor's starting to hit him. I love it.

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:58.000
Rob is an old man now, so racism kind of just creeps in.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
I'm not grandpa. I'm not grandpa.

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:08.000
You have to understand, I was with a friend today. We went to Pride and we was at the parade for almost five hours.

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:19.000
And, you know, I couldn't go by myself without, you know, a canister with some alcoholic beverage with me so I can, you know, myself.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:29.000
And I did not realize how long the parade is because normally after about two or three hours, we go to a bar in downtown Manhattan and just kind of unwind, but five hours. Wow.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
The dikes on bikes alone take like 90 minutes.

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:39.000
He didn't even see them. I didn't think they were at the front or at the end. I was like, uhhhh.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:44.000
I don't think you'll ever see more boobs in your life than the dikes on bikes. You gotta get out there.

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:48.000
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go so we can try to squeeze in a couple more collars before we're done for the night.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:50.000
But thank you.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Rob, one more thing before I get out of here.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Stay fabulous, darling.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:06:00.000
I will. And of course, Rama, you know I say this from the bottom of my heart, with love, stay black.

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:02.000
Alright, you got it.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:04.000
Alright. Take care, my friend.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.000
You too.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:11.000
Alright, bye. I'm just waiting for the angry email that comes into the show. You guys are fucking racist.

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:15.000
You have to understand, that is an inside joke that dates back a long time.

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:17.000
It's Dan's fault.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:19.000
It is Dan's fault.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:21.000
It is my husband's fault.

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:23.000
Alright, but we got another call coming in because the calls are coming back to back tonight.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:25.000
Everything is my husband's fault.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:27.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:29.000
Hey, this is MXC in the chat room or Marcus.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:33.000
Well, hey, good to hear from you. I don't think you call in very often, do you?

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:35.000
Yeah, never.

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:37.000
Oh, first timer.

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:39.000
Yep.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Thank you for sacrificing your phone call virginity to us.

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:44.000
That's right.

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Well, I wanted to call in and say congrats on your 14th anniversary, guys. It's pretty intense.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Thank you.

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:57.000
And I thought this was a funny coincidence. I started listening to your show when I was 14.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Oh, fuck. Here we go.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:02.000
How old are you now?

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:04.000
26.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Oh my god.

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
Oh, you sweet summer child.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:10.000
I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Someone had to.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Oh, that was, so you might, I'm going to guess at 14 and you were listening to this show.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
If you've been listening, that's still, that's still a while to be listening to the show.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:20.000
You must have been a big DDR player back in the day.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:22.000
Absolutely.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:24.000
That's where I found the show.

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.000
That's where it is. My signature on DDR Freak or something.

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:28.000
Yeah.

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:30.000
Love it.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:32.000
DDR Freak, man. Making signatures was my freaking hobby.

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Yeah, you still...

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:35.000
You still talk about icons on LiveJournal.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:37.000
Yeah.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:45.000
You know, I still have my LiveJournal with my icons from maybe about five years ago, six years ago, last time I used it.

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:50.000
ActDeftInChat says, I was 24 when I started listening. LOL.

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Me too. I was 24 when the show started.

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:59.000
So, actually, no, I was 23 for the very first episode because it was three days before my 24th birthday.

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:01.000
So...

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:04.000
Yeah, I was, I was still in my twenties.

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:06.000
Yeah. And then, so...

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:08.000
I know. Here we are.

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:10.000
I'm sorry, guys.

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:12.000
No, it's all right. It's all right.

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:14.000
That's okay. I got carded the other day, so I'm happy.

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
Well, thank you for being around still all these years. That's, that's amazing.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
Especially considering, you know, we've kind of drifted away from the music game stuff a little bit.

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:25.000
That's awesome that, you know, um, a lot of folks have still stuck with us. I really appreciate that.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Yeah, it's just a lot of fun each week, you know, hear you guys chatting about, well, video games and food a lot.

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:34.000
But it's also pretty fun.

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:36.000
You want a cupcake? Come get it.

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
We have some raspberry lemon ones that are pretty good.

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Oh, that sounds delicious.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:43.000
All right. Oh, well.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:47.000
A little bit of a distance. Well, um, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:55.000
Um, I mean, I don't know. Are you guys, I know you've been to GamerX and MagFest. Any plans for conventions?

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:57.000
I know you're going also to Final Fantasy FanFest.

03:08:58.000 --> 03:08:59.000
GamerX is coming up in September.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:03.000
Yeah, I feel like there's like way small time.

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:10.000
But I guess because GamerX was in December last year, it is actually shorter this year because they're bumping it back up to the fall.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:17.000
So, yeah, Vaga Network is actually sponsoring GamerX again. So, Dark Soccer and I at least for sure will be there.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:21.000
I don't know about Shane. I know Loki usually can't do the con thing because of family.

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:23.000
Is Shane doing GamerX?

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:29.000
I don't know. Maybe. It just, I mean, depends on when it is.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
It's the last weekend of September leading in October.

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:34.000
Shane, do you need to do a Blue Ranger costume?

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:38.000
Um, I wouldn't know which Blue Ranger to go as.

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
I don't think I want Shane wearing spandex.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.000
You should do Mega Blue.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:47.000
No, if I was going to wear something, it was going to be Gundam from Danganronpa.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:49.000
Oh, you should totally do that.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:54.000
But I don't think, I don't know if I'm going to go, so I'm a TBA.

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
I'll help you make the costume though. That would be awesome.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
I know Shane's doing Power Morph Cons.

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:02.000
Power Morph Con and Pokemon Worlds.

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:04.000
Shane, I will make you the hamsters.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:06.000
I want real hamsters.

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:10.000
My convention calendar for the rest of this year, I'm doing Dragon Con absolutely for sure.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:14.000
That is a given. And then of course Fan Fest is booked and stamped and ready to go.

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
And I will do GamerX as well since VOG Network is sponsoring that.

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:21.000
That's three cons for the rest of the year. That's pretty much going to fill up my year.

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:25.000
And then I am looking at MAG Fest for next year as well. I had such a great time this year.

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:29.000
I can't see how MAG Fest is not going to be a regular thing moving forward.

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:33.000
Awesome. Yeah, I definitely want to go to MAG Fest again.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
That's like insanely good.

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Yeah, and I feel like it's just going to get better. I want to do a panel at MAG Fest this year though now.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
Now that I've kind of had a taste of it, it's like I want more.

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:44.000
It'll be a lot of fun.

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:49.000
Alright, well thank you so much for calling into the show. I really appreciate it.

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000
And please come up and say hello if we end up at one of these cons.

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:54.000
Yeah, I definitely will.

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:56.000
Alright, awesome. Thank you so much for listening.

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:58.000
Hey, thanks for the show.

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:00.000
Take care. Thanks for being here.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.000
Bye.

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:07.000
I know MAG Fest wasn't in January. That's kind of where I'm at as well because it's like, ugh.

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
I don't want to get snowed in.

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
Alright, we'll try to squeeze in one more call here.

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:18.000
The phones are on fire tonight, you guys. I'm really sorry. I'm not going to be able to get to everybody because it's already 9.30.

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:20.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:22.000
Hey, it's Sturlock.

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:24.000
Hey, Sturlock, buddy. What's on your mind tonight?

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.000
Not too much. Just wanted to call and wish you guys a happy birthday and you as well, Rob.

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Thank you. I really appreciate that. Thanks for your support over the years. I know you've been listening for a few years.

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:37.000
I've been listening for about half the show's life now, I guess.

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:41.000
A pretty freaking impressive amount of dedication. I really appreciate that.

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:43.000
2007, I think.

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:45.000
Wow, and here you are.

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:47.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:57.000
Oh, not a whole lot. I'm both kind of excited and sad about Pokemon Sun and Moon.

03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:00.000
You were talking about this a little bit in chat, and I think Shane should hear this.

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:05.000
He said he's excited.

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.000
No, I heard.

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:09.000
Alright, Shane would like you to explain yourself.

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:11.000
Yes, please.

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:19.000
I've been playing, for people who don't know, but I think most people know at this point, I'm a blind gamer.

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:29.000
Blind since birth. I've been playing games with varying degrees of success, pretty much forever.

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:36.000
And I've actually been playing Pokemon since Red, Blue, and Yellow.

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:44.000
And one thing that really makes Pokemon playable, one is its awesome sound design.

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:49.000
And the other thing is the grid-based movement.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:55.000
And it seems with Sun and Moon, they're probably ditching the grid.

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:57.000
Yes, I can see that.

03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:08.000
I'm holding out hope that it works like sixth gen, where you can still use the grid if you use the G-pad, but I have my doubts, but yeah.

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:14.000
What about the grid makes it…

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:20.000
Because everything is relative. Nothing changes as you're moving.

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:29.000
You know how unlike a lot of 3D-based games, you're not really moving in straight lines.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:34.000
You're constantly having to fiddle with the camera to keep going in a straight line.

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:47.000
If you're not messing with the camera at all, it's changing constantly, so you're not moving relatively.

03:13:48.000 --> 03:14:01.000
If you move up and then you move back down, because everything's on an angle, you're not going to move the exact opposite direction.

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:14.000
And that's why the grid is so nice. Everything is just relative. North is always north, south is always south, that kind of thing.

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:18.000
And everything being tile-based.

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:29.000
That is kind of unfortunate, but at the same time I realize that this series has to change.

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:45.000
I kind of look at it as like, you know what, I have the old games and I still enjoy the hell out of the old games, and I'll just watch playthroughs of the new stuff.

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:54.000
I think it's reasonable to hold out hope, though. Prepare for the worst, but hopefully you'll still get the best.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:07.000
The idea that the D-Pad can still work will hopefully pan out, because they probably don't focus on that type of stuff in the big showy trailers and the stuff they're really trying to show.

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:18.000
Especially if they're trying to express freedom in Pokemon games, they're not going to really focus on that. But I really hope Nintendo doesn't leave people behind as they grow, so to speak.

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:36.000
Yeah, and it's just like, the way the games were designed in the past, it's almost like, I don't know, it's almost like, I know this isn't the case, but it's almost as if they almost knew that blind people were playing these games.

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:42.000
Just by the way they designed things and the way the sound design works.

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:46.000
You played Gen 6 then, right?

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.000
Yeah.

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
So what about the gym where you're on roller skates?

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000
That was a lot of trial and error.

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
That was a lot of...

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:06.000
Because with that, that still kind of worked if you...

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:20.000
But you had to be very careful to make sure that you weren't going up or down as you were, you know what I mean, like you were moving in straight lines basically with the circle pad.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:27.000
So it was a lot of trial and error, that gym is kind of a giant pain.

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:30.000
Lumio City is another...

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:32.000
What's that?

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000
It's a giant pain in general, just so you know.

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:41.000
Oh, Lumio City, I've heard people that are sighted even hate that place.

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:43.000
Yeah, that's pretty terrible too.

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:49.000
That one I literally had to have someone, just because of like...

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:57.000
Literally the perspective is so different in that place that conventional movement is impossible.

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:06.000
So I literally had to have someone sighted write literal step-by-step directions through that fucking place.

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:10.000
So I could get through the parts where it was required.

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:19.000
Well, my fingers crossed for you, my friend, that Nintendo is able to make the games accessible.

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:27.000
And I think you've always been a really good reminder when you call into the show, giving us your perspective, that games need to be accessible.

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:32.000
And that way everybody who is a fan of games can really enjoy them, and accessibility is really, really important.

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:36.000
So hopefully Nintendo will get you back one way or the other.

03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:42.000
Yeah, definitely. Also, Jamie, you're gonna have...

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:48.000
Yeah, thanks for getting Mind Paradise stuck in my head now. I'm gonna be listening to that thing on repeat.

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000
It is seriously one of the best songs.

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:53.000
It's great.

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:59.000
We were just sitting here in the studio during the break talking about how that Dance Maniacs game had really, really had some of the best songs with it. It was amazing.

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:08.000
I didn't realize that Cat's Eye was from... because you guys have played that many times over the years in breaks.

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:10.000
Cat's Eye also made it into 4th Mix.

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:16.000
Yeah, it was also in 4th Mix Plus, I think. So it was a Bamani song that was in multiple games.

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
It gets played twice as much.

03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:21.000
That's good stuff.

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:24.000
Well, my friend, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up tonight's show, but thanks so much for the call. I really appreciate it.

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:28.000
Yeah, no problem. Happy birthday to, like I said, to you and the show.

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000
Thank you very much. Appreciate it, buddy. Take care. Have a great week.

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.000
Thank you.

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:39.000
Alright, thank you to those that called in tonight. I'm very sorry to those that didn't get through. It was ringing off the hook tonight.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:46.000
Please consider sending an email. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send an email. Make Dark Sakura work next week.

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:50.000
That is gonna do it, however, though, for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:55.000
Before we roll the credits, I wanna make sure we check in for any last minute stories with Loki. I don't know if we have anything here.

03:18:56.000 --> 03:19:06.000
Yeah, I was just gonna mention that the Dolphin emulator has reached 5.0 and there's been a ton of updates done to it where a lot of games will run much better and all that sort of thing.

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:14.000
So, if you wanna check it out, I wanna say it's at, I think, Dolphin-EMU.org. Let's go check it out.

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:19.000
I'm actually thinking about downloading it because I, I don't know, the fuck of it.

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:21.000
Awesome.

03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:23.000
That's it.

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:31.000
Alright. Well, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and supporting it for the past 14 years.

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:37.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, as we always say every week, tell a friend or two or 15 about the show.

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:44.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can only put those voices out there if they show up.

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:51.000
Word of mouth is really all we've had. We don't have a million dollar website backing us up. We don't have celebrity power or any of that stuff.

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:57.000
So, word of mouth is really what we got and thank you guys so much. You guys have some very kind things and stay in chat there.

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:04.000
SG100Matt saying thank you guys and Gal for all your hard work over these 14 years. Thank you guys for showing up every week and giving us a reason to do it.

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:08.000
ActDef saying thanks to you guys. Keep doing such great work. Thank you.

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:15.000
RobertM saying anyone in the audience gotten Drawful 2. I fucking forgot that came out this week. I gotta, did you know that?

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:17.000
That Drawful 2 came out?

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:28.000
Yeah, but I feel like I haven't played enough Drawful to really care about Drawful 2. I would like some more Quiplash and some more Bomb Corp.

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:30.000
Well, they have a Party Pack 3 coming so.

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:32.000
Yeah, by doubt there's a new Bomb Corp in it.

03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:36.000
But I bet a new You Don't Know Jack is in it. I'm hoping. I'm hoping.

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:38.000
More Bomb Corp. So good.

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:45.000
Alright, we'll see. We'll see. Alright, that is gonna do it for our show this week. We do have to go around of course and get everybody's final thought.

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:48.000
Hey Shane, thanks for being here and spending the special show with us.

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:50.000
You're welcome.

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000
Appreciate it. Have fun with Pokemon. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:20:54.000 --> 03:21:03.000
No, if you like Power Rangers, please listen to my show and my pending Pokemon thing that I'm beginning to start working on kind of.

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:11.000
Alright, good luck with that. My final thought, I'll go first. My final thought tonight is, you know, I was really stressed about this weekend.

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:18.000
Not really with this show alone, but it was just kind of like this in addition to Rocky last night, in addition to other stuff I had going on yesterday.

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:23.000
I was like, oh my God, I had so much stress this weekend. But this weekend actually was pretty rad.

03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:28.000
So I'm actually kind of like, oh, I'm sad. I have to go back to the real world and work tomorrow and all that.

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:35.000
But, oh well, got to pay the bills. And I have 4th of July next week to look forward to, so that'll be a thing.

03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:37.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:44.000
So as I mentioned last week, I'm supposed to be driving a Lamborghini in a racetrack on Saturday.

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:52.000
So if it's anything like I drive in Forza Horizon, this may be the last show that I'm alive on. So it's been nice knowing you.

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:57.000
You'll be fine. Let us know how that goes though. I hope there's some video or something.

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:00.000
Yeah, I don't have any GoPro cameras or anything to take. That'd be awesome.

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:02.000
You need to find one, borrow one.

03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:06.000
And last but certainly never least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:12.000
Reject false icons. Also, Taco.

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:19.000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back next week for even more.

03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:25.000
As was said in a comment earlier, as the road to the OLR quiceniera begins.

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:29.000
Have a wonderful week everybody. Happy gaming. We'll see you next time.
