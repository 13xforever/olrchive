Tonight, the least surprising intro you hear all year, E3 is here, and by some accounts, it's already begun. One keynote is already complete and there's six more to go. Join us as the news continues to be made even in the middle of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 645 for this June the 12th of 2016.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It is E3 week and we are going to get into things here pretty shortly. Of course, we are the show about all things gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle and all that, live at the Voice Geeks Network, vog and network.com.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie. Joining me by my side, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello, hello.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hi.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And also over there, Techmaster Loki.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright, we are going to get into E3 here shortly, but I really need to say something here at the top of the show. And it isn't quite gaming related, but I have to acknowledge and just pour my heart out a little bit for the senseless tragedy that happened in Orlando.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And it's just like, I'm at this point where it's like I don't even have like the words for a radio guy to end up speechless is really something, but I mean this really just affects us all.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And not just the fact that like, you know, I'm a gay guy and we sometimes joke in our community that there's this whole like six degrees of separation in our community, so I feel like, you know, what happened in Orlando, yes it's on the other side of the country, but I feel touched by it as well.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And, you know, it's interesting, I got a very sweet message from a listener on Twitter earlier today that's across the pond and was saying that, you know, hey, I know this is really like nowhere near you, but I'm still like thinking of you.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I replied back, I said, you really never know how these things can affect people because I'll tell you guys, one of our frequent contributors here at VOG Network, Shane from the Ranger Pride cast, is actually in Orlando right now.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now he's nowhere, he was nowhere near this, thank God. But I, you know, the first thing I thought when I heard this this morning was that, oh my god, I gotta, I gotta text Shane to make sure. I mean, he's not really the type to go out to these clubs and stuff, but I was still concerned so you know and, and just to hear all this tragedy that has happened is just, I, I don't even know what to say anymore.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Like it's just, I feel like every week there's something horrible that we're talking about and the kind of tie this together to why I want to bring this up as we're about to get into one of our biggest shows of the year on E3.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Inevitably somebody's going to want to tie this over to video games and I just, I, it's, I think you guys all know and I know, you know, it's not the video games.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And why do we continue to do a show like this in the face of all this tragedy and what's going on is, is that I can tell you guys being a gay kid growing up and getting picked on and getting taunted verbally by bullies and sometimes physically and all this stuff

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and being threatened and all that stuff. Sometimes video games were very much my escape and my place to go to kind of, I don't want to necessarily say shut out the real world but to kind of like turn away from all that reality.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I in some ways today when I heard about what was going on in Orlando, I acknowledged it, I got very angry about it but then I had to do something to take my mind off it and that was to go play a video game.

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So anyway, I know that was a lot of verbal blah blah blah but I just I really want to get that off my chest that I'm just, I'm so angry and just upset and my heart goes out to all of those affected because like I mentioned before, you know,

24
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and we joke about it in gay culture but it's a part of human culture. We're six degrees separated from these people one way or another. Those were people's children, those were people's uncles, brothers, sisters, and so on.

25
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know that we're affected by this and I just hope to hell. This country finally, I'm not going to get too political I promise but this country finally does something, something, anything to turn this around and stop this from happening.

26
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright, anything you want to add real quick before I shift gears?

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Just a fun tweet that I read to you earlier that Canada has had eight mass shootings ever. We've had seven since Monday. We keep having the discussion go around the rhetoric keeps circulating, but no one does anything.

28
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Number one, vote people in who will do something. And number two, don't vote for people who pat themselves on the back congratulatory after 50 people are dead. Just saying.

29
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And Americans, vote. Just vote. Like, I, it's such a huge party.

30
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No one in this country has an excuse not to vote.

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
For real, because there's other countries.

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can vote from home. It should be mandatory.

33
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There's other people listening in other countries that are probably like, man, I wish I could vote in my country. So anyway, again, I don't want to get too political I do want to say the chat room hello hi live.vognetwork.com and break man in our chat says, every one of us should be angry, gay, straight, bi, pan, everyone should be angry at this.

34
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And I agree. Anyway, like I said, video games, that's how sometimes we escape the fuckery of the real world and so forth. So here we are. Biggest week of the year as far as video games go and a lot to take your mind off today of what's going on, EA starting things off with their press conference, our show going to be

35
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:42,000
even like earlier this week, it's just been like, well, but there's been announcements. So it's not necessarily league. That's true. It's kind of the I don't want to say the B roll stuff because some of this stuff feels very like I'm very B rolls is kind of like, hey, we've want to have something out before everybody went in to jump the gun a little bit. I think like we got to get the press now before we get drowned in all this other press and so forth. So let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. Again, I mentioned this for a few weeks now, but we are going to be cut short tonight, the Bethesda press conference.

36
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:11,000
starts at seven o'clock Pacific. It's about 618 Pacific right now. We will be stopping the show right at seven taking an extended break tonight because I just I know we're not gonna be able to compete with that. But you can participate if you do want to get some feedback and chat with other folks live.vog network.com. I promise you it will be more exciting than the twitch chat that Bethesda will have. And much more filtered and so on. So you can check that out. We will be watching that live as well. And then we'll come back and we'll all kind of talk about it.

37
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But for you, podcast folks, when you're used to hearing a three hour show, you're probably gonna get one tonight. That's only like an hour and a half or two hours just because I don't I don't know how long but that do we know if it has to 60 or 90 minutes?

38
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't know, we don't know. So we're having to play tonight show a little bit by ear. For that reason, certain segments and things you're used to hearing on the show are not going to be here tonight. Fugal question of the week, rapid fire news, we're going to roll that over to next week. But for now, let's talk about EA's press conference because EA was the first to go today. This is the earliest I think I've ever seen a press conference.

39
00:07:41,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go during E3 week is that we had a press conference at 1pm today. Pacific time and that was EA talking about what they showed Dark Sakura. I'm gonna go a little out of order here just because I know people want to know Dark Sakura. What'd you think of Mass Effect Andromeda?

40
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Pretty. And there's a lady. So happy.

41
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, I mean, I have to admit I was a little bit frustrated when they said we're going to tell you more this fall. But here's a behind the scenes look and I already just kind of knew like get set the bar low. I honestly thought they were going to have the game at their EA play event.

42
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now the question is, do you really think it's coming out in spring of 2017? I don't think it's coming out in spring 2017.

43
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If they're not showing it now, then I have concerns. Now, could EA be withholding for a Microsoft or Sony press conference? I don't think they would have said this fall if that was the case. I think they would have said soon or later.

44
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What exactly is this fall that they would be showing them? And that's my curiosity is that you've also got this big white elephant in the room about the Nintendo NX. So when are they going to show the Nintendo NX?

45
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
White elephant is a type of gift exchange. Oh, sorry, pink elephant. Pink elephant is when you're drunk. It's just an elephant. It is a smelly elephant. You are mixing your metaphors.

46
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It is a smelly elephant that won't stop pooping. It is a brown elephant that will not stop leaving gifts behind. I like the brown elephant.

47
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The big brown elephant in the room is, what is happening in the fall? I mean, because we got the Nintendo NX thing too, right? So, and we don't know. I mean, the assumption is they're going to do it with Tokyo Game Show, though Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, so they'll bring back their thing.

48
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It could be just, there's a lot of stuff like they're focusing on fourth quarter right now, and maybe that's why they're not really trying to hype up Mass Effect at this time. Because I mean, they've got like a lot of big properties that they're trying to get everybody incentivized to purchase right now.

49
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And Mass Effect is probably just later. It's outside of the window that like the other titles that they were showing off were this year.

50
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I am actually also surprised they didn't show Mirror's Edge. I realize the game just came out, but you've got like, what, a quarter million gamers watching a feed right now. Show us the deals. Remind us that it's in store. I was really surprised they didn't take that opportunity.

51
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, I don't think they need to do that. Although, if they would have cut out half the banter that they had, they could have had time for another trailer.

52
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's run down the list here of what they announced. Titanfall 2, and the big deal there, it's a single player mode.

53
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, it's got single player as well.

54
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh yeah, it has one.

55
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Last time it was just like, well, it's a multiplayer game. It's a multiplayer only game, and then you can play it solo, and that's your single player campaign.

56
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But this actually has a single player campaign. The new thing is they've got this grappling hook thing that's going to be pretty cool, so you can use the grappling hook to kind of tether yourself to a Titan.

57
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And really, any game that adds a grappling hook is usually better, so that's always a good sign.

58
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And then of course, the multiplayer looks pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean, overall, I am not sure how excited I am about the single player campaign, but it looks nice.

59
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, it looked gorgeous, and I also caught that grappling hook thing. And you know, I'm not huge on shooters, but with as much as I'm now playing Overwatch, I'm kind of going like, oh, maybe I should try to do some more shooting.

60
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It was fun, and in the last game, they had classes that were kind of catered more towards people that aren't necessarily into shooters.

61
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like, they had a gun that would auto-target type things, so it was, you know.

62
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's true. I remember that.

63
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A little bit more, you can kind of play it however you want, and I mean, I don't know. It was alright.

64
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Plus, you can rack up kills on the AI characters that are there, so that kind of helps out as well.

65
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Right. Next up, they showed Madden 17, which, you know, here's the thing, guys.

66
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I know a lot of us are, like, rolling our eyes at, like, the sports thing, but you've got to realize these games are, it may not be the crowd that was listening to this show.

67
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Madden's going to be dead, and they'll still be Madden games.

68
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
These games, don't say that. This has been a very cruel year of dark soccer.

69
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay, I don't...

70
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But no, I know what you mean. I know what you mean. They will, those games will sell until the end of time.

71
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But that's the point, is that, you know, as much as we all kind of, like, roll our eyes at, oh, here's the Madden game.

72
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's like, okay, you can't deny these games fucking sell.

73
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, they're good, but, Mike, I didn't understand what they were trying to push with this.

74
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like, the whole thing was, we're doing more organized events with Madden 17, and I just was kind of rolling my eyes and scratching my head, like, how's this going to incentivize someone to purchase the game?

75
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I understand, yeah, it's competitive, and that you're doing all these events, and that there's this prize pool, but who cares?

76
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is it the whole, if you can spend $60 on our game and then get good like these guys we're going to show a little spotlight of, then you too can win a million dollars.

77
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No, you're not.

78
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I kind of got that. I'm like, no, you're not.

79
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, you're not. These people...

80
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I got that vibe, like, that's the reason why they might show it.

81
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
People think it's kind of weird that I sit at home and play Madden all the time to get really good at this, and yeah, I don't know.

82
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, people think that about a lot of people that sit at home, do something for a long period of time as well, but that's the thing, is these people have that much more time ahead of you on this.

83
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're not going to all of a sudden catch up to them.

84
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah. I mean, the game looked gorgeous, but I, you know, and I can recognize, like, wow, that's a pretty game, and if I was into football, I'd be really into this.

85
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But, you know, I'm just...

86
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

87
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It is what it is.

88
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't really know, I mean, because we're going to get into it in just a second here, but I don't really know what they would need to do to a sports game to make me interested in it, because adding more, you know, curated events, that's not doing it for me.

89
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Adding a story mode, that's not doing it for me either.

90
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
All right, well, let's get to that.

91
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So, we already talked a little bit about Mass Effect Andromeda.

92
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I just wanted to say, I did think it was gorgeous, and, you know, interesting little glimpses of some characters, but I think there's a lot of assumption that that last female character that does the narration at the end is the quote-unquote new femshep, but hold on.

93
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I mean, it could be, but not necessarily.

94
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It could be a character akin to a Caden and Ashley type of support character.

95
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So, we don't know, but it was nice to at least see even five frames of some new aliens and kind of get a sense of, you know, okay, this is going to be...

96
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is definitely a series that's going to try to differentiate itself from the main trilogy.

97
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So, I look forward to whenever they're going to finally share more about it, because I just wanted to know, like, is there going to be the multiplayer again?

98
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are they going to squeeze that in there? Is it going to be as fun as it was in Mass Effect 3?

99
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, they will, because they can add microtransactions.

100
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I guess that's true.

101
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
All right, then they talked a little bit about the EA Play charity.

102
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know how much that discussion you caught, but they kind of talked about that there was, like, meta-achievements in the games, and they were going to donate money based on the achievements that people were getting in the games.

103
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I thought it was a nice gesture. I thought it was cool. And I think this is something that a lot of people have been calling on is just, you know, throw diversity a frickin' bone.

104
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And so, I kind of think EA stepped up to the plate with that.

105
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And they were very supportive of these charities that support getting more women into the industry, getting more diverse voices, you know.

106
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I think some of those coding charities are also about, like, I think...

107
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Sorry, I don't have all my charities memorized, but I think some of them are about getting, like, kids involved in instruction in school, too.

108
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So that's cool. I mean, I can't sit here and go, you know,

109
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, God, EA, what a bore. I can't be cynical about that. Like, that's cool that they're, you know, gonna...

110
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Gaming for good is always exciting.

111
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay, and then I think the game you were referencing a minute ago, Loki, FIFA 17, right?

112
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, FIFA 17. And they had, like, a bunch of new modes in there and enhancements and stuff.

113
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But the big thing they were showing was, like, the story mode, which the other games have done that before.

114
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Like, the NBA 2K series sort of does that, but it's not all dramatic like that.

115
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The problem that bothered me about it is they drag it out so long during the conference.

116
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Like, this dude comes out and he's like,

117
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You don't know who I am, but I'm, you know, I'm this person and you're gonna know my name.

118
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm like, I don't fucking care who the hell you are.

119
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was a little melodramatic. I was like,

120
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, here's the thing. Okay, all that being said, though, I have to admit, I'm not super into sports games.

121
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not super into FIFA. But when they were showing that trailer, I was like,

122
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is kind of, like, I'm kind of living for this. Like, this is some, like,

123
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Empire level of Dallas of the, what do you call that? The real, like, melodrama type of stuff.

124
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You know what I mean? The melodramatic type of, like, over the top drama.

125
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's, like, in those shows. I was kind of, like, seeing a little bit in that trailer and I was like,

126
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can kind of go for this. I'm digging this. So, yeah, I was-

127
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just didn't get it. You know, being a person that I'm not, like, into sports games,

128
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
it's not getting me into sports games. And that's the thing. It's like, I don't know,

129
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
like, these games that are coming out now, like, the Madden with the, you know,

130
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
the additional competitions and stuff that are gonna be curated by EA and stuff.

131
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And then this FIFA with the story mode and stuff. How is that generating more of an audience for your game?

132
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because, like, the people that are fans of the game are gonna be buying the game anyways.

133
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I just don't think this is gonna be like, Oh, you know what? I wanted a story mode.

134
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That was the last thing I was waiting for. You know, like, hey, I really wish there was more Madden competitions

135
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
because that was really the only thing, you know, my barrier of entry to that series.

136
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
To be honest, though, I did go from, and no one curr, to, well, maybe I'd red box it.

137
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Which is a step up. I gotta admit. But, you know, you have a lot of chatters saying right now, you know,

138
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
obviously FIFA is their biggest game. There's a very intentional reason why they did that from Europe.

139
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Which also, I think, explains- because, you know, when they said the press conference was gonna be at 1 o'clock,

140
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think a lot of us were like, that seems really early. Well, they timed that so that it would be 9 o'clock in the UK.

141
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So they- there was some intent there that they definitely were doing a press conference that overseas could see as well,

142
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
which is way more into soccer. But yeah, when they started bringing out the, um, the co- I think-

143
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't even know who they are. Sorry, the coach? Coaches? Managers? Managers, yeah. The teams?

144
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I, you know, I have to admit, I kind of glazed over, like, I literally have no idea who these people are.

145
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But I guess people are gonna be really excited to see them in the game if you're into soccer.

146
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So, but I have friends here who are, like, that go to the SAC Republic FC stuff all the time.

147
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, eh, they might be into this. But, you know, again, it's gonna sell like crazy no matter what.

148
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Um, okay, so, so none of that stuff that I- well, the EA play was a pleasant surprise, but otherwise,

149
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
nothing I've mentioned was a surprise. All that stuff we expected.

150
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Uh, so the first thing that really caught our eye as something new is when they came out and talked about EA Originals,

151
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and they kind of showcased a game called Fee, which, um, looked a little to me like Journey meets Ori and the Blind Forest type of thing.

152
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Like, there was- there was the art- the art going into it. Um, I mean, but we didn't really get to see a whole lot of what the raw gameplay looks like.

153
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, we just kind of got some bits and pieces, but it definitely looks like EA wants to push, like,

154
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
we're not just these big sports- you know, EA- EA's gotten a bad rap in the past, and so I kind of feel like,

155
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
okay, they are trying to listen to this a little bit, they're trying to help with the diversity initiative and all this stuff,

156
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and they've always been very supportive of GLBT and all this stuff, you know, they're right there marching the pride parade and all that.

157
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Um, and now they're kind of talking about we want to support these, we're not some big evil studio,

158
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
we want to support these low growing things and nurture them, uh, on their first game to success.

159
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I did like that they said, basically, that they're not taking any sort of the pro- like, there's no profit sharing with it,

160
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
so any of the games that they do choose for that, it's basically, they're just giving them some money to get, you know, elevated,

161
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and then that's it, it's EA, you know, and they're gonna publish it, but nothing's gonna be taken from the publisher- or the, uh, developer, which is kind of nice.

162
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So that's kind of neat, so, um, I- that was the first part, I was like, okay, this is cool, like, this is something new, I'm into this,

163
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I was surprised they only showed one, because I kind of thought this EA Originals was gonna be a multitude of games,

164
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
but they only showed this one for whatever reason, maybe this is the only one that's ready to go, I'm not sure.

165
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Um, okay, so after the EA Originals was the Star Wars stuff, which, it was cool to see Sacramento, did you see that?

166
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, I saw Sacramento.

167
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Capital Games, shout out.

168
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I saw that, I was like, woo, Capital Games!

169
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I knew they did mobile stuff down there, I did not realize it was Star Wars they were working on.

170
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah, they're, they're, um...

171
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I, I honestly thought they did the Dragon Age game that Jamie always talks about, I thought that was them.

172
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They may have, I don't remember, but, yeah, they're, um, BioWare Mobile?

173
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, yeah, at one point they were a BioWare, they were BioWare Sacramento, and then they changed to Capital Games, or just EA,

174
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and so they're doing Star Wars, but anyway, I mean...

175
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's still huge, I mean, yeah.

176
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh yeah, for sure, but to be fair, in that whole clip, I'mma be real, the, the greater clip that showed everything, besides the hometown shoutout,

177
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was kinda like, this is a whole lot of nothing.

178
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The Visceral Games one looks pretty awesome, like what they, the very, like, two seconds that they showed of it looks pretty sweet.

179
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And that was, that was, uh, Lando we saw in Battlefront, right?

180
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That was Battlefront, yeah.

181
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's like the one thing I was like, oh cool, and then...

182
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But no, the Visceral one looks pretty awesome, that's gonna be that third person action game stuff, but...

183
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Did it, was it me, or did, like, Jade seem very, like, fake, excited about it?

184
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's just like, it's just like, off, somehow.

185
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's, it's nerves, because the guy that was demonstrating F.E.A. was also very, very, very nervous, I'm sure.

186
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, that guy could understand, because you're like an indie developer, almost, and you're like in a press conference for EA, he's like, uhhh...

187
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You know what, not everybody, just because you're good at managing games doesn't mean you're necessarily good at speaking in front of a crowd.

188
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So, and, um, I think with good reason, there's a lot of pressure to make sure we have women on the stage and diversity on the stage.

189
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I think whether she really wanted to be up there or not, she probably needed to be.

190
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So, um, maybe it was nerves. I didn't, I didn't get that same, I mean, I kind of just, the only problem I had with it is that it was a whole lot of nothing.

191
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I kind of more got the impression she was just selling a whole lot of, stay tight, like, that's all I really got from her.

192
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah.

193
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And the package in general, so.

194
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And I think it's still stupid that they're making another Battlefront game after this last one came out and had, like, hardly any content.

195
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And they're like, eh, it's gonna have the content from the new movie. It's like, yeah, that's awesome.

196
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think the people that bought the original Battlefront would probably like that content as well.

197
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

198
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think, oh no, fuck them. They're gonna have to buy a new game.

199
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And then lastly, Battlefield 1, which looked really pretty, but again, a lot of, not my kind of thing, but Loki, this is your kind of thing. What did you think?

200
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I thought it looks really cool. And I actually watched after the thing was over, they had, like, a live stream of their, the first multiplayer gameplay from it.

201
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So they had a bunch of celebrities and, like, other, you know, players playing. It was 32 on 32.

202
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, okay. That's cool.

203
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So they had this, they were filling it in. It wasn't just all celebrities. It was, like, half of, like, esports guys and YouTubers.

204
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And they were half, you know, Twitch streamers and the other half was, like, celebrities.

205
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
When they showed Zac Efron, did he not want to be there?

206
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, God. He was, like, not excited at all. And then, like, same.

207
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But I heard some people that were watching the feeds saw Snoop Dogg and he looked really into it.

208
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah, he's, like, totally into it.

209
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Snoop Dogg's a hella gamer, though. He's talked about it.

210
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And Terry Crews is awesome. I mean, Terry Crews is just, he's just a hilarious guy.

211
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But, like, he was just, like, getting all into it and shit. And so, it looked awesome.

212
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And, like, everything that they were talking about, like, the destruction and everything being very dynamic was in there.

213
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And they kind of showed off, you know, one of the blimps coming down and everything.

214
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It looks awesome. It looks pretty cool. I definitely want to check it out when it comes out.

215
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not really into the modern Battlefield games too much.

216
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But I'm willing to check this out because it looks pretty, it looks nice.

217
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It looks different and it'd be kind of fun to try it out.

218
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So, last overall thoughts of EA's press conference.

219
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Dark Soccer, I don't think, you only really saw the part you wanted to see.

220
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But do you have any, you've listened to us kind of banter a little bit. Anything?

221
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I've been getting my hair done.

222
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Priorities.

223
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Well, I already had this scheduled.

224
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Her hair looks gorgeous, by the way.

225
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, because Monet rocks.

226
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But based on what we heard and any thoughts on the thing as a whole?

227
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mass Effect.

228
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Loki?

229
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Honestly, as I was agreeing with somebody on Twitter, I can't remember who said it.

230
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
They gave the conference a D+.

231
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I think that's kind of where I'm at with it. It was very average and ho-hum.

232
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There was nothing really, the gameplay for Battlefield was kind of nice.

233
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But it was, we already kind of had a trailer of that.

234
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It was just kind of nice to see it actually confirm that, yeah, it does sort of look like that.

235
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But overall, there was nothing really surprising.

236
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There wasn't anything like, ooh, any real big exciting announcements.

237
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It was just kind of, eh.

238
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at, is that it was very, very par for me.

239
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And maybe because they're out the gate first, maybe there's something they have to kind of keep under wraps for the Sony or Microsoft.

240
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That is true. There could be something.

241
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And usually they go after, so there could be something going on there.

242
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We won't know until after Monday.

243
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But I would say it's almost below par for me.

244
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I would say a more like C- for me, which isn't really far off from what you gave it.

245
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Because just the fact that, you know, they were out there talking Star Wars, but didn't really give us a lot.

246
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
They were out there talking Mass Effect, but really didn't give us a lot.

247
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm surprised they didn't mention anything Maxis.

248
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean, I granted, or even PopCap.

249
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
PopCap was completely missing too.

250
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, no PopCap, no Maxis.

251
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Well, didn't they close Maxis?

252
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah, okay. But I mean, there's somebody making Sims games, I would assume.

253
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
True.

254
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They're still going to carry on the franchise, and there's nothing PopCap related at all.

255
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's true. The Sims was completely missing.

256
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Which is a bit of a, you know, I don't know if we're right around the corner from The Sims 5.

257
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But I am kind of surprised there's kind of nothing in that franchise, you're right.

258
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So, okay. Well, that is our thoughts on EA.

259
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

260
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Lots of different comments in chat.

261
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Let's see, talking about Snoop Dogg being into video games.

262
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Act F says Snoop Dogg is fo-shizzle into video games.

263
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think that they were showing, and someone had mentioned this.

264
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't know, I'm not one to identify drugs, but I think that they said that he was smoking a blunt while playing the game.

265
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Cut!

266
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They actually had video of that happening, too.

267
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He is smoking something, let's put it that way.

268
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
He's got a card, you know he has a card, Wink.

269
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He does, but it's awesome.

270
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He's got stress or, you know, back pain or something.

271
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

272
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm not into multiplayer, this is about Battlefield, but it was pretty damn cool.

273
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
A lot of shit going on at once.

274
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's the thing, even though I'm not into multiplayer because I know they get my ass handed to me pretty quickly,

275
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
but the single player campaign looks pretty awesome, too, from the cinematics and stuff that they're showing.

276
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
VidPower talking about Jade Raymond saying,

277
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Haven't seen Jade Raymond in the spotlight for five years, good for her.

278
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's a good point, is that she hasn't done this in a while, so maybe that's why, you know.

279
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I cut the executives a little slack.

280
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Not everybody is born to get up in front of all the people.

281
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That's why Reggie Fils-Aime is a great face for Nintendo.

282
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And no, I'm not afraid of multiplayer, I just know my level of gameplay in multiplayer.

283
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
One more comment here, then we'll move on.

284
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Kaijuto says, The reason why so many Star Wars games suck is because the devs try to be storytellers,

285
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and they forget about making a fun game.

286
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Leave the story to the movies.

287
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks quickly.

288
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We're going to run through this quickly. How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

289
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I played World of Warcraft.

290
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How's that been going?

291
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's been really fun. I think the thing that I like the best about doing my quests there,

292
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
is that I don't have to freaking go all over the world to do the quests I'm doing.

293
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I can stay in a particular area and get them done.

294
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And so it's felt a lot more streamlined and less disjointed,

295
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and there hasn't been that particular level gap between being able to do things,

296
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
where I'd just have to grind until I was at a level that I could do the next level,

297
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and not have to be locked for it.

298
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So it's been pretty awesome that way.

299
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And I'm having a good time. I'm having a really good time.

300
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I just miss everybody who used to play.

301
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You're playing with the Game Boy guys though, right?

302
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The Game Boy.org guys?

303
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I sometimes see Jon sometimes.

304
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Okay, when they're on. Fair enough.

305
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, I just wish everybody was back, then it would be more fun like it used to be.

306
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

307
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just the other usuals.

308
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Loki.

309
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I really didn't play that much this week,

310
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
because I've been still very exhausted after work and kids and all that.

311
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So really the only thing I've been playing is just mobile games, which is weird.

312
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Still playing Ingress just the minimal amount so that I can keep my Sojourner thing going,

313
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
until it finally platinums out or whatever, and then I don't have to play it anymore.

314
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And then I've been playing Pokemon GO quite a bit.

315
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm up to about two-thirds of the way to level seven.

316
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So I've been playing that.

317
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And that's just mainly because I've had to go to a lot of parks and stuff with kids,

318
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and it's a good way to kill time.

319
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Plus at home you can still play it at home,

320
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
because you can put the incense thing on you,

321
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the track the Pokemon to you and double the XP with the Lucky Egg.

322
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And then that way you can just sit on the couch and play it occasionally when they come up to you and stuff.

323
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So it's just a good time waster, I guess.

324
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's all right.

325
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's still very buggy, though.

326
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I complain about it all the time with people.

327
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, I wish I'd played something more significant, but I've just been so damn tired.

328
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And then in the time that I have been awake, I've been trying to work on my game,

329
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
which I'm not getting very much progress there because I do end up falling asleep while I'm working on it.

330
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
My Gaming Week.

331
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV, which got a patch this week, the 3-3 patch,

332
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
so an expansion on the story.

333
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'll keep it spoiler-free, but very, very epic.

334
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Although the content this time is pretty unforgiving.

335
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We tried to do the new trial.

336
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There's a brand new eight-person fight in it, and it's hard.

337
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We tried to do it, like five of us and a few pickup people, and we couldn't beat it.

338
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We got it down to 2%, still couldn't beat it.

339
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Which I don't think all the content needs to be gimme.

340
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I think you do have to bang your head on the wall a little bit,

341
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but I was a little surprised because that's a big step up in difficulty for Final Fantasy.

342
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But we'll get there, I know it, and it'll feel real good when we do beat it, finally.

343
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But seriously, the story, phenomenal.

344
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
One of the better Final Fantasy games in the series, it really is.

345
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And also been playing Overwatch.

346
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Still been kind of going with that.

347
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And Alan's been super getting into Overwatch now, too.

348
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
In fact, he is double my level and then some.

349
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So we play once in a while.

350
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Sometimes he plays a lot right before I go to bed,

351
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and I don't always want to binge game right before bed,

352
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but we've been able to pop on, and there'll be some people that'll be on,

353
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and we'll kind of do some matches here and there.

354
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But I am enjoying Overwatch still.

355
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Just a lot of fun, and there's still some characters I want to play.

356
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I got myself, or I should say Alan bought me,

357
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
because he was buying another pop figure,

358
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
but he got me the Winston doll, the pop figure doll.

359
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's big, because it's Winston. I like it, it's cute.

360
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That was pretty much it for my Gimme Week, though.

361
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So just some quick housekeeping.

362
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We will be back with a full show next week to wrap up E3.

363
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I do believe a longtime OLR listener and fan,

364
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Misty, is going to be here in the studio to help us recap E3

365
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and run down all that.

366
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And then in two weeks, our 14th birthday here at Orange Lounge Radio.

367
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The 14th anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio

368
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
will be the same day as my actual birthday, June the 26th.

369
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
How about that?

370
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
All right, so let's try to do some news here.

371
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
We're going to do just one or two, maybe three stories,

372
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and then we're going to get to the Classic Game of the Week

373
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and make our way to the next press conference.

374
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Loki, start us off tonight.

375
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So, you know, as each year,

376
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
a lot of announcements get leaked ahead of time,

377
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and it's usually the fault of the company

378
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
that's actually going to be doing the announcement.

379
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And in this case, Microsoft, being Microsoft, decided that,

380
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
hey, let's go ahead and put that pre-order page up for the new Xbox Slim.

381
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Whoops, that's not supposed to go up yet.

382
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So, yes, we got to...

383
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
They did this last year, by the way.

384
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I don't know if you remember, but they totally ruined last year.

385
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So, I don't know if it's on purpose,

386
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
if it's just like a leak, quote, unquote.

387
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But basically, it's an Xbox.

388
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
They call it the Xbox One S.

389
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It is 40% smaller.

390
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It has a two terabyte hard drive.

391
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It supports 4K Ultra HD video,

392
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
a high dynamic range,

393
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and a streamlined controller,

394
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and also has a vertical stand.

395
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And the game system itself looks pretty similar to it was before,

396
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
although the mesh on the bottom looks a little bit different,

397
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and it's not so VCR-looking this time.

398
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So, it is definitely slimmer-looking,

399
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and apparently also maybe looks like a USB port

400
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and an infrared sensor on the front.

401
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So, that's all we know about it so far.

402
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
No word on what the cost is going to be or anything,

403
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
but we will find out tomorrow for that, I'm assuming,

404
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
since I'm assuming this is right around the corner

405
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
since they're taking pre-orders for it.

406
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And, yeah, so is this the same as the souped-up system?

407
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
No.

408
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Because it has the 4K video.

409
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The rumor was originally that they're going to be redesigning the original system,

410
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so they're going to be shrinking it down, which is this,

411
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and then the new system would be something different.

412
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It'd be separate skew altogether.

413
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay, so the 4K video kind of ended up being a surprise bonus then in this.

414
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I guess, yeah.

415
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't think this is the souped-up system.

416
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That wouldn't make...

417
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't think that's the same thing.

418
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No, yeah, because the souped-up system was talking about new chips and stuff,

419
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and that's not what we're seeing.

420
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, I don't think that's this,

421
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
although I am kind of curious to see what the difference would be

422
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
if how one would support and the other one wouldn't,

423
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
unless that's just going to be something that they patch in for all the systems.

424
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Good thought.

425
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Which could be.

426
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I mean, I would imagine spec-wise it's probably the same.

427
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Is 4K? I don't have a 4K TV.

428
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Is it still just an HDMI cable?

429
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's still HDMI, but I think it may...

430
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't really know.

431
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Because I was thinking maybe there's a physical port on the back that's different.

432
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I don't know.

433
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
To be honest, I don't know.

434
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I don't have a 4K TV, nor am I not.

435
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Anyone in chat know?

436
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm not too interested in getting one just yet.

437
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I think it's way too early.

438
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't know how much 4K content is out there.

439
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And to be honest, the 1080 stuff that comes over,

440
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you know, with Netflix and everything,

441
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it's not always that great-looking anyways,

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
so I don't really think I need that just yet.

443
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Besides the file size and everything and bandwidth, no thanks.

444
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes, this new Xbox One sounds great if you waited.

445
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But for me, it's kind of a...

446
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Well, here's the thing too, though.

447
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I did wait.

448
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I haven't purchased an Xbox One yet.

449
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm still hoping we hear something about Crackdown this year.

450
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
My thing is, though, is...

451
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And this is also the same...

452
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's got me on the fence too about PlayStation VR.

453
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's like, what's it going to mean with these new systems

454
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that are going to be coming out?

455
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
In fact, I wanted to see something real quick here.

456
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't remember if it's part of the show.

457
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It is not part of the show.

458
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Oh, maybe it is.

459
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Okay, so yeah, I don't know what exactly it means, though,

460
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
with these new systems coming out.

461
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Is it just going to be an upgrade that they do every now and then?

462
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I know that they're saying that these older systems

463
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
are going to still be able to support the same content,

464
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
but is it going to be supporting it

465
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
just like the 3DS did with Hyrule Warriors,

466
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
where it plays good on one

467
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and doesn't play that great on the other?

468
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I kind of want more information about that

469
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
before I jump into that stuff.

470
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
All right, well, another big thing

471
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
that was announced ahead of E3,

472
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
not leaked, but announcement,

473
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
y'all, I was happy about this.

474
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Final Fantasy XII Remaster.

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's happening. It's true.

476
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm so excited about this.

477
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age

478
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
will be coming out on the PlayStation 4.

479
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This is going to be a remaster

480
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
based on the International Zodiac Job System,

481
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
so similar to what we got with the Final Fantasy X Remaster,

482
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and it looks gorgeous,

483
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and I'm so, so happy this game is getting a second chance.

484
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I never played XII, really.

485
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm so happy this game is getting a second chance

486
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
because Final Fantasy XII on PlayStation 2

487
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
came out right when the Xbox 360 did,

488
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
so I think a lot of it got lost in that whole shuffle,

489
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
so I'm really happy this game is getting a second chance.

490
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The battle system is really, really fun.

491
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's different.

492
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's not what you're used to in the old-school games,

493
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
but I love it.

494
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Although, with XV coming around,

495
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
it seems kind of similar to XV almost.

496
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, I guess, but...

497
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Or is it more Kingdom Hearts?

498
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Honestly, not to get you too excited,

499
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it felt more like XI's battle system

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
than anything else. It really did.

501
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, I know you've mentioned that before.

502
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I know that sounds weird, but it really feels like XI's,

503
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and I loved programming the gambits for your supports

504
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
because you can tell them, like,

505
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
oh, at 20% health, start healing,

506
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
otherwise attack, use fire if the mob is weak.

507
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You can set all this crazy stuff.

508
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's really cool.

509
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
They're talking high-resolution upgrades

510
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
for movie scenes, fonts, 7.1 channels surround support.

511
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Why don't they have that in the MMO?

512
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You should be able to hire support characters or something

513
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and then be able to program them like that.

514
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That would be pretty awesome.

515
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
English and Japanese voices,

516
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
you'll be able to switch between them.

517
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Original and newly re-recorded backgrounds,

518
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
you'll be able to switch between them.

519
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Shorter load times, autosave, and speed mode,

520
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and speed mode operability.

521
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So I'm really hyped for this.

522
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm really, really, really excited about this.

523
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So, yay.

524
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Looking at the chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

525
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
DarkTetsuya says,

526
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
This reminded me of a conversation I had with someone

527
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
about the possibility of a 12 remaster.

528
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I tried to finish 12,

529
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but even after using a GameShark to get myself unstuck,

530
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I still couldn't finish the game,

531
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
so I hope the HD version fixes some of the problems I had.

532
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And BobbyBlackWolf saying Final Fantasy 12

533
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
was my favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack.

534
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It was really, really good.

535
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm curious on 11 Mobile now,

536
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
which, whenever that information's supposed to come out,

537
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
because I know they're supposed to be doing something with that.

538
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week,

539
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Dark Soccer, you want to quickly tell us about what you had.

540
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Huh?

541
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Your story up next.

542
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week.

543
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

544
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's okay.

545
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I have to say that I've still been reading up about what's gone on.

546
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I understand.

547
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
There's definitely a lot weighing on our minds today.

548
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So sorry about that.

549
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So, I've actually known people who were affected by this

550
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that Fallout 4, for some reason, showed up free.

551
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Who knows?

552
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It was apparently just a pricing error.

553
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I know someone who is affected by this too.

554
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Okay.

555
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They might be sitting across from you.

556
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Really?

557
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So, Microsoft said that for those who downloaded Fallout 4 for free,

558
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the licenses are revoked.

559
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Too bad.

560
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But they are going to give everyone $10 in their Microsoft account

561
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
as an inconvenience payment.

562
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Why not just own it and let them keep Fallout?

563
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Because they can do that.

564
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
They have the ability to do that.

565
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And people knew that it wasn't like,

566
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh, I thought it was free.

567
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It was more like, hey, it's free now.

568
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Go download it before they catch it.

569
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I mean, the Digital Deluxe version was free too, which is like $100.

570
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And at some point, Bethesda is hemorrhaging a lot of money.

571
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It was the same thing with, what was it?

572
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It was with, what's that, Harmonics game?

573
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Amplitude.

574
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They did it with Amplitude.

575
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I didn't gain fucking $10 from Sony.

576
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
All right.

577
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, look, and before I get nasty emails,

578
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
we already bought Fallout 4.

579
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We just had it on PC.

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Alan has it on PC.

581
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It was kind of one of those things where I was like,

582
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
well, I'm curious, but no big loss.

583
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If I want to borrow it now in Steam library, I can.

584
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I've got the console version.

585
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
No.

586
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
All right.

587
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

588
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Back before there was digital storefronts.

589
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Or maybe, actually, maybe not this week.

590
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Maybe when there was digital storefronts.

591
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I forgot.

592
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's only got to be 10 years old.

593
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We're going to take a trip back in time,

594
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and Dark Soccer's going to find a game that she thinks, hey,

595
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
you guys should be playing this game this week.

596
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So Dark Soccer, in the spirit of E3.

597
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes, in the spirit of E3.

598
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
What is this week's classic game of the week?

599
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Half-Life 2, Episode 1.

600
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Which, yes, I've done Half-Life, and I've done Half-Life 2.

601
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I'm doing Half-Life 2, Episode 1.

602
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Is there a certain reason you have Half-Life on the brain

603
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
right now?

604
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Is there a particular reason?

605
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Well, you know, we always speculate,

606
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
because there's a 3 in E3.

607
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So I'm just saying.

608
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So maybe this isn't the first time you'll hear about Half-Life.

609
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Half-Life 3 confirmed.

610
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, my God.

611
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh, my God.

612
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Half-Life 3 confirmed.

613
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Exactly.

614
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So we all know what Half-Life is.

615
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's a first-person shooter.

616
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
This starts exactly from where Half-Life 2 ended.

617
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And it continues the game of Gordon and Alex and Dog

618
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
going through their adventures and a cliffhanger ending.

619
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And I just picked it, because it came out June 1 in 2006.

620
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's how old Half-Life 2, Episode 1 is.

621
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That's how long we've been fucking waiting.

622
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Well, not true, because there's an Episode 2, but still close.

623
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
We've been waiting a long time for Half-Life, Episode 3.

624
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But one of the special things about this, though,

625
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is that it does have an improved AI for Alex, in particular,

626
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
in the game.

627
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And it was the upgraded version of the source engine

628
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
that had better lighting effects and different facial animation

629
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
technology.

630
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And then it allowed the AI enemies

631
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
to also use different fighting tactics.

632
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So it definitely added some more challenges, too.

633
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And it added more settings to the game.

634
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So it definitely was a big addition to the series.

635
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And it would definitely be worth mentioning.

636
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But we're still waiting.

637
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Still waiting.

638
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And that's it.

639
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Still waiting for that day.

640
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Half-Life 2,

641
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Episode 1.

642
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
To register participation for this week's episode

643
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com,

644
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
use the passphrase, skate.

645
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So we got like five minutes here before we have to cut over

646
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
to the Bethesda conference.

647
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So maybe we can squeeze in release dates real quick?

648
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Do you think we can travel around the world,

649
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
check out release dates?

650
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Because there's probably not a lot this weekend.

651
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
No, there's not a lot.

652
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Unless there are surprises.

653
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's the thing to cross your fingers for.

654
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
True, yeah.

655
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Some surprises.

656
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Some surprises.

657
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But so far, what's on the plate, Dead by Daylight on PC,

658
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Dreamfall Chapters Book 5 Redux on PC, Mac and Linux.

659
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That is it.

660
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
On June 13th, cat lateral damage for PlayStation 4 in the UK.

661
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And that's it?

662
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah.

663
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
All right.

664
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Well, let me, I'm running over to Japan real quick.

665
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Run, run, run.

666
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And checking what's coming out of there in Japan.

667
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It looks like it's a little busier over there this week.

668
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
On the 16th, on PlayStation 4, you have Root Letter

669
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is out in Japan this week.

670
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Again, on the PlayStation 4.

671
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And then traveling over to the Wii U.

672
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Still slow this week.

673
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The next big release in Japan is Minecraft Wii U edition on the 23rd.

674
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Meanwhile, on the PlayStation Vita,

675
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
we have Hakoyuki, Shinkai Hana no Shu,

676
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
as well as Root Letter is out on the Vita.

677
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So you have those to look forward to this week.

678
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And then lastly, wanting to check the DS

679
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
to see if there's anything on the DS this week.

680
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, Taiko no Tatujin Doko Don Mystery Adventure.

681
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's right.

682
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
A Taiko no Tatujin game that is like an adventure game.

683
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's not your typical Taiko no Tatujin.

684
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But don't be fooled.

685
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You still have the drum beats and all that good stuff in it.

686
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But this one's going to be a little more of a hybrid game.

687
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So there you go.

688
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That is your Japanese releases for this week.

689
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
All right, guys.

690
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We're going to take a quick break.

691
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And when we come back, we will hopefully...

692
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Skyrim HD, you think?

693
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Hopefully?

694
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Possibly.

695
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So you want me to say something?

696
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Elder Scrolls VI?

697
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Come on.

698
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Hey, Oblivion was 2006.

699
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Skyrim was 2011.

700
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Maybe?

701
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Maybe?

702
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It's about time.

703
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Set the bar to realism.

704
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But we know Dishonored 2.

705
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We're about to see.

706
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Dishonored 2, I mean, the stuff that they think was very likely so far.

707
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So Dishonored 2, obviously, is going to be there.

708
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
They've got, let's see, Dishonored 2 Fallout 4 DLC, Doom DLC,

709
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Elder Scrolls Online updates, Elder Scrolls Legends,

710
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and then some rumored, Wolfenstein 2, The Evil Within 2,

711
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Prey 2, Skyrim Remastered, and maybe Quake, but probably not.

712
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All right.

713
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Do we know if it's 60 or 90 minutes?

714
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We don't know, do we?

715
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Don't know.

716
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
All right.

717
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So we will be back when the Bethesda press conference is over.

718
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Stay tuned.

719
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Don't go anywhere.

720
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
For you podcast folks, it's going to be a time warp.

721
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
We will be right back.

722
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

723
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Live tonight, June the 12th of 2016, our 645th episode already in progress.

724
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We had a nice big break as we were watching the Bethesda press conference

725
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
together as a group.

726
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
What did y'all think?

727
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I kind of thought it was pretty good.

728
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You know, they did a really good job hyping their games and showing a lot of gameplay.

729
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I almost think they showed too much gameplay towards the end, but that's just me.

730
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I know some people are way more into the Dishonored stuff than I am,

731
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
but I thought they did a, I thought, especially contrasted to EA earlier today,

732
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
which was a lot of, I think, more talk.

733
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I think they did a great job.

734
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It wasn't as exciting as last year, I think, but it was still very good.

735
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah.

736
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yet another game I might have been interested in,

737
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
but there was no mention of a female protagonist.

738
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Which game was that?

739
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Prey.

740
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Ah, yeah, Prey.

741
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That one was interesting because, well, with Prey, I mean, I remember the older game,

742
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and I think a lot of us were anticipating Prey 2, but this game they showed,

743
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I mean, I know Prey was kind of like a sci-fi hybrid thing.

744
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It seems like a reimagining, but I'm still not interested.

745
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
There was a lot of Native American culture tie-ins in the old game,

746
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and I don't know if that's going to still be there.

747
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But even in the supposed Prey 2 that they were showing didn't look anything like Prey,

748
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
so I don't know. I guess it's not a big deal.

749
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Let's go down the list. We'll revisit Prey in a moment,

750
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but let's go down the list of everything they showed.

751
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
This one really surprised me, especially because they opened with this,

752
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and they didn't close with it.

753
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The closer was kind of, okay, that's it, bye.

754
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm kind of surprised they didn't close with this.

755
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But they opened big with Quake Champions, so Quake is coming back.

756
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
DarkSakura, were we talking about this just last week?

757
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
More Quake? Here we go.

758
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I said it would be nice.

759
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So Quake Champions, which to me kind of feels like,

760
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
oh, they might have seen what was going on with Overwatch,

761
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
that people really like these characters that are very fleshed out.

762
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
They're a first-person shooter, and maybe this is their own kind of spin on that.

763
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't know. That's kind of what I took away from it.

764
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But at least for me, Quake has not particularly been a character-driven game before,

765
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
but it looks like they're going to really try to change that with this new one.

766
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But it looks sweet.

767
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I was kind of surprised to see it so soon after Doom.

768
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
What did you think, Logie?

769
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I thought it was all right. I'm not a huge fan of Quake,

770
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
but it looks decent.

771
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I mean, it's an arena shooter, so I wish it was an actual Quake game,

772
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
not just this kind of arena, multiplayer-focused game, I guess.

773
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
More of an actual storyline Quake game.

774
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But whatever. That's fine.

775
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Next up, obviously they didn't show a lot of gameplay,

776
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
but with their QuakeCon coming up, they're probably saving the big reveal for that.

777
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Elder Scrolls Legends, the card game, they showed a little bit of that,

778
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
which, again, not to keep saying Bethesda wants to be Blizzard,

779
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but this looked a lot like Hearthstone to me,

780
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
especially when they were saying it's tablets now, too.

781
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah, a big meh from me because I just don't give a shit about those types of games.

782
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, I have to say, as much as I love Elder Scrolls,

783
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I was not really, you know, but I get there are people super into trading card games

784
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
that are going to be really excited about this.

785
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So, you know, different stuff for different people.

786
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The Fallout 4 add-ons, so they talked a little bit about Fallout 4 after that,

787
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and then showed off some of the add-ons.

788
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, the contraptions thing was pretty funny.

789
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The add-ons are just going to be fantastic.

790
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I mean, just with all the stuff you can do in the game

791
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and now that you can create elevators and stuff and make contraptions,

792
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I can only imagine all the YouTube videos are going to come out from that.

793
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
The other part was torturing Mama Murphy like that.

794
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That was fantastic. So, yeah, that was pretty awesome.

795
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah, and, you know, again, I don't know the Fallout 4 world super, super well.

796
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I've kind of watched Alan play a little bit of it,

797
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
but I did think that the theme park thing looked pretty funny, too.

798
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That was something that has been rumored to be coming out for a while now.

799
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Even, like, with the original, with Fallout 4, they had, like,

800
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
it was in one of the updates that said Nuka World,

801
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,000
leaked actual, like, it was like an internal email that came out in 2014 or 15

802
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
was saying something about Fallout Nuka World.

803
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So, it was something that they've been planning from the get-go,

804
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
but it'll be neat to check out, like, an actual, another expansion.

805
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I still hope you have to play Far Harbor, so I'm looking forward to that.

806
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But, yeah, more expansions.

807
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And then, obviously, they're feeling a lot of love with the Fallout Shelter,

808
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
and they're talking about now Fallout Shelter is going to be a PC game,

809
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
but then I thought it was all too interesting that they're bringing the vault into the Fallout 4 game.

810
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah, so you can make your own vault, which is pretty awesome.

811
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Even DarkSakura piped up, she went,

812
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I want a vault!

813
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Speaking, then you can experiment.

814
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It appeals to my Sims house building love.

815
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And you can experiment on your, you know, vault guests, if you will,

816
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
so that's pretty awesome.

817
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Let's see, so then, big announcement, Skyrim HD is real,

818
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and it's October 28th is when it's coming back.

819
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Looks like mod support will be a part of it as well.

820
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yep, that'd be awesome. I would pick that up.

821
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
They're going to be able to charge you 60 bucks for that all over again, I bet.

822
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Probably.

823
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah, that's going to be, I wonder if that'll last a long time,

824
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
or if that'll start to fall in price pretty quickly.

825
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I would imagine it'd fall pretty quickly.

826
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
They've been pretty good at discounting some of their games,

827
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
like Wolfenstein was like 20 bucks, not too long.

828
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And they discount that stuff pretty often, so.

829
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Very curious how PC is going to take that,

830
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
because modding has already made PC Skyrim HD.

831
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, I mean.

832
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
There's textures and stuff, so kind of interesting

833
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
how they're going to resell that to the PC audience.

834
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I think it's more of a console thing.

835
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I don't know if, I'd be surprised if they actually released it on PC.

836
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm pretty sure there were three boxes on the screen.

837
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So, it wasn't Wii U.

838
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Of course not.

839
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know.

840
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
They could, they could try it, I guess.

841
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I don't know why you would purchase that again.

842
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It could be something like a lot of times when they do

843
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
like an HD remix like that or something,

844
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
they may just put it out like for 20 bucks on PC.

845
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You know, like really cheap.

846
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Right.

847
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Well, I'm curious if all the expansions are bundled in as well.

848
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That is going to sweep the pot for those that maybe never picked those up.

849
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It would be all the expansions bundled in,

850
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
but I'm thinking if they do re-release on PC,

851
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
they're not going to charge like 60 bucks for it.

852
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's just going to be like 20 or something.

853
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It's inexpensive.

854
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
They've done that in the past with other like HD

855
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
or like collectors, not collectors,

856
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
like game of the year editions or definitive editions.

857
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
They'll be, you know, console obviously is going to be more expensive

858
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
because it's a new game for that platform,

859
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
but for PC, since it's already been out,

860
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
it's more of just kind of a compilation.

861
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Oh, Defective Candy calls us out in chat

862
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
over at live.fognetwork.com saying the nice thing is

863
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
if you own Skyrim and all its add-ons

864
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
or own Legendary Edition on Steam,

865
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
you'll get a free upgrade to Skyrim

866
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Special Edition on October 28th.

867
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I did not catch that.

868
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That must have been in some type of e-mail

869
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
or some online follow-up thing.

870
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Which I do, so that'll be cool.

871
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That, okay, that's pretty rad then

872
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
if they're throwing that in as a free upgrade,

873
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
then that kind of answers the questions,

874
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
what to do about the HD modders and stuff,

875
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
but my thought is that maybe they went back

876
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
and changed some stuff actually in the engine itself

877
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
that's going to want to make some of the modders

878
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
go back and do new things

879
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
with some of these enhancements in the engine.

880
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Well, yeah, because it's a pretty old engine,

881
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
so if they are updating the whole engine

882
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and maybe run on something a little bit similar

883
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
to Fallout 4, then that would be pretty nice.

884
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah.

885
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Let's see.

886
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Tigerclaw says,

887
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I also have Skyrim on 360,

888
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
which I never got around to playing

889
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
when I first bought it.

890
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Well, sadly, I think you're going to have to rebuy it,

891
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
but maybe if they are going to get it free on PC,

892
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
it lends itself to the fact that maybe it won't be

893
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
a very expensive game.

894
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Maybe it'll be more of a budget title.

895
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Then Prey was the game that was shown after that.

896
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Which is kind of confusing

897
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
because it looked like a whole new franchise

898
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and then all of a sudden it's all Prey.

899
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's like, huh?

900
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I thought it was going to be,

901
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I thought it was going to be like Groundhog Day

902
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
or Good Morning, Malcolm would be the name of the game.

903
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I don't know.

904
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It was just, it was different.

905
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's just so like, this is Prey?

906
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Okay, if you say so, I guess.

907
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I mean, it didn't look anything like the first game

908
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and didn't look anything like that second trailer

909
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
for Prey 2 or whatever.

910
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It was just kind of, here's the thing,

911
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
we're calling it Prey.

912
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And I'm not saying they have to like just copy

913
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the first game or something.

914
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Maybe there's some theme that ties them together

915
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
that, you know, you know,

916
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
why you have the different protagonists and stuff,

917
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
but I'm just...

918
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Well, yeah.

919
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I mean, the first one,

920
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
it was you're kidnapped by aliens basically.

921
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So we're kidnapped by aliens again?

922
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I don't know.

923
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah.

924
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Let's see.

925
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And then after that was the Doom update.

926
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So they talked about some of the DLC for Doom.

927
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So they're going to do like multiplayer DLC,

928
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
which, okay, cool.

929
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But then they mentioned the shareware throwback concept

930
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
where they're going to release episode one,

931
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
or the first level, I guess,

932
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
free on Xbox and PlayStation,

933
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
which I mean, that's cool.

934
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I love how they frame that, but it's a demo.

935
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
They're releasing a Doom demo this week, basically.

936
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So for those that want to check it out.

937
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But that, again...

938
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But it would be cool though,

939
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
if like it was like the shareware thing

940
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
where I download that one level demo

941
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and then I say purchase

942
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and then I can download the rest of it.

943
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, are you kidding?

944
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Of course that's going to be there.

945
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
In the day of digital sales?

946
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Of course they want that money.

947
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That's how they're doing it.

948
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That's how they're going to get the money themselves.

949
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And that's how I think that they should be doing it

950
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
with all these other games.

951
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Like, yes, I understand you can't make a standalone demo,

952
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
but just put out the first level or something for free.

953
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah, interesting.

954
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'd be curious to see what kind of success they have for this.

955
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Because again, I didn't think I would like Doom,

956
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
but I really do.

957
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of people

958
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
that can use this demo as a chance to see,

959
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
well, I'm kind of on the fence about first-person shooters.

960
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Am I going to like this?

961
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And I bet, you know, there'll be some.

962
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
They'll say nah, still not my cup of tea.

963
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Too fast, too bloody, whatever.

964
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But there'll be some that are like,

965
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
okay, push A, I want more right here.

966
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So that is pretty cool.

967
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Then after that, they talked about the Elder Scrolls Online,

968
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
which I've got to admit, I could not get,

969
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
as much as I love MMOs,

970
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I really tried to get an Elder Scrolls Online.

971
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I kind of couldn't do it.

972
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Maybe I need to give it a second chance.

973
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And the nice thing is about the pricing model,

974
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't have to pay a monthly fee,

975
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
so I can give it another chance.

976
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I liked how they were talking about the whole

977
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
we're going to just level sync you to everything.

978
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You can do whatever the hell you want in the game.

979
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That was cool.

980
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
If you want to play it with me, I own it.

981
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I haven't played it yet.

982
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, I own it too.

983
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I played a little bit of it, but it was so buggy.

984
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But then again, I played it the day it came out.

985
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
LOL Bethesda and buggy games.

986
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So now it's probably fine.

987
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
If I can fit it into my busy schedule.

988
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Girl.

989
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
No, I'll check it out.

990
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Okay.

991
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'll check it out.

992
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
After we see Warcraft.

993
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, which is also on my list of things to do.

994
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Sadly, a topic we will not be able to talk about tonight

995
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
because none of us saw it yet,

996
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
but we got too busy of a show tonight anyway.

997
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The 23rd, it will be released in Japan.

998
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
That was another pretty notable deal

999
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
is that they're going to take the Elder Scrolls Online to Japan.

1000
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'd be very curious to see how it's received over there.

1001
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Speaking of Warcraft, World of Warcraft does not exist in Japan.

1002
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Final Fantasy XIV obviously exists in Japan,

1003
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
but the MMO landscape without Warcraft in it,

1004
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
very different in Japan.

1005
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So it'll be very interesting to see what Elder Scrolls Online does.

1006
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And then after that was talking about the Bethesda VR,

1007
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
which kind of surprised me that they're taking existing things

1008
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
and putting it into VR

1009
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
because that isn't necessarily always the best idea,

1010
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
but it sounds like they're taking care

1011
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
to ensure that the games are kind of built for VR, so to speak.

1012
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And then they mentioned that Fallout 4 is going to be on the HTC Vive.

1013
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So interesting that they did not mention the PlayStation VR.

1014
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oculus, I kind of get a little more

1015
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
because wasn't there a little spat going on

1016
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
between one of the id, which does the stuff for Bethesda,

1017
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and Oculus, wasn't there a little thing going on there?

1018
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So I can kind of see maybe why that was left out.

1019
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But this is going to be very interesting now

1020
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
as we're starting to see the chess pieces move

1021
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
where what VR is going to have what.

1022
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah, that's definitely a great win for the Vive

1023
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
because someone's looking to purchase,

1024
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
you know, a VR system and it's like,

1025
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
oh, hey, Fallout 4, that'd be pretty awesome.

1026
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Thank you, Bobby.

1027
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Of course, Bobby knows this shit when it comes to VR.

1028
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

1029
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I think the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus is still going on.

1030
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
They feel Carmax stole ZeniMax tech and took it to Oculus.

1031
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So that was, yeah, so that's not a surprise

1032
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
that they're leaving Oculus out in that regard.

1033
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But when they said Bethesda VR,

1034
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I was like, well, are they going to create their own headset?

1035
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Please don't.

1036
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh, yeah, please don't.

1037
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I was like, oh, see, they're saying

1038
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
that he stole their tech

1039
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
because they're actually developing one their own.

1040
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I'm like, oh, no, not another one.

1041
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And then it's like for the Vive, I'm like, okay, fine.

1042
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That's fine.

1043
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
At least they're siding with somebody.

1044
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I was just a little worried there that,

1045
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
hey, we've got our own headset.

1046
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'd be very curious to see how that plays.

1047
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I have to admit Doom is very fast, very fluid,

1048
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
and I feel like would make me very sick.

1049
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But the way he phrased it,

1050
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
he wasn't saying like it's just Doom ported to VR.

1051
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
He kind of was saying it's an experience.

1052
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
He kind of used some words that make me think

1053
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
it's not just a injecting VR.

1054
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Like they're doing something

1055
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
to keep the VR stuff in mind with that.

1056
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So I'd be very curious to see about that.

1057
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And then, of course, Fallout 4,

1058
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
they mentioned that will come out for the HTC Vive,

1059
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
so that'll be pretty interesting.

1060
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yeah, and Bobby in chat says,

1061
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
yeah, it's an experience in the Doom world,

1062
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
but Fallout 4 is a VR conversion of the game.

1063
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But Fallout 4 I don't think moves as fast as Doom does.

1064
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It's still a fast game, but it's a little more tempered.

1065
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And then lastly, of course, an extended, very extended,

1066
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
very, very extended look at this.

1067
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I kind of think it was a bit much.

1068
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
People are disappointed that there was no announcement

1069
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
for a new Wolfenstein,

1070
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but if you caught a glimpse

1071
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
of during that little DOS thing that they were doing

1072
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
with the different folders that were listed on there,

1073
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
they all had release dates.

1074
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Each of those folders was dated by the release of those games.

1075
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So they had Keen, 12, 14, 90, Wolf 3D, 5, 5, 92,

1076
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
New Order, 5, 20, 14,

1077
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Old Blood, 5, 5, 15,

1078
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
New Colossus, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.

1079
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So that's probably the new Wolfenstein

1080
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
that they're like, tease!

1081
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
A little tease in there.

1082
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And then, of course, the other thing.

1083
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
In the old Wolfenstein games,

1084
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
wasn't one of the battles that people remember

1085
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
when Hitler was in a colossus?

1086
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Wasn't that the boss one?

1087
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm almost positive that was one of the...

1088
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah, like he was in a mech. I remember that.

1089
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That was a whole big thing.

1090
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Maybe they're bringing something like that back.

1091
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Okay, so what about Dishonored 2, though?

1092
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It looked really pretty.

1093
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah, it looked nice.

1094
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I think the gameplay, though, was a little long.

1095
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm not that excited about it,

1096
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
but it looks cool.

1097
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I actually am interested in this one.

1098
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I wasn't at all interested in the first one,

1099
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
but now I'm interested in this one.

1100
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Well, then, mission accomplished

1101
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
on Bethesda's part, I suppose.

1102
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
No, I mean, they did try to sell me

1103
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
with the anus shots, but, you know.

1104
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, like I said,

1105
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
you got ripped, and you asshole.

1106
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
When I said shoot him in the butt, I wasn't literal.

1107
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But, Jamie, what'd you think about that deal, though,

1108
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
where if you get the game,

1109
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
you said you never really got into the first one.

1110
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Here's your chance. The first one completely remastered.

1111
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Oh, yay, you had another game in my collection

1112
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm not gonna play.

1113
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Whoopty shit.

1114
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
This one's supposed to be pretty good, actually.

1115
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Now you know why I was tempered

1116
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
when it came to the Elder Scrolls Online.

1117
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's like, uh, another game I'll never get to.

1118
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Dishonored, I feel like, is in my Steam.

1119
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Like, it came in some damn bundle a long time ago.

1120
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yeah, I think I got it.

1121
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
They were giving it away at one point,

1122
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
so, you know, they want to raise hype

1123
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
for the second game, so.

1124
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
ActDeaf, just curious what it is

1125
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
that piqued your interest in Dishonored 2, Darasaka.

1126
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Female protagonists with cool powers.

1127
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah.

1128
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I am a sucker

1129
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
for a well-developed, uh,

1130
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm trying to think of what the right word to phrase it says.

1131
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
A well-developed environment,

1132
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
meaning that you've got

1133
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
the history in the buildings,

1134
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
you've got the people going about their days.

1135
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
You can actually sit,

1136
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and people watch if you wanted to,

1137
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and it would be legit.

1138
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Like, I've followed NPCs around before

1139
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
in Fable.

1140
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I can see where they went.

1141
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And you being a big Sims fan,

1142
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that doesn't surprise me at all,

1143
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
because that's part of the big allure of The Sims,

1144
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
is watching your Sims hook up and stuff like that.

1145
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Well, not really. It's seeing how you can torture them

1146
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
until they, you know, set themselves on fire

1147
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
or drown, and then you just go build more houses.

1148
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That's The Sims for me.

1149
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But I like the artistry

1150
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
that went into it, and the depth.

1151
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And I kept thinking,

1152
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
like, when they showed that scene,

1153
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and what was the huge rail that was going in the big circle

1154
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
above their heads,

1155
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I was like, I wonder if you could get up there

1156
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and wander around.

1157
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Because one of the things I love to do in games

1158
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
is find out, how can I get to where I'm not supposed to go?

1159
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
How can I stand there?

1160
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
How can I climb there?

1161
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And so, that's what really

1162
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
set it off for me.

1163
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So, I gotta just poke you on this a little bit, because

1164
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
you know, you mentioned with Prey, you weren't interested

1165
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
because there wasn't a female protagonist,

1166
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
but I mean, I kind of, I don't know,

1167
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I guess it's limited what we know about the game so far,

1168
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
but I thought the environments were really pretty,

1169
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and I remember that about the old Prey game, so I mean,

1170
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
are you just, do you think you're really serious?

1171
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm serious, that's it.

1172
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I think...

1173
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Don't you think it's early to judge it based off that?

1174
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I mean, at least, at least

1175
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
the character was Asian too,

1176
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
which you don't see a lot of... That doesn't matter,

1177
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I don't care what their, you know,

1178
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
what their skin looks like,

1179
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I care if it's a character

1180
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that I can understand.

1181
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Huh. And so,

1182
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I think that we also do have,

1183
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
we're getting a lot more,

1184
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
you know, characters, especially, you know,

1185
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
games like Mirror's Edge with only female

1186
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
protagonists. I think we need

1187
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
more of them, and I don't,

1188
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I don't know, I guess I'm just sort of sick

1189
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
of supporting, you know,

1190
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
a male narrative

1191
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
for this long, you know? Does that make sense?

1192
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I guess,

1193
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and it's like, I understand the need for diversity

1194
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
in games, but at the same time, like, you know,

1195
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
if Prey ends up being really cool,

1196
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
maybe, you know, we just saw one trailer,

1197
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
maybe there'll be some, maybe there will be a playable woman

1198
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
in it at some point that you take over for a little bit,

1199
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
or maybe there'll be a very strong female support

1200
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
character or something? I'm tired of

1201
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
being, I'm tired of women being

1202
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
support for a man.

1203
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
In storytelling.

1204
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm tired of the women in refrigerators.

1205
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm tired of the whole thing.

1206
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
We, you know,

1207
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
it really is just so off-putting now.

1208
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I'm tired of

1209
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
giving my money to that.

1210
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And I think that, you know,

1211
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
it's time to

1212
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
to have, um,

1213
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
shut up,

1214
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
okay? Just shut up.

1215
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Is something in chat bothering you?

1216
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You're telling me it's time to rant. It's bonds006.

1217
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Oh. No, it's not a rant.

1218
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's something that needs to be said

1219
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
and there's a difference.

1220
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We,

1221
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
everybody,

1222
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I think, we're looking

1223
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
so hard for

1224
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
okay, thank you then. We look

1225
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
so, um,

1226
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and I'm not,

1227
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
we are all co-hosts.

1228
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Okay? You gotta, you gotta

1229
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
respond to what is in chat here. Okay,

1230
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Stoppy says, tired of being a supporting character

1231
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
is a co-host. No. Co-host means

1232
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
you host with people. All three

1233
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
of us. Right. And it's not

1234
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
poking fun. You said it at

1235
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
the really worst time. The

1236
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
whole point is that, especially

1237
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
in this day and age, we need to all be

1238
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
on equal footing. And when you've

1239
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
been delivered games

1240
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
historically that have all been

1241
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
written for men, that

1242
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
have all starred male characters, sometimes

1243
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
you get a point where you're a little fucking

1244
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
sick of it. Just saying.

1245
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I can understand that, that you've

1246
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
kind of hit your limit. And I hope, um,

1247
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I hope there will be

1248
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
something that, you know, comes

1249
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
from Bethesda in the future that will

1250
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
hopefully surprise you pleasantly about

1251
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Prey. But I do want to say this,

1252
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
speaking of support and all this, I do think this is worthy

1253
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
of calling out. I did think it was very awesome

1254
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
that everybody had the rainbow.

1255
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Everybody had the rainbow ribbon. I thought that was very, very

1256
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
cool. A nice gesture by the

1257
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
company. I just wanted to acknowledge. Oh, yeah.

1258
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I did find that really, really awesome.

1259
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yes. And it's just,

1260
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
you know,

1261
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
EcumaJP

1262
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
says, um, that

1263
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
men are stupid and that is why we have a

1264
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
story to tell. No, I

1265
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
don't think that, I don't think that at all.

1266
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
It's just that,

1267
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
you know,

1268
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I,

1269
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I think that

1270
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I'm just really tired of it. I'm, I'm really

1271
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
looking to have something that's going to be more

1272
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
something I can relate to. And

1273
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
not have to put myself into

1274
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
the writing of

1275
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
the character that

1276
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
in the end, I

1277
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
can't see eye to eye with.

1278
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I mean, yeah, we might

1279
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
understand on views or I might feel this way in the situation.

1280
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But in the end, I don't have that

1281
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
perspective. I don't necessarily want

1282
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
that perspective. And I'm

1283
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
tired of everything being delivered to me

1284
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
from a man's perspective. Well, these are,

1285
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
these are raw, real feelings and you're entitled

1286
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
to them, whether somebody agrees with you or not.

1287
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Um, in chat,

1288
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Alan Alchemy over at live.vongnetwork.com

1289
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
says, it's her $60. If people refuse

1290
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
to see movies with Michael Bay or Adam Sandler

1291
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
on principle, people can avoid video games

1292
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
for whatever reason they want as well.

1293
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Um, Bobby in chat with a

1294
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
counterpoint and I'll kind of let you

1295
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
respond and then close this and move on.

1296
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Uh, Bobby in chat says, I have no problem with someone

1297
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
not spending their $60 on it, but I hope this doesn't become

1298
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
a movement to limit storytellers to

1299
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
only have them be female protagonists.

1300
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
That's what I worry about. If we can get

1301
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
to a point, and I've said this before about

1302
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
every type of representation

1303
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
for every

1304
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
aspect of diversity, we need

1305
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
to get to a point where

1306
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
it doesn't matter because

1307
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
it's common. Where it becomes

1308
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
just part of the story.

1309
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Where the representation across

1310
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the board is so

1311
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
normalized that we're not

1312
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
going to see,

1313
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
oh, this is, we need a diversity

1314
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
so let's throw a woman in here.

1315
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Oh, we need them to be diverse so let's

1316
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
make her a lesbian while we're at it.

1317
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And we'll make her Asian too.

1318
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You know, it's

1319
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
not, you make this a decision to

1320
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
be diverse. It's, you make this

1321
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
a decision to tell a good story.

1322
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
This plays into who this character

1323
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
is. And my

1324
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
perfect ideal of

1325
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
equality for everybody

1326
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
is when we

1327
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
don't have to worry about

1328
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
safe spaces. When we don't

1329
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
have to worry about representation.

1330
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
When we don't have to worry

1331
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
about, oh, that's so novel that they

1332
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
did that. Or kudos to

1333
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Pixar for having a lesbian

1334
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
couple and finding Dory.

1335
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Where it's normal.

1336
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And no one has to care.

1337
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Does that make sense?

1338
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's fair, yes it does.

1339
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Alright. Let's move on.

1340
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
However, just in the interest of trying to cover

1341
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
some of these other stories before because we're obviously

1342
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
running very late tonight. We do want to try to at least

1343
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
take a couple calls over

1344
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1345
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But I think that's all we got. That was it

1346
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
for the presser, right? So Loki,

1347
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
anything you're going to be buying out of that?

1348
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Probably just Skyrim HD

1349
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and then I don't need to buy the DLC

1350
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
because I have the season pass.

1351
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Because that's why they increased the price of the season pass after

1352
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
marches because of all the additional DLC.

1353
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So I'm good there.

1354
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That's it.

1355
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I just want to mention

1356
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
this very nice closure in chat.

1357
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Bobby responding to what DarkSakura said saying

1358
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I hear you. I may not agree 100%

1359
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
but I hear you and I'm listening. And I think that's very

1360
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
nice closure on that.

1361
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Okay, so let's move on with some

1362
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
other news.

1363
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Because there's still a lot we haven't talked about yet.

1364
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So we're going to try to run through some of these stories here

1365
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
so we can get to calls. So Loki?

1366
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So there's another game that was announced, or a new game

1367
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I should say, that's being announced by Volition.

1368
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Sadly it's not another Saints Row game.

1369
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But it's a game called

1370
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Agents of Mayhem.

1371
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And it's like this futuristic

1372
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
single player game where

1373
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
you have like a team of

1374
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I don't know, almost like pirates.

1375
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But futuristic pirates I guess.

1376
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
And they have different abilities and you can switch between them.

1377
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And it looks pretty awesome.

1378
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
No multiplayer though, that's kind of sad.

1379
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It almost looks like it's sort of tied into

1380
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
the Saints but it's not. It's a completely different world

1381
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
they've confirmed. It just happens to

1382
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
have almost the same logo

1383
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and all

1384
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
tours in there. But apparently all tours also in

1385
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Red Faction so that doesn't necessarily

1386
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
mean anything. But

1387
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
yeah, they were showing that off and that should be out sometime

1388
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
in 2017 for the

1389
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
consoles and PC.

1390
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Alright, I know

1391
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
when I heard about that I definitely thought of you.

1392
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Well right, yeah I looked at it

1393
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
but I don't know. I had to see

1394
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
more of it. It's not that exciting.

1395
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I want

1396
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
a new Saints Row game.

1397
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
But I'll check it out I guess.

1398
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
If the humor's there I'm on board.

1399
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Right, yeah.

1400
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
There was a quote

1401
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
out there that was like a hoi mother fucker

1402
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
or something.

1403
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It was pretty funny.

1404
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It looks interesting. I like the art style

1405
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
so it'd be cool to see if that carries on through the game.

1406
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Sony confirming

1407
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
this week that it exists but it will

1408
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
not be at E3 and that is

1409
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Andrew House, CEO of Sony Interactive

1410
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Entertainment confirming there is

1411
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
a high-end PS4.

1412
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Not calling it the Neo or the 4K

1413
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
or any of those names that have been thrown around

1414
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
the internet. However in an interview with the

1415
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Financial Times he confirmed

1416
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
it is intended to sit alongside and

1417
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
compliment the standard PlayStation 4.

1418
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
We will be selling both

1419
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
versions through the lifecycle.

1420
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I don't like it.

1421
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I need to hear more details.

1422
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It better have sparkles.

1423
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm actually

1424
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
glad it's not at

1425
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
E3 because with the VR

1426
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
kind of being around the corner

1427
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
this tells me that they are expecting

1428
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
for this holiday that VR will be a

1429
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
solid experience without this

1430
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Neo or whatever.

1431
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I hope that's the case.

1432
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I really hope so too. Because that's gonna really

1433
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
fuck it up for me if it is because

1434
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
it's just

1435
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
you get everybody hyped up about

1436
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
your VR and then like, oh by the

1437
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
way you kind of need a new console to actually get

1438
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
to work right. You know it's like fuck you.

1439
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
That's kind of fucked up if that's the case.

1440
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So I need to see how

1441
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
it goes. I mean I have it pre-ordered.

1442
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I put the $100 down but like

1443
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I'm gonna be pissed if I spend $500

1444
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
on a PlayStation VR and then Res HD

1445
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
is the only thing I get to play. Actually

1446
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I won't be that upset.

1447
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I would assume that it will

1448
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
buy the newer system

1449
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and have it work but it's just like

1450
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I shouldn't have to

1451
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
if I'm paying like $400 for a new

1452
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
system and $400

1453
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
for the you know

1454
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
VR like

1455
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I might as well just spend a little bit more and just get a fucking

1456
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Vive and a high end PC at that point.

1457
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
That's my thing. It's like

1458
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I bought a console

1459
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
to avoid this shit.

1460
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
This like yearly update bullshit

1461
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and now they're like hmm we want some of that

1462
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
some of that cell phone tablet

1463
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Apple money. Fuck you.

1464
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I am not doing this shit

1465
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and I don't know

1466
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I'm kind of curious to see what devs think about this

1467
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
because it's just if you have to keep

1468
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
making sure oh I gotta make sure my game

1469
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
runs better on this version

1470
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
of it and not so

1471
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
not or it still runs on the other one as well

1472
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and I don't know. Yeah I gotta

1473
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
really see what this is about. I mean the

1474
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Apple cell phone thing that earns my money

1475
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
every other year at least. You know I feel like

1476
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
the upgrade is enough to justify it every other year.

1477
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But it's something that you use every day and

1478
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I mean it's something like true I

1479
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
use mine all the time and I don't necessarily do

1480
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
anything graphically intensive on it. It's not like

1481
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I'm

1482
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
those things can pack a punch.

1483
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So right now I understand that but like

1484
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I feel

1485
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
you know I can get by for

1486
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
a few years if I don't want to

1487
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
necessarily do all this stuff but like I'm

1488
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
not I don't buy

1489
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
my phone to game on and I'm not

1490
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
buying one every other year or so.

1491
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I mean I tend to buy mine until it just

1492
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
doesn't fucking work anymore then I'll buy a new one.

1493
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And that's I think how it should be with the

1494
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
consoles. If you're going to keep coming out with new consoles

1495
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
each year like call them a different

1496
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
console or something. I mean just

1497
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I don't like this just

1498
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
upgrading specs. If I want to just upgrade specs

1499
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
every year that's a PC.

1500
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I'm buying a PC at that point.

1501
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Why am I supporting the consoles then?

1502
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Alright. Let's move

1503
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
on with some more news though so we can get to calls.

1504
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Dark Soccer do you want to take this next story?

1505
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Yes.

1506
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Speaking back on representation

1507
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
there was some

1508
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
negativity unleashed toward Ubisoft

1509
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
regarding Watch Dogs 2.

1510
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
There's a bunch of racist

1511
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
assholes out there who

1512
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
are upset that the hero

1513
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
of Watch Dogs 2 is black.

1514
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
A black hacktivist.

1515
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
What's wrong with you

1516
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
people? What is wrong

1517
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
with you? No stop. Stop right

1518
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
now if you're listening to this podcast look

1519
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
in the mirror and say me

1520
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1521
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I give

1522
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
our listeners a lot of credit that they're pretty

1523
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
intelligent to be listening to this show. Yes.

1524
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Honestly I'm going to say this very bluntly

1525
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
anybody that felt that way

1526
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
would have already tuned out on your

1527
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
last rant. Let's be real. Well fuck them too.

1528
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So I mean if they've made it

1529
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
this far I think people understand.

1530
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Who cares what the skin color is of the

1531
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
protagonist. Some people care because

1532
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
they're stupid. But we need to know

1533
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
whether the game is going to just be all

1534
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
downgraded like it was before. That's what

1535
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I'm interested to find out. I think

1536
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
yay for

1537
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
there being a black person in the lead.

1538
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I think that is great. And who gives a

1539
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
shit about a black person being the lead? There's a black

1540
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
person in the lead of Grand Theft Auto 5

1541
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
which sold 60 million copies.

1542
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I don't think you fucking care.

1543
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I mean seriously. Very true.

1544
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Who gives a shit?

1545
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Very true. Yeah so if

1546
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
it's just

1547
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Twitter needs to just be taken

1548
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
away from some people.

1549
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It's just people dislike things.

1550
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And people

1551
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
dislike all sorts of things. And they

1552
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
whatever. I mean you can't

1553
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
please everybody. Honestly

1554
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I wouldn't want to run into these people online anyway

1555
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
so it's probably best they don't get the game.

1556
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
It's just like I mean 60 million people

1557
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
though. If they had such a problem with it

1558
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
they wouldn't have bought Grand Theft Auto 5

1559
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
60 million times.

1560
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Let's move on Loki.

1561
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Alright so this is pretty exciting.

1562
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
You know I didn't quite buy in

1563
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
on this whole Lego Dimensions

1564
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
thing originally.

1565
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Oh I'm sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here.

1566
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Oh no we actually missed that last time.

1567
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
So let me cover the Lego Dimensions thing real

1568
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
fast. And I'll get

1569
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
to the other thing. So Lego Dimensions

1570
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
they announced basically their

1571
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
season 2 or I guess the new set of

1572
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
properties that are going to be attached

1573
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
to this. And I got to say I am super

1574
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
excited about it. It's like before they

1575
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
had the whole thing where it's kind of the cross

1576
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
franchises. You know you have Back to

1577
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
the Future. Fucking Doctor Who.

1578
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
You know all this stuff going together. Now

1579
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
it's just it's fucking

1580
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
crazy 80's shit.

1581
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So here's what they've got.

1582
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
They've got A-Team, Adventure

1583
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Time, Harry Potter

1584
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

1585
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
The Goonies, Gremlins

1586
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Knight Rider

1587
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Fucking Lego City Undercover, Sonic the Hedgehog

1588
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Powerpuff Girls, Teen Titans Go

1589
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Beetlejuice and E.T.

1590
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It's pretty badass. That is

1591
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
fucking amazing. I feel like this is

1592
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
a game that's aimed towards 30 somethings

1593
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and I'm eating it up. It's just like they're like

1594
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
hey we know where the money is and damn

1595
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
right you know where the money is and it's fucking

1596
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Legos so you know what if that

1597
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and they just they just walked into a

1598
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
what's that new store called we went to an art

1599
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
firm called the Brick House is that what it's called?

1600
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's that new store that's just like a bunch of like nerd stuff

1601
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
and I swear to god the Lego people just went there and went

1602
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
we're gonna get that that that that

1603
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
that that that like every

1604
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
shirt in the store they're like we need that license

1605
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
that license and then of course I

1606
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
missed they also have

1607
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
the main campaign

1608
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
that's gonna be in there is the new Ghostbusters

1609
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
movie that's as well and it

1610
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
it's not something and what's cool about this you don't

1611
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
need to buy

1612
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
a new portal or anything it works with the old

1613
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
portal and those will work for any future

1614
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
versions of the game as well it's coming out September

1615
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
27th but the only thing that really

1616
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
stopped me from buying this originally is the price

1617
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
because it's a Lego premium those sets are

1618
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
like $30 for each of the expansions

1619
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and like the the actual toys

1620
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
are like $20 it gets really expensive

1621
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
yeah but it's

1622
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
really hard you'll pay it for the Goonies it's

1623
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
really hard to like not want to buy all

1624
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
this shit so that's

1625
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
the only problem and uh Bobby

1626
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
in chat pointing out it's not Lego Dimensions 2

1627
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
it's just the regular Lego dimensions

1628
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
yeah it's just more stuff

1629
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
which which is great

1630
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
it is they're not gonna like incrementally

1631
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
you know do more that's great but like seriously

1632
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
that's like fucking 80s

1633
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
crazy right there

1634
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
alright um well let's

1635
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
move on and um

1636
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I'm not sure our show role seems a little

1637
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
borked right now I think some old stuff got in there somehow but

1638
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm going to move on to this story about

1639
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I skipped what the story was I had because it was honestly

1640
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
not that interesting

1641
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
well let's talk about the Dorito machine

1642
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
that's at E3 have you guys seen the pictures

1643
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
of this going up there's a gigantic

1644
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
arcade game in the middle of the

1645
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
street uh and I'm assuming

1646
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
it's in one of those parking lots around the area

1647
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
yes I can imagine all the traffic that would cause

1648
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
from being in oh my I would know

1649
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
how am I I don't know what the fuck is this

1650
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Doritos machine doing here it's gonna be a mess

1651
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
uh but anyway uh

1652
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
there's a bunch of other fan stuff going around but there's a

1653
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
huge Doritos arcade thing

1654
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
uh that is gonna be having I guess

1655
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
concerts on one level of it and

1656
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
then like a giant screen I mean it just

1657
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I thought it was a giant Trojan horse to get Jeff

1658
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Keeley into the actual E3 event

1659
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
he is after all the Doritos pope

1660
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
it's kinda neat I guess it's visibility

1661
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
for all of E3 but it's a little

1662
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
bit like okay this is a bit

1663
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
it's just funny that it's Doritos too

1664
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
does it have fountains that shoot Mountain Dew on it

1665
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
when somebody gets a new high score just everybody

1666
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
gets sprayed with Mountain Dew

1667
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
it actually sounds disgusting

1668
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
alright um

1669
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
let's talk our last story tonight

1670
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000

1671
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
last story for me showing Rob

1672
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000

Open just think uh six hours

1722
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
a day everyday of rich men hitting

1723
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
white balls on perfectly manicured grass

1724
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
so I'm looking for suggestions

1725
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
on what I should cook for dinner

1726
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
on Thursday and Friday by the way included

1727
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
underneath this recipe I'm cooking tonight

1728
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
steak hair Redertainment and it's sauteed

1729
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
chicken cutlets with wine sauce

1730
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
you wanna know what? what?

1731
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I have in my freezer right now

1732
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
marinated chicken thighs

1733
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
in Beaujolais

1734
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
with herbs de provence

1735
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
the answer my friend

1736
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
if you're wondering what to cook the answer

1737
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
is always tacos

1738
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
tacos

1739
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
uh there you go

1740
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
did anybody take time off work for E3

1741
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
this year? I did not

1742
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I thought about it but no I didn't

1743
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
but see with the job that I have now or at least

1744
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
the position I'm in I can listen to the podcast

1745
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
most of the day so I'm just gonna

1746
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
watch the presentations while I work

1747
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that's nice so I'm just gonna do that

1748
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
sadly I will not have that option

1749
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I teach tomorrow so I'm in a class

1750
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
all day so pretty I'll get to watch

1751
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Sony but I will not get to watch Microsoft

1752
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
which is kind of a bummer so I'll just have to kind of

1753
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
catch the highlight reel

1754
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
yeah I might be the vice versa cause I'm gonna be having the

1755
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
wrangle kids during Sony so

1756
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I usually try to catch it

1757
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
while I'm cooking dinner or something

1758
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but

1759
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and then I'm very curious about the Zelda stuff

1760
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
on Tuesday what that all is gonna

1761
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
entail

1762
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
my hype is not that great for

1763
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
well that's good to set the bar low

1764
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
well I mean I'm

1765
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
excited about the game but I'm just like

1766
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
is that it? I mean like I really wish they

1767
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
had a presentation of some

1768
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
sort of showing the other things

1769
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
cause I know they have more than just Zelda

1770
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
there are other things but they're not talking

1771
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
about it for why

1772
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I don't understand the reason for that

1773
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
yeah

1774
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
let's get to the phones it's your chance to

stories we wanna try and work in here Loki

1791
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
so you know how there is all these

1792
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Microsoft leaks and

1793
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
not only did the new system come out but

1794
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Dead Rising 4 is another thing that got

1795
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
leaked out with actual gameplay

1796
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
right

1797
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
also ReCore was another thing

1798
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
so GameSpot decided to email

1799
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Microsoft to get their comment on the leaks

1800
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and all they did was send them

1801
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
a Shruggy like

1802
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
an Aski Shrug

1803
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and then a link to their E3

1804
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
page and they're like eh

1805
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
that was their official response

1806
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I thought that was funny

1807
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I'm glad they have a sense of humor about it

1808
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
that's funny stay tuned

1809
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
sounds like Bloodstained Ritual

1810
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
of the Night will be playable at E3

1811
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
2016 I'm excited to see

1812
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
what comes out of that

1813
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
didn't they just release a playable version of that

1814
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
or they were supposed to be releasing

1815
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
some sort of beta or something

1816
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I saw something I think either this week or last

1817
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Raginator

1818
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
in chat is saying no love for GOG this week

1819
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
big GOG deals

1820
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we gave a little love to GOG last week

1821
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
to be fair and they're not paying us

1822
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
but since you brought it up

1823
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
this is the season for summer sales

1824
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I'm sure GOG's got theirs

1825
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
what Steam's ought to be in a couple of weeks

1826
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
they already have the cards up

1827
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
there's a pretty good Humble Bundle right now too

1828
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I haven't checked it out

1829
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
but yeah I do need to get that one because that's the one that has

1830
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
that cool drifting game in it

1831
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
again Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

1832
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
you know what we didn't talk about that also leaked

1833
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
was Injustice 2

1834
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
did you check any of that out? Injustice 2

1835
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
it looked okay I mean I didn't play the first one

1836
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I have it for free since they gave it away

1837
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
like a couple of years ago

1838
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
so I gotta check that out

1839
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
some DLC apparently already

1840
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
being teased now people are reading into

1841
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
some of the things that Ed Boon is saying but some of the

1842
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
teased DLC Blue Beetle

1843
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Captain Cold and Swamp Thing

1844
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
one of the things

1845
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
though I didn't really care for about it

1846
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
they were saying that they have like it's almost

1847
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
it sounds like

1848
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
the Overwatch loot crates that you get

1849
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
or something so you basically get

1850
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
these like unlocks for different armors

1851
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
or something after

1852
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
each match or something and I guess you

1853
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
can pay to get more of those or something

1854
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't know I didn't really catch that

1855
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
on the Nintendo

1856
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
side did you see the two new Pokemon for

1857
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Sun and Moon that was in the magazine

1858
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
oh I don't give a shit about that

1859
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
they looked really cute though I will say there was like a cute

1860
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
little koala bear looking thing

1861
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
like holding a log and he's like

1862
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
this is my log kind of like the log lady from Twin Peaks

1863
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
this is my log and then there was like a little

1864
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
puppy thingy too so it was

1865
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
cute I mean if Pokemon

1866
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
need to be cute right because someday

1867
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
they might be in Pokemon Go I mean I know

1868
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Pokemon Go is only the first 150

1869
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
they keep adding Pokemon to it because they have like

1870
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
107 was the max and now it's like

1871
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
130 something

1872
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
yeah I think Porygon

1873
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
is as high as it goes in the Pokedex so far

1874
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I think

1875
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
yeah we'll see no I think it's higher

1876
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
than that now I don't know we'll see

1877
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
anyway also

1878
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
World of Final Fantasy is

1879
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
launching in October

1880
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
hmm did you check out the

1881
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
footage for World of Final Fantasy I'll be checking

1882
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that out that looks pretty cool I don't

1883
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
remember what that is

1884
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
it is the extra

1885
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Final Fantasy game that's the one that they were

1886
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
teasing that I think is

1887
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
the experience that is specifically made

1888
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
for I'm trying to remember if this is the one

1889
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
about the cell phones

1890
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
no this is different this is the

1891
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
one that's kind of more appealing to children

1892
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and they showed like a real

1893
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
brief teaser of it last year

1894
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
it's going to be on Playstation 4 and Playstation Vita

1895
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and it's going to come out October 25th

1896
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
you remember there was a real quick glimpse of this

1897
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
at the Playstation thing last year and it was like very

1898
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
chibi Final Fantasy characters and all that

1899
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
yeah

1900
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
it's going to be very busy for Final Fantasy

1901
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
this year with Final Fantasy 15 coming out

1902
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
very soon

1903
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I

1904
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
will put out one more call for calls

1905
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and then I'm going to assume people just

1906
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
got caught up in watching Morgan Webb

1907
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
and Adam Sessler and didn't come back

1908
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Orange Lounge Radio

1909
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
all one word on Skype

1910
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
of course if you didn't get through on Skype tonight

1911
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
if you were doing other stuff tonight and weren't able to join us live

1912
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
you can always send us an email

1913
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

1914
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
you know I did just remember

1915
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
we did the mailbag

1916
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and then we did not do the FUs of the week

1917
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
which usually comes right after the mailbag

1918
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
so I think this is a good opportunity for us to get

1919
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
a little bit ranty

1920
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
all this is bad

1921
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
here is justice

1922
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
here is punishment

1923
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
here

1924
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
is it fucked up

1925
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
FU

1926
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
to haters everywhere

1927
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
especially the ones who decide

1928
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
to act on it

1929
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and FU to this asshole that my sister is

1930
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
friends with I don't know what the fuck caught up to your ass

1931
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
but you suck

1932
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
uh Loki

1933
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
um FU in my car

1934
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
cause the other day as I was leaving the show

1935
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
my check engine light came on

1936
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and the drive light was flashing

1937
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
which means the transmission problem

1938
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
except the problem is my car is driving just fine

1939
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and then a day later it went off

1940
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
so I'm gonna assume everything is okay

1941
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
until it finally breaks

1942
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I don't know it's buggy

1943
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and blame it

1944
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
you know what the problem was

1945
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and the reason it came on

1946
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
some dumb ass little ass dog

1947
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
in the car instead of killing it

1948
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I decided to swerve a little bit to the left

1949
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and hit the brakes

1950
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
and then the stupid light came on

1951
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
so apparently there was a loose sensor or some shit

1952
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
fucking dog

1953
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
shit killed your ass

1954
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
don't talk about killing your dog

1955
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I didn't though

1956
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I can say that now because he's still alive

1957
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
uh I'm gonna just defer

1958
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
to what I said at the opening of the show

1959
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
for my FU of the week

1960
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
honestly that's all the anger I have

1961
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
in that department right now so there you go

1962
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
alright um

1963
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I guess I guess that's

1964
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
oh wait last minute

1965
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
somebody's waiting at the last minute to call in

1966
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
but let's get to it hi you're on orange songs radio who's this

1967
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
hey this is akdef

1968
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
hey akdef thanks for not leaving us too lonely this week

1969
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
in the skype segment I was getting a little worried

1970
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
what's on your mind

1971
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
well

1972
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
uh

1973
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I'm gonna ask you a question

1974
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
first of all

1975
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
yeah

1976
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
to all of you

1977
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I don't know if it can be plausible

1978
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
but how exciting

1979
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
would it be to have

1980
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
like nintendo

1981
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
announcing okay since

1982
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
you saw the demo

1983
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
for Legend of Zelda for Wii U

1984
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and NX

1985
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
we're gonna have it on the eShop right now

1986
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
and you can download it on

1987
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
well in this case on tuesday

1988
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
how exciting would that be

1989
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I wish but

1990
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
we're past those days unfortunately

1991
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
those were the days of the early

1992
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
xbox 360 and what 2006

1993
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
c3 2005 c3

1994
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
sadly those days are gone

1995
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
they would not put it up because it would be reversed engineered

1996
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
people would start modding it

1997
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
doing crazy crap to it trying to dig through the files

1998
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
find secrets and I mean

1999
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I think nintendo's probably just focused

2000
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
on finishing the damn game

2001
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
it's probably enough of an inconvenience for them to have to do

2002
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
this e3 thing anyway which by the way

2003
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I think you're not seeing the nx version

2004
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
at e3 because

2005
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
you know they have to cut a demo specifically

2006
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
for e3

2007
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
but we do live in a day and age

2008
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
of live streaming and so

2009
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
maybe you're not gonna be able to play the demo yourself

2010
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
but you'll be able to watch somebody else

2011
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
do it live like right

2012
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
there you know the one thing that's gonna be

2013
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
missing is the controller so

2014
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I think maybe that's just

2015
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
what they want that'll be a little more controlled

2016
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I think that's just what it boils down to

2017
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
well that's for sure

2018
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
well if we don't have at least

2019
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
that surprise announcement

2020
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
what surprise announcement

2021
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
would you like from

2022
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
well for many of the companies left

2023
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
on e3

2024
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
from

2025
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
nintendo

2026
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
there's the rumors going around

2027
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
about earthbound 3

2028
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
or mother 3 you know whatever they're gonna end up

2029
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
calling it I would really love to

2030
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
see that become a reality I'm not gonna hold my

2031
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
breath too much

2032
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
but from nintendo I've just kind of accepted the

2033
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
fact that it's just not gonna happen this year

2034
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I just need to wait till next year

2035
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I am still gonna really hope that

2036
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and I know it

2037
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
sounds weird to talk about old shit

2038
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
but I really would like to hear that maybe

2039
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Microsoft is gonna make a major expansion

2040
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
on the backwards compatibility catalog

2041
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
this week

2042
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and perhaps that Playstation 1

2043
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
games will be playable at least

2044
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Playstation 1 games will be playable again on

2045
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Playstation 4 I really really think it's time

2046
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
and that would be a very nice surprise

2047
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I would look forward to which I know is weird to talk

2048
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
about old shit but this is

2049
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
important this is the reason why so cause I don't want

2050
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
you going well Rob they're gonna talk about

2051
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
old shit at e3 then what the fuck is the

2052
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
point of e3 because you

2053
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
can still have the old shit but with the

2054
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
new frills that have

2055
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
bridged the Playstation 3 and Playstation

2056
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
4 you know what was the big

2057
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
jump we took this generation

2058
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
the social end of things right

2059
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
so if I can play the Playstation 1 games

2060
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
and stream them or

2061
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
do the share play things so I

2062
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
can play with friends

2063
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
across a great distance that's

2064
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
gonna breathe whole new life into

2065
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
some of the old library there so

2066
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
that's why I get excited

2067
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
about the old games and the new shell

2068
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if that makes sense

2069
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
yeah it absolutely

2070
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
makes sense like I was actually

2071
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
thinking right now that

2072
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
when they announced that

2073
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
new bibriven was coming to

2074
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
beta and Playstation 3 like

2075
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
2 years ago or

2076
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
at least yeah I think 2 years

2077
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
ago right yeah

2078
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and I was thinking they never

2079
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
like follow

2080
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
follow that up like

2081
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
they should probably

2082
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
yeah announce like oh

2083
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
you can now play Playstation 1

2084
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
games on PS4 like bibriven

2085
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
and hey we're gonna announce

2086
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
a new bibriven with

2087
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
3 support or at least digital

2088
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
yeah and that never happened

2089
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
on Playstation 4 it happened on 3 but not

2090
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
4 so yeah be curious

2091
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I do wanna

2092
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
point this out as well when it comes to Sony

2093
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
is that I think Sony is under

2094
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and for me like an expectation I really

2095
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
have of them is to deliver

2096
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
something really big this holiday

2097
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and you know I

2098
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
fully expect there'll probably be a God of War 4

2099
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
announcement I don't think it'll be ready for this holiday

2100
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
but I think something they've been

2101
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
teasing us with over the past couple years

2102
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
they need to date for this holiday

2103
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
like it's fucking time already Sony needs to

2104
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
put up with some of the stuff that they've been showing

2105
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
my gut tells me

2106
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Last Guardian is gonna be that game finally

2107
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
will be that game and that's what we're gonna get this holiday

2108
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that's just cause I don't think it's Final Fantasy 7

2109
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
not with 15 this year

2110
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
it certainly ain't Kingdom Hearts 3

2111
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
uh especially with you know

2112
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
2.8 is gonna be that game anyway I kinda

2113
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
think it's time the game looked

2114
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
to be far enough along and what we saw last year

2115
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I really think Last Guardian is that game and that's my expectation

2116
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
yeah that's

2117
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
probably true

2118
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
let me ask you this question

2119
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
before I let you go ActDeft there was a

2120
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
pretty big game that came out a couple days ago

2121
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
which sadly we've all been distracted

2122
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
in other ways we haven't been able to talk about it but I know

2123
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I know you have had to have spent

2124
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
some time with Kirby RoboBot

2125
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
oh yeah

2126
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Kirby Planet RoboBot I was actually gonna

2127
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
ask you well all of you

2128
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
why haven't you played that game but

2129
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
but yeah we have all been

2130
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
pretty occupied even me

2131
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I have that game

2132
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
right now in front of me it's even

2133
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
like on my 3DS

2134
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
right now but I haven't started

2135
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
yet I have been so

2136
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
busy this weekend so

2137
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I haven't gotten the time to play it

2138
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
uh

2139
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
especially with Nintendo's calendar

2140
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
being a little funky where the games come out

2141
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
on Friday now right?

2142
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I can never remember what day is anymore

2143
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I think that's just you know

2144
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and I'm gonna be honest ActDeft

2145
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I like Kirby but do I like

2146
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Kirby enough to drop that money on it

2147
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I kinda just need to hear some of the feedback

2148
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
first and see if it's something that

2149
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I really think is gonna be up my alley before I drop

2150
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
the 30 bucks on it

2151
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
well if something I have been watching

2152
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
and reading reviews it's getting a lot of positive

2153
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
reviews that's good

2154
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
it's one of

2155
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
and even some of my friends

2156
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
that aren't

2157
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
into Kirby

2158
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
are really liking it right now

2159
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
so that's something

2160
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I just

2161
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I'm waiting even to

2162
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
just do all art to finish so I can play it

2163
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
alright

2164
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
then we're gonna let you go so we can wrap it up

2165
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
ActDeft

2166
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
alright take care my friend

2167
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
thanks for having me

2168
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
alright good call

2169
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I don't really see the

2170
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
phones lighting up and we're well after

2171
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
9 o'clock here on the west coast I think we are going

2172
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
to shut things down here

2173
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
at Orange Lounge Radio but I do wanna

2174
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
thank all you guys for listening again this

2175
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
week really appreciate it I know it was a bit of a shorter

2176
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
show for those of you guys on the podcast feed but again

2177
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
remember there was a big hour

2178
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
15 minute chunk that we lost there while we were

2179
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
watching the press conference

2180
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
as I'm sure a lot of you were

2181
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
over the weekend but we will be back

2182
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
next excuse me

2183
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
we will be back next

2184
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
week to do a full recap of

2185
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
E3 to talk about our

2186
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
impressions of what we do see from Microsoft

2187
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Sony, Nintendo

2188
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
who else still has to go? Ubisoft

2189
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
got one to go, PC

2190
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Conference which again I'm not

2191
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
expecting much out of but you never know

2192
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
yeah let me see what we got on the list here real fast

2193
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I feel like I'm missing somebody

2194
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
does Square have a conference? No they already

2195
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
they did like their stream already

2196
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
yeah they dropped their hints already

2197
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
let's see here so there is

2198
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
god dammit

2199
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
tomorrow ok here we go here we go

2200
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
so we've got

2201
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
ok so EA and Bethesda have already gone

2202
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
yep apparently also

2203
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
in just a few minutes

2204
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
there's also one from Kadokawa

2205
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I have no idea what that is that's in

2206
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
20 minutes actually from now

2207
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
tomorrow's Microsoft then PC Gaming

2208
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Ubisoft and then Sony

2209
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
and then Nintendo has their stream

2210
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
on Tuesday so really it's all

2211
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
they're blowing their load tomorrow

2212
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
well that's typical though for E3 week

2213
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
so they

2214
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
usually stretch out their conferences like multiple

2215
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
days though like you'd have like EA and stuff

2216
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
normally well only because

2217
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
usually after Nintendo is Square Enix

2218
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
but for some reason and last year actually

2219
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
didn't somebody feel like there were two people

2220
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
kind of in that slot last year so

2221
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I think that was lost a little bit this year

2222
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
oh it was the PC thing

2223
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
because with having

2224
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
EA bump up a day I think that really shifted

2225
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
things so it

2226
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
does feel a little different this year it's going to be very different E3

2227
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
but I'm excited to hear from some of the folks

2228
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
who are at the show I'm hoping we can get some of our other

2229
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
VoG people who actually went to the show

2230
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
maybe on the show next week to talk about it a little bit

2231
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
and then of course

2232
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
we'll give our own perspective and we can't wait to hear

2233
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
what you guys have to say let's hope for some good

2234
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
surprises we'll have fun

2235
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
as I end every episode

2236
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
of Orange on Tradio thank you guys so much for tuning into

2237
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
the show and if you enjoyed what you heard here

2238
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
please tell a friend or two about the show

2239
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
spread the word leave a nice 5 star

2240
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
review wherever you found this show because we are

2241
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't put

2242
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
those voices out there unless we

2243
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
have them and you know I think

2244
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
one thing we've definitely learned tonight perspective

2245
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
and hearing from other people

2246
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
can definitely be helpful

2247
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I think we can all learn from that so we want

2248
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
we want more of your voices out there to be

2249
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
participating with our show so

2250
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
let's go around now and give everybody's

2251
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
final thought Loki

2252
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I can't wait to see

2253
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
what they've got in store for

2254
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Microsoft and Sony

2255
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Microsoft a lot of it's been kind of

2256
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
spoiled but

2257
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
so interested

2258
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
to find out what they have

2259
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I'm curious to see what the

2260
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I'm assuming they're all going to be quiet about it

2261
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I kind of want to know what's going on with these new systems

2262
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
it means why are you keeping us in the dark about

2263
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
this shit do you not know what the fuck

2264
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
is going in them because it seems like

2265
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
even with like the NX I heard rumors

2266
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
that they're like not manufacturing yet because they

2267
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
may add VR to it it's like they don't even know what

2268
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
the fuck is going to be going in those systems yet

2269
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
why do we

2270
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
need them if you don't know what they're for

2271
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I don't know

2272
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
my final thought is the fall is

2273
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
looking almost as interesting as the summer

2274
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
at this point with what we were talking about at the beginning of the show

2275
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm very curious

2276
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
to see what happens in the

2277
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
fall and where all this stuff lands with these

2278
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
announcements we haven't had quite yet

2279
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
but dear god please don't let

2280
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Mass Effect get delayed again unless

2281
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
unless they really really need it to make it a

2282
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
good game and I'll understand but I just

2283
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I really want that game out oh my god

2284
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and last but not least Dark Soccer your final thought

2285
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
well two things but they're related and

2286
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
kind of a downer okay

2287
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I was reading a post about

2288
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
cops going through

2289
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Pulse and hearing

2290
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
phones ringing for people who wouldn't answer them

2291
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
yeah awful and then I just

2292
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
saw a post one of my friends posted

2293
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
one from a lady who was trying to find her

2294
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
son who was there and hadn't heard from

2295
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
him in hours she

2296
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
he's alive in critical condition

2297
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
but he's alive

2298
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
so one of the lucky ones our thoughts

2299
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
pull through yeah so

2300
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
um just people

2301
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
out there don't take anyone you love

2302
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
for granted stay close

2303
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
stay in touch and

2304
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
if you see anyone spouting

2305
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
any kind of hateful

2306
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
rhetoric you shut them down

2307
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
that's all

2308
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
alright and we are now gonna

2309
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
