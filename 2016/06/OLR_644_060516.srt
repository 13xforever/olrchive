6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, June the 5th of 2016, with episode number 644 of our show, broadcasting live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, by my side as she is every week for the past 644 weeks.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hi.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi, how are you?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm okay. I look awful in this picture though.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, I don't like the way I look in my picture either.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So DarkSakura and I went clubbing Friday night, just so you guys know.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We went out to a bar because you know DarkSakura and I love drag queens.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I'm not trying to push a drag queen agenda on this show, but it's going to happen sometimes.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And you really should always walk into a club purse first, if you're not already doing so.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But anyway, so we went to see one of the big drag queen stars, Bob the Drag Queen, who was here on Friday.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And we paid to get our picture taken with Bob, and of course we're looking at the pictures going, God we look awful.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think Jamie looks fine, and she says I look fine, but of course, you know how that is.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You see pictures of yourself, and you're like, oh God.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, DarkSakura and I are having that moment right now.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But you look good, DarkSakura, and your face was beat for the gods.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, ma.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, if it took an hour to wash off, one would hope so.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But oh my God, at least my makeup got me a free drink.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Did it really?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Because that guy, there was this guy, I was walking around with my fan, I broke my shade fan.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Fanning everyone, letting everyone fan themselves.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And this one guy's like, oh, I can do one better, and he holds this ice cube over my head.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, God.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Dripped water onto my mug.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I'm like, ah!

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And his girlfriend's like, no, stop!

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Or whoever was with him.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
A, try not to scream into the mic, please.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And B, the things that drunk people do.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I'm sitting here with my foundation going pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And he's like, oh my God, can I make it up?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me buy you a drink.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It reminds me of the nastiest drink ever, but I don't care because it was free vodka.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It was like well vodka and crap ginger ale, but whatever.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It was free.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, but we had a good time.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's what's important.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We did.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Except, uh, Dar Sacher and I got, well, I did.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I got very, very, very, very toasty drunk, which I haven't done since I was like, well, now that Alan drives, I have a designated driver when I go out.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, Alan just commented.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, did he? Yeah, there it is.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And doppy, I will tell you this.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't care if people think I'm a drag queen because just wait until gamer X.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Drag cosplay.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You heard it here first.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's happening.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sure we all look forward to it.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Meanwhile, we got to also say hello over there to somebody.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Unfortunately, who doesn't join us on our Friday night adventures, but we still love to have him here.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Say hi to tech master Loki.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I would love to go, but you know, kids, uh, someday there'll be 18 Loki and we're going to get you all caught up on everything you missed.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All right.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We'll only be about what, 50, 50 years old by the time.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey, purse first.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Uh, how have you been doing? I know you were having some drama with your air conditioner, which the heat here in Sacramento, we're in that lovely part of the year where it's triple degree heat.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I know we have listeners in Arizona who are like, fucking fuck you, but it's bad for us.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Whatever you chose to live there. Okay.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well enough how, how hot it is here.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And we chose to live here, Loki.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Uh, but, uh, your AC was broken for God's sake. That's a horrible, horrible thing, but you're all better now, right?

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, we got a new AC, new first. So we had them replace everything and it was nice the day that they replaced it because you know, I had no, it was pretty hot during the week.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It got up to 90 in the house. So while I was sitting there playing games, um, so I had a fan on, I'm like, this is not doing anything.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I had like three fans on. I have a ceiling fan. I had a box fan and as small fan, they brought from work.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So it's just like all on me at the same time. Like this is just drying me out cause it's just hot air being blown onto me.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Staying hydrated is the most important thing.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't even matter at that point. I mean, like I was drinking tons of water. It's just, it's not, it's just unbearable.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This heat wave is everywhere right now. Um, in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network, vognetwork.com

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show and William murder face and chat saying it's a hundred in Portland, which is, is not common for them.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So there's, you know, heat waves everywhere right now. So it's kind of gross. Yeah.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And it wasn't so bad. I mean, cause like the last, like the last few days before the day I took off to actually have them install it, um, it was, it was hot in the house, but we would go out other places.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then I like had rigged up a air conditioner radiator thing using a box fan and some copper pipe. And so I actually did that and it worked somewhat, but you know, basically you select the box fans in the windows, sucked in the cool air.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Once it cooled down a little bit and it was pretty bearable. It's just, it's, you know, hot, but yeah, 90 degrees when they finally, Oh, then on top of that, you know, Hey, yeah.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, you're going to hate hearing this, but we got to test the heater. So we got to turn the heater on for like five minutes. I'm like, bangs. Oh boy.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, at least you can get, get out of the way when it's working. Now it's working great. So, uh, I want to tell one other quick story that's non gaming related.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then I promise we'll get into all the good video gaming content for, for the next three hours ish. Um, but I do want to mention, uh, the funny followup to dark soccer and I go into the club.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we're up until 2 AM because that's what people who have been drinking do. We find ourselves at Denny's. That's how, you know, we're drunk cause we allowed ourselves to eat at Denny's eating food that is incredibly crap for you.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Um, and then I kind of realized at some point, Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be up at seven in the morning cause I'm doing a five K on Saturday. So in the heat on Saturday, thank God it was a little more overcast yesterday, but I, I actually walked.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I didn't run it, but, uh, with coworkers, I walked a five K and it was, it was interesting because the whole, you know how like every, every marathon they do has some type of theme to it.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's, that's the big thing, right? Themed runs. I don't know if you guys have coworkers in this or seen this, but like,

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This marathon's theme is we're making you run even though you don't want to.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay. Well, I know a big famous one is the beat the blurch thing. That's by the oatmeal guy, right? Where they actually have the blurches chase you around. Uh, Disneyland does one all the time. They do, Oh, they do night runs, right?

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They do the color run where you throw the colored powder on. They totally just stole that from that holiday in India. They just, you know, you throw the color packets on each other.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I still want to do the, um, the mud run one day.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They have that. Okay.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Which is a military obstacle course.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So the twist on this one was that it was bubbles everywhere. And as you were running, you would, and you would think they would be like literally everywhere, but because we're in a drought, they, they had to, um, they had to, I guess, ration out the bubbles.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So every kilometer you would run right through, it's like going through a fricking carwash or something. This just bubble overload everywhere. And it's just ridiculous.

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But nobody told me the bubble would have dye in it. So if I showed you the socks I wore yesterday, they are ruined. They're like red, green, blue, all the stupid bubble colors all over.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Save them for next year's pride.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And yeah, the ironic thing was this was the same day as, as pride in Sacramento, which I didn't go to because the heat I knew it was going to be killer.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So anyway, uh, act deft and chat says, fucking bubbles. Yeah. That's what I was saying at the end of it.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Uh, dark Tetsuya says way to adult Rob. Yep. Uh, let's see.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
SG100 Matt says I've ran two five K's in the past year. It's a great experience and I'm happy I did them.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, I understand. And I think that's great if you're trying to get fit and all that stuff, but my God, the people running these things have to be making a killing.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, cause they what? They charge you 20 bucks to do it and they get thousands of people to sign up for these things.

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't imagine it costs that much money to put, you know, these little silly things at the stations and stuff. It's $10 for parking.

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They charge for shirts at the end. If you want shirts, they charge you to register the day of whoever's running these things is making a killing.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's why there's so many of these damn things. Like every month over it, over at the County fairgrounds, there's some type of fricking five K run going on.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But anyway, Alan alchemy is in chat saying the socks look like they were soaked in cherry Kool-Aid. I want to just throw them away.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, that's probably what will be happening. All right. And act deaf says VOG five K. Uh, sure. I don't, I don't think we could get thousands and thousands of people to show up for that, but we could, we could do a five K lap around the dragon con hotels.

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maybe that's something just dragon con do a five K I'm kind of surprised they don't VOG five K in the, in the VOG five K you have to play 5,000 video games and walk five meters.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They're all video games that dark soccer has selected to personally torture you with. Wait, wait, what? The VOG five K you're going to pick 5,000 video games for people to play 5,000.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes. All right. First thing I actually have that many first game everybody has to play. Well, how much do I hate everybody? A lot. Clue Clue land.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please look forward to it. The VOG five K featuring clue clue land.

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, no, no. Better yet. Cheetah man. All right. That'll be the second game. That'd be the second game is cheetah man. All right. Anyway, Bible adventures.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Um, well, let's get into some gaming talk. So before we get to our gaming weeks, the type of games we've been playing this week that didn't involve running and bubbles and all this stuff.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's talk a little bit about, um, gaming and what's going on in the news. Um, next week is going to be a really big show because next week is E3 week.

119
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And, um, even though, you know, we here at a VOG have decided to opt out of E3 this year, because we personally feel we can get as much out of it, following it online as we can being there at the show.

120
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's the long and short of it. The reality is we are going to get a data dump from a lot of publishers starting next Sunday. I remember when E3 week, didn't E3 week start on Tuesday at one point.

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And it was because the expo was like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Wasn't that a thing along a few years ago. I feel like that was the thing. Now E3 week. Now the expo is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now E3 week starts on Sunday.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I was talking with dark Sakura before the show. And I was saying, you know what, with the, with the way the E3 schedule is next week, by this time on the next episode, we are going to know the details for Mass Effect Andromeda game.

123
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The dark soccer and I have been very much looking forward to Loki. Not so much. Why would we know when's the ether conference one o'clock on Sunday Pacific time.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So EA will go before OLR. So you can already, so Loki brace yourself because that's going to be the start of next show, but there'll be some other stuff too. I'm sure. And you'll be screaming about some celebrities that showed up. I'm sure.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why would I scream at celebrities? I don't give a shit about celebrity. Exactly. Exactly. That will be Loki. And then Aisha Tyler showed up and I didn't care.

126
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's Ubisoft. And I don't care. I still don't. I like Aisha Tyler. I've met her. She's awesome. I don't care. You can put any celebrity in front of you. You don't need celebrities. Just skip, skip the like formalities of like, ha ha ha. Here's our gameplay. Ha ha ha joke. It's not funny. Ha ha ha. You know, like I don't care. Just cut that shit out. Make your thing like 30 minutes shorter.

127
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:51,000
To be fair, I actually think Aisha Tyler is great. It's just, when I thought of E3 and celebrities, she's the first one I thought of. I guess that's a compliment. Um, so. And for the love of God, no fucking musical performances for Just Dance or Rock Band if they're going to still do that. But like. There's no, Ubisoft is not Sunday, Loki. You don't have to worry about that. There's no Ubisoft. This is in general.

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So then, so next week we're going to have to do a show. So next week's show is going to be very interesting. We're going to have to do a show like we did last year because Bethesda has rudely decided to do their press conference right smack in the middle of our show.

129
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hoping for that Skyrim HD.

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So at seven o'clock, we are going to take an extended break. And then while we all watch the Bethesda thing, because I know what y'all are gamers. I'm not going to expect that you're going to be listening to Orange Laundry instead of watching the conference.

131
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Honestly, I don't know what their plate is for.

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, I'm, I'm glad you asked that because I wanted to go around quickly since this is our last opportunity, really. I wanted to check in. What do you guys think is going to happen with EA and Bethesda? And I opened this up to the chatters as well.

133
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What do you guys think is going to happen with EA and Bethesda next week? So Loki, you're hoping for a Skyrim?

134
00:13:43,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think it'd be cool. Like a Skyrim HD or something like that would be nice because I like Skyrim and I don't follow. That was good. And it would be nice to see something like that. I don't really know what else they would have planned. I think I thought there was maybe a new Wolfenstein game coming or something.

135
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, the last one was pretty well received, right?

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Apparently, yeah. I bought it. I still haven't played it yet, but I bought it.

137
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think a sure thing is going to be Doom DLC because I think Doom is, I kind of feel like it's doing better than even Bethesda expected. I don't know. Maybe they expected it, but even the critical reviews have been very good. And it is, I mean, I played some more Doom this week. It is a great game. It really, I mean, it's a little gross, but I can look past that.

138
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm waiting for it to go on sale just because I don't know how much of it I'd play right now, but it looks good.

139
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And of course we're getting some questions from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. Stoppy says, very good idea for that break. Makes it easier on me. I don't have to choose. Look, we're just being realistic. We know. It's E3 week. You're going to choose the press conference.

140
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Even I, and here's the thing, some folks have asked, why don't you guys run a commentary stream so we can listen to you guys commentate while the Bethesda thing's going on in my honest to God answer.

141
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And you're not going to like it, but I'm all about the truth here at Orange Springs Radio is because I think those things are stupid.

142
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because I, I have tried to find a previous E3s. I'll be like Nintendo live stream and I'll look it up on Twitch and it's like angry dude commenting on Nintendo conference. It's like, I don't care. I just want the information right now. So that's so because of personal bias.

143
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't remember doing any streams.

144
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now. Yes. Snarky with text is different. Bobby says, I have no problem snarky with text. That's very different. So we probably still will in the chat room provide that because that's something optional. You can kind of look away to and stuff like that.

145
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know. I think it's fun, but the problem is though is like you have video and you're watching the video, so there's a lot of silence.

146
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll tell you what, what we could do, we could record something and make it like a special thing that is like an option. I won't even put it on the feed. It'll be like an optional download somewhere. Like an extra, this is what, if we had a Patreon, it's one of those things I put on the Patreon, like a bonus thing that you can go download and just hear Loki scream about everything, which I know some of you love.

147
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Scream about everything last year.

148
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Actually yeah, Bethesda had one of the better conferences last year.

149
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, I thought they knocked it out of the park last year. I mean, so I have high expectations. Well, I have no expectations because I don't know what the hell they're coming out with because as long as they don't talk about all their roles online because no one gives a shit about that anymore. I don't know. A new Elder Schools game would be nice.

150
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Tiger Claw in chat says, giant bomb does it. They do commentary over the press conferences.

151
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I stand by what I said.

152
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, somebody said, oh, Kajuda said Bethesda has nothing to show.

153
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Well, I have a conference. And I feel like they did have surprises last year. In fact, they dropped a pretty big one last year with the whole Fallout Shelter. That ended up being a huge thing.

154
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I know some of you guys are going to roll your eyes to the back of your head with the phones.

155
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And console mode for Fallout 4, which is just starting to roll out.

156
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And Fallout 4 in general. I mean, people knew it was coming, but we got a ton of information last year.

157
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh yeah, it's Dishonored 2. That's right. That is their thing this year.

158
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So, what do you think Bethesda will have this year? Do you think Elder Scrolls will get the reveal of the next game in the franchise?

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know if they'll have another game, because that takes a while. I mean, maybe it's possible.

160
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think maybe more DLC for Fallout 4, because we're kind of at the end of what they've announced for the season pass already.

161
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So, there may be more stuff coming, which I think they did say that that was going to be the case.

162
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Actually, no, I know that they've said that that's going to be the case.

163
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And then there's, you know, it'd be nice, even just an HD collection of Skyrim and Oblivion would be nice, or just Skyrim.

164
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Darsakra, I know you don't play as many Bethesda games, but any thoughts on what they might bring to the table next Sunday?

165
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Skyblivion. They'll probably pick another continent in their world and name a game after it.

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why not?

167
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I would be cool with another property, like something brand new.

168
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, actually, that's something I think is...

169
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Another Star Trek game, how about that?

170
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You laugh, but we have the new series coming in 2017, and we have the Star Trek Beyond movie, so I don't think it's beyond all possibility that Star Trek's named.

171
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I realize those games haven't been very good, but maybe they're going to do something to really, you know, make us drool over them.

172
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Although, you know, temper your expectations, people. The video games don't usually end up being very good.

173
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I kind of wish that they'd do a revisit back to that Call of Cthulhu game. Remember that one that we saw years ago at E3?

174
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I would love to see something like that come out. If they still own the rights, they should totally do a new Call of Cthulhu game.

175
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay.

176
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You know.

177
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You just like Cthulhu.

178
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Blurgh.

179
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's the tentacles, you know, they're kind of a turn on.

180
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm down for the original IP. I think Bethesda does, you know, we had the Evil Within just a couple of years ago.

181
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We had their Team Fortress-y game that I don't remember in the moment what it was called. I don't even know if that ever came out.

182
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Umm...

183
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't remember, dammit, I don't remember what it was called. Somebody in chat will save me here, but you know, they have original IPs sometimes.

184
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I think that's, that is probably what we'll see is something completely new. So I know that's such a safe prediction, but in this day and age, is that a safe prediction?

185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, we haven't really heard too much about them. I mean, I know what they've got coming, so anything that they've got as a surprise is actually pretty much a surprise right now.

186
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So I'm looking forward to it, I guess.

187
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And Act Deft is saying Dishonored 2, and you know, I'm sure that is going to be a huge, huge thing.

188
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, they'll probably have like a nice gameplay portion for that.

189
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But they talked about at least four or five games last year, so I'm expecting to see something similar this year.

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, I was, I remember Doom was a big part of it. Fallout 4, they showed off gameplay for that.

191
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Didn't they talk about Elder Scrolls Online at the very beginning, like an expansion or something for that? I seem to recall.

192
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'd completely filter out anything Elder Scrolls Online.

193
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I know, I don't, I wonder if they're still going to keep that going or if they're kind of done with that. We'll see.

194
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Alright, Doom Plague in chat says Hexen Reboot.

195
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That'd be cool.

196
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Actually, I'm fucking here for that.

197
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, you know what, I hear something that we haven't heard of in a while. What about a new Quake game?

198
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What about a new Quake game? It would seem a little weird though, my only concern is that Doom just came out.

199
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Like, is it really time to talk about another shooter right now?

200
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

201
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm asking the wrong crowd.

202
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And how about more Unreal Tournament while we're at it?

203
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm all for more Unreal. Anyway, let's talk about the other one real quick that's going to be on Sunday.

204
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So, before OLR, here's the day to make predictions. EA, what's going to happen with EA?

205
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What do you guys think?

206
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm going to be bored with all their sports coverage, which is going to be the majority of it.

207
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Mirror's Edge is awesome, but isn't that already out?

208
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, it's like they've already had the beta.

209
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's coming out, I think, next week or something.

210
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, it's like weeks away from coming out, so that's a good question.

211
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Are they going to emphasize Mirror's Edge because they know they have a captive audience,

212
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
or are they going to kind of de-emphasize a little bit?

213
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I would assume they have to talk about it.

214
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, Mass Effect, Titanfall 2 are going to be big.

215
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I think Titanfall 2 is going to be huge.

216
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Mass Effect, obviously, is going to be big.

217
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I would like to see, I mean, it's a pipe dream. I'd love to see that new Criterion game that they're working on right now.

218
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I kind of wish it wasn't the game that they're working on, it was a new Burnout game.

219
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like, so much. That would be fantastic.

220
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I would be very happy.

221
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A brand new Burnout.

222
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I would be very happy to see Eraser.

223
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's so amazing.

224
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, I would be very happy.

225
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Even like, I was watching a trailer today, a launch trailer for that.

226
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It was a golf game I talked about last week.

227
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Extreme Golf, Dangerous Golf, I don't remember what it was called.

228
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think it was Dangerous Golf or something like that.

229
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Came out on Thursday.

230
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And they have this thing that's like a Smash Breaker, which is a total fucking rip-off of the Crash Breaker from Burnout.

231
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But then it's like, man, I really want another Burnout game.

232
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I think they have a new E for Speed game coming out, but I don't know if that's this year or not.

233
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think it might be next year.

234
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, Battlefield 1 is pretty much a definite for EA.

235
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Of course, yeah.

236
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh yeah, Battlefield 1, duh, completely forgot about that.

237
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
How did you, you play that more than us?

238
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't play Battlefield that much.

239
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Actually, I have Battlefield 4.

240
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We have Mass Effect, you have Battlefield.

241
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't play Battlefield, though.

242
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Battlefield's more sim.

243
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I stick to the Call of Duty, which is, you know, very arcade-y.

244
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's good, I like Battlefield 4 a little.

245
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I haven't played it too much.

246
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I really thought about buying Hardline and stuff because it was down to like 10 bucks.

247
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm like, eh, but am I really going to play this?

248
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Battlefield 1 looks good, though.

249
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let me ask this very random question.

250
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Do we think maybe anything on the PC front?

251
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You know, we haven't talked a lot about Origin for a long time.

252
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, EA's PC platform has been, I guess, a little bit dormant.

253
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is it too early for another Sims game?

254
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You know, Sims 4 is in the news this week.

255
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We'll get to that a little later in the show, but is it too early to talk about Sims 5?

256
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Are they going to attempt to do a SimCity?

257
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, didn't Maxis get, it could be awkward, I don't know.

258
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It would be interesting to see if they try, though, to do a Sim something.

259
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
How about SimAnt Revisited?

260
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But I would like to see like a PC exclusive type of thing coming from EA, you know?

261
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
As much crap as SimCity got and, you know, as tepid as the response to Spore was,

262
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I think that's a universe that's still worth visiting, but...

263
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Now, Tigerclaw is saying there's a new Star Wars game.

264
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, I remember hearing about that, but there's just going to be like either another Battlefront game, which...

265
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Come on, I mean, that was an incomplete game that they put out with DLC that was way too expensive,

266
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and now you're telling me I have to buy another game for more content?

267
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Fuck you, seriously.

268
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Well, with Rogue One being in theater, I mean, we live in a day and age now

269
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
where there's going to be a new Star Wars movie every year.

270
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's a little weird, but awesome.

271
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So, you know, maybe there'll be a tie-in game for Rogue One.

272
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Who knows?

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We'll see.

274
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
All right.

275
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, so we will find out...

276
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh, by the way, Act F says Mirror's Edge is out on the 7th.

277
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, I thought it was this week, because it's on EA Access, which is usually about a week early, so...

278
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I still think they'll bring it up, if nothing else, DLC talk.

279
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That's always a given.

280
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's how they push their current stuff, is...

281
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, there's supposed to be a TV show they're making too, I think.

282
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Well, that is true. That is very true.

283
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It should be boring as shit.

284
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And Dungeon... Or, excuse me, sorry.

285
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Doomplague in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,

286
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
City Skylines is on sale on Steam at the moment. Forget SimCity.

287
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Exactly, yeah. If there was a new SimCity to come out, it would have to really do much better than it did last time.

288
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Like, it'd have to set that bar way higher.

289
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
As much as I don't really give a shit about this game, I'm thinking maybe another Plants vs. Zombies thing.

290
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't know about Garden Warfare 3.

291
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Maybe something in that casual space, the PopCap space, you know what I mean?

292
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Peggle 2 is alright, I guess.

293
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Why not Peggle 3?

294
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Why not? Let's do it.

295
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Something new. Like, they have some new IPs that come out every now and then.

296
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I mean, I'd be happy with that.

297
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Or, hey, EA, let's just totally pipe dream. Let's throw out a DJ game of some sort.

298
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You know, hey, did Rock Band do well enough for you?

299
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
EA had nothing to do with Rock Band 4.

300
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh, okay, well.

301
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And fuck, I don't... Can you make a DJ game anyways?

302
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Alright, we're gonna move on and talk about our gaming week.

303
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We'll see what comes through next week at E3, when E3 starts on Sunday.

304
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So weird. Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing,

305
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
going into more current stuff.

306
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Dark Sakura, starting with you. How was your gaming week?

307
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Um, I played World of Warcraft.

308
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You've been on hiatus for that for a long time, so...

309
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Like, two years.

310
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So how is it going back?

311
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I forget how to pet battle, and I kinda don't care.

312
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I really like it. I like the story.

313
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I was really interested in the whole Warlords of Draenor thing,

314
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
because that's actually one of my favorite things out of the lore.

315
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Or, you know, the Draenei and all that business they went through.

316
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And, um...

317
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's a sort of interesting kind of, I guess, time traveling a little bit in the game.

318
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Um, it's also, uh...

319
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I love the art style for it. I think it's pretty...

320
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's definitely looking a lot better than it did when I quit.

321
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Um, the graphic updates are nice.

322
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Um, and it's just, it doesn't force me to have to do instances when I don't want to.

323
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
To level.

324
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The level progression feels a lot more solid than Final Fantasy XIV does.

325
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I like being able to separate my characters and their jobs.

326
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I just like it. It's easier for me.

327
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Plus, I have something, you know...

328
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I can dedicate the time on one thing and not have to switch and change gear classes,

329
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and have everything stored in my storage, and it's just much better managed.

330
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean, I think that XIV is prettier in general.

331
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But I think that there's a greater air of magic, of fantasy, in World of Warcraft.

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And so, I'm glad to be back.

333
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm still solidly Team XIV, but I am curious what the new expansion's gonna do.

334
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You know, new expansions are always an exciting time for an MMO, so...

335
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's another part of the lore that I like.

336
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I think I read all of the...

337
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, what were the books?

338
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It was about Malfurion and Illidan and all them,

339
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
where folks go back in time and see everything firsthand.

340
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I liked that trilogy, and so I'm actually hoping to see more fallout from it.

341
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let me ask this very random question,

342
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
because this is something else that's happening right now that's kind of a big deal.

343
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You know, in the UK, it's happening right now, and we're gonna get it.

344
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I believe next Friday, and that is the Warcraft movie.

345
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's kind of a big deal in gaming.

346
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I understand the reviews have been pretty tepid so far, what we're seeing,

347
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
but do you have interest in the Warcraft movie?

348
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, I'll see it. I don't care how bad it is.

349
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I kind of feel like I have to.

350
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like, that part of me that played World of Warcraft,

351
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
even though I haven't in years,

352
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
well, besides just the random flirting with WoW here and there,

353
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but I haven't really played Warcraft seriously, like raiding and stuff, in a long time.

354
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And I kind of feel like that part of me that did take it seriously for a while,

355
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
like I kind of owe it to that part of myself to see the Warcraft movie,

356
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
but I'm going in with real low expectations.

357
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm going in preparing to take a nap.

358
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, you know, me, I have a particular love of bad movies with a good story.

359
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And you know what I mean by bad movies with a good story.

360
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, Showgirls.

361
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That movie was a shit show, but I love it.

362
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You don't know shit.

363
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I did the hand thing. You guys didn't see it.

364
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But, oh, by the way, I finally got to do that in Miitomo.

365
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What's your favorite scary movie? Showgirls.

366
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh, is that a question in Miitomo?

367
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, what's your favorite horror movie?

368
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So I did Showgirls.

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Love it.

370
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So anyway, I have been doing Miitomo.

371
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Right now, I'm dressed like an Azalea trail maid in the game,

372
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
which only people from the deep south know what that is.

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Also, a little bit of Heroes of Dragon Age.

374
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm starting to lose steam on it until I can get Cullen,

375
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and then I'll play it a whole lot more.

376
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I got Ocarina of Time 3D for my 3DS.

377
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It was 20 bucks. I was like, why not? I want to play it.

378
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So I can actually take it at work, because I freaking love Ocarina.

379
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So I'll enjoy getting to play that again.

380
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What else did I play?

381
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh, I did buy something that we will be talking about on the show

382
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
until the Windows emulation just was like, ugh, ugh, ugh.

383
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's like old-ass Windows emulation on top of it.

384
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Oh, okay.

385
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And no ability that I could find so far to play it windowed.

386
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So if I can figure out how to play it windowed, I will enjoy it a lot better,

387
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
because then I can shrink it and have at least the resolution look right.

388
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But I'm not going to play it so I can figure that shit out.

389
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So I guess we'll come back to that in a little bit,

390
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
but if you were listening last week, you might already know what it is.

391
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?

392
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It was all right. I played a shit ton of Final Fantasy XI.

393
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
On a private server, of course.

394
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh, shame. I kind of want to go shame on you, but at the same time it's like,

395
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
all right, Final Fantasy XI is how old at this point?

396
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Exactly.

397
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Square really needs to get free.

398
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Here's why it's awesome, before you judge.

399
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So I'm playing on a fun server, is what they call it,

400
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and they have a lot of things tweaked in there.

401
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Like the experience rate is ungodly.

402
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I think it's like 30 times the normal experience rate.

403
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then your guild rate is really high as well,

404
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
even though you really don't need to buy anything,

405
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
because everything on the auction house is 100 gil.

406
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It doesn't matter what it is, and they constantly stock it.

407
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And then of course the drop rate is ridiculous as well.

408
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You get this auto regen, refresh, TP increase, and all this other stuff automatically.

409
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And on top of all that, all your spells are unlocked completely,

410
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
so you don't have to do that in all your jobs,

411
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and all the limit breaks for your jobs are all unlocked.

412
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So it's nice, so you don't have to do all that hassle stuff.

413
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I soloed a black mage to 67 in about less than eight hours.

414
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Wow.

415
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

416
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You know, if Shane's out there listening,

417
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and I doubt he is because he's probably working,

418
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
but you're going to get a text message from him shortly.

419
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Where, how, when.

420
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah, it's awesome.

421
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The only thing that kind of sucks is they have something,

422
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
because it is on a private server,

423
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
some things don't work correctly.

424
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So you can't do the Abyssia stuff, you can't do Corsair.

425
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What? That's like my favorite job in the whole game.

426
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah, Corsair Puppet Master, and Rune something or other.

427
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh, the stuff that came with that expansion.

428
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yeah, because it's basically a little buggy,

429
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and it could cause a server to crash.

430
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So if you do that stuff, so they've locked those out,

431
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
but everything else is fair game.

432
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So I'm basically running, I think at one time I had the plus int gear,

433
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
which now that I did some research into it,

434
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
actually plus magic attack is what I want,

435
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
so I'm going back and doing it.

436
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But my plus int gear was so ridiculous,

437
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it was like plus 36 int on my black mage,

438
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and so apparently it doesn't do a whole ton,

439
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
so I actually have to go re-buy everything now.

440
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But yeah, it's been fun.

441
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
There are some other people playing,

442
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I never run into anybody ever,

443
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
so I've been soloing everything,

444
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and with the refresh regen stuff,

445
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I mean, there's really no healing in between anything,

446
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it's just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

447
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And with the rate of experience,

448
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
you can level up to like 15 in one of the starter areas

449
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
in about less than 30 minutes.

450
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I mean, really the most time is like,

451
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
oh crap, I gotta upgrade my gear,

452
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
because it's been about 15 levels since I did that.

453
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So that's really the big thing.

454
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And running also item management,

455
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
because the drops are so much,

456
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
you're just like constantly auto-sort, auto-sort, auto-sort.

457
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And oh crap, I gotta dump all these stacks

458
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
of rabbit furs and stuff that I have.

459
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So it's just extremely fun.

460
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm liking it a lot,

461
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
because it's just took all the grind out of it.

462
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
There's still grind, and you're not invincible,

463
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because now I'm soloing down in Crawler's Nest

464
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
or in, god, the tree with the spiders and stuff,

465
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I don't remember what it was called.

466
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh, the Boyata tree or whatever it's called, yeah.

467
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Boyata tree, yeah.

468
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Trying to solo there, and it's extremely dangerous,

469
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
to the point now where, crap,

470
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
this stuff is actually put up a fight,

471
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
this regen stuff's not really working out,

472
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
or like, oh crap, I gotta kill this thing,

473
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
but it's next to all these other things,

474
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and it's just gonna chain them together.

475
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Do they let you do the trust people,

476
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
like the NPCs that play with you?

477
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I think you can do the trust.

478
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You should get on that if you haven't already,

479
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
because those things help a lot.

480
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The other thing too that you can do as well

481
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
is you can teleport, basically.

482
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can give yourself a chocobo at any time,

483
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
so they have little command line things you can put in,

484
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
so you can do the chocobos,

485
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you can teleport to different areas,

486
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
so it just saves on, there's no ship travel,

487
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
there's no chocobo crap that you have to do to get that,

488
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
just go, go, go, go, go.

489
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I mean, that's what I love about it,

490
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
is just take all the crap out of it,

491
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and it's just the game.

492
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
All right, cool.

493
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And then aside from that,

494
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I played a little bit of Ingress,

495
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
more Pokemon Go, and yeah.

496
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I mean, I hate level five in Pokemon Go.

497
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I got a Magikarp, so that was kind of fun.

498
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I was like, woo, Magikarp.

499
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I heard you need something like 99 to evolve one of those.

500
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You have to catch 99 Magikarp to evolve.

501
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah, I have to look at it now,

502
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
because they've changed how they do everything.

503
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So now they have these candies and dust,

504
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and I don't know, it's just,

505
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm like, what the fuck is all this stuff?

506
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
They have to snort stuff, and then they believe they're-

507
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, they have it now, though, that you can use it to,

508
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you can increase the stats of your characters,

509
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
because before it was just like,

510
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
okay, you have to catch so many,

511
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
then you evolve it to the next thing,

512
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and then catch so many of that,

513
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and you evolve it to the next thing.

514
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Now you can kind of recycle your Pokemon,

515
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and get these things to evolve them,

516
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
or change their stats or something.

517
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So I just love the mess of that,

518
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
but yeah, it's all right, I guess.

519
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And then Ingress, I need to play more of it,

520
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because I'm out of everything, and yeah.

521
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, actually, I'm out of level six resonators now.

522
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's just crazy.

523
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Gotta go hack more.

524
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It would be nice if there were actually things I could hack

525
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
that aren't all level eight now.

526
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
All right, yeah, I'll show you some places to go.

527
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Anyway, let's move on.

528
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Talking about my gaming week,

529
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and the things I've been playing this week.

530
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So not Pokemon Go, but Pokemon Alpha Sapphire,

531
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I've still been playing a little bit of that.

532
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I was talking about that last week,

533
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
where I just suddenly got interested in Pokemon again.

534
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So I was playing just a little bit of that on 3DS this week,

535
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
but not a lot.

536
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So finally, Loki, you'll get a kick out of this,

537
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
on the Xbox One, I finally, finally, after all this time,

538
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
loaded up Saints Row 04.

539
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, I thought you were going to say Grand Theft Auto 5,

540
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but I'll take Saints Row 04.

541
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That's not backwards compatible yet.

542
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But Saints Row 04, they gave away, right?

543
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So I finally fired that up and played it,

544
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and I played through the first three chapters, probably.

545
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So I played the opening,

546
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and I don't want to give too much away,

547
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
but the big scene with the music

548
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that's supposed to make you laugh,

549
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but I didn't think it was as funny

550
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
as the opening to the third game,

551
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
which I've never laughed harder at a video game in my life.

552
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But it was still fun.

553
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And then there's this really weird flashback,

554
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
where you're in a 50s sitcom type of thing,

555
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and the way your character walks around.

556
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I was dying.

557
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Everything's so over the top.

558
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So there's still a lot of that funny stuff.

559
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Just because the opening wasn't as good

560
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
doesn't mean the game isn't still fucking funny.

561
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But here's the interesting thing,

562
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and the part where I ended up stopping.

563
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So you finally, after going through those sequences,

564
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
you end up basically in the same world

565
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
from Saints Row 03, right?

566
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yep.

567
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So you're driving around in the car.

568
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, as I'm driving around,

569
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
all of a sudden the car disappears,

570
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the game freezes,

571
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and my character is just sitting there

572
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
like she's driving the car, but there's no car.

573
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And I can't move anything.

574
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Where's my fucking car?

575
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Exactly.

576
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Where's my sweet ass wheels?

577
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's just, and the game froze.

578
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And I'm like, is this an emulation thing?

579
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What happened?

580
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It's a Saints Row thing.

581
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Is it a Saints Row thing?

582
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's a Saints Row thing.

583
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They have the whole buggy Saints Row thing.

584
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That was in that.

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, okay.

586
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, there you go.

587
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I just didn't really,

588
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and for you really don't need to be driving cars anyways.

589
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Well, you do at one point just,

590
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
well, the story tells you two to go get a gun, basically.

591
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This is where I was at.

592
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And then it froze, and I was like,

593
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
all right, I guess I'm gonna move on

594
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and play other things.

595
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But here's what I've been playing the most of this week.

596
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So if you listen to the entire episode of Orange Lawns Radio,

597
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and I know not all of you do,

598
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
because it's a long show,

599
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
but the very, very end of last week's show,

600
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think my final thought was something like,

601
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I really hope I can resist the temptation to buy Overwatch

602
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
because it's getting really difficult to not buy Overwatch.

603
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Well, guess what I did after last week's show?

604
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I bought Overwatch.

605
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And so I've been playing a lot of Overwatch.

606
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And I gotta tell you,

607
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I was really skeptical about Overwatch

608
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
for a variety of reasons.

609
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
A, are any of my friends gonna be playing

610
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
because, you know, a lot of these big multiplayer games,

611
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
like, you go and everybody's playing for a week

612
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and then everybody's gone, right?

613
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
B, the lack of a single-player mode

614
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
still kind of kills me a little bit.

615
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You know, so there were still some reservations I had,

616
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
but everybody online is just talking about

617
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
how great it is, how great it is.

618
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I remember playing the beta and thinking,

619
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
well, it's not that bad.

620
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And then I realized on PC,

621
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and this is really tricky, so just a heads up,

622
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
although you can buy the console editions for 60 bucks,

623
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the Origins edition,

624
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and that's the one that shows up in the launcher for PC

625
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
as a $60 edition,

626
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
look very carefully and read the screen carefully

627
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
because underneath the purchase $60 Overwatch Origins editions link,

628
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
there is a little link that says,

629
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
just, or, buy just Overwatch,

630
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
or buy regular Overwatch or plain Overwatch.

631
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And if you click that link

632
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
through the Battle.net store on PC only,

633
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
you can get Overwatch for 40 bucks.

634
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You just miss all that extra shit.

635
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You don't get the extra skins, who cares?

636
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You don't get the wow pet, I don't fucking care,

637
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
the Diablo wings, okay, that would have been cool,

638
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but not $20 cool.

639
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So once I found that, I was like, okay,

640
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
now it's only 40 bucks, all right, fuck it,

641
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm just going to buy it.

642
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And I've got to say, I'm not disappointed,

643
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and it's a really weird place for me

644
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
because I'm not usually into first person shooters,

645
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but I should have listened to what I say all the time

646
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
about Blizzard because it's holding itself true again.

647
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Blizzard excels at making genres accessible to everybody.

648
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They did it with the MMO with World of Warcraft

649
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
because you look at that compared to a game like EverQuest

650
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
or Final Fantasy XI, it's like, wow, it's super accessible.

651
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
They did it with Heroes of the Storm and the MOBA.

652
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They've done it with Hearthstone and the trading card game.

653
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And now they've fucking done it with Overwatch

654
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and the first person shooter.

655
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's extremely just accessible and easy to pick up and play,

656
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
and it's really, really fun.

657
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And the part that is surprising me greatly

658
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
is that I can play with strangers

659
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and actually be totally okay with it.

660
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm not really finding myself in a toxic environment.

661
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Why? I just disabled voice chat, easy as pie.

662
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And there's still enough to do

663
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
where you don't really feel like you're working against your team.

664
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I have a lot of fun with it,

665
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
but I have way more fun when I do have friends.

666
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I was playing with some friends.

667
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
For those of you that listen to Starboard Power Coupling,

668
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
which, by the way, shout out, they're going to be 100 years old.

669
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
No, they're having their episode 100 in, I think it's on June 18th.

670
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Is there a 100th episode?

671
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So, yeah, that's very cool, so congrats to them.

672
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But I was playing with Dr. Ken from that show

673
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and some of his WoW rating buddies that I had met at BlizzCon a couple years ago.

674
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We all played Overwatch the other night, and I had a great time.

675
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And it was cool because I got to experiment with some characters

676
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't usually get to play around with, and nobody cared.

677
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So I got to do a couple matches as Winston

678
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
when I'm really used to doing support.

679
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
One other thing I'm going to say about Overwatch

680
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
that I think is very important as to why this game is so successful.

681
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I think Overwatch, this is going to be a big statement I'm about to make,

682
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I think Overwatch has the best art direction

683
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and cinematic presence of any video game ever.

684
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I really believe it.

685
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I think Overwatch has the best art direction

686
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and cinematic presence of any video game I have ever played, ever.

687
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And I think that goes a long way as to why this game is so fun

688
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
because it feels like you're playing a frickin' movie.

689
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
A lot of that has to do with the way the sound is designed

690
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and how you get climatic music during certain points of the game

691
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and it just has this big epic feel to it.

692
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Part of it is just the way the plays of the game are designed, how that plays out,

693
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
because it kind of gives you something to hope for and look forward to

694
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and kind of see at the end of the game

695
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and it kind of just bookends to a really cool story

696
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
when a game only runs for like ten minutes or less.

697
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And so it's a very great thing to approach in short bursts.

698
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The heroes are fantastically well designed.

699
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Look at all the fan art out there

700
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
and other stuff we were talking about last week,

701
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
the CD'er stuff, so to speak,

702
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
but the characters are extraordinarily well done.

703
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't think that type of stuff can be ignored about Overwatch

704
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and why it's doing so well.

705
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What did they say? Seven million people were playing it the first week?

706
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

707
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I refuse. I still suck at FPSs unless it auto-aims for me.

708
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I do notice the aiming mechanism is much more forgivable

709
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
than it is in other games.

710
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It seems like the hitboxes are much larger

711
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
or there's a little bit of an assist going on.

712
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But I will say this, Bobby.

713
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Depending on which character you play, you may not need to aim.

714
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
For example, Mercy.

715
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
If you're going to heal, you don't need to aim

716
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
because it's like the medic in Team Fortress 2.

717
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You just run behind them and you use either the heal gun

718
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
or you use the support gun

719
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and it automatically attaches a line to them.

720
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So there's that.

721
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Or with Symmetra, you're very rarely in the fold attacking people.

722
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I mean, you kind of can, but again, her weapon,

723
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and I think Winston's weapon is like this too,

724
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
you just have to be kind of near the target

725
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and the weapon will, it's more like an area of effect weapon

726
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
than it is like a gun that you aim.

727
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So there's that.

728
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And I was going to say, there was another character too

729
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
that's like this where you don't necessarily have to be able to aim.

730
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, Soldier 76.

731
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
His ultimate ability is that you just shoot anywhere you want

732
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
and the bullets will automatically hit any opponent that's in range.

733
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The ultimates are very interesting.

734
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So, I mean, that is how Blizzard made a first person shooter more accessible,

735
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
is that not everybody necessarily needs to first person shoot.

736
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's crazy, but it works.

737
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Let's see.

738
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Bobby says, isn't it a team game so you would need voice chat?

739
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Not necessarily.

740
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The objectives are usually pretty clear.

741
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Everybody knows their role.

742
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I think it can be enhanced with voice chat, but it's not needed.

743
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Let's see.

744
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Also looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

745
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
ActDef says, so basically it's just Team Fortress 3

746
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
with more likeable characters.

747
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And I'm not shading Team Fortress 2.

748
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Team Fortress 2 has very likeable characters, incredible characters.

749
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Overwatch somehow pushes it further and it's pretty amazing.

750
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Let's see.

751
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And VidPower in chat says, Overwatch's characters are so likeable.

752
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah, I agree.

753
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And lastly, Tigerclaw in chat says, so you can play the game in third person

754
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and still get hits if your aiming is off.

755
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Can you play in third person?

756
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I know you can spectate in third person, but if you can play in third person,

757
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I haven't seen that yet, but it seems like the engine can render it.

758
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I haven't looked for it, so I don't want to say it's not there.

759
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But again, it would depend on your characters.

760
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So there you go.

761
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
All right.

762
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And then Kaijuto says, this guy is caught up in the hype.

763
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Let's see what he says in December.

764
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I don't know if that's totally a fair statement

765
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
because a good game is a good game, and yeah, it's a lot of fun right now.

766
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Will it still go in December?

767
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I kind of think Blizzard, based on their track record,

768
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
have a pretty good way of keeping their games relevant.

769
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And I think they will do, I mean, if they make good on their promise

770
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
of new maps, new characters, things like that,

771
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
to make you want to revisit the game,

772
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I think they will sustain it through December.

773
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
We'll see.

774
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So how about that DLC or the in-game microtransactions?

775
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I just ignore it.

776
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's skins, it's sprays, and you get some for leveling up,

777
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
like tagging the walls and stuff,

778
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
and you can change the quotes and the characters and stuff like that.

779
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I still kind of don't like it, but I just don't support it.

780
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So I don't buy from the store because I don't need that stuff.

781
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Fair enough.

782
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
All right.

783
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But that's enough.

784
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I have talked plenty and plenty about Overwatch.

785
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I want to get into...

786
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
If someone will get it for me, that would be great

787
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
because I actually do want the WoW stuff.

788
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I might start playing Diablo again.

789
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Diablo is really fun.

790
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I got it for free.

791
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
By the way, that's an example of the whole

792
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
is Overwatch still going to be relevant six months from now type of thing.

793
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm still playing Diablo 3.

794
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
How long ago did that game come out?

795
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That game was a fucking mess when it came out.

796
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I quit playing it soon after I hit level 10.

797
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah.

798
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But yet you're tempted to...

799
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Does anybody remember the server issues?

800
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Does anybody still focus on that?

801
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
No.

802
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Exactly why a SimCity 2 could possibly be a thing.

803
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Perhaps.

804
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Very much so.

805
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Okay.

806
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
We got to get into some housekeeping.

807
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I want to get into gaming news for the week as well.

808
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So housekeeping for the week.

809
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Next week's show is going to be a little bit different

810
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
as we mentioned earlier with the whole E3 stuff going on.

811
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But we will be here in studio.

812
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I do want to give one more shout out for what is going on in Atlanta

813
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
this upcoming weekend, the Southern Fried Gaming Room Expo.

814
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I've been talking about this on the show.

815
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
If you are in the Atlanta area, I urge you to check it out.

816
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It's going to be running June 10th through 12th.

817
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's old school arcade games.

818
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Panels.

819
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Just kind of like celebrating that gaming culture.

820
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Especially if you love the video games of the 80s and 90s.

821
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I really think you're going to enjoy it.

822
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm really bummed I can't be out there in person.

823
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I wanted to go.

824
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I explored going.

825
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But just with my job transition late last year,

826
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I just wasn't going to be able to make it work.

827
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I had to choose this or Dragon Con.

828
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I chose Dragon Con.

829
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But our very own Bobby Blackwolf will be there.

830
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
He told me he's doing three panels on Saturday and one panel on Sunday.

831
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
This is the Bobby Blackwolf Expo, I think.

832
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He's not moderating the ball, but he's participating in four different panels throughout the weekend.

833
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You will have ample opportunities to say hello to Mr. Blackwolf.

834
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
If you are a VOG listener, he will be there.

835
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm sure some of our other listeners will be.

836
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Be sure to let us know in chat or on Twitter if you're going to be at Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

837
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Maybe next year I'll be able to join you guys.

838
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Hopefully I'm able to make that work.

839
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Check that out this upcoming weekend.

840
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I also want to give a shout out.

841
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Speaking of Bobby, our YouTube channel, if you haven't checked in on that lately,

842
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
be sure to visit our YouTube channel over at VOG Network.

843
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's our username on YouTube.

844
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
If you missed the Mass Effect ride review that I did with Shane from Ranger Pridecast,

845
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
you should check that out.

846
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's still there on the feed.

847
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Bobby has uploaded a couple interviews this week.

848
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Bobby showed this week very, very, very much about AR and the Hololands and his experiences with that.

849
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
If you want to take that one step further, Bobby's done a few interviews.

850
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
My understanding is there's more and more video.

851
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Bobby's been very busy these past couple weeks.

852
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That is coming soon to the YouTube channel.

853
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Check that out as our YouTube presence is expanding this year.

854
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Be sure to like, subscribe, and all that fun stuff.

855
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I noticed some stuff in chat.

856
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I just want to add to this on the whole Overwatch talk real quick before we get into gaming news

857
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
because this was something I thought about myself.

858
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
ActDeftInChat says, if Splatoon is still going...

859
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Actually, I think one of the things that makes Overwatch so likable is a lot of the same things

860
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
that are making Splatoon very likable right now.

861
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
There's a lot of commonality right there.

862
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I know we went back and forth a lot about Splatoon voice chat.

863
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I still kind of wish it was there if I wanted it.

864
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But to go back to that comment that came in earlier,

865
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
how do you know what to do if you can't communicate with your other teammates?

866
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You'd asked about with Overwatch.

867
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Well, look at Splatoon as well. You can kind of get away with it.

868
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Splatoon also has great art direction.

869
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Very vibrant, very cinematic, very colorful in the way it's presented.

870
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I think Splatoon is a lot of fun for the same reasons.

871
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
My point being, I think Overwatch has way more in common with Splatoon

872
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
than it does with Battlefield.

873
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That's my comment on all that.

874
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for now, though.

875
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
We're going to start off with Loki.

876
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Alright, so like they did the last few years, Sony is bringing E3 to you

877
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
if you happen to go to one of the 80 movie theaters that they are going to be broadcasting it to.

878
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You can watch the conference on Monday, June 13th.

879
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It'll be running from, I want to say, 6 to 830.

880
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And you can get tickets, I guess, right away, or try to get tickets.

881
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And yeah, with that, if you do attend, you will get a commemorative Coca-Cola cup,

882
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
a PlayStation card, and a digital gift basket.

883
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And they have a bunch of locations that are doing it. You can go to their website.

884
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But none here.

885
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yes, unfortunately none here.

886
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I just happened to notice there are none here. We'd have to go to the Bay Area.

887
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
If you want to check it out, PlayStation.com slash E3 Experience, if you want to see if there's one nearby.

888
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah, nothing, unfortunately, unless I'm in the Bay Area or LA.

889
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
If I'm in LA, then I'm going to just go to it.

890
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah, right. I know our pals from Game Buoy, also here on the VOG Network.

891
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I know our pals from Game Buoy went to this last year, so I can't see why they won't be going this year.

892
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I didn't ask Captain Spike if they got tickets, but they'll probably go.

893
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
They had a good time last year.

894
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
If they had it here, I'd go, just because I think it would be a fun way to watch it with a bunch of other gamers.

895
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
With all the cheers and stuff, it would be kind of like being there live,

896
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
which I'm very thankful I got to do at least one time in my life, was be at the event live.

897
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But, hey, at least this way I'm going to be watching it at home, so the good news is, pants optional.

898
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And that is also a great way to experience E3, just so we're all clear.

899
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Well, it is a packed theater. I mean, it's dark. Pants could be optional.

900
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Alright, pants should always be optional, but only American meaning of pants.

901
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Let's move on with some more news about E3 and talk about Nintendo, which some of you also may be watching without pants.

902
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't know, but there's going to be a long time to watch.

903
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Here's the interesting thing about Nintendo, if you didn't already know.

904
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
They're not going to do a Nintendo Direct this year, because they've pretty much already said,

905
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
we're just showing Zelda at E3, that's it.

906
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
However, what they're going to be doing instead is they're going to be doing two full days of Treehouse coverage.

907
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So the Treehouse gang, they did this last year, they broadcast live from the E3 show floor.

908
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
They're going to be doing it again this year.

909
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
9 a.m. Pacific on June 14th is when they're going to be streaming.

910
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But here's the thing, what's kind of developed as this week has gone on.

911
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Treehouse is not going to only show Zelda.

912
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It seems like that's what they're certainly going to focus on in the beginning, because I think that's what a lot of people want to know about.

913
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But they have announced there is going to be some other things shown on the feed as well.

914
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,000
They will have the first live gameplay of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon, which actually is going to kick off the streams.

915
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
That's pretty cool.

916
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The second day, they're going to talk about Monster Hunter's Generation, Dragon Quest 7, Pokemon Go will be a part of that as well, Tokyo Mirage Sessions.

917
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So there's a lot to see on the feed.

918
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So I guess that's a bit of a relief to some people, is that there is going to be more than Zelda.

919
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Don't get me wrong, Zelda footage is great, and I'm still not understanding why they have a 90-minute demo for it.

920
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I guess that's cool. I don't think they need it because it's Zelda, but whatever.

921
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
After a while, how many repeats of the Zelda footage could you watch?

922
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It would get kind of repetitive and not necessarily boring, but it's like, okay, I'm ready for something different.

923
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So yeah, they've got all the third parties, some third party stuff that show off as well, so I'm assuming that's what they'll cover because that's what they kind of did last year.

924
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I mean, last year, I think, how many directs did they have? Multiple directs, and even still, they had stuff that they were announcing on Treehouse because they couldn't fit it all in.

925
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And this year, it's like...

926
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Well, but it also goes to show that Treehouse may have some kind of bonus stuff in it, so maybe...

927
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I'm still very disappointed this year with them. I mean, I get it, it's all about Zelda, but you've got more than...

928
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I literally just said it's not all about Zelda. There may be some more things that show up for Treehouse.

929
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm saying they're talking about E3, it's all about Zelda, but they've got more games coming. They've got that Paper Mario game that I'd like to know.

930
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think that's more interesting because that's actually coming out this year.

931
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I think they'll show that on Treehouse. I think they will.

932
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And how long is it before we get to this? I mean, is this... Let's think about this.

933
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:02,000
If this system is greatly more powerful than the Wii U, are we gonna really want it on the Wii U?

934
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Or is this gonna be something we get down to the end and it's like,

935
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh yeah, we just decided that it's just gonna be an NX game instead of a Wii U game?

936
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
No, because they promised it on Wii U, they will still say...

937
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It's gonna be just like the GameCube Zelda. I'm using my quote-y fingers that ended up on Wii. Same thing.

938
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Well, granted, but the Wii was pretty much just as powerful as the GameCube, so that was basically the same thing.

939
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:31,000
This potentially could be something different. Granted, I would hope that their system is more powerful than the Wii U.

940
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Alright, well Nintendo has an awful lot of space on the E3 show floor for the one game.

941
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't know if you've heard this rumor as well, is that the demo is supposedly 90 minutes.

942
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I guess there's two demos and combined it is 90 minutes worth of gameplay.

943
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
That'll be very, very interesting. But Nintendo has reserved a lot of space for it.

944
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Which, when I say a lot of space, honestly, looking at the map, it looks to me like the same amount of space they reserve every year.

945
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I just, I don't... I get it. I mean, I'm all excited for a longer demo. I mean, that's what people want.

946
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But like, if you're thinking about, do you really need that long of a demo to sell this game?

947
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I mean, I'm excited for the game right now. I don't think I need 90 minutes of the game.

948
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I mean, granted, yeah, I'll take 90 minutes of the game, but it's like, I'm just thinking like the five hour lines that they normally have.

949
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You know, shrink that demo down. I mean, come on.

950
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Well, the entire booth is nothing but Zelda kiosks, though. It's gonna be interesting. I don't know.

951
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Like, I'm curious to see how it plays out. But, you know, a 90 minute demo is kind of a throwback to the days of the PlayStation discs that came with the magazine that gave you a really robust demo of the game.

952
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So, I think it's exciting. I hope it doesn't cause...

953
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That is pretty exciting. No, it doesn't even matter.

954
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Is fucking stream the goddamn demo. You have a fucking eShop. Download the fucking demo.

955
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I was like, they're gonna stream it on Treehouse. What are you talking about?

956
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:01,000
No. I understand. Yes, it could be running on dev hardware, whatever. But you could make a smaller demo that could be ready to play so that everybody tries it out.

957
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I don't think they'll do it.

958
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Of course not. That's effort.

959
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I think in this day and age of the fact that they could stream that 90 minute demo on Twitch, that's what they're gonna do.

960
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Well, they could have done that, too, back in the 2006, you know, E3. But instead, you know, hey, guess what? On Microsoft's, you know, the storefront, they had three demos you could download and try.

961
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Interesting point from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. How long is the Final Fantasy XV demo, the first one?

962
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Oh, that was a good probably two-hour demo, right? But that wasn't on the E3 show floor. But, you know, I think that's what Loki wants. Something that you can download and experience yourself, right? And that whole thing.

963
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Exactly. I mean, that's more exciting than watching a stream of a 90-minute demo.

964
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'm still awfully curious to see what happens at E3. Moving on. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Not E3.

965
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Well, really good news. And I think that the folks behind The Sims have always been really good about diversity and making sure that people are represented. You know, you've been able to have gay couples from the get-go. You could have alien and vampire babies in E3.

966
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Well, now in Sims 4, they're removing the gender restrictions on clothes, hairstyles, and some of the other characterizations. Like, the custom gender settings they have now is that you can pick the gender, but you can also customize it a bit more.

967
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Sections include physical frame, if it's masculine or feminine, clothing preference, if the Sim can get others knocked up or neither. And the last question, can the Sim use the toilet standing?

968
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Interesting.

969
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:17,000
They do make things that help women stand up and pee, just saying. Sure. You know. But, um, they, uh, I think it's a really, really good thing for them to do, especially with all this, you know, people getting their panties in a twist over, you know, genitals and bullshit.

970
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So, I think that, um, it's a really good thing to see them actually taking that next step. And if it's supposed to be simulating life, quote, even video gamey life, then why not add in that customization, make it a bit more gray area, like, you know, things in real life are.

971
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm all about choice. If I don't like it, I won't choose it. Ta-da! But I do love in Miitomo that I can wear a princess dress, because it makes for some fun pictures.

972
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Or green lamé undies in a top hat, Rob.

973
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I do what I want in Miitomo, and I think anybody should be able to do what they want. Now, I realize I have a more tongue-in-cheek style with it. And for other people, this is real life. But again, I portray my Miitomo in fun, zany ways. I realize some other people are gonna take the Sim stuff very seriously, and that's, that's cool. Like I said, I'm all about choice.

974
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:29,000
If I don't want to do it, I won't choose it. Done! But Sims has always been about, you know, kinda, I guess, it's kinda funny, I can't help but get my head out of this story that was going around this week. Did you see this on Facebook?

975
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That the Tesla guy, Elon Musk, right? Had this whole theory that we are simply people living in a greater, uh, uh, and I'm totally gonna mess this up.

976
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Like avatars in a, like, intergalactic video game. Something like that, in an intergalactic video game simulation or something like that. And I was like, kinda like, how apropro with this Sims news is that, you know, for the, uh, greater civilization that's playing a game of The Sims right now with us, uh, you know, just interesting.

977
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Anyway, uh, very cool though. I'm all about options and, and more stuff, and if you, uh, wanna wear whatever clothes you want. I mean, how many women do I know that wear guys' clothes, cause a lot of times they're com- I don't wanna say they're always comfier, but for some women they are.

978
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And for me, shoot, sometimes I've seen like a button-up shirt or something that is a woman's shirt, but whatever.

979
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:32,000
You know what? Gendering clothes to me is as stupid as gendering pens.

980
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Especially t-shirts, although I get some need the boobage. Some need to be cut a little differently for the boobage. That's, but I mean, usually it doesn't-

981
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Call them titty shirts then.

982
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Well, to some extent I think that the girl cut shirts are meant to take into account the different torso length on average.

983
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But for me, like for example, if I wanna buy a men's t-shirt and I want it to fit girly but accommodate my shoulders, cause I've got some big shoulders.

984
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I'll buy a medium or a small, a men's medium or small. When I had pneumonia and lost all that weight, I could get away with wearing a boys' XL shirt.

985
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I have a few boys' XL shirts in my closet still, that I can still wear. But yeah, it doesn't matter. I buy men's jeans, you know why? Pockets.

986
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You know why else? Better made. It's just women's clothes are meant to be, I'm just gonna stop cause I will get on a rant.

987
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Is that products that are made for women are usually more expensive because they are put with some sort of, oh this is special for you.

988
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Or disposable fashion, you know.

989
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Made for a man but pH balanced for a woman.

990
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Oh, fuck that shit. You know what? I like the smell of my husband's deodorant. I buy it for him because that's how I want him to smell.

991
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Which is a wife's prerogative. And I will use that shit because it smells like sandalwood and freakin' oranges. And it smells amazing.

992
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I gotta read some of these comments from chat and then we'll move on. Stoppy in chat at live.voguenetwork.com says, burn that bra, DarkSakura. You go girl.

993
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Oh no, I can't burn my bra. I'm a double D. No, I take that back. I'm a triple D.

994
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I need the support. She's keeping her bra. But she's burning the women's pants. Listen, she is a Diners Drivin' in Dives, okay?

995
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Well now the entire internet knows my chest size. Thank you.

996
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Alan Alchemy says, women's jeans are given fake pockets so they have to buy a purse.

997
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And SSG100Matt says, my girlfriend hates girls jeans because of the pockets. She doesn't want to have a purse. She just wants men's pockets. There it is.

998
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Alright, let's move on. We got other stuff to talk about than just clothes. Although, funny enough, clothes will come up later in the show, I promise.

999
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
But it'll be a little different. For now, let's get back to some other games. Loki.

1000
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Alright, I know everybody's excited about this, but hey, that Allison Road game. The one that was supposed to be like kind of the continuation of P.T.

1001
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Because, you know, Silent Hills isn't gonna be a thing. Yeah, that got cancelled too. So, sorry.

1002
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Bastards. Well, but we don't know the reasons yet, right?

1003
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We don't know. They just said sadly.

1004
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Well, you know where all the tinfoil hats are going? Is that they got a C&D from our pals at Konami. Again, this is alleged and rumor mill, we don't know.

1005
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:46,000
They say that there will be a statement soon, but because they're not saying right away, everybody's assuming worst case scenario, everybody's already got a hate boner for Konami.

1006
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And, let's be real, rightfully so, after the past couple years. So, this is instantly where everybody's going.

1007
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Hey, Melger Solid 3. It's got a pachinko slot machine.

1008
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Hey, don't be ruining the news that's coming up later.

1009
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Spoiler.

1010
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But yes, they're basically from their official Twitter page.

1011
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Hi all. Sadly, Allison Road had to be cancelled. Statement to come in the next few days. Thanks for all your support. Very sad to see it had to come to this.

1012
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I was gonna say, wasn't this another Kickstarter project? And it was, but then the Kickstarter was stopped because they got the publishing deal.

1013
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Interesting.

1014
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So, I don't understand how it can be, you know, it's not really a continuation of it. I mean, it's just similar setting, I guess. I mean, I don't understand how they can get cease and desist from Konami.

1015
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I'm not sure how that works either, unless there was something, did they use-

1016
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Unless they've patented or copyrighted the gameplay for the trailer.

1017
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Eh, no. You can't really patent gameplay, though.

1018
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Or the events that happen. I don't know.

1019
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Well, here's the thing. Did they use Konami's name or Silent Hill's name in their Kickstarter?

1020
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Or did they use their assets for the engine?

1021
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah, because if any of those things came into play, that's gonna be what got them. But again, we are tinfoil-hatting with everybody else right now. We don't know that that's the case. There could be something else.

1022
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:18,000
The publishing could have fell through. Somebody may have left or decided it wasn't working. We don't know. So, we're gonna find out hopefully in the next couple days.

1023
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
They're gonna probably bury it under all the E3 news that's about to be released upon the world.

1024
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah, I'm just kind of skimming everything on this. I don't see anything mentioning Silent Hill or even P.T. for that matter.

1025
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yeah, and DungeonBuster in chat says the screens looked very, very similar to P.T.'s aesthetics, but that's like saying P.T. has a patent on scary modern house interiors.

1026
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
To me, isn't that saying that Silent Hill, in my opinion, isn't that saying that Silent Hill and Frigens are Resident Evil?

1027
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I mean, that's basically the same logic there. Yeah, I mean, there's just... I don't see anything like that. I mean, if it is a cease and desist from Konami, on what grounds, I'd be interested to see that.

1028
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh my god. If it does end up being that, can people hate them anymore right now? I don't think it's possible, but if that ends up being the case, we might find out.

1029
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Let's just hope it's not.

1030
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Alright, moving on. Some big news for this week. I think this is a pretty big deal anyway because I got some free games this week. Sorta.

1031
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Here's the deal. If you weren't aware, if you are using GOG.com, which, you know, is good old games, but I think now their branding is they're really just trying to be GOG.com.

1032
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And it's somewhat of a competitor to Steam, but they really started out and still deal with old video games. That really was their bread and butter for the first few years.

1033
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I've bought things on there like Sid Meier's Covert Action, which is one of my favorite games growing up.

1034
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You can get things like Sid Meier's Colonization, the original, you know, things like that. You can get old school games on good old games.

1035
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Oh, I bought a game called Castles 2 that I used to play a lot on PC. But anyway, now they do a lot of the newer games too because it is the same company that made the Witcher 3.

1036
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So they sell newer games as well, so they've been growing a bit more to be more of a Steam competitor.

1037
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
They put out that front end, the GOG Galaxy. Is that what it's called? GOG Galaxy, I think it's called?

1038
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah, I think so.

1039
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
It's like their storefront, their client, it was something they put out I think last year, a little bit of a response to Steam.

1040
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And now this is another pretty big step to try to get people to get that GOG account up and running and check out the GOG Galaxy front end.

1041
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Is that now you can link your Steam account with your GOG library and once you do so, you can import your Steam games into GOG at no extra charge.

1042
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But, there's a big but here, if you run this it's not going to just suddenly import all those 500 games you have on Steam that you collected in Humble Bundles.

1043
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It does have to be something that's approved by the publisher for this import.

1044
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So for that reason, this list is limited to what, about 20 or so games right now? I'm guesstimating here.

1045
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Some of the selections, VVVVVV, The Witcher Enhanced Edition, Galactic Civilizations 3, Braid, Saints Row 2, but not 3, Bit.Trip Runner, and so on and so on.

1046
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:31,000
So when GOG recognizes that these games are in your Steam library, they will now show up in your GOG library for no extra charge.

1047
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And some people might think, well what's the big deal? Well, A, to try to put everything into one warehouse because if you know that you have more games in your GOG launcher, what are you likely to fire up to play your games?

1048
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
GOG or Steam? There's that whole thing into it.

1049
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
The big, big thing for some people is the fact that GOG games are completely DRM-free.

1050
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And Steam does have their Steam DRM and we all know about the big button that if Steam ever goes out of business someday, their games will become DRM-free, but for now that's not the case.

1051
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So for some people that's a very big deal.

1052
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Also the GOG games sometimes come with little extras, like a PDF manual or a soundtrack, just kind of depending on the game.

1053
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That will show up in your GOG library on a game-by-game basis as well if it's found in your Steam library.

1054
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So not a ton of extra frills, but still kind of a nice feeling that, oh, if I buy it here, I'm also going to have it here.

1055
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's a little bit like trying to homogenize the PC platform in a little bit of a way. It certainly makes GOG more competitive, if nothing else.

1056
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So, I don't know, Loki, do you ever use GOG? Do you think you could try this at all?

1057
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I have some free games on there. That's about it, though. I haven't really used it much.

1058
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So I think I have GOG Galaxy installed, so I'll try it.

1059
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And actdeftinchat says, I'm supposed to be saying G-O-G. I don't know, I just... G-O-G, I don't know, I think GOG, whatever.

1060
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Maybe it's not correct, but it just rolls off the tongue in a different way. GOG.

1061
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Sounds like googly eyes, kind of like Bobby Blackwell would put on his Oculus Rift, or his HoloLens as the case may be.

1062
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So I don't know, I keep just saying GOG.

1063
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Must be hard to put those on the HoloLens, because you actually have to look through it.

1064
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I think he talked about it in tonight's show, that there is a safe place he can put them on there, but you'll have to download the show to hear it.

1065
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So, anyway. That's true. Thank you. Tigerclaw has a very good point as well. Tigerclaw says, well we call this place VOG, so we should be able to say GOG.

1066
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
You know what, that's a damn obvious point that probably is coming into play more than anything else, to be honest.

1067
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Sorry, it's the V-O-G.

1068
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Alright, anyway. I will say I did run this process myself earlier on GOG, and I got like nine extra games in my GOG library out of it.

1069
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
So, you know, that's kind of cool. Something for nothing. I'm a fan.

1070
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Most of these games I got out of humble bundles and stuff anyway, so.

1071
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Alright, let's move on. DarkSakura, you've got old games to talk about too. You love to talk about old games on this show.

1072
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah, and I need to tell everyone in chat not to spoil for me, but it was funny, last week's classic game was D.

1073
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And it looks like that I must be psycho and have the SPN, because D is now on GOG, which is the game that I was trying to run in emulated DOS, and it was not happy.

1074
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I paid six bucks for it, which is great, because I like paying less money for decent games.

1075
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:58,000
So, yeah. I mean, I think that it's good that it's out so now more people can experience the cracked out weirdness.

1076
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:09,000
But, yeah. Act deft. It was a joke. Psycho. And have ESPN.

1077
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Mean Girls reference. That's okay, not everybody's gonna get the Mean Girls reference.

1078
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I haven't even seen Mean Girls, but I know that.

1079
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
You can quote it without seeing it, it's fine.

1080
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I know, because of everybody. Actually, I have the movie now and someone needs to come over and watch it with me.

1081
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
So anyway, I already told y'all what it was about last week, so just go buy it.

1082
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I didn't realize that that's what Ken Gino died of, though. That he died of heart failure.

1083
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I thought he was gonna die of ESPN, but yeah.

1084
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Well, whatever.

1085
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Boo.

1086
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So apparently, though, he had another game idea that is now under crowdsourcing to cover.

1087
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
His colleagues are trying to develop this idea that he had into a game.

1088
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Um. So, called Kakexun. K-A-K-E-X-U-N. So, cool. If it's crazy, I'll play it.

1089
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I think that's really cool, though, that you had that classic game of the week last week and then all of a sudden it's back in the news.

1090
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It's almost like someone out there listens to this show, Dark Sakura. Someone out there with influence is listening.

1091
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And they got the license and everything all put together in a week.

1092
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Well, nobody else is using it.

1093
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Technically, like, three days.

1094
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It was an easy one to get. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1095
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
It did, well, it's original release had an MS-DOS version, so what ifs.

1096
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
What ifs. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1097
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We may not be able to foresee the virtual releases all the time, but we definitely know what's gonna hit the store shelves at least.

1098
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And some of the virtual releases.

1099
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?

1100
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Well, one thing we know that's coming out this week is gonna be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, which is on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1101
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Also, we have Odin Sphere Left Fraser. I think that's how you pronounce that.

1102
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
That's on PlayStation 3. Basically all the PlayStation platforms. PS3, PS4, and Vita.

1103
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
SteamWorld Heist HD on PC, Mac, and Linux. PS4 and Vita.

1104
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
The Solus Project on PC and Xbox One.

1105
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And then also Hearts of Iron 4 on PC, Mac, and Linux.

1106
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And, let's see, later on this week, on Friday, we're gonna have Kirby Planet Robobot.

1107
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
That's on 3DS.

1108
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
It's a big deal for some people.

1109
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Yep. And then there's a new Sherlock Holmes game coming out, apparently, The Devil's Daughter.

1110
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1111
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Some people eat those games up.

1112
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Yes.

1113
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
That's why they keep making them.

1114
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And then, of course, Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. That's on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

1115
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And Outlier Sophie, the Alchemist of the Mystery Book on Vita and PlayStation 4.

1116
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That's it.

1117
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there for this week.

1118
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
On June 9th, Project CARS Perfect Edition hits the PlayStation 4.

1119
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Mirror's Edge Catalyst also gets released in Japan on June 9th.

1120
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And Grand Ages Midi-Val comes out. Not medieval, but Midi-Val comes out on the PlayStation 4 this week as well.

1121
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And I think there's also a motocross video game, MXGP 2, comes out in Japan this week.

1122
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
That is all on the PlayStation 4.

1123
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:42,000
On the Wii U, unfortunately, nothing really to report until we get closer to, like, the 23rd when Minecraft Wii U comes out in Japan.

1124
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,000
But there's nothing on the Vita this week either, which is kind of surprising, because the Vita is much different in Japan than it is here in the US.

1125
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
They still get a lot of releases over there.

1126
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But there is some stuff to look forward to on the 3DS.

1127
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
In fact, there are some new LL systems, their version of the XL.

1128
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
They have a lime cross black and a pink cross white system coming out.

1129
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And on June 9th for the 3DS, Gaya Kuten Saiban 6.

1130
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That is the Ace Attorney series.

1131
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It's a new game this week, so I'm pretty sure some folks who are into those law games and Objection and Phoenix Wright and all his characters are going to be excited about that release on the 3DS this week.

1132
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Alright, let's move over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1133
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Very little. On the 9th, Mirror's Edge Catalyst. On the 10th, Kirby Planet Robobot.

1134
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Done. There it is.

1135
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to go to Dark Sakura with this week's Classic Game of the Week and see what future digital release she'll be predicting this week. Loki.

1136
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm actually surprised by this number, but apparently Valve has sold 500,000 units of the Steam Controller.

1137
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Wow, that is pretty good.

1138
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
That is pretty good.

1139
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
That's worldwide, right?

1140
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yes.

1141
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
You have to remember, Steam is very, very, very, very, very big in other countries as well, more so even than console gaming.

1142
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So it's a little less surprising when you consider the worldwide element.

1143
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I don't know, I have never tried that controller, but it's different, so I don't like it.

1144
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Not really my appeal, or it doesn't appeal to me, but that's cool that they've sold so many.

1145
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I don't like things that are different, signed Loki.

1146
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm just kidding.

1147
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But I saw a sale on Steam, that was the big Steam sale this weekend, was buy a controller or a Steam Link.

1148
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I have to admit, I was a little bit tempted, but I didn't do it.

1149
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I'm not using the Steam Link enough, sadly, to justify that.

1150
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I like the Xbox 360 controller. It works well.

1151
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I mean, I don't really think I need this controller.

1152
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I mean, yeah, I don't, so I'm not going to pick it up.

1153
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Maybe if they have one on a really cheap, cheap sale or something, like ten bucks or something.

1154
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
But no, I'm not going to pick it up for full price.

1155
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Alright, well congrats anyway on the sales milestone for Valve.

1156
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It'll be interesting to see if they decide to do a second version, or they soup it up with something else later on, who knows.

1157
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I bet some of y'all went to the mall this weekend.

1158
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And the reason why is because of a partnership between Vans and Nintendo.

1159
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Now we had already talked about on a previous episode how this partnership was happening, but the release actually came out.

1160
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And it is more than just shoes.

1161
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:46,000
We thought in the beginning, because Vans is probably most famous for their shoes, and originally they were showing shoes, well guess what?

1162
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:55,000
There's a hell of a lot more that's out there, including backpacks, hats, socks, sandal-type shoes, shirts.

1163
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I mean there's a lot of stuff that's out there, so you can actually check a lot of that out on Vans' store.

1164
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
There's actually some cute stuff that I want, like this hat that has all the Donkey Kong stuff on it I think is really cool.

1165
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
You can just get a hat that says Game Over.

1166
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
You get a backpack that says Game Over.

1167
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You can get a t-shirt that has the princess on it, and with a little logo around it that says your princess is another castle, something like that.

1168
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
So you can check that out.

1169
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And Vans has this all online on their website, so you can check that out at the Vans website, but it's also available in stores.

1170
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So some folks have been going to the stores to check some of this out.

1171
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
They are saying though that this is a limited time.

1172
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:45,000
We don't know what the limited time is, if it's a couple years, if it's through the holiday or what, but don't expect these things to be around forever.

1173
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
But that's actually very typical of licensing agreements.

1174
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
They're not usually indefinite. They usually have a type of limit on it.

1175
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
So there you go.

1176
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
And Bobby Blackwolf says, do those shoes cost $300, Rob?

1177
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Great question, but no, I believe they're more in the what, like $40 to $60 range.

1178
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Oh, there you go.

1179
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Actev says $60 to $80.

1180
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's still kind of pricey for shoes, but you know what?

1181
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
You know what I say to that, Dark Sakura?

1182
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Let's get them.

1183
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars.

1184
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
All right, let's travel back.

1185
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:24,000
You know, I remember when Nintendo clothes were something you had to order out of Nintendo Power when they had a catalog in the magazine.

1186
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You could just walk into the mall.

1187
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week where every week on the show,

1188
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Dark Sakura picks a game out of the archive that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this with E3 on the horizon to hell with Mirror's Edge and Mass Effect Andromeda.

1189
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Just kidding. She didn't say that.

1190
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
To hell with all these new games. Play this classic.

1191
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I was like, hey, you remember this one?

1192
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Well, the game of the week is Pandemonium, which was also known as Magical Hoppers in Japan.

1193
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And I will tell you this, even-

1194
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Also known as some reviews I've seen for this show.

1195
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Girl.

1196
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
So anyway, what's funny is that I actually played Magical Hoppers first.

1197
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:19,000
If I remember right, I think Pandemonium was released in the US first and then Magical Hoppers came out in Japan and then Pandemonium got the UK release.

1198
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So they were actually kind of different versions of different things.

1199
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So it was pretty, pretty interesting that way.

1200
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So with this game, I mean, of course, the Japanese version is completely just reskinned and all of that.

1201
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So I'm sorry, I'm getting messages in the chatroom while I'm trying to do my segment. Stop it.

1202
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Anyway, so Pandemonium stars two characters.

1203
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
One of them is a jester named Fargus, and he has a staff named Sid.

1204
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And then there's the Nikki, who is a circus performer who then decides to become a wizard and she steals some book of magic and Pandemonium happens.

1205
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And it's one of those 2.5D games.

1206
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It actually plays not too differently in the way it scrolls and moves from Planoa.

1207
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It's just that little platforming in the round kind of thing.

1208
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And it's really you play through the game, you bop things on the head, you jump on things, you bounce on watermelons, you get gems and you beat the game.

1209
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:52,000
So versions of this game, there's the PlayStation, the PC and the Saturn version, and it had an N-Gage version.

1210
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,000
The N-Gage version had 11 levels where the other ones had 18.

1211
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And the saves for this game actually use a password system. They don't use the memory card.

1212
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Now, the story for the Japanese one is actually a bit different.

1213
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So with this game for Pandemonium, it starts off already in like a magical land and everything in the Japanese one.

1214
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And it actually has a fully animated opening instead of the 3D CGI opening that the U.S. one had.

1215
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:37,000
But the animated one for Japan in Magical Hoppers is that these two normal people get summoned to another world and the girl becomes a bunny girl.

1216
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And the boy gets some weird outfit and a magical talking stick.

1217
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And they have to, I guess, get back to their own world. It's different.

1218
01:26:47,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And so my memory first of this game is Magical Hoppers, including seeing all of the freaking commercials for it on some of the early anime that I would just watch taped off of my friend's TV in Japan.

1219
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So Pandemonium did have a sequel. It came out in 1997 for PlayStation and PC called Pandemonium 2.

1220
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And the Japanese sequel was called Miracle Jumpers.

1221
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:29,000
But I forgot to mention that Pandemonium came out in 1996 and was developed by Toys for Bob, which is great because we just saw a Bob last night and it was published by...

1222
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And I just retweeted the picture, by the way, of me because Alan posted it. So I was like, all right, even though I look hideously fat...

1223
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I'm not posting the picture of me.

1224
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
You look fine, but...

1225
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
No, I'm not doing it.

1226
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I was so drunk that clearly I just like, I didn't just suck in my gut. I stuck it out because I was like, hey girl, I'm drunk.

1227
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I had some Pandemonium of my own going on in the lower hemisphere, but whatever. It's done now.

1228
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Yeah. I broke my fan. That's all I said. Oh, I didn't realize this, but it also came out on iOS. Pandemonium did.

1229
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
But it was published by Crystal Dynamics. There you go.

1230
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Pandemonium, also known as Magical Hoppers.

1231
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:22,000
There it is, your classic game of the week. Pandemonium on the PlayStation 1, but as Dar Sakra mentioned, ports, lots of them.

1232
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,000
We're going to take a quick break for now though, but don't go anywhere. There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1233
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I failed on asking a Fugu question of the week again. God, I'm so sorry you guys, but I kind of did show roll at a way different time than I used to.

1234
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Why don't we just like ask a random question now for the folks in chat?

1235
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,000
We could do that or we could open it up to ask Orange Lounge. But then again, last time we did that, we didn't get a lot of questions.

1236
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
No, we didn't.

1237
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,000
So maybe we will ask a question of chat. We'll think about it and let you guys know when we come back with part B.

1238
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And we will do that. But we will also take your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1239
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And of course, we are going to do your emails as well that you've sent to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1240
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
When we come back, right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1241
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with our 644th episode for this June the 5th of 2016.

1242
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
By the way, I did put out in chat, just so you know, there is a chat question of the week since I failed on getting a FUGL question up.

1243
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
You should still follow us on Facebook and Google Plus just because we like friends.

1244
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio for you, you, Google faithful.

1245
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
But we do have a chat question up. If you want to see it though, you need to be in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

1246
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And please read that carefully because I want you to private message those answers to me.

1247
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So while we are collecting those, we're going to get some rapid fire news.

1248
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I turn around. We have a little workstation. My workstation during the show is in the corner.

1249
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So I'm not always able to look directly at Dark Soccer and Loki because I'm sometimes fixated on chat.

1250
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
But it's funny because I turn around from my corner and I see both Loki and Dark Soccer playing on their phones.

1251
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I'm not playing on my phone. I'm trying to get my text message forwarding set up.

1252
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I am playing on my phone.

1253
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It just looked like you were playing on your phone. It's just a funny thing to turn around and look.

1254
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Well, if you could put the phones down for a minute and we're going to do some rapid fire news.

1255
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Loki, starting us off.

1256
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Sure. If this will accommodate my catching the Raticate here.

1257
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I don't think you're supposed to be talking about that.

1258
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Whatever. No one's going to send a police after me or anything.

1259
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I don't give a shit.

1260
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Anyways, so last week we talked a little bit about what was coming to Xbox Live Marketplace for the month of June.

1261
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Now let's talk about PlayStation Plus.

1262
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
We're getting NBA 2K16, which I really don't give a shit about because sports.

1263
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And then Gone Home, which is alright.

1264
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So those are going to be your free games on PlayStation 4.

1265
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
PlayStation 3 is getting Echo Chrome and Siren the Blood Curse, episodes 1 through 12.

1266
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
That's kind of cool.

1267
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And Vita, God of War Chains of Olympus, and Little Deviants.

1268
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
And yeah. So pick those up starting May 7th.

1269
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Or I'm sorry, June 7th.

1270
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
The May games are actually, tomorrow is going to be the last day to download the May stuff.

1271
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So make sure you mark it.

1272
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I'm running late.

1273
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I'll still put NBA 2K16 in my library because it's a free game.

1274
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And why not.

1275
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:45,000
So Minecraft, it seems like each week they're catching up more and more with the Pocket Edition.

1276
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
And Windows 10 version and all that.

1277
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Now this week they're going to be getting a brand new update.

1278
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Including pistons as well as, looks like, some other features.

1279
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Mainly the Redstone piston stuff was up there.

1280
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
1.5 they called the friendly update.

1281
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And it includes like, let's see, pig riding, horse armor.

1282
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And yeah, the pistons are the main kind of draw there.

1283
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Gamers love their horse armor.

1284
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
But yeah, it's kind of cool.

1285
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And I'm looking forward to checking that out on Windows 10 and the Android version as well.

1286
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Especially now that I have that VR version, so yeah.

1287
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Gotta check that out.

1288
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And then last but not least, Chrono Trigger.

1289
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Wants, you know, the director of the game, Takashi Takeda.

1290
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
He wants the game remade.

1291
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
You know what, I say if they're going to remake it, can we remake it like in the style of the actual drawn artwork?

1292
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Because that'd be pretty badass.

1293
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Could they remake it in five episodic statements like they're doing Final Fantasy VII remade?

1294
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Well if Square is going to...

1295
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,000
The style of the artwork.

1296
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
It was all Toriyama.

1297
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
But now it could actually be all hand drawn.

1298
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
It would have to be pixel art.

1299
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Well that's true, but I see what you mean.

1300
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
But I mean, the pixels are still based off of the artwork too.

1301
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I would kind of rather see them do a sequel type of thing.

1302
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I mean yes, I know about Chrono Cross, but I kind of don't.

1303
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I don't know, I don't see that game as a sequel. I know not everybody agrees with me.

1304
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
But I'd like to see them do something like more of a direct successor to Chrono Trigger.

1305
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
But let me just hold my breath.

1306
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Except the whole thing is that Cross was the direct successor?

1307
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Yes, I know.

1308
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Because it had the characters returning for the...

1309
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
But the gameplay was awful.

1310
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
That's just my opinion.

1311
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Well this day and age I guess it's going to be called Chrono Triggered.

1312
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
So it will be a whole different storyline along with that.

1313
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Moving right along.

1314
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Let's get into, hey Pokemon!

1315
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
More information on Pokemon Sun and Moon.

1316
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So not only do we have the Treehouse event coming up,

1317
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
but we also had some Pokemon announcements this week.

1318
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
They did like another sort of direct thing, more like a Q&A type of thing this week.

1319
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
And they actually showed some more information,

1320
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
including some more information about the legendaries that are on the box art for Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.

1321
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
For example, Solgalo is the Pokemon from Pokemon Sun.

1322
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And I'm sorry if I mispronounced these things.

1323
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It is a Psychic or Steel type.

1324
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Not a Fire type.

1325
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Even though it is Pokemon Sun.

1326
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
But okay, whatever.

1327
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And then Lunala is from Pokemon Moon.

1328
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And Lunala is a Psychic Ghost type.

1329
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
There you go.

1330
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Also, more information about some of the gameplay mechanics itself,

1331
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
including the fact that it will be on the Aloa region,

1332
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
which is four tropical islands and an artificial island.

1333
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
So a lot of people comparing it to Hawaii.

1334
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Usually the locations in the Pokemon games are inspired by something in the real world.

1335
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,000
The professor, the topless professor in the game,

1336
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
which is getting a lot of fan art.

1337
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I don't know if you've seen that,

1338
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
but there's a lot of stuff on Twitter and Tumblr about Professor Kukui

1339
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
is the Pokemon professor.

1340
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And there's also a girl who assists the professor named Lily.

1341
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
There's also Hau, which is a boy with a big appetite

1342
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
who is the same age as the player's character.

1343
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
And then also the Pokedex is a little different now.

1344
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
The Pokedex is a Pokemon, and it's Rotom.

1345
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
It's a Rotom Pokedex, and it will do much more than simply record Pokemon.

1346
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
There is a personality.

1347
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
It will now show your current location and the next destination on the map,

1348
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
on the second screen.

1349
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So that'll be kind of nice for those that lose their place in the Pokemon games.

1350
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So that's pretty cool.

1351
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Also, one other quick thing.

1352
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
There's going to be a QR scanner,

1353
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
and it will allow you to see information about Pokemon when you scan QR code patterns.

1354
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
And you can register Pokemon of the Aloa region in their Pokedex

1355
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
and figure out where they live by scanning in QR codes.

1356
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
This sounds sort of like something they did in Yo-kai Watch,

1357
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
although in Yo-kai Watch, when you scan a QR code, you got a little in-game bonus.

1358
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
But I'm wondering if instead these QR codes that you scan in

1359
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
are going to sort of help you find maybe some harder-to-find Pokemon in the game.

1360
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'll be very curious about that.

1361
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
We were talking a little earlier in the show about Splatoon.

1362
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Even though they said there was going to be no more major updates to Splatoon,

1363
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
there still is updates happening.

1364
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
In fact, one is scheduled to happen on June 8th,

1365
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
including nine new weapons in the weapons shop.

1366
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Also, two new kinds of gear will be added also in the shop.

1367
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
There are some adjustments to main weapons, sub-weapons, and abilities.

1368
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
There's also going to be some stage adjustments.

1369
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
For example, you will no longer be able to take some shortcuts in the Arowana Mall.

1370
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You also will not be able to take shortcuts in the Piranha Pit.

1371
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
So they're just kind of tweaking some maps and so forth.

1372
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So there you go.

1373
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And then they also say, of course,

1374
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
several enhancements to improve the user's experience and enjoyment.

1375
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
The ever-so-vague reference there.

1376
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And lastly, from Nintendo, could there be more Mario Kart 8 DLC on the way?

1377
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
This would be the type of thing that would be perfect to announce during Treehouse.

1378
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
It's kind of a bit of a surprise.

1379
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Well, Nintendo of Europe actually tweeted out saying,

1380
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Good things come to those who wait. Hashtag MK8.

1381
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
A lot of people are reading this to say,

1382
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
could this mean that there's going to be more DLC for Mario Kart 8?

1383
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Finally, Mortal Kombat 8's going to be coming to the Wii U.

1384
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:56,000
But there's a screenshot with it that is from a different Mario Kart game.

1385
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So is it maybe a virtual console thing?

1386
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Who knows?

1387
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
But I don't think anybody would be too upset if they would put out some more maps,

1388
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
maybe a few more characters.

1389
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Why not? Another reason to go visit Mario Kart 8 after all this time.

1390
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Why the heck not? I'm for it.

1391
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Dark Sakura!

1392
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Well, for folks in Tokyo, Sega is having a 25th anniversary Sonic celebration.

1393
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
It's happening on June 25th, and you could possibly get into it.

1394
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
It will also be streaming through different channels,

1395
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
and will have some different developers there.

1396
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And yeah, you can play the new Sonic Boom, but no one cares.

1397
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And this is not replacing the event that's happening in San Diego on July 22nd here in the US.

1398
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,000
And what Joyopolis is, is basically like an arcade theme park type place.

1399
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Next up, in more Sega news,

1400
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap has been teased for a possible smartphone release.

1401
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:19,000
It looks like it got teased by Dotemu, and also got another tag on there for Lizard Cube.

1402
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And it looks very strongly hinted. I think it's going to be on some mobile device.

1403
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
But it could also possibly be on the 3DS or Wii U.

1404
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:39,000
And that was the game that was the sequel to the first Wonder Boy game.

1405
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I think in the US we got it as Monster Boy, or one of them.

1406
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And also, and this is great, great, wonderful news,

1407
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:56,000
is that Capcom has bound Noel Brown from the 2016 Pro Tour events,

1408
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
and Evo supports them 100%.

1409
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,000
If someone doesn't know what this complete waste of humanity did,

1410
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I'm sorry, I should be reporting the news. What this person allegedly did.

1411
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:25,000
He basically was going around harassing both verbally and physically female attendees,

1412
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
and he was caught on camera doing it.

1413
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I was going to say, was it? I mean, I know you're supposed to say allegedly,

1414
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
but when it's right there on a live stream, it's...

1415
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So basically, he's a dumb shit and an asshole shit.

1416
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:47,000
So I have no respect for any human being that does not respect the consent of another person.

1417
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
So it's disgusting. He's disgusting.

1418
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So as a first defense, he is banned from the entire tour for this year,

1419
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
and if it happens again, he will be banned for life.

1420
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And since this is the first time they've had to make a judgment like that,

1421
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
they're holding this for everybody.

1422
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
First offense, you're banned for the year. Second offense, you're banned forever.

1423
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
So I like this statement.

1424
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
We do not condone any acts of harassment, and we want all of our players and fans to know

1425
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
we will continue to work to ensure that all Capcom Pro Tour events

1426
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:33,000
provide safe, inviting environments where the focus is on healthy competition and exciting rivalries.

1427
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So, yeah. Gone.

1428
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Bye.

1429
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Yep. Oh, and one last thing is that EVO said that they'd completely stand behind Capcom's decision,

1430
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
and he won't be allowed to attend EVO 2016.

1431
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So, he's not even gonna get lit in the building.

1432
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Well, let us move on to a much more pleasant topic,

1433
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
and that is one where we get to interact with our listeners in a segment

1434
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
we would usually do as the Fugu Question of the Week,

1435
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
but because of my failure, it is the Chatters Question of the Week.

1436
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:26,000
You know what, though? Hey, even though it's my failure and Facebook and Google lost out,

1437
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
the chatters won, so, hey, things work out sometimes.

1438
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Anyway, we wanted to know of our chatters this week.

1439
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
We asked, what is your favorite E3 memory?

1440
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Which, by the way, would have been the question I asked on Fugu if I hadn't remembered.

1441
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
So, what is your favorite E3 memory?

1442
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
And this could be a game that was announced, maybe a demo that you played during those years

1443
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
where you could kind of beam the demos down or maybe you went to a Best Buy or something.

1444
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Maybe you got to go to the show and you have a memory being at the show itself.

1445
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So, let's see what our chatters thought.

1446
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Bobby Blackwolf starting us off with a message that says,

1447
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
My first in 1997.

1448
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Well, you know what they say, you never forget your first.

1449
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I know my first E3 was a trip.

1450
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It was such a trip, and I'm sure my co-hosts feel very similar.

1451
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:18,000
So, yeah, the first E3 is always kind of a big one.

1452
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Moving on to some other answers here from our chat room.

1453
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

1454
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Back in E3 2014, I was watching the initial reveal of Zelda Wii U.

1455
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Enuma was talking about how the new game was going to work,

1456
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
but then when he said,

1457
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And here's your first look at the world of the new Legend of Zelda,

1458
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
and he snapped his fingers,

1459
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I screamed so loud it scared the other dogs in my mom's bedroom.

1460
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Good times.

1461
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Yes, I think we've all had that gasp moment.

1462
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Stopy says,

1463
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
My favorite has to be The Last Guardian and Shenmue 3 announced.

1464
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I went into E3 last year so cocksure of myself

1465
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
that we wouldn't hear a peep about either.

1466
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Then I tell you what, Alice bangs Zoom straight to the moon.

1467
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Yeah, nothing can come close to Sony 2015.

1468
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Yeah, that was a pretty big deal.

1469
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Act Def says,

1470
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
My favorite E3 memory.

1471
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I can't recall a special one,

1472
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
but one of the most recent ones

1473
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
is probably when Mirror's Edge Catalyst was first announced.

1474
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I got really excited for there being a sequel

1475
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
to one of my most favorite games of the last generations.

1476
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Vidpower says,

1477
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Memorable E3 moment.

1478
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Free Xboxes for everyone in the audience at E3 2010.

1479
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Lucky you.

1480
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Did you get one of those, Vidpower?

1481
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Lucky you.

1482
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Because I guess I was happy for the people in the audience.

1483
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yeah, I was looking at the redesign.

1484
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
But also a little bitter.

1485
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
That's all right.

1486
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Anyway,

1487
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Reginator says,

1488
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
My favorite E3 memory was watching coverage of it on G4.

1489
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Sigh, sniff.

1490
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And participating in E3 events via PlayStation Home.

1491
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Oh yeah, that was kind of a neat little thing they did.

1492
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Too bad they pulled the plug on that.

1493
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
SSG100Matt says,

1494
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
When Sony dropped the mic during their PlayStation 4 conference

1495
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
by saying they would allow used games

1496
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and not require an always online connection.

1497
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That conference sent shockwaves around the industry

1498
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,000
and actually caused Microsoft to reverse their Xbox One policies

1499
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
a few days later.

1500
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
That was pretty awesome.

1501
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I'm surprised we didn't get more answers so far that said that.

1502
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Because that really...

1503
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
That was just like, damn.

1504
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
That was a moment for the ages.

1505
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
That was just...

1506
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
That was a public beating is what that was.

1507
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And hey, the kind of moment that fanboys live for.

1508
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Orange Wright says,

1509
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I don't think anything can match

1510
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
watching Konami's 2010 press conference for the first time.

1511
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Watching that best worst conference without knowing what to expect

1512
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
left me bewildered the entire time.

1513
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Sony 2015's one-two punch of Last Guardian and Shenmue 3 is a close second.

1514
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Kind of makes you wonder.

1515
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Sony's raised their bar pretty stinkin' high.

1516
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Kind of wonder what they're going to show this year.

1517
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I mean, after what they've done the past couple years,

1518
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
they're going to have to...

1519
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I don't know.

1520
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
They're going to have to give free money to people or something.

1521
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
We'll see.

1522
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Dungeon Buster says,

1523
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Best memory of E3?

1524
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Probably going to the first one and running into Howard Lincoln.

1525
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Like, almost literally running into him and the ring of cameras around him.

1526
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Thanks for the answers in chat, you guys.

1527
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Those are some really good answers.

1528
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
How about you guys here in studio?

1529
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Your best E3 memory?

1530
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And that could be one you went to or one you...

1531
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I know we've all been to at least one.

1532
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
But that could be one you went to or one you didn't go to.

1533
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I'll do mine because I kind of already told this story a couple weeks ago on the show,

1534
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
so I'll keep it short.

1535
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
But I think Will Wright actually doing the demo with Spore

1536
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
was a very surreal moment for me as a gamer and a developer I really respect.

1537
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
So, yeah, that's my personal favorite memory.

1538
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Dark Sakura?

1539
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Probably all the times I bumped into Kojima every year.

1540
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It just happened and he recognized me the third year.

1541
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I don't even know how it happened.

1542
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It was just like this fake magnet.

1543
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And then in the magical sound vibrating floor at the Xbox announcement.

1544
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
No, I'm kidding.

1545
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It was really uncomfortable to sit on that diagonal floor.

1546
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I do remember that very first year getting to meet Akira Yamaoka.

1547
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And that was very, you know, we all love him because of Silent Hill

1548
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
and the stuff he did for DDR and 2DX.

1549
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
So getting to meet him was a huge highlight, too.

1550
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And I got my photo with Igarashi.

1551
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
That was cool.

1552
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Loki, how about you?

1553
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I don't know.

1554
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I mean, I guess the PlayStation 4 thing was pretty awesome.

1555
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Even though I look back at it now, it wasn't as awesome as I think I originally thought it was.

1556
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Asking Jason Enos at the time about In the Groove was pretty funny.

1557
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Too bad we didn't get the recording of it.

1558
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Yeah, it was kind of my bad, but...

1559
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Whatever, it's fine.

1560
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
His response was very politically correct, for the record.

1561
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah. He's a cool guy.

1562
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I don't know. That's about it.

1563
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Yeah, I can't really think of anything too huge.

1564
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Some folks in chat are lighting up...

1565
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

1566
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
These are some great responses in chat.

1567
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
S2100Matt says,

1568
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
What about the ferret being put on the Katamari?

1569
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

1570
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
How about hashtag space ponchos?

1571
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Reijinator says,

1572
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Remember Sony's presser from E3 2006?

1573
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
$599 US dollars.

1574
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
$599 US dollars.

1575
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Reij Racer!

1576
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Attack the enemy crab. Historically accurate.

1577
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Stoppy says,

1578
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
They can only top themselves one way.

1579
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
PlayStation 4 now plays everything PlayStation.

1580
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
PS1, 2, 3, and 4.

1581
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I kind of don't think that'll happen.

1582
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And Vita. Why not do Vita?

1583
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I kind of don't think that'll happen, Stoppy,

1584
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
but if it does, I'll do a YouTube reaction video of myself crying.

1585
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
How's that?

1586
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
That'd be awesome.

1587
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
At least PlayStation 1. I mean, come on, man.

1588
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Like, the PSP plays PlayStation 1 games.

1589
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
That console is more powerful than the PSP.

1590
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Yeah.

1591
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
No YouTube if it's just PS1.

1592
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I'll maybe shed a single tear if it's PS1,

1593
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
but it has to be all of that.

1594
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Because I have a lot of PlayStation 1 games,

1595
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
or even PlayStation 2 games,

1596
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
like, I had purchased, like, you know,

1597
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Katamari and also Twisted Metal Black,

1598
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
and I saw that Twisted Metal Black's on sale again

1599
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
for the PlayStation 4 for $5.

1600
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I'm like, eh, it's only $5. I'm like, fuck that.

1601
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
No, I already bought it once. I am not paying for this again.

1602
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Granted, it was only a dollar that I paid for it originally.

1603
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I still won't pay them for it again.

1604
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Not necessarily directly related to the show itself,

1605
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
but I just, I have to throw this out there as a favorite memory,

1606
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
and it's kind of a throwback to our old home and our old network,

1607
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
but, and I think it was the last year all three of us all got to go,

1608
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
and that was the Paris Hilton year E3, right?

1609
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
2006, the year of the Wii.

1610
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
That was when we did the All Games thing in Santa Monica.

1611
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Remember, we were at the hotel, like, right down the street from that?

1612
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That wasn't the last year I was able to go.

1613
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Was it?

1614
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Oh, you went one of the years I didn't go.

1615
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
You went after the Santa Monica years one more time,

1616
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
because you went as a distributor.

1617
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Yeah, I went 2009.

1618
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
But I think it was the last year all three of us went.

1619
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Yeah, maybe.

1620
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
And they were, I feel like they were broadcasting the entire time

1621
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
from that arena lounge, and they had their own little mini event

1622
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
going on there, and it was just a lot of fun,

1623
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
because we were with other indie podcasters,

1624
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
kind of like our little niche audience, and that was a lot of fun,

1625
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and I do remember the whole time thinking,

1626
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
boy, somebody spent a lot of money on this,

1627
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
but thank you, thank you.

1628
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
That was probably some of the most fun I've ever had at E3,

1629
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
like, outside the show itself, so it was a great, great experience, so.

1630
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
All right, any other moments to share before we move on

1631
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
with the rest of our show?

1632
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Okay, then let's get into some more news.

1633
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Loki.

1634
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:55,000
All right, this is pretty awesome, as I kind of alluded to before.

1635
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
The console mods that were promised, you know, last,

1636
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:05,000
was it last year during E3, for Fallout 4, finally are coming out.

1637
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
So May, the end of May, they launched for Xbox One,

1638
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
and were very popular.

1639
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
In fact, they've received 50 times more traffic

1640
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
than when it launched on the PC.

1641
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
And it's pretty awesome, you can actually go to,

1642
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
they have a special website that you go to for these,

1643
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
and then you can basically tag which ones you want,

1644
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
and then you go to your game, and there they are.

1645
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
So there's quite a few mods that are available now,

1646
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
and I think it's going to be launching for PlayStation 4

1647
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
at the end of this month, so.

1648
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Very much looking forward to that, that is pretty awesome,

1649
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
and something that they've been trying to do for,

1650
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
they said for 15 years now, so.

1651
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I can't wait to see, especially with this,

1652
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and then, let's assume that they're doing a new,

1653
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
like, Elder Scrolls game, that would be pretty awesome as well.

1654
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
All right, well, as spoiled by Loki earlier on the show,

1655
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
but no, I know you guys, you guys read blogs and Twitter,

1656
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
so I'm sure you guys have already seen,

1657
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
there is a new Metal Gear Solid 3 that was announced by Konami,

1658
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
but it is a pachinko machine.

1659
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Oh my god, all those things we said, please don't, please stop.

1660
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Konami, don't, like the slow motion stone.

1661
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
No.

1662
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Here it is.

1663
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yep, Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is now a pachinko machine.

1664
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
It will feature-

1665
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Oh, I need her.

1666
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
It will-

1667
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:37,000
It's not just snakes anymore.

1668
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Rob literally cannot right now.

1669
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Next story.

1670
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Kidding.

1671
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I don't know why that's so funny, because it's so stupid.

1672
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Yeah, I guess it would be Ball Eater, yeah.

1673
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Ball Eater.

1674
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I expect nothing less from Loki on this program anymore.

1675
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Coin Eater.

1676
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Yeah, they should just play that song, you know.

1677
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Characters from Snake Eater, including the pain, the end, the fear, and the fury,

1678
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
which are emotions you're all feeling after hearing this announcement, I'm sure.

1679
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So there you go.

1680
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
You can also check out the trailer if you want,

1681
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
but you're probably just going to be really upset.

1682
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater pachinko comes out in the fall in Japan.

1683
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Oh, I'm totally looking forward to not ever playing that, because it's in Japan.

1684
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
And not even round one's going to import it.

1685
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
At least not the one here.

1686
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I didn't see any pachinko machines at the round one I went to in San Jose.

1687
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I don't know if the one in SoCal, like if they bring in that kind of stuff.

1688
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I didn't see any of that up here.

1689
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
But you know what?

1690
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
If I'm going to do something Konami, it's going to be those music games

1691
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
that were actually pretty cool that I did get to play in San Jose.

1692
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
So as much as we love to have a hate circle jerk for Konami,

1693
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
and we all do on the internet right now, and with damn good reason,

1694
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
at least there's some cool stuff.

1695
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I never thought I'd be saying this in 2016,

1696
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
but at least there's some cool stuff happening in the Bomani world.

1697
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
At least there's that, if nothing else.

1698
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
All right.

1699
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1700
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Well, it's not exactly video game related, except it's Pokémon.

1701
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
So that's why I did it.

1702
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But there was, it's nice to hear stories about good cops, you know.

1703
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
So this kid, nine year old kid named Bryce,

1704
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
he was walking along with his Pokémon collection,

1705
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
and some kid just stole it out from under him and ran off with it.

1706
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
What a dick.

1707
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
What a dick.

1708
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Who would steal a kid's binder full of Pokémon cards

1709
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
that he's been collecting since he was six?

1710
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I'm really sorry about it, and it's a really big misunderstanding.

1711
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
No.

1712
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1713
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So anyway, they called the police,

1714
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
and the police did actually catch the kid,

1715
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
and gave Bryce back his binder, but it was missing some cards out of it.

1716
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:17,000
So what this guy did is he donated his Pokémon card collection

1717
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
from when he was a kid.

1718
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And a lot of Japanese cards actually,

1719
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
including like this Mew card that there's like one of ten of in the world.

1720
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And so, hey, I guess there are some good cops out there, right?

1721
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
So that's it.

1722
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
All right.

1723
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Yay.

1724
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Pokémon.

1725
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Saving the day.

1726
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
He won't care in five years.

1727
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Yeah, you never know.

1728
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
The story might make him care a little more.

1729
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
The story might make him care.

1730
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andraday with vognetwork.com,

1731
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
use the passphrase, surprise.

1732
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
All right.

1733
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Okumojp in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1734
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Pokey cops.

1735
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And Kaijudo says in chat,

1736
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Did the police catch them all?

1737
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Yes, they caught him all.

1738
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
All right.

1739
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And his prison sentence evolved into six more years.

1740
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
All right, moving on.

1741
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Loki.

1742
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,000
So, Vin Vindy has finished its hostile takeover of Gameloft.

1743
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
And according with that, they sent a letter to all of the employees,

1744
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
basically telling them,

1745
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Hey, you work for us now.

1746
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
So that's kind of interesting.

1747
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,000
And, of course, none of the higher-ups want them to take over the company.

1748
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And it's just, I guess that's why it's a hostile takeover.

1749
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Along with that, though, of course, it's suggested, I guess, that the CEO is considering resigning as well.

1750
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Basically, I guess it was saying that, yeah, the CEO, Michael Gilmont, is likely to resign.

1751
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
The family will likely consolidate its efforts on protecting Ubisoft from Vindy now.

1752
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
So, yeah, that kind of sucks.

1753
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
But, oh well, we're going to have to see what happens with Ubisoft now.

1754
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Very interesting.

1755
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Do you think E3 will get any type of, I mean, I guess it's not really the place for it.

1756
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It's not really the place, yeah, for it.

1757
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,000
And it's kind of hard because there's not a lot that they can do.

1758
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,000
What they're doing is it's not like they're, you know, they're buying the shares from third parties.

1759
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
So people that already have shares in the company, they're basically buying them from them.

1760
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
And so that's how they kind of get around it.

1761
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But, yeah, it's kind of hard when your company is being told, you know, being run by somebody else.

1762
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
And, yes, Vindy did such a bang-up job with Activision.

1763
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
So, eh, we'll see.

1764
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
All right.

1765
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Well, this is a very interesting throwback, one that seems a little archaic to me.

1766
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,000
But they're talking about that could the password, remember when video games had passwords?

1767
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Like the Guardian legend, right?

1768
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
TGL, Kid Icarus, right?

1769
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Icarus fights Medusa angels, wasn't that it?

1770
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Terror, danger, horror.

1771
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Yeah, Metroid, Justin Bailey, right?

1772
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
We all know these codes.

1773
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
So password, but usually the passwords were not so easy.

1774
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Like it was just like...

1775
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Narpus sword.

1776
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Is that a zero or an O?

1777
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Or you filled out a grid, you had to have draft paper if you were playing Mega Man.

1778
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:29,000
So could passwords be making a comeback in Dragon Quest XI?

1779
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I kind of think we the internet are reading too much into this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

1780
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Yuji Ohori actually said that passwords could make a return in the next installment of Dragon Quest.

1781
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
He said he's looking forward to bringing back the spell of restoration in Dragon Quest XI.

1782
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
That's the password system that was found in previous games.

1783
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:54,000
The password system will allow you to resume your game and obviously we have regular saving now.

1784
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Now, I hear something like that and I kind of go,

1785
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I don't know about that because people aren't going to want to write down passwords.

1786
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
But, here's what people do nowadays.

1787
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
What if the game gave you, this is what it would do, it would give you a QR code.

1788
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:12,000
And you could take a picture of the QR code and then you could take that anywhere.

1789
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Although I guess now that I think about it...

1790
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Fuck them!

1791
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
The game can't really scan QR codes.

1792
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
There's a reason why we don't use the password system anymore.

1793
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
It's because we have fucking saves.

1794
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And also because there's more data to save as well that with a password system you can't really do that.

1795
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:31,000
So, why? Why are you making it so fucking annoying to save my game?

1796
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Just save my fucking game.

1797
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:38,000
My thought is maybe, and Dartisious says I agree with Rob, that's what they're probably going to do.

1798
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I don't think the passwords are being used the way we're jumping to conclusions here.

1799
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Yeah, it's probably going to be, woohoo, you unlocked costumes, woohoo, it's items.

1800
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Yeah, you put in a password, you get a free item, you get a bonus, a costume, a monster, you know, something.

1801
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
That's probably what it's going to be.

1802
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I think if you're thinking you've got to get out the notebook to write down your complicated passwords, I really don't think that's going to happen.

1803
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Yeah, just save. Why are you doing this?

1804
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:11,000
So, there you go. Bobby Blackwolf says, why can't we just pay 99 cents to get them unlocked?

1805
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Why do you need a password for it? Well, maybe you'll have to pay to get the password.

1806
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Maybe only subscribers to Square Enix's newsletter will get the password.

1807
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Well, they're only getting that payment once because once they have the password, it's going up on the fucking internet.

1808
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Alright, we'll see what comes of it. I don't know, that story, I'm like, is that a translation error?

1809
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:37,000
But I don't know, everybody's running with it anyway, so we'll see, but I kind of think people are reading too much into it.

1810
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Let's get to something we love to read too much into, our emails.

1811
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

1812
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Sorry, I love these comments in chat.

1813
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Ragenator says, the password is Ermagerd.

1814
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Ermagerd.

1815
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Just a reminder, if you haven't noticed from listening to this show before, somewhere in the show, there is a password.

1816
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:18,000
We use passwords at VoG, because there's actually a game going on, and you can actually put in a password, and you get points.

1817
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:24,000
And what do you do at points? You collect them, like they're Pokemon. Why? Because that's the game.

1818
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
It makes you feel better about yourself.

1819
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
That's right.

1820
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
In some intangible way.

1821
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
So listen for the password in the show, unless you're listening live.

1822
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
If you're listening live, you just go to live.vognore.com, you just check right in, you get the exact same reward.

1823
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Sorry, you can't double dip. You can't listen live, and, well you can, but you won't get anything extra.

1824
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Besides a pat on the ass and a job well done.

1825
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Alright, anyway, let's get to, speaking of a pat on the ass and a job well done.

1826
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Our one email.

1827
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Let's get to our emails for this week. One email.

1828
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Hello from the Lone Star State. Hold on. Hello from the Lone Star State.

1829
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
That's Texas, right?

1830
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Hello from the Lone Star State.

1831
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
That's Texas, right?

1832
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I've been a new silent listener for about two months.

1833
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Answer my goddamn question. It's Texas, right?

1834
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
No shit.

1835
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Alright, well then I have to say this. You have to prove that you're from Texas. You ready?

1836
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:18,000
The stars at night shine big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.

1837
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,000
And if you didn't finish that, then I don't believe this email. Alright, go ahead.

1838
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I've been a listener for about two months, and it actually says, I've been.

1839
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Alright.

1840
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,000
No, no. I'm just saying, because that's how we talk in this album.

1841
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I guess I do believe you. Alright, move on.

1842
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I've been a new silent listener for about two months, and the show you have is just great.

1843
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Oh, please use punctuation though. I really would appreciate it.

1844
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I listen to this show normally the day after, and it's just great to listen to during work to get my mind out of work.

1845
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I've been dying to listen live, but I just seem to remember after Game of Thrones is over.

1846
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Goddamn that show.

1847
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Chair of Swords. And man, I beat myself up afterwards.

1848
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:07,000
But anywho, my point is, it's an awesome show, and good job to you all.

1849
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I'm sorry, it's really difficult to read without punctuation, sorry.

1850
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
You know what, give the guy a break. He probably typed it on his cell phone.

1851
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I almost, you know what, mine actually puts in punctuation.

1852
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I remember punctuation, usually.

1853
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I remember the Alamo.

1854
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I almost feel like I'm in the studio, haha.

1855
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
This comes from Spokesman101.

1856
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
PS, look into text alerts.

1857
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I never thought of that.

1858
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Okay, here's the thing with text alerts. I don't use any of them, because I kind of find them to be annoying.

1859
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I hate them.

1860
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Okay, but if people are going to request them...

1861
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
We've had one request.

1862
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Alright, is that a thing people want? How much does that cost to do?

1863
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I don't know, but I think they're annoying as fuck.

1864
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
But if somebody wants them, I'll annoy you if you want.

1865
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

1866
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
You know what, I'll text you.

1867
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I like the part where he stops moving.

1868
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,000
I'm going to just text you at 2 in the morning.

1869
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
You have a text from Orange Lounge Radio.

1870
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

1871
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And then you'll get a text at like 4, 12 in the morning.

1872
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Don't put me in charge of this shit.

1873
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
The stars at night, right?

1874
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Now, here's the thing. Here's what I would do.

1875
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
And I think this would be a great idea.

1876
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
And I'm volunteering Bobby, because I don't know anything about this stuff.

1877
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
But someday, we've talked about this for a while.

1878
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Lessons in telephony.

1879
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Having a VoG app.

1880
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:40,000
And the VoG app could do the push notification that would bother you if you enable it.

1881
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Because, you know, you can turn that on or off.

1882
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And then VoG would remind you,

1883
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Yo, fuck Game of Thrones tonight.

1884
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Bobby and OLR are on.

1885
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
And everybody going to die. That's what happens on Game of Thrones every week.

1886
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Don't bother with the chair of swords. We're more comfortable.

1887
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
That's what happens on Game of Thrones every week.

1888
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Everybody going to die.

1889
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,000
And something about doors. I don't know.

1890
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Or we could push a message earlier in the day saying,

1891
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Hey, just a courtesy announcement.

1892
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Game of Thrones is on all the piracy websites.

1893
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
So go watch it now so you're available for OLR tonight.

1894
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
That's something else we could do.

1895
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Hold the door for a moment. We got an announcement.

1896
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
DVR.

1897
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:28,000
You can stay off of Facebook for however long it takes for you to get caught up on chair of swords.

1898
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,000
And then bam, you got us.

1899
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Bobby is pointing out, create a text alert in your Twitter app for the VoG network account.

1900
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
It tweets whenever a show goes live.

1901
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Well, there you go. I guess that's true. I forgot.

1902
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I forgot we have that nice little convenient thing built in there.

1903
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Thank you for the lovely letter.

1904
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Yes.

1905
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I totally heard it in my head in my accent, which doesn't really come out that often unless it has an E2.

1906
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
But it would greatly, greatly look into actually using punctuation.

1907
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
No, I'm going to say I'm going to explain something.

1908
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I have a very difficult time reading something that does not have punctuation.

1909
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:12,000
To show me where a sentence ends, because it will just sound stupid when I read it out loud.

1910
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Because I just can't not read it the way it's written, you know.

1911
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:25,000
So put in a mark where the end of your sentences are and I won't be confused.

1912
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Before everything went online, I used to grade papers, so I'm used to it.

1913
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Yeah, but people should know how to, you know.

1914
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
But we're very, very thankful for the email, especially for the new listener.

1915
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Thank you.

1916
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Don't ruin the moment.

1917
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I'm not trying to ruin it. It just really does make it difficult to read aloud. That's all.

1918
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
All right.

1919
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Let's, well, thank you. If you want to send an email, participate at orangeloundtrader.com is the place to send that.

1920
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,000
And while you're using the at and the dot, don't forget to use them elsewhere.

1921
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Right, Darsyra?

1922
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Yes.

1923
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I made a point. I made a point.

1924
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
You didn't let me answer.

1925
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Oh.

1926
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Yes, God.

1927
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
All right, let's move on. What an appropriate time to get into the FUs of the week.

1928
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:42,000
FU to not being paid for doing nothing and for me for not writing my book.

1929
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I'm going to write my book. It'll be written. You'll see.

1930
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I'm going to comb that thing with a fine tooth comb for all your punctuation.

1931
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Girl.

1932
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Do you want to know how many times any of those papers I wrote in high school and college had punctuation errors?

1933
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
The only time were when I'm not the one that wrote them.

1934
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Like when other people are doing typing for me.

1935
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Write your book already. You've been talking about for 10 years.

1936
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I know you just get a hold of it before it's published.

1937
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I don't want to kill the poor girl.

1938
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Act up. You shut your form out.

1939
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I love this. No, we have to read. You don't just response.

1940
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Respond to people in chat without reading it. Act up.

1941
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Says Dark Soccer's book will be done with Loki's.

1942
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Loki's game is done. I love it.

1943
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
She's got time then.

1944
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
No, seriously.

1945
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Are you done?

1946
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
No.

1947
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
FU to people who say that I can't get my book done.

1948
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I will write it out of spite.

1949
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
It'll be called a tale of spite.

1950
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
We're just motivating you.

1951
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Well, I'm not motivated by spite. So there you go.

1952
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And also FU to having to still not have any caffeine.

1953
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Because now in another half a week I have to give up my coffee altogether. No decaf.

1954
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And my throat still hurts. It still hurts to talk.

1955
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I have a voice. But it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

1956
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So I have to make it to the end of the month.

1957
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
All the saints in heaven help me.

1958
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
If they exist. They're dead anyway.

1959
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
But may their memory help me.

1960
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I will remember.

1961
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
And I will persevere.

1962
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Are you alright? Are you finished?

1963
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I'm having a moment. Okay, I'm done.

1964
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I'm also reading about funeral homes.

1965
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Loki.

1966
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Yeah, I guess I have FU to myself for not working on my game.

1967
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
A lot of... I... I don't know.

1968
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I keep having the excuse that I'm tired.

1969
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,000
And it is the case because I'm literally falling asleep as I'm at my computer.

1970
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
And the last few nights it's been like, okay, I can play Final Fantasy XI.

1971
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Or I can work on my game.

1972
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And I'm just tired. Like, I'm tired as it is.

1973
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I really want to try.

1974
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
And I start trying to work on just research and stuff that I want to do for that.

1975
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And then I'm just fucking tired. I'm like, fuck it.

1976
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I'm just going to play Final Fantasy XI because it requires no brainpower whatsoever.

1977
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
And so I do.

1978
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And that's been the problem with...

1979
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Not necessarily Final Fantasy XI, but just like...

1980
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Okay, I can work on my game. I'm going to go on YouTube and research some stuff I want to find out about voxel engines.

1981
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Because that's my main thing is I've been trying to...

1982
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I've been stuck trying to find a way to optimize my voxel engine.

1983
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Because they have solutions that people have voxel engines all throughout Unity and stuff that people have made.

1984
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
But it doesn't...

1985
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
It's not optimized enough for what I want to do.

1986
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
And so I'm trying to figure out how...

1987
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Now I'm probably going to research how Minecraft does it.

1988
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I think it has to do with how they load their chunks and everything.

1989
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
And that's kind of...

1990
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
And really this is all just for the editor. It has nothing to do with the actual game.

1991
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Because the game is just going to be all...

1992
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
It's all pre-done. It's just...

1993
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
You know, I need...

1994
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
The editor for everything needs to have voxels.

1995
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
So whatever.

1996
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
So FU to myself for that.

1997
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
And also FU for the weather being so damn hot.

1998
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Thankfully now I have air conditioning.

1999
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:16,000
My FU of the Week also goes to just the hot weather.

2000
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
My god, it just makes me want to do nothing but be indoors all day long.

2001
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Although that's not such a bad thing.

2002
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,000
But I do have to be outdoorsy once in a while.

2003
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Once in a while.

2004
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I mean, where else am I going to find Pokémon?

2005
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
So there you go.

2006
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Allegedly.

2007
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Alright.

2008
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
That's it for the FUs of the Week.

2009
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Let's move on.

2010
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2011
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2012
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Yippee!

2013
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
1877 GameOLR.

2014
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,000
But our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2015
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
All one word.

2016
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Loki.

2017
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yes.

2018
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:49,000
So, to be honest, I don't know how this is going to be possible.

2019
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:54,000
But apparently there is a Star Wars Battlefront 3 fan game that's coming to Steam.

2020
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,000
And not only is it coming to Steam, not like through Greenlight or anything, it's being

2021
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
published by Valve.

2022
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
This story is a lie.

2023
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Valve doesn't do anything involving the number 3.

2024
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Come on.

2025
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Exactly.

2026
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I think that's right.

2027
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
They said, you know what?

2028
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:15,000
People have been fucking saying, you know, publish something with the number 3 in it.

2029
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Done.

2030
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:23,280
I just, I fail to see and they keep, I mean, they're saying that, you know, Valve is definitely,

2031
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:26,640
they're confident that there's not going to be like a cease and desist on this.

2032
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:27,640
But how?

2033
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:32,780
I just don't see how that's going to happen.

2034
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:34,160
I don't know how they're going to do that.

2035
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:36,400
Is it completely a mod?

2036
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:37,400
It's a fan game.

2037
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:42,400
So it's, I guess, I don't know if it's based off of what they had like previously done,

2038
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:48,880
because I know there was kind of a leaked, you know, Battlefront 3 that was done in Unity

2039
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:52,880
that was partially, I mean, partially completed.

2040
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:58,040
I don't know if that's going to be what they're doing now, but I don't know.

2041
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:01,440
I don't know how it's going to be accomplished, especially with, granted they're not calling

2042
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:07,560
it Star Wars, but it is Star Wars and it has all the Star Wars things in it.

2043
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:11,400
So, I mean, I just don't know how that's.

2044
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,320
When you say it has the Star Wars things in it though.

2045
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:19,880
Like the Star Wars, like the AT, the AT-ATs and the characters, like the droids, they're,

2046
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:20,960
they're just there.

2047
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,200
They're like, it's, it's, it's definitely that.

2048
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:29,200
I mean, it's not like, I don't even know how it's going to be possible.

2049
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,200
That's the thing.

2050
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:35,680
I don't know how they're going to manage to pull this off, but I guess they're confident

2051
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:37,320
it's going to be something that they can't fight.

2052
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:42,520
And then their, their defense is like, well, so far no one's, you know, done a cease and

2053
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:43,520
desist for anything.

2054
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:44,760
Because they're waiting for you to make money off it.

2055
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:46,160
But they're not making any money.

2056
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:47,160
It's going to be free.

2057
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,080
So it is something that is putting out for free.

2058
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:52,280
It's from Frontwire called Galaxy in Turmoil.

2059
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:55,520
Bobby's figured it all out in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2060
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:58,820
Bobby Blackwolf says it's Frog Fractions 2.

2061
02:13:58,820 --> 02:13:59,820
That's it.

2062
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,820
That's what happened.

2063
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:01,820
So laugh.

2064
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:08,100
It would be so awesome if that was it.

2065
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:11,060
That's that is my, that's my favorite E3 announcement by the way.

2066
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:12,540
It would be the biggest troll ever.

2067
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:13,540
What?

2068
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:14,620
It's Half Life 3.

2069
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:17,580
Or it's just Frog Fractions 3.

2070
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:22,100
There never was a Frog Fractions 2 or the Frog Fractions 2 was the buildup for Frog

2071
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:23,260
Fractions 3.

2072
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:27,140
But I was going to say my favorite E3 announcement is when they finally told us where the fuck

2073
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,560
we can play Frog Fractions 2.

2074
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:34,200
It's just, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm hoping for this year, Frog Fractions 2.

2075
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:39,280
I'm hoping for Gabe to actually come out on stage and say, I'm sorry, I'm not here to

2076
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:45,240
talk about Half Life, but I got Frog Fractions 2 y'all, deuces!

2077
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:47,920
And then drop some mic.

2078
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:56,480
He just, he can't get anywhere near a stage because people are like panting, heavy breathing,

2079
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,480
breathing intensifies.

2080
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,480
You know, it's just like nothing.

2081
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,280
Our expectations are way too high.

2082
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:04,980
Gabe is not allowed to touch a stage cause it's just going to be a disappointment no

2083
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:05,980
matter what.

2084
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:10,480
No matter what, it's going to be a disappointment because he didn't do it unless he's backed

2085
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:11,480
by a full choir.

2086
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:12,480
Oh my God.

2087
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:16,280
Can you imagine just like, just the ridiculousness.

2088
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:20,000
So I mean, since this is a, you know, our dream scenario here and everything, they give

2089
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,160
back like the, the full like Gaben meme thing, you know, where it's fucking, you know, just

2090
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:28,840
like, you know, the whole background and everything and just, you know, then eventually the mics

2091
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:32,320
drop in from the ceiling and the choir, it's all of that.

2092
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:33,320
Everything.

2093
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:34,320
It'll be the greatest show on earth.

2094
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,320
It will be.

2095
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:36,880
Have a circus while we're at it.

2096
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,880
Why not?

2097
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:38,880
All right.

2098
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:45,520
Akuma JP wants to point out, it is 2016, June 6th here.

2099
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:50,560
If you cut it in half, you get three, therefore it's time to announce Half Life 3.

2100
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,960
You know, it sounds to me, Akuma, that you're doing fractions.

2101
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:59,160
And if you divide by three, you get frog fractions too.

2102
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:09,960
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, hey, someday, someday now, you know what, I know we made

2103
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:15,840
a decision to not do E3 this year, but now I'm a little disappointed after something

2104
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,600
I heard about what's going to be shown at E3 this year.

2105
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:24,720
And that is, there's actually going to be a company showing some games at E3 this year.

2106
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:30,000
Naughty America will be attending the E3 Expo in LA, and they are going to be demoing and

2107
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,480
showcasing the latest in adult VR content.

2108
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,480
That's right.

2109
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:40,680
Naughty America has been on the forefront of technological advancements from HD to 4K

2110
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:46,440
and now VR adoption as the first major adult studio to produce VR content.

2111
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:51,560
By the way, reps will be on hand to discuss the expanding role that immersive, mortal

2112
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:56,040
content, mortal, Mortal Kombat.

2113
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:59,040
That's not the game I want to play in this experience.

2114
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:03,840
Reps will be there to discuss the expanding role that immersive mobile content plays in

2115
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:09,440
adult entertainment, how gamers utilize VR headsets for adult content and explain the

2116
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:10,840
technological horizon.

2117
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:15,360
It's going to be like that scene in the freaking lawnmower, man.

2118
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:19,800
But this goes to show that VR will survive.

2119
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:20,800
Of course.

2120
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,240
I've already, I mean, you've already tried it out.

2121
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:25,320
I mean, so this is like an actual thing.

2122
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:27,120
And I mean, what was it?

2123
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,520
They've been doing this already, like a lot of different sites.

2124
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:32,960
How nice of Naughty America to claim that they're the first, which is not fucking true

2125
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:33,960
at all.

2126
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:34,960
But whatever.

2127
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:35,960
I mean, who gives a shit?

2128
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:39,400
I mean, there's a lot of different content providers now, and I guess they're the most

2129
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:41,960
name brand worthy of it.

2130
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:44,720
But yeah, it's pretty much everywhere.

2131
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:50,280
I'm mobile since it's basically just a video with head tracking.

2132
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:56,600
Now this article that I'm looking at on this website, VG247.com, which I do like this website

2133
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:59,640
by the way, I'm going to be a little critical here in a minute, but I do really enjoy this

2134
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:05,560
website, just to be clear, actually asks, does VR porn have a place at E3, a show that

2135
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:08,760
is primarily about the video game and interactive entertainment business?

2136
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:10,160
Oh, these kids today.

2137
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:13,160
Oh, these kids doing their reporting today.

2138
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:16,800
They seem to have forgotten about Kensha Hall back in the day.

2139
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:20,600
And I think some things that actually, I don't, the one that comes to mind, do you guys remember

2140
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:23,040
Feel 3, I think was the name of the game.

2141
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,480
It wasn't even in Kensha Hall, if I remember right.

2142
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:26,480
Yeah.

2143
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:27,480
Yeah.

2144
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:33,200
It was like, it was like, it was like the second life thing that was all adult.

2145
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:34,680
That shit was at E3.

2146
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,400
So does VR porn have a place at E3?

2147
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,400
Yes.

2148
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:39,880
It's not out of character for E3.

2149
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:43,000
It's not Game Expo, it's interactive entertainment.

2150
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
That's right.

2151
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,600
And porn is very entertaining.

2152
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:53,320
RageNator in chat in response to my word mix up there says, kind of gives new meaning to

2153
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:56,280
finish him.

2154
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:59,440
I will be leaving the chat room for the night.

2155
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:01,480
Goodbye.

2156
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:02,480
Just kidding.

2157
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:09,360
I will be opening up the Skype line, however, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, orangeloungeradio,

2158
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:10,360
all one word.

2159
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:14,520
Give us a call on Skype to talk about anything we've talked about so far on the show tonight

2160
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,200
or porn, if you want, I guess.

2161
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:20,520
Hey, if you got a modern heads, if you got a modern phone in Google Cardboard, you might

2162
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:21,520
as well give it a try.

2163
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:24,040
They have VR trailers you can check out.

2164
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:25,040
There you go.

2165
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,160
So you can get an idea.

2166
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:28,840
For what it is, it's pretty impressive.

2167
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:33,000
Experience it first hand or with both hands, whatever you're into.

2168
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,280
Hey, but we're getting a call.

2169
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:35,280
Let's get to it.

2170
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,280
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

2171
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,280
Who's this?

2172
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:38,280
Uh, hi.

2173
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:39,280
It's YYR.

2174
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:42,720
I feel like I just saw you.

2175
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,720
I'm sorry, what?

2176
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:45,600
I said, I feel like I just saw you.

2177
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:46,600
Oh, yeah.

2178
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,600
You know what?

2179
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:49,440
I can't even believe that it was only a week ago.

2180
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:52,560
It like doesn't make sense to me at all.

2181
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:53,560
You know what?

2182
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:58,200
I can't believe this bullshit that Skype is trying to show me an ad right now.

2183
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:03,020
God, I thought you were going to say you couldn't believe it's not butter.

2184
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:04,320
Well thank you, Bing.

2185
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,600
I know, right?

2186
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,520
Anyway, how do I ad block on Skype?

2187
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:08,560
Alright, anyway.

2188
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:10,560
What's in your mind tonight, my friend?

2189
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:15,200
Well you know, really, one reason I called was just to say I just want to thank you guys

2190
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,480
again for allowing me the opportunity to be on the lovely program.

2191
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:23,680
I want to thank you and curse you simultaneously for introducing me to donut muffins.

2192
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:28,880
Although I guess your wife plays a role in that, so you can shift that to her if you

2193
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:29,880
want.

2194
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:32,880
Oh, they're wonderful, but you know this.

2195
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:40,840
But yeah, if anyone wants to taste this wonder and greatness, it's Devil's Teeth Baking

2196
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:44,760
Company in the outer sunset neighborhood of San Francisco.

2197
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:48,600
Hey, they didn't pay for that ad.

2198
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:52,760
But yeah, and I've been hard at work on multitasking, plane flights are wonderful.

2199
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:57,120
I actually just added a tournament mode to the game yesterday.

2200
02:20:57,160 --> 02:21:03,480
It basically gives any number of players you designate the same sequence, so everybody

2201
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:08,000
can play the same thing and see who's best.

2202
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:14,040
And supposedly, they're going to be running a midnight tournament of this game as long

2203
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,040
as they can get it to work.

2204
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,920
I'm sending them a build, I'm not going to be there.

2205
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:23,000
If anyone is going to be at the Anime Next convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey next

2206
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:28,640
weekend, I have some friends of mine, longtime friends, who are helping to run the game room

2207
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:33,840
there, and well, they asked me if they could run a midnight tournament on it, so hopefully

2208
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:35,600
that will be there Saturday night.

2209
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,720
The cast of Anime Jam Sessions got to be represented there.

2210
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:42,400
I can't imagine they're not there at that con.

2211
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,680
Fantastic.

2212
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:48,240
And there was one other thing I wanted to thank you for, Rob.

2213
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:50,360
Well here's the thing.

2214
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:54,520
I was thinking about it for days before I appeared on the show last week.

2215
02:21:54,520 --> 02:22:00,720
I have been playing a lot of video games over the last 30 plus years.

2216
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:05,440
Lots of different genres, they can't be compared to each other, and I just wanted to thank

2217
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:10,560
you for not asking me that question that you often ask of guests in the studio.

2218
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,880
What's your favorite video game ever made?

2219
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:16,840
Yeah, that one.

2220
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:33,480
Well now that you bring it up, I didn't ask him because usually I do that.

2221
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:38,400
I ask that question for people that are new to the show, but I didn't really consider

2222
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,360
YYR new to the show.

2223
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:48,680
So just amongst all his appearance of appearances over the years, I've just never gotten around

2224
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:50,440
asking YYR that question.

2225
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:53,480
Or I just assume it's DDR, BeatMania, I don't know.

2226
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:54,480
So anyway, there you go.

2227
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:56,240
He hung up and dodged the question.

2228
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:59,800
Wow, I didn't get to figure out what else he was going to say.

2229
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:00,800
Alright, whatever.

2230
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:06,920
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2231
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:10,760
Any last minute stories to report on LOKI or Darksharkar if anybody has a last minute

2232
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:11,760
story?

2233
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,760
No.

2234
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:19,480
I was going to say the Tamps Offs Senran Kagura and Oni Chambara are now on Steam.

2235
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:20,480
Oh really?

2236
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:26,480
So you can pick up Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos and Senran Kagura Shinobi Versus.

2237
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:30,600
I'm going to have to check those out.

2238
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:31,600
I'm going to get right on that.

2239
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,040
Just think of all the nudie mods those are going to get.

2240
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:34,040
Will they import into GOG?

2241
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,040
Lots of nudie mods.

2242
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,040
I guess not.

2243
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,160
Alright.

2244
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,160
Let's move on.

2245
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:39,160
Take another call.

2246
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:40,160
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2247
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:41,160
Who's this?

2248
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:42,160
Hey.

2249
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:43,160
This is Ragingator.

2250
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:44,160
Hey Ragingator.

2251
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,160
What's on your mind?

2252
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:46,160
Two quick questions.

2253
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:52,100
Well, the first one is well, a little long winded but I'll try to keep it short and

2254
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:53,100
free if possible.

2255
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:55,880
Hey Ragingator, do you need any help finding mortgage rates?

2256
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,240
Your local mortgage rates?

2257
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:59,000
Oh god, no.

2258
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,720
Because Skype seems to think we do.

2259
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:01,840
I'm just saying.

2260
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:03,000
What the fuck is this?

2261
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Fuck these ads.

2262
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Alright, anyway.

2263
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Go ahead.

2264
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:17,360
Now, you guys were mentioning that the whole GOG Connect earlier in the show, in fact,

2265
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:22,280
Kazen was telling me about that a couple days ago.

2266
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:28,800
Now Mike, my question for you regarding that is do you know if there's like a set schedule

2267
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:38,360
or like set rate where they'll be introducing new gains for GOG Connect like let's say

2268
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:44,120
for a second conversation, let's say it's going to be two gains per week or something

2269
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,120
like that?

2270
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:49,480
Eh, I don't know if they'll do it on a weekly basis but maybe a monthly basis but realistically

2271
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:53,680
it's as fast as they can get the agreement signed with publishers and if you want that

2272
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:58,280
to happen more often, I think you really have to kind of, you know, and I don't know how

2273
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:02,760
I feel about this whole like social buzz or whatever but the reality is that's the

2274
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:06,920
day and age we live in, I think if there's a lot of very positive buzz around this feature

2275
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:09,600
out there, more people will want to get in on that.

2276
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,440
Oh, that's the thing that people like.

2277
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:14,800
Oh, the internet will say good things about us if we get in on that.

2278
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:18,320
It's going to encourage more publishers to put their older games in on this.

2279
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:20,920
So that's really what it comes down to, Rage Nator.

2280
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:25,360
It's as fast as they can sign the agreements but I think people need to be prepared for

2281
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:30,640
the fact that, you know, this feature might be around for fifty games or so and then it

2282
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:33,240
mysteriously disappears.

2283
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:37,520
Not saying those games are going to disappear from your library but then suddenly people

2284
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,120
get really quiet about it.

2285
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:42,280
You have to be prepared for that end game too.

2286
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:44,800
Yeah, well I hope that's not the case.

2287
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:48,640
Hopefully I'll stick around for a while and they continue to support it but you never

2288
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:49,640
know.

2289
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:52,840
Well, I mean, on the bright side, for what it's worth, I guess not really the bright

2290
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:59,720
side but for what it's worth, it would be no different than what we had last week.

2291
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:01,440
If it were to go away.

2292
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:03,880
We'd just be back to where we were last week, right?

2293
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:04,880
Yeah, true.

2294
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:12,520
Well, now, moving forward, a few more second questions so you can take in more calls.

2295
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:13,520
Yep.

2296
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:22,440
Now, with E3 being next week, is there anything that you're possibly looking forward to or

2297
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:29,400
hoping that would occur, at least, not so much in terms of console space but in terms

2298
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:33,720
of possible announcements with PC gaming?

2299
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:42,200
Now, we're not talking about, you know, the very unlikely, like, FY3 being out so, I mean,

2300
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:43,200
come on.

2301
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:47,160
It's just not going to happen but anything that would be realistic.

2302
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:51,720
Well, RageNator, you couldn't have asked this question in a better year because I have the

2303
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:56,200
easiest answer I've ever been able to give for this question and the answer is everything

2304
02:26:56,200 --> 02:27:00,800
regarding Civilization VI because we know that's a thing that's happening and I fully

2305
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:04,440
expect that we're going to get the details at E3 and I'm all over that.

2306
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:07,600
I'm very, very...and that's not something we're going to see on console, at least I

2307
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:11,600
don't think it would be something...I can't see how they would make it on consoles.

2308
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,560
I guess anything is possible but I'm not expecting that.

2309
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:18,040
I'm expecting that to be a very PC-centric thing.

2310
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:22,280
So yeah, Civilization VI, that's my easy answer but truth.

2311
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:23,280
Oh, cool.

2312
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

2313
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:30,560
In fact, honestly, I really haven't played a whole lot of the older games especially

2314
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:38,480
as of late now because I've got a lot of games to play but, you know, at least C4 and C5

2315
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:39,480
are pretty fun.

2316
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:45,400
Yeah, they're a little bit of a complicated side but still fun nonetheless so...

2317
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:51,080
Alright, well, I'll let you go so you can take more calls but thanks for taking my call.

2318
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:52,080
You got it, buddy.

2319
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:53,080
Have a good one.

2320
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:54,080
Thanks for calling.

2321
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:55,080
See you next time.

2322
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:56,080
Alright, bye-bye.

2323
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,080
Bye.

2324
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:00,760
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word but we have another call already

2325
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:02,240
coming in so let's get to it.

2326
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:03,240
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2327
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,240
Who's this?

2328
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,240
Hey, what's up?

2329
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:06,240
This is Kajudo.

2330
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:07,240
Hey, what's on your mind, Kajudo?

2331
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:08,240
Nothing much.

2332
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:13,280
I just want to ask you, can you honestly say that you think Overwatch has legs?

2333
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:14,560
I mean, think about it.

2334
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,200
It doesn't have any private servers, right?

2335
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:18,200
Right.

2336
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:22,680
Also, you can mod the game because Blizzard won't allow you to mod it.

2337
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:27,560
It's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One but we all know that if your first person shooter

2338
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:32,480
is in Call of Duty, it's gonna die on those systems because that's what happens to every

2339
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:36,240
first person shooter that ends up on those systems and it doesn't have cross-platform

2340
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:40,480
play so I think people are gonna get tired of this game really fast.

2341
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:45,200
I mean, they're gonna probably have to pop up these new characters and new maps on a

2342
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:47,880
week-by-week basis if they want to keep this thing going.

2343
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:53,440
90% of everything you just said also applies to Diablo 3, which is still going strong on

2344
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:54,440
PC.

2345
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:57,040
No, actually not really because Diablo 3 has a single player.

2346
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:01,040
One thing I forgot to mention is this is all online.

2347
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:06,560
They have that tutorial or whatever in Overwatch or whatever it is and you can play bots but

2348
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:08,280
that's still not considered single player to me.

2349
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:10,760
I mean, Diablo you can play pretty much by yourself.

2350
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:12,760
Have you ever been to Blizzcon?

2351
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:15,560
No, I don't go to any of those things.

2352
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:22,160
And see, I kind of think you're underestimating in some ways the power of Blizzard.

2353
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:23,240
And I'm serious.

2354
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:26,980
If you look at some of these people that are playing Overwatch now, it's a lot of the same

2355
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:34,040
people that support World of Warcraft and Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone.

2356
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:36,040
Why can't I even think of the name of that game at the moment?

2357
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:42,760
Anyway, these games have a very, very, very loyal audience and I defer to the fact that

2358
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:47,920
those tickets sell out within seconds and that wow being the fact that in my opinion

2359
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,280
Jamie would disagree but in my opinion World of Warcraft is not the best MMO on the block

2360
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:58,720
anymore yet it is still the most popular and by far Blizzard still has legions and legions

2361
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:03,320
of fans behind it that are going to play a game like Overwatch simply because it's Blizzard

2362
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,180
and Blizzard does what?

2363
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:09,300
They make games extremely accessible.

2364
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:12,540
This is their first person shooter.

2365
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:14,260
You're talking about an MMO.

2366
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:17,540
You're talking about whatever the heck Diablo is.

2367
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:20,180
I don't even know what you can consider that game.

2368
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:26,860
This is a totally different ball game for them and I mean when you think about PC players

2369
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:31,380
I mean the main reason why Team Fortress 2 is still around and Counter-Strike, the reason

2370
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:35,220
why those games are still around is because people have their own servers, they put their

2371
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:38,780
mods on there and that's what keeps those types of games running.

2372
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:42,460
I can't picture a first person shooter running that long without those things especially

2373
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:43,460
on the PC.

2374
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:47,420
I mean they could probably get away with it on like a PS4 or Xbox One because they don't

2375
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:50,940
do that anyway but no way they can get away with that on a PC.

2376
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:51,940
Blizzard.

2377
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:52,940
There's just no way.

2378
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:58,740
Blizzard also has two other games which is Hearthstone a card game and Heroes of the Storm

2379
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:04,700
which is a MOBA game and that is literally all of Blizzard's titles.

2380
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:06,620
So far they're batting at 100.

2381
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:09,220
But those are still different from a first person shooter.

2382
02:31:09,220 --> 02:31:11,180
First person shooter is a totally different ball game.

2383
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:16,080
I understand that but now Blizzard's throwing their wiener into the first person shooter

2384
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:17,700
game and I think it's...

2385
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:19,860
And their wiener is going to get chopped off by December.

2386
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:21,860
I'm going to ask you one more question.

2387
02:31:21,860 --> 02:31:22,860
Have you played Overwatch?

2388
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,140
Yes, I played the beta and I hated it.

2389
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:27,240
What did you hate about it?

2390
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:30,240
I hated the fact that there wasn't many maps.

2391
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:31,240
There wasn't much you can do.

2392
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:34,280
There weren't that many game modes.

2393
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:37,680
Also another thing that I hated was I love to play like the stealth class and I know

2394
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:40,960
they had that ninja guy but he seemed like a waste to me.

2395
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:44,880
I mean he basically did pretty much everything that all the other characters did.

2396
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,160
His weapon, his ninja stars pretty much sucked.

2397
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:48,400
I mean you couldn't do much with them.

2398
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:52,360
I mean the only character that I had fun with was the other girl that can like create ice

2399
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,360
walls.

2400
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:54,360
I was having fun with that.

2401
02:31:54,360 --> 02:32:03,040
I mean I lost interest really quickly and I have a couple of friends who also played

2402
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:06,760
it and they lost interest and they were like well I might pick it up on the PC just because

2403
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:08,760
it's 40 bucks on the PC.

2404
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:12,440
But they were like no I'm not getting this on the PS4 because they know the community

2405
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:16,480
is going to pretty much die out on the PS4 even though it says again it there.

2406
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:19,960
So if you really want to play it your best bet is the PC and I don't know how long it's

2407
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:20,960
going to last there.

2408
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:23,360
I'm going to leave you with two more thoughts.

2409
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:25,760
One at least you played it and I'll give you credit for that.

2410
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:30,320
I mean even though yes it was a beta I'll admit not a lot changed from beta to release

2411
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:33,360
so I'll give you at least credit that you at least tried it when you're making these

2412
02:32:33,360 --> 02:32:34,360
statements.

2413
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:37,440
And you know sometimes things are not going to be for everybody and that's just the way

2414
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:38,600
it's going to be.

2415
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:43,160
But B one thing I think that Overwatch will have going for it and we'll see in a year

2416
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:46,800
you know I mean who knows maybe it won't be still a thing in a year.

2417
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:51,980
But I think one thing that Blizzard is going to show from their track record is that will

2418
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:57,060
there be an expansion at some point to Overwatch probably but that'll be a good three to four

2419
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:02,220
years down the line and in the meantime the game is going to be supported.

2420
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:05,380
And again I'm just going off track record I've got nothing else but you know what's

2421
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:09,860
happened with Diablo what's happened with Warcraft and all their other games is that

2422
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:14,260
Blizzard is is pretty darn good about doing regular patches and content updates.

2423
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:18,220
That is not something that happens in a lot of the console first person shooters today

2424
02:33:18,220 --> 02:33:21,660
because things like the call of duties and the battlefronts they get a refresh every

2425
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:25,700
year even destiny had an expansion that you had to buy after a year.

2426
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:28,900
I don't see that happening with Overwatch.

2427
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:33,420
I could end up being wrong they might do an expansion in a year but again if track record

2428
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:38,820
is anything go off of I think Blizzard is going to support the base game a lot.

2429
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:43,220
They're going to take that more Nintendo approach Mario Kart 8 style where they're still supporting

2430
02:33:43,220 --> 02:33:46,620
it three years down the line but we'll see.

2431
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:53,740
One other thing I just want to point out about Overwatch is you were mentioning about them

2432
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:57,660
keeping up with updates and all that type of stuff they're going to have to ease up

2433
02:33:57,660 --> 02:34:00,260
with their with their ban hammer.

2434
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:03,100
So far they've been ban hammering people for the right reasons I mean they have people

2435
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:08,580
cheating you don't want to cheat online you know like I never condone that but Blizzard

2436
02:34:08,580 --> 02:34:12,640
is really known for just like I don't know we're banning somebody who did they weren't

2437
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:16,140
cheating or they might have did something that I don't know appeared to be cheating

2438
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:21,420
and they're really quick to ban somebody so if they want this game to stay alive chill

2439
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:25,340
out with the ban hammer and make sure that you know someone's cheating before you ban

2440
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:26,340
them.

2441
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:27,340
Yeah.

2442
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:31,020
All right well thank you for your input I appreciate it.

2443
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:34,420
Have a good day Judo.

2444
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:35,980
See ya.

2445
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:40,300
Okay so there you go the show where every gamer has a voice you know what I know some

2446
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:46,900
of you guys in chat or you know but not every game is for everybody and some people aren't

2447
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:50,340
going to necessarily like a particular game I know there's been very popular video games

2448
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:55,100
that I don't always necessarily like in fact I wasn't sure I was going to like Overwatch

2449
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:59,380
you guys might remember and I've been critical of some elements of Overwatch that there's

2450
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:04,820
no single player mode in this other stuff and I'm still I'm still kinda wishing it was

2451
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:10,700
there but so far in my experiences with Overwatch I've had a lot of fun and I suppose at the

2452
02:35:10,700 --> 02:35:14,880
end of the day that is what it's all about but I get it is a valid concern will I still

2453
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:20,660
be having fun in December but I'm just really hoping with Blizzard's track record I do so

2454
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:26,340
anyway 1-877-GAMO-LR username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word if you want to give

2455
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:27,580
us a call.

2456
02:35:27,580 --> 02:35:31,780
Tigerclaw in chat says you know Blizzard fans are pretty hardcore and the Warcraft movie

2457
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:36,100
comes out in five days if the fans don't end up liking that movie you know Blizzard

2458
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:41,620
is going to face a lot of heat because Blizzard was involved in the making of that movie.

2459
02:35:41,620 --> 02:35:46,340
Yeah I bet the gals from Girls Gone Wow I saw them posting on Facebook that they were

2460
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:50,220
going to go see it so I'm almost positive if they taped a new show today which they

2461
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:53,440
probably did I'm pretty sure we'll hear about that because remember in the UK the movie's

2462
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:58,220
already out so I'm sure we'll hear about that come Wednesday when their show airs here on

2463
02:35:58,220 --> 02:36:03,180
the voice of geeks network but bummer because the time difference but I would love to pick

2464
02:36:03,180 --> 02:36:06,660
their brain a little bit about this whole Overwatch thing I'm curious if they have jumped

2465
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:12,380
in and tried it at length or what have you because that would be a great example of you

2466
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:16,340
know players that don't necessarily play a lot of other games are they coming over to

2467
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:19,220
this simply because Blizzard's name is on it.

2468
02:36:19,220 --> 02:36:25,100
Alright one last call for calls 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype orange lounge radio

2469
02:36:25,100 --> 02:36:30,520
all one word checking in one more time for last minute stories if you have any no running

2470
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:37,660
out alright just a quick teaser for next week while we give it just a few more seconds here

2471
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:42,500
to see if any other calls come in I do want to mention again next week's show for you

2472
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:47,700
podcast folk it'll be a little bit shorter that's because live we're going to be experiencing

2473
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:54,500
the Blizzard the Bethesda press conference live essentially so we'll be taking an extended

2474
02:36:54,500 --> 02:37:00,260
break next week while we all listen in on the Bethesda press conference and then we'll

2475
02:37:00,260 --> 02:37:04,420
come back and give our immediate reactions to what's going on and so forth we'll also

2476
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:10,780
be talking about EA and we're going to have plenty of other predictions as well and then

2477
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:17,660
after E3 is all said and done the weekend after what we have June 18th and 19th so what

2478
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:22,600
the 19th I think is that show we're going to be joined in studio here by Misty long

2479
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:29,000
time OLR fan going to be here on June 19th that's her second or third trip on the show

2480
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:35,520
so she'll be here on that day joining us for some E3 reactions and follow-ups and then

2481
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:39,200
we're going to go I mean this is a big month because we roll right from June 19th into

2482
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:48,280
the next show June 26th with it which is a double event it is my birthday my actual birthday

2483
02:37:48,280 --> 02:37:56,760

2484
02:37:56,760 --> 02:38:02,840

deft and chat over at live dot vog network comm says can't wait for 2017 and the OLR quesadilla

2489

2490
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:39,320

2491
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:46,720
until I moved to California I can't wait yeah we're gonna see I I think if we can get to 15

2492
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:51,240
years which I don't see why we wouldn't at this point but you know you never know but if we can

2493
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:58,540
get to 15 years I think it's just high time we just put the money in rent a space so rent a

2494
02:38:58,540 --> 02:39:04,680
ballroom at a motel somewhere around here and just say if you want to be there live just be here we

2495
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:10,040
move our show for the night to a live space and just invite any fucking person that wants to cut

2496
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:14,640
well within reason we don't want like you know trolls showing up but you know maybe they have

2497
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:19,480
to maybe have to answer a few simple questions about OLR to get through the door but we'll invite

2498
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:25,160
whoever to show up and we're just gonna have a big fucking party for our quesadilla it'll it'll

should why is Bobby welcome say they don't want me showing up of course we want you sure I think

2503
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:54,440

2504
02:39:54,440 --> 02:40:02,520
I'll be a lot of fun so yep anyway that's a year off we still have a 14 year look forward to which

2505
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:10,200
is just really crazy I can't think of any other podcasts or internet shows that celebrate 14

2506
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:14,320

2520

2527
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:09,600
game so it's mentally being worked on it's not physically being worked on I see there's a big

2528
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:14,520
difference Loki and last but not least dark soccer your final thought tonight damn it why
