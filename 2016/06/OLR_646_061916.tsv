0	3000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
7000	13000	Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
14000	25000	Tonight, another E3 is behind us, and from Scorpio to God of War, and Breath of the Wild to Mobile Pokemon, there's a lot to discuss this week on the show where every gamer has a voice.
25000	30000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
31000	41000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange, Lounge, Radio, live tonight with episode number 646.
42000	49000	It's the same forwards and backwards for this June the 19th, 2016. This is the show after E3.
49000	56000	We're going to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, probably a lot of the stuff that happened this week, because it's kind of a big week for games.
57000	68000	My name is Rob Roberts, based out of lovely Studio N7 here in Sacramento, California. You can follow me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me, as always, my amazing co-hosts.
69000	74000	Say hello over there to this lovely lady who I went on a hot date with the other night. It's DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
74000	75000	Hey.
75000	78000	Hey, hot date, because it's hot in Sacramento. It's always hot here.
78000	79000	It is.
79000	90000	So DarkSakura and I went and saw the Warcraft movie, which is actually kind of noteworthy because I never go to movies anymore, but Jamie was like, Rob, movie. Rob, movie.
90000	93000	He was like, no one wants to see Warcraft with me. Rob was like, I'll go.
94000	99000	Yeah, I'll go because Alan usually works weeknights, so we went.
99000	100000	We had a fun time.
100000	107000	Yeah, I got to say, you know, because we're going to get into a lot of E3 news tonight, and I know Warcraft is so last week, now that Finding Dory's out.
108000	113000	But I actually, like, the movie was better than I thought it would be, honestly.
114000	117000	It was really good if you know the lore.
118000	123000	Yeah, if you're a gamer. I would say even if you're at least a gamer and can kind of understand video game logic a little bit.
124000	127000	Here's your quest. Go to Dalaran. Here's your quest. Go back to here.
127000	133000	They definitely made a movie for Warcraft fans, which is why it's tanking in the US.
134000	138000	They changed some very important things in the first war.
139000	142000	I'm okay with the little changes. Things are going to happen for the movie's sake.
143000	148000	Well, plus, like, Garona in the movie was half orc, half human, and she's not that in the game.
149000	153000	But when the first game came out, she thought she was half orc, half human.
153000	156000	Spoiler alert. Well, the games are how old at this point.
157000	159000	Well, yeah, and it turns out she's half draenei instead.
160000	161000	And we'll join the movie!
162000	163000	Yeah, for like two seconds.
164000	165000	Well, yeah, and then they... I'm sorry.
168000	169000	They were in the movie.
170000	171000	They'll be in the sequel, you know it.
172000	177000	I was just surprised there were no night elves. I mean, they were kind of there.
178000	179000	They had high elves.
180000	181000	They had high elves.
181000	184000	But Alan was like, well, they didn't go to the other continent.
185000	189000	But there were some fan service-y things I was hoping to see that I didn't see.
190000	192000	But honestly, I'm nitpicking. Overall, I had a good time.
193000	194000	It was a fun popcorn flick.
195000	197000	What, a game that takes a couple weeks to play?
198000	199000	Yeah.
199000	200000	Into a couple hours.
201000	206000	If you're interested in Warcraft, I really think the movie is worth seeing. It really wasn't bad.
206000	214000	And even though, yes, I know I said it's tanking in the US, apparently it's doing phenomenal overseas, especially China, which is very interesting.
215000	219000	Because, you know, there's a lot of people in China, so if they're making a movie that's doing well over there,
220000	228000	perhaps we could see a sequel that is more Chinese-funded and possibly even directed, made, who knows? We'll see.
229000	235000	But I know the maker of the movie, Duncan Jones, said he wanted to do the Lich King story, which I would be all about that.
236000	242000	I would totally be down for that. That would be tremendous. Especially if we get crazy-ass Sylvanas.
243000	244000	That would make me extra happy.
245000	252000	That would be great. So, anyway, there you go. There's our hyper-review of Warcraft from our hot date on Thursday night.
253000	258000	Also say hello over there. Sadly, turn down our hot date, but that's okay. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
259000	260000	I don't believe I was ever asked to go on the hot date.
261000	262000	You weren't!
263000	265000	You wouldn't have gone. I think we just knew you wouldn't go.
266000	271000	It's a weeknight, and you have the parental duties and all that, and B, it's Warcraft. You don't care about Warcraft.
272000	274000	See? See, I know Loki. I know Loki.
275000	276000	How are you otherwise, though? How was your week?
277000	278000	Eh, it was alright.
279000	283000	Happy Father's Day to you and, of course, all our daddy gamers that are out there listening,
284000	290000	including father figures, fathers of pets, mothers who also have to be fathers, all that stuff. Hope everybody's having a good day.
291000	292000	Are you having a good Father's Day?
293000	294000	Man, it's alright.
294000	295000	Yeah, it's okay. Does it suck?
296000	298000	Nah, I wouldn't go that far.
300000	306000	Start off with being woken up by a child who wanted to immediately sip, you know, where I was laying. I was like, ugh.
307000	310000	I'm like, get up, daddy! Get up! I'm like, no!
311000	315000	And then it's like, ah, the fridge is leaking. And I'm like, ugh.
316000	317000	And then...
318000	319000	Isn't this the one day a year when you're supposed to be allowed to sleep in?
319000	320000	It's like, I wanna go get shoes.
321000	327000	And then we had to go to the Palladio and I had to watch the kids while she picked out two pairs of shoes and some boutique.
328000	329000	Did you get shoes?
330000	331000	No, I didn't get fucking shoes.
332000	333000	That's not fair.
334000	337000	I didn't get shit. And then, I mean, I guess we went to Red Robin and she paid for lunch.
338000	344000	But technically my burger is free because I am one of those Red Robin royalty members so my burger was comped because I just happened to be on the tenth burger.
345000	348000	Okay, but Red Robin is like on the Loki list of fine dining restaurants.
349000	352000	It happened to be convenient nearby and it had something the kids would...
353000	357000	Like, she was like saying, well, if I was to pick a restaurant, I'd probably go to Land Ocean.
358000	363000	I'm like, can you imagine our kids at fucking Land Ocean, which is like, it's a seafood, surf and turf, like, restaurant thing.
364000	366000	It's like, you know, much higher end, way more...
367000	368000	Take them to Flame and Fire.
369000	372000	I'm like, no, that's not gonna fucking happen. We'll just go to Red Robin because they can get fucking grilled cheese there and that's it.
373000	374000	That's why I picked that restaurant, it's for the kids.
375000	376000	Alright.
376000	379000	And then I went to Random Restaurant for dinner, which, eh, I don't know.
380000	384000	They didn't speak English. Half of my dinner is, I don't know, some garbage.
385000	387000	And then the other half is actual edible, so...
388000	391000	I tried to warn you that, well, I warned you after you already went there.
392000	393000	That was in hindsight.
394000	396000	Yeah, I didn't have the greatest experience when I went there either, but anyway.
397000	399000	Well, I hope they're doing something nice for you for when you get home.
400000	402000	But anyhow, let's say hello as well.
402000	407000	We have a special guest in the studio joining us tonight, coming from a long way away to be on our show this week.
408000	409000	Say hello, everybody, to Misty.
410000	411000	Hello.
412000	414000	Hi, Misty. Long time OLR listener and fan.
415000	418000	I feel weird calling you a fan because, you know, we know each other well enough now, we're just friends.
419000	421000	But, you know, that's, I guess, how we got to know each other as you were listening to the show.
422000	423000	How long have you been listening to OLR?
424000	425000	2004.
426000	427000	Is your mic on, hun?
428000	429000	Make sure the switch is on over there on that mic.
429000	435000	Because for some reason we're not picking you up, but maybe we just don't have the, try again there.
436000	437000	How long have you been listening to OLR?
438000	440000	Technical difficulties, everybody.
441000	443000	She doesn't do the radio stuff very often.
444000	445000	So, actually, there is no switch on this mic.
446000	447000	Did the damn thing just cut out?
448000	450000	All right, well, that's what happens with live radio, is it?
451000	452000	Sometimes you have to switch things on the fly.
453000	454000	I have a backup mic.
454000	458000	I might. Thankfully, when the video game bang guys were here, we had to hook up like six mics.
459000	462000	So, we're good now. Try that one, Misty. How long have you been listening to OLR?
463000	464000	April 2004.
465000	468000	What the hell? That one's not picking her. Oh, because that one is still muted.
469000	471000	Okay, try one more time, please.
472000	473000	April 2004.
474000	475000	Thank God, there she is. There you go.
476000	478000	And still listening today, and here she is live.
479000	481000	You're a big music game fan, right?
482000	483000	Of course.
484000	488000	As part of your adventure out here to the West Coast, you went to round one in San Jose yesterday, right?
489000	490000	That's right. How'd that go?
491000	495000	Not bad. I mainly stuck to the Supernova 2 machine, but I did play some Crossbeats.
496000	499000	I sucked as much as usual at 2DX.
500000	503000	Gotcha. So, you got to play a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
504000	509000	Did you see all those zillions of crane machines that they had?
510000	513000	I know you're a big fan of Pikachu. Did they have Pikachu in some of the crane games?
514000	519000	Not that I recall seeing. I remember seeing Mario and Luigi, the little ones in one of them.
520000	522000	Oh God, those things are cute. I did see those.
523000	530000	Awesome. Well, I'm glad you could be here tonight, especially the week before our big 14th birthday, if you can believe it.
531000	532000	Would you buy us for our birthday?
534000	535000	I'm just kidding. I'm just putting it on the spot.
536000	537000	I was going to mention, there was one more thing I just remembered.
538000	539000	Yeah.
539000	544000	My dad had called me for Father's Day. He wanted to plan something, so we're not actually doing Father's Day this weekend.
545000	551000	We're doing Father's Day July 2nd, but he's like, it's a surprise. I'm not going to tell you what it is until later.
552000	560000	And then a couple days later, he told me, he's like, okay, so we're going to go to this place and race exotic sports cars.
561000	570000	So that's pretty awesome. So we're going to be taking, I would give a choice of like a Lamborghini or like, I remember the other, like some other kind of car.
571000	572000	I just saw Lamborghini. I was like, okay, cool.
573000	574000	That'll be fun.
575000	576000	And racing it around track.
577000	582000	You know, actually that made me think of the show yesterday, Misty and I were on a trip and as we were coming home, I was trying to point out to her, I was like, oh, look, look, look over there on the side of the road.
583000	586000	That's the indoor skiving place. That's the place I was talking about on OLR.
587000	589000	Misty was like, what place? I don't think I heard that episode.
590000	591000	You're just not caught up on the backlog yet.
592000	594000	Well to be fair, it was last week's show. You were mentioning it, right?
595000	596000	Oh, was it last week's show? Maybe. I don't know.
597000	602000	Keep in mind, approximately the time the show was starting, that's when I was heading out to St. Louis on the train.
603000	606000	Gotcha. Nowhere. I'm just giving you crap. It's quite all right.
607000	613000	Whenever I hear from people that are like, hey, glad to hear you're doing well. You know, I haven't listened to the show in a long time.
614000	618000	I'm like, it's okay. I don't like take it personally. It's a big commitment to be here for a few hours.
618000	620000	But we appreciate the commitment of those of you that are here for the show.
621000	628000	Those of you, especially live in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.
629000	633000	vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
634000	636000	Some people making fun of the microphone issues that we were having a moment ago.
637000	641000	Stoppy in chat saying, this is false advertising. I thought every gamer has a voice here.
642000	645000	Look, sometimes it just takes a minute to get it all wired up.
645000	648000	Every gamer does have a voice. Just some of those voices can't be picked up by the microphone.
649000	656000	Exactly. That's exactly right. Some of them are broken due to technical difficulties. Would you expect anything less here on OLR?
657000	663000	And I also admit I'm not, I'm the only one that does not have a laptop in this room. How many people are all OMG-ed when she's here?
664000	666000	Wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't have a laptop either. I have a desktop.
667000	668000	Well, you have a computer screen, period.
668000	677000	I'm not, I got to admit, I'm not seeing a lot of stuff. I did, I do see SSG100Matt saying, confirmed, Misty carries an EMP device that kills mics on the fly.
678000	680000	So you're just being accused of causing the problems in chat.
681000	683000	I ride trains. I can't afford that stuff.
684000	688000	Plus you, you were here on the 10th anniversary episode. Is that the last time? That was the last time you were here, right?
689000	694000	Yes. 10th anniversary episode. This was a while ago. I don't, don't you like Studio N7? Isn't this a nice upgrade from where we were at before?
695000	697000	It is. Yes. It's very lovely.
698000	707000	Let's see. Also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt mentioning Loki's Father's Day should be like the God of War trailer, except they're hunting bacon.
708000	711000	I might want to hunt something. Just go to the store and buy it.
712000	721000	His mouth is full of meat, which is like a radio sin as he's trying to talk, defending the bacon thing.
721000	737000	All right. Anyway, uh, Misty, did you, did you get, I know you were on your way out here, but did you have time to get caught up in all the E3 hype or, or do you, I kind of get the sense you don't necessarily have to play the latest and greatest video games to be the gaming enthusiast you are.
738000	743000	You kind of have your own, like either, you know, games that are a couple of years old, like Pokemons or whatever that you're into.
744000	747000	I saw you yesterday while we were coming back. You were, you were rocking the Pokemon yellow.
748000	750000	And I was like, all right, this is old school. I liked it. I like it.
751000	756000	Well, I do have the, the Pikachu 3DS with the Pikachu theme. So I was like, complete the trifecta and get yellow.
757000	770000	You need a Pikachu invention is what you need over there, an intervention. That's okay. So what kind of games do you usually play like these days? Do you, do you tend to, do you play any of the latest and greatest stuff or do you more like to play the classics?
771000	772000	More classic stuff.
772000	784000	Yeah. Yeah. As, as an example, some of the time while I was on the train, I've got my uncle ditched a Vista era laptop on me, so I've got the step mania 3.9 running on it.
785000	792000	There you go. Now I know you love your music games because not only did you have to go all the way to round one, but here you are rocking step mania on the train. What is your favorite music game of all time?
793000	799000	I would say, I would say DDR if I had to pick a specific mix fifth because that was my new mix.
799000	808000	Okay. All right. You know what? Hey, this show would not exist if it wasn't for DDR cause that's how Dark Soccer Loki and I all met as I'm sure many of you know. So I'm very thankful to that.
809000	817000	What's your favorite DDR song ever? You can only pick one. If you say two, I will turn off that mic permanently.
820000	823000	I can't, I can't really choose. I am a labor after all.
825000	827000	Fine. Try. What's the first one that comes to your head?
830000	832000	I'm putting her on the spot people.
833000	834000	Let them move.
835000	838000	Yeah. Silence means let them move. Love this feeling.
841000	844000	If I have to say something, I would say, probably say before you.
845000	857000	Okay. That's a very good choice. Oh, that's a good, that's a classic. That's good. I kind of thought, I kind of thought you were going to say, you're not here because I always see you play in the Makiri Al Moka stuff on the supernova, but that's all right.
857000	865000	That's all right. Good pick. B4U is a classic. I think Dark Soccer, one of her favorites ever is Brilliant 2U Orchestra.
866000	871000	Yeah. So, and they're not too dissimilar, those songs. So a lot of rooted in the same stuff. So awesome.
872000	880000	All right. Well, Misty, I know you're going to sit in tonight's show. And, uh, even though I know you're more of a classic gamer, I'm sure you're keeping up and up on what's going on with the current stuff as we get into E3.
881000	886000	So feel free to, uh, lend your voice to the conversation. I promise chatters, I'm not going to cut her off tonight.
887000	892000	Yeah. And you guys in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com where Bobby Black Wolf is yelling, just say butterfly.
893000	895000	Oh, hell no.
896000	907000	She's like, please, I have taste. All right. Anyway, uh, let's, and Stoppy says, I like that one DDR song that's all electronic and it plays really fast and it has a techno beat to it.
907000	916000	Oh yeah. Candy. Clearly is that that's the one he's talking about. Right. All right. Let's get into E3 this week. So there was a lot of news that came out of E3.
917000	925000	Let's start kind of at the top of the show this week, talking a little bit about probably what were the big two that we were looking forward to going into the week, Sony and Microsoft.
926000	928000	Yes. I'm leaving Nintendo out in a moment. We'll get to them later.
929000	930000	What about Ubisoft?
930000	938000	Well, I figure a lot of those games kind of show up at Sony or Nintendo, or we'll get to them in the show later as well. We have a lot of those coming up.
939000	947000	We need to talk about how terrible the show was. Like seriously, it's like, they thought it was a good idea to do some stupid Just Dance number with giraffes and fucking, I don't know what it was.
948000	958000	And then, oh, by the way, a moment of silence for those people that died in Orlando. It's like, it was just such a weird juxtaposition. I mean, it's just like, before the dance number?
958000	960000	It was one of the more awkward tributes.
961000	963000	It's like out of all of them. It's like, oh, hey, by the way.
964000	970000	You know what though? You know what though? And I said my piece on that whole thing last week, so I'm going to try to not go back to a bad place with that.
971000	985000	But I was very moved with how much of an outpouring of support there was at E3 for, you know, what happened at Pulse Nightclub and, you know, the pain that the LGBT is feeling as a result of that and so forth.
985000	997000	It was kind of surreal to see things like Miyamoto wearing a rainbow ribbon and to hear Sony on stage at their press conference acknowledge our thoughts are with the LGBT community.
998000	1005000	It just kind of, I don't know, I just felt very like, wow, that was really great to just have that acknowledged. It really does mean a lot.
1006000	1012000	Ubisoft kind of had the tackiest one of the bunch, but I'm happy they acknowledged it at all, for what it's worth.
1012000	1013000	Sure.
1014000	1017000	So, anyway, so is that all you want to razz Ubisoft on was just dancing?
1018000	1021000	No, I've got lots more, but we'll go move on to the other ones.
1022000	1031000	Alright, can we talk about then kind of the big gaming console conferences? Again, I'll get to Nintendo later, but they didn't have a conference. They did a different thing.
1032000	1034000	So let's talk, and they kind of talked about one thing and a few other things.
1035000	1039000	So let's talk about Microsoft, I guess, was up first. And so Microsoft, what? They had a variety.
1039000	1046000	They came out and announced, hey, there's a new console coming out that you totally didn't know about because all the information leaked out, like, way before that.
1047000	1059000	But it's the Xbox One S. It is 40% slimmer. It's got up to a two terabyte hard drive, and it's available in August for $299. I think we're at least starting at $299.
1060000	1066000	And go buy it now until we give you a few more reasons not to buy it because that's coming up later in the show.
1066000	1073000	Yeah, it's called the Xbox One S because if you only give one shit about gaming, this is the console you're going to get.
1074000	1080000	But if you give two shits about gaming, boy, hold on to your butts because in 2017 we've got Project Scorpio on the way.
1081000	1086000	That was, I got to admit, that was a little weird to me. Like, I'm not trying to, like, there was a lot of stuff I liked about Microsoft conference.
1087000	1093000	That was weird to me that they're going to try to sell this Xbox One when they're saying an even better console is on the way.
1093000	1103000	But here's the thing, though. It's like, okay, let's pretend here. The games that they showed right now, which are running on that hardware, I'm assuming, look fine.
1104000	1110000	Why do I need to upgrade the hardware? They didn't give me a reason for it. They didn't say anything other than it's going to be more powerful.
1111000	1116000	Okay? What are you going to do with it? Are you going to be able to do 4K on everything? We're going to try.
1117000	1119000	Yeah, it's like, because...
1120000	1122000	But Loki, teraflops.
1123000	1124000	Yeah.
1125000	1129000	I just like saying that word. Dark Soccer, don't you like saying that word? Teraflops.
1130000	1131000	Not as much as I like Nagahide.
1132000	1135000	It's like a cross between terrible and a flop, so...
1136000	1141000	But Jamie, the Xbox Scorpio is going to have six teraflops of power.
1141000	1147000	It doesn't mean anything. That literally means fucking nothing. I mean, you can throw specs out all you want.
1148000	1155000	But here's the thing. Even when they're talking about cards, I want to say that they're similar to GTX 980 or something like that.
1156000	1164000	And those can't even run 4K at 60 frames per second for a lot of things. What makes them think that this is going to be able to do that?
1165000	1167000	Do you know what a flop is?
1168000	1171000	Yes, a teraflop is memory bandwidth.
1172000	1174000	A flop is a floating point operation.
1175000	1178000	Right. I know what a flop is, Dark Soccer. I host one every Sunday night.
1179000	1180000	No, that's a train wreck.
1182000	1183000	That's insulting to real train wrecks.
1185000	1186000	Witness a train wreck.
1188000	1189000	Let's see.
1190000	1194000	What about the whole... Okay, teraflops aside and the whole new console.
1195000	1202000	Again, as much as we're having a laugh here, I do enjoy my Xbox One. There were some games I'm really jazzed about.
1203000	1204000	Forza Horizon 3. Thank you very much.
1205000	1206000	Yeah, Forza Horizon 3 looks nice.
1207000	1212000	Love it. Love that series. What about the whole emphasis on the Windows 10, Windows Play Anywhere stuff?
1213000	1214000	They're really trying to get you to buy a Windows 10 PC.
1215000	1220000	Well, didn't Microsoft kind of already shove one down your throat if you have a Windows 7 or 8 PC?
1221000	1224000	Well, I have a Windows 10 laptop, but I can't run any of that shit.
1225000	1226000	If you don't upgrade, I'm going to kill you.
1227000	1228000	I can't run any of those.
1229000	1235000	I mean, that's cool, I guess, that you'll be able to play cross-platform with those games.
1236000	1242000	And they'll be available on both PC and their Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive.
1242000	1246000	That was so fucking annoying, the entire thing. It's like, who gives a shit?
1247000	1252000	It's Windows 10 exclusive for a little bit, by the way. It's not a permanent exclusive.
1253000	1256000	It's exclusive for a little bit of time, and then it's going to go on the Steam.
1257000	1266000	So, I don't know, it means really nothing to me, but it's nice, I guess, at least when you buy it on one, you get it on the other.
1267000	1274000	All right, let me mention some other kind of cool things, just because I don't want to get branded a hater, just because I'm picking on a few things here.
1275000	1276000	But there are some other awesome things.
1277000	1284000	Dead Rising 4. Hello. Frank West is back. I feel a lot better about what I'm seeing with Dead Rising 4 than I did with 3.
1285000	1286000	That's true, yes.
1287000	1293000	So, I mean, it kind of feels like maybe the fact that they're putting Frank West in it is a little bit of the whole, let's go back to our roots type of thing, what made this series really fun.
1293000	1297000	So, that's encouraging, I think. So, I'm excited for Dead Rising 4.
1298000	1299000	Yeah, it looks good.
1300000	1314000	Let's see, also, hey, they mentioned Tekken 7. I didn't catch if it was some type of Microsoft exclusive or anything, but they did shine a light on Tekken 7 as part of their conference that it will be out on Xbox One in early 2017.
1315000	1319000	Dark Sakura, I know you like your Tekken. Is it enough to get you to get an Xbox One?
1320000	1321000	No.
1321000	1323000	I think it'll be on PlayStation 4 as well.
1324000	1332000	It probably will at some point, but, so I was just curious why they mentioned it at Microsoft's conference unless they have some type of...
1333000	1335000	I don't remember what it was, if they had anything for them.
1336000	1339000	Let's see, also Halo Wars...
1340000	1343000	Oh no, they were giving out Tekken Tag 2 for free.
1344000	1345000	Ah, that was the backwards compatibility thing.
1346000	1347000	Yeah.
1347000	1351000	Let's see, Halo Wars 2 was kind of their other big thing, and they mentioned that's coming February 21st.
1352000	1355000	Not my type of game. I used to like RTS games, but I'm just not that excited about it.
1356000	1357000	I never really played the first one.
1358000	1364000	I know people that were really into the first game, so I'm very happy for them, but yeah, for myself, it was not really a title for me to get excited about.
1365000	1369000	Like Loki, I was hoping for some more glimpses of Crackdown, which didn't seem materialized.
1370000	1372000	Yeah, no glimpses of Crackdown, but hey, that's because they're working on it, so whatever.
1372000	1377000	It's probably not going to be out this year, unfortunately, so 2017, yay.
1378000	1388000	Interesting thought from Oculus Man in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, who said they mentioned it, meaning Tekken, at their conference because they couldn't mention Street Fighter.
1389000	1395000	Interesting theory. Get people hyped about a different fighting game. Very interesting theory like that.
1396000	1398000	Well, they have, you know, killer instinct, so...
1399000	1400000	That is true, Season 3 and all that.
1401000	1402000	Alright, so that was...
1403000	1411000	Which they announced was, I mean, they showed Gears of War 4, and then they mentioned that, oh hey, there's going to be a character from Gears of War that's going to be in Killer Instinct.
1412000	1413000	You know, alien thing.
1414000	1418000	Which they've kind of done for some other, like, cross-promotion stuff. They've put a character in, so that's neat.
1419000	1422000	Yeah, I like Killer Instinct. It's a fun fighting game, so we'll see.
1423000	1429000	Let's move on and talk a little bit about Sony and Sony's press conference. What did you think of Sony overall?
1430000	1431000	Loki?
1432000	1440000	It was alright, but even last year, there were a lot of trailers for things that I don't know when they're going to come out, and I don't think a lot of those are going to come out this year.
1441000	1442000	And that's the thing.
1443000	1444000	I think hardly any of them are coming out this year.
1445000	1449000	At least we know that The Last Guardian has a date now, because everyone's getting kind of pissed off about that at this point, because it's been several years.
1450000	1453000	But there's a lot of things that they're showing that, who knows when those are coming out?
1453000	1470000	Well, not to play the I Told You So card, but I'm going to wallow in this for a minute, is that I did mention on last week's show, Sony has kept making promises, and I fully expect they need to, or else they're going to get accused of that again, is that they only ever show stuff and they never effing deliver.
1471000	1477000	So I said, if they don't date one of these games that they've been teasing us with for a while for this holiday, like, Sony has to put something out this holiday.
1478000	1481000	And I said it would be The Last Guardian, and sure enough, ta-da!
1481000	1483000	So, but, I mean, you know.
1484000	1488000	I mean, the games look good, like Horizon Zero Dawn looks nice, God of War looks great.
1489000	1494000	Which also, to be fair, Horizon Zero Dawn, at least, they also dated for early next year.
1495000	1496000	Yeah, it is, what, February?
1497000	1503000	Yeah, it'll be out by the time the next E3 rolls around, so that was kind of a bonus, in my opinion.
1504000	1509000	And then they had some zombie game, which was at the, I'm trying to remember what it was called now.
1509000	1510000	The Days Gone?
1511000	1512000	Days Gone, yeah, that looked alright.
1513000	1521000	Okay, now, here's the thing that I have to be a little bit critical of Sony about, because as much as I did really like their conference, and they are getting really good at E3.
1522000	1531000	Like, I would say they've been good at E3 for the past, ever since they punched Microsoft in the face live on stage, they've been delivering very, very, very solid E3s.
1532000	1542000	But the one thing I do have to razz them for a little bit that I don't understand, why did they show the Days Gone thing early in the show, and then they closed with the gameplay?
1543000	1546000	That felt really anti-climatic, and it felt like a substitute.
1547000	1555000	And I know there's a lot of talk about, well, Rob, you can't sub things at the last minute because these things take weeks of planning and dah, dah, dah, dah.
1556000	1560000	And I'm like, any party planner always has a plan B for when something goes wrong.
1561000	1562000	I feel like that was plan B.
1563000	1569000	You know what could have been a nice tail end to that? A good old-fashioned announcement from Rockstar Games.
1570000	1577000	Of Red Dead Redemption 2, which everyone was expecting, and that does seem like the perfect thing that could have capped off Sony's conference.
1578000	1587000	Yet, not only was it not at Sony's conference, it was not at E3 at all, which is kind of one of the surprising misfires in the prediction world.
1587000	1594000	Yeah, and then they showed off Call of Duty Infinite Warfare, which, here's the thing that's kind of funny about it.
1595000	1599000	Like, watching the gameplay footage, I didn't know what game it was until the very end. I'm like, that was Call of Duty?
1600000	1605000	I mean, because it just didn't, it's so out there now, it's just hardly recognizable.
1606000	1614000	Yeah, well, and Bobby was getting into this a little bit on his show because he mentioned that he was really into it and then kind of felt a little bit dirty when he realized it was a Call of Duty game.
1614000	1620000	And I have to admit, I have a lot of those same feelings, is that I was like, I was like, you know, at first I was kind of into it.
1621000	1625000	I was like, oh, is this like a, I mean, I know it's not Mass Effect, but it's kind of like a, is it trying to go over the same audience?
1626000	1630000	Like, what is this? And I was like, oh, maybe it's a little too shooty for me. I don't know if I'd be into this.
1631000	1637000	But I'm like, but it kind of looks really cool. I bet there's gonna be a big new IP. And then it was Call of Duty! And I was like, oh my God!
1637000	1644000	I was disappointed they didn't really announce anything about, like, backwards compatibility or anything like that. It's just like nothing.
1645000	1653000	Yeah, that was, that was a surprise to be missing was, well, and the fact that the Vita is just been written off completely at this point.
1654000	1661000	I mean, we kind of all knew it was coming, but there's people clinging to their Vitas, like, you know, no, I will love my Vita forever! Give me something!
1662000	1671000	Literally nothing from Sony on the Vita. So that end of things is a little disappointing. But I do overall think they built a lot of great hype into their press conference.
1672000	1681000	I mean, the Hideo Kojima thing, which, although you have to admit was totally expected, I did not expect that they would already have, like, a trailer type of thing.
1682000	1684000	Which is like, what the fuck is this?
1684000	1693000	Which is, which is great. It gets people talking. I mean, what is up with the pregnant man Norman Rita's thing? I don't know, but okay, whatever.
1694000	1697000	Norman Fetus, as everybody keeps making the joke.
1698000	1704000	Well, and the fact that he was showing us all of the game's assets at that press conference, that's for sure.
1704000	1711000	But yeah, well, Shane and I were watching the Sony conference together when the Hideo Kojima thing started, and then it was Norman Rita's.
1712000	1721000	We were sitting there going, oh shit, Guillermo del Toro's name is going to come up. Oh shit, this is going to be the fucking sucker punch that gets everybody just like Final Fantasy VII and...
1722000	1730000	Well, actually, to go back with that, you know, real quick, let's take a step back with kind of surprises like that, because there was a lot of things.
1730000	1735000	Like, first of all, Call of Duty, there was a game that looked, oh shit, this looks like P.T.
1736000	1738000	Yes! And then what the fuck, it's Resident Evil!
1739000	1742000	Okay, that was a huge win in my opinion. Did you see that Dark Soccer, the Resident Evil 7?
1743000	1744000	I saw some of it.
1745000	1749000	Oh my god. Yeah, when the thing was playing, we were like, oh, this is Sony's answer to P.T.
1750000	1751000	I saw the house.
1752000	1754000	Yeah, I was definitely like, okay, this is a P.T. thing, this is what it is.
1754000	1762000	Well, remember on the show a couple weeks ago, we had stories about that some of the producers from P.T. went over to Capcom to work on Resident Evil,
1763000	1769000	and now it's one of those things in retrospect, now that you've seen the trailer, you're like, wow, that should have been fucking obvious, we should have seen that coming.
1770000	1771000	But there it is, Resident Evil 7.
1772000	1774000	Way to fill the gap in the market. Bravo.
1774000	1783000	Well, and then the fact that they said it was VR on top of that, I was, yeah, that was actually probably one of the biggest highlights of E3, in my opinion,
1784000	1788000	was being like really fucking interested in a Resident Evil game again. I can't remember the last time I could say that.
1789000	1794000	And Resident Evil Biohazard, nonetheless. And in Japan, it's called Biohazard Resident Evil.
1795000	1801000	So, finally they're bridging these fucking names together, which is nice, so maybe in the future we won't have this difference anymore.
1802000	1803000	I still think Biohazard is a better name overall.
1804000	1810000	I like Biohazard is the name, too, but I like that the game is going to have both titles here, so that's pretty cool.
1811000	1816000	I did not check out the demo yet, though. I would be doing a disservice to my friends if I played it without them here to see me screaming,
1817000	1821000	so I'm sitting on it for a little bit before I play it. So, did you check out the demo yet?
1822000	1827000	No, I didn't download the demo. One of the things I, well, I'll get to in my gaming week, I guess.
1827000	1834000	There was some stuff that I did download that, you know, was like, hey, it's available now. So, I did that.
1835000	1841000	No, I didn't download that one. I was looking for it, but they didn't have it up when I was checking, so I just didn't download it.
1842000	1847000	Yeah, it took a while to come up that night. Like, I swear I didn't go up until 1 AM, but I just ended up grabbing it the next day, whatever.
1848000	1853000	Oh, so anyway, I want to mention, I didn't finish my thought on the Guillermo del Toro thing during the Death, what is Death Stranding?
1854000	1856000	Is that the name of the game? What a fucking Kojima name.
1857000	1863000	Clearly, Sony handed Kojima a blank check and just said, just do it, buddy. Whatever you want. Do it, buddy. We don't care.
1864000	1867000	You're Team Sony now. Like, make everybody cry. Just do it.
1868000	1877000	So, and it was worthy of, in my opinion, what should have been the actual closing of Sony's show and not the plan B.
1878000	1880000	Yeah, that would have been the fantastic way to close it.
1881000	1886000	That was in the middle of the show? And they had something bigger for the closing? What the hell was it?
1887000	1891000	That's what I thought. I was like, oh my God, this is going to be like, this closing is going to fucking kill us, like whatever it is.
1892000	1893000	And then it just was kind of, oh, we're going to just do some more.
1894000	1896000	And it's another No Man's Sky trailer that no one gives a shit about at this point.
1897000	1902000	Hey, you know what? Props to Sony for not even mentioning that game's name on the stage.
1903000	1904000	It's coming in like two months, so that's fine.
1904000	1910000	And don't get me wrong. I have it preordered. I will be playing it. I'm excited to play it. But like, it was time to not talk about that game.
1911000	1916000	So, I was very happy for that. So, in my opinion, Sony was mostly a win.
1917000	1924000	It wasn't quite like out of the park, smashing a window in the parking lot like it was last year, but it was pretty good.
1925000	1932000	They still did a pretty darn good job, I thought. The Kojima thing and the Resident Evil thing, they have a lot of, the God of War trailer looked great.
1932000	1938000	Like, I'm not usually into God of War games, but I was very much about that trailer.
1939000	1948000	Even though, I don't want to sound like too big of a Tumblr user, but the animal stuff was a little hard for me to watch.
1949000	1954000	But I could still probably let it slide. I think the game looked really, really fun. Exciting.
1955000	1958000	And just really different from the prior God of War games.
1958000	1960000	So, genre bending a little bit.
1963000	1965000	Not really, but okay.
1966000	1967000	Really? It's the same.
1968000	1969000	It looked a little, I don't know, it looked-
1970000	1972000	It just has more narrative. You're still chopping up.
1973000	1975000	I think so. Maybe it just seemed like it was a little bit slowed down in a way.
1976000	1977000	And I wasn't okay with that.
1978000	1983000	And just the beginning, because your son dragging you down, it's just like, perhaps he'll die or something and then he'll be back to like, oh hey, it's God of War again.
1984000	1986000	I'm gonna kill everybody. Yeah, we'll see.
1987000	1994000	So, yeah. A little sad to not see Guillermo del Toro's name on the Kojima project, but I understand. That was family-head.
1995000	1998000	And how can we forget about the new Spider-Man game?
1999000	2001000	Oh yeah. That looked pretty fantastic.
2002000	2006000	I don't know if that was necessarily a closer, but I'm kind of surprised I didn't get more attention.
2007000	2009000	It wasn't a closer, but yeah, it was pretty nice. It looked cool.
2009000	2015000	Yeah, no, that looks great, especially with Insomniac being involved with that. Yeah, that looked like a lot of fun.
2016000	2018000	And then I think it's worth mentioning the Crash Bandicoot thing, too.
2019000	2024000	I was a little like, oh, are they gonna announce a new game? And then they were kind of like, Skylanders!
2025000	2028000	And I was kind of like, but it's cool that they're remastering the old games.
2029000	2035000	I wonder if this is them measuring the hype a little bit? Like, should they do a full-on new Crash Bandicoot game?
2035000	2040000	I don't know. But that was pretty cool to hear that those remasters are coming. I'm all about that.
2041000	2047000	Alright. Let's see, going into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2048000	2052000	Tigerclaw says, the new God of War is going to be interesting since it will take on Norse mythology.
2053000	2057000	This means you'll probably get to fight Loki. Perhaps.
2058000	2061000	Maybe? Perhaps. Let's see.
2061000	2067000	Stoppy in chat says, ugh, I hated Crash. Not every game is going to please everybody.
2068000	2073000	Crash was like the first PlayStation game I owned, so I'm excited to check out the remaster.
2074000	2079000	Let's see, other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2080000	2083000	Dark Tetsuya said, did anyone see the Crash Shadow as the guy was walking on stage?
2084000	2089000	Yeah, I noticed that. It was very obviously going to be a Crash Bandicoot thing, but I thought it was going to be a new game.
2089000	2095000	Because that was kind of where Sony set the bar after their conference last year, where it's like, we're just granting gamer wishes.
2096000	2099000	Everybody come rub our lamp and get your gaming wish, because we're granting them.
2100000	2103000	They showed a lot of VR stuff, and a lot of that looked kind of interesting.
2104000	2112000	My thing is, I don't know how deep of experiences those are. They showed a Star Wars thing that looks like it was just a mission that you do.
2113000	2117000	And then there was some integration with Final Fantasy XV, which was something.
2117000	2120000	Yeah, but they're all sideshows compared to the real game.
2121000	2126000	But you know what, I will say this. I'm very thankful that Sony didn't mention their...
2127000	2130000	I don't even want to call it successor console, because that's not really what it is.
2131000	2133000	But Sony didn't mention their console upgrade, I guess.
2134000	2143000	I'm really glad that Sony didn't do that, because that shows me that what they're hyping for PlayStation VR right now will work with the PlayStation 4 that you have.
2143000	2147000	And isn't going to require this new thing. Because remember we talked about this last week or the week before on the show?
2148000	2155000	That I was very concerned with this whole fact that the PS4 upgrade is coming, and that people are saying it's going to be the definitive way to do VR.
2156000	2160000	And I'm kind of like, well then why the fuck am I getting the VR thing right now, if it's not going to work right on PlayStation 4?
2161000	2168000	But this kind of helps, I think, with some of those feelings for them to not announce that, yet talk about all this VR stuff.
2168000	2173000	Because the expectation is, that's what we'll get this holiday, and it'll be a lot of these rich experiences.
2174000	2180000	And also, I was reading some of the impressions of people that went to the Best Buy events that they had on Thursday and Friday, basically showing off the VR.
2181000	2189000	And people liked it. They thought it was good. And the headset felt light. They didn't really have any problems with it, so it seems to be pretty positive.
2190000	2195000	Well, my understanding too is that if you didn't go to E3, there's a ton of Best Buys now that have the PlayStation VR for you to try.
2195000	2202000	Ah, they only give it two days, and that's it. And it wasn't that much. There was like two in California. There's a double-end in somewhere in SoCal.
2203000	2209000	Oh, you know what? Probably because they had to have a retail rep policing it, because they can't just leave it out on a kiosk. Those things will get damaged or stolen so easily.
2210000	2211000	So they probably had to have a live person there to do it.
2212000	2217000	Yeah, what was it that I heard? There was somebody trying to download the Zelda demo on an SD card or some shit like that?
2217000	2225000	I got, oh man, there was a lot of fuckery at E3 this year. I just gotta say, there was some stuff on Twitter I was reading that was super not cool.
2226000	2233000	Like, gamers behave yourselves. Like, you wanna know why gamers get a shit reputation sometimes? It's because of shit like this.
2234000	2239000	And I think it's very important that the rest of us who aren't idiots call out this behavior.
2240000	2246000	Hold on, hold on, hold on. I know what you're alluding to, and it's not necessarily gamers giving bad times, because those events are for press.
2247000	2250000	So fucking look at your own selves when you're going to that.
2251000	2256000	I am not gonna say that we might have a problem where the killer is inside the house, so to speak.
2257000	2263000	I absolutely would believe that, you know, there are some seedy people who probably have worked their way up in the industry.
2264000	2274000	And like I said, those people that are, the 96% of people out there who are way more awesome need to speak up when they see shit going on.
2274000	2278000	Okay, and then along with that, can we talk about the other flops of E3 as well?
2279000	2280000	If you must.
2281000	2284000	Okay, so these are brief, and most of these you might not have even noticed actually happened.
2285000	2293000	Actually, a few things. They had a few other livestreams going on. One that I kind of checked out a part of was a Friday the 13th game. Remember that one that was on Kickstarter?
2294000	2300000	Actually, it looks really good. It looks just like the movie, and you actually get to play as Jason and everything, and I'm digging that.
2300000	2303000	I've seen some of the clips on Twitter that are really fucking gross.
2304000	2305000	Oh yeah, it's absolutely gross.
2306000	2307000	Fucking gross.
2308000	2309000	Whatever, it's the game, okay? It's fine.
2310000	2312000	This is the type of thing that Jamie would play and laugh at.
2313000	2314000	What?
2315000	2316000	Friday the 13th where you're playing as Jason getting to murder everybody?
2317000	2318000	Okay, that would be fun.
2319000	2323000	See? See? All you have to say is murder, and Jamie perks up like a dog when you say, treat?
2323000	2331000	Sega had something planned, like a livestream planned for the anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog, and they were going to be making this big announcement.
2332000	2338000	The big announcement was there was a contest for the biggest fan of Sonic. Oh, and fuck you, here's another Sonic Boom game.
2339000	2340000	Loki, are you going to be entering the Sonic?
2341000	2342000	Oh fuck, no I'm not.
2343000	2344000	Why not?
2345000	2346000	I'm not a fan of Sonic.
2347000	2348000	Okay, OLR listeners.
2349000	2350000	I'm not even a fan of Sonics.
2351000	2352000	You like Sonic the fast food chain?
2353000	2354000	No, I don't.
2355000	2356000	You don't like tater tots and lime slushies?
2357000	2358000	No.
2359000	2361000	Chat room, Loki should enter the contest, shouldn't he? Come on.
2362000	2365000	Chatters, wouldn't you back Loki up if he entered the contest for Sonic's biggest fan?
2366000	2369000	Misty, shouldn't he enter? He should enter, right? She's dying over there, she can't even.
2370000	2371000	I think Loki should enter.
2372000	2374000	I'll just take a picture of me flipping off the camera and that's it.
2375000	2376000	I owe no Sonic perks.
2377000	2379000	Okay, now you give me a reason to actually want you to enter.
2380000	2381000	Yeah, exactly.
2381000	2385000	And, Loki, since you want to win, you have to do it in full costume.
2386000	2394000	Sorry, so Photoshop everything. I'll dye myself blue, I'll spike my hair. Of course it's all Photoshop, I'm not actually going to do that.
2395000	2396000	I mean, come on.
2397000	2399000	And then I'll tell everybody in Ingress you're a traitor.
2400000	2406000	Stacks of like, you know, my house will have like the thing. No, I'm not going to do that.
2407000	2410000	And then of course the PC conference sucked balls like normal, so.
2411000	2412000	Yeah.
2413000	2419000	Let's see, SSG100Matt says, Loki will only enter the contest if they promise to get rid of his stupid friends if he does it.
2420000	2425000	I've undergone leg extensions so that my legs can be long and spindly just like Sonic.
2426000	2435000	You know, the new Sonic, because I have to stay close to being accurate to the character and now that they have lengthened his legs, I also need to go and lengthen my legs as well.
2436000	2437000	Just cut that and send it in as the clip. There it is.
2438000	2439000	It's incredibly painful, but...
2440000	2441000	But you gotta go fast.
2442000	2450000	I gotta go fast. And everybody knows if you have a longer stride, you can go faster, so that is really an evolution right there.
2451000	2455000	Love it. Any other teraflops you want to mention, Loki?
2456000	2467000	For the love of God, Ubisoft, for the love of God, please do not do the mock co-op conversations or chatter or whatever the fuck you want to call it.
2467000	2475000	It is so fucking irritating and unrealistic. Nobody fucking talks like that. And you wasted too goddamn long on it.
2476000	2483000	And I didn't need to have a section of your stupid conference talking about your stupid fucking Assassin's Creed movie that's coming out.
2484000	2485000	That was so fucking boring.
2487000	2489000	And was it steep? Looks kind of lame.
2490000	2495000	Wow, you're just kicking them while they're down. Was there anything you liked? The South Park game?
2496000	2497000	Watch Dogs 2 actually looks pretty good.
2498000	2499000	Alright, there we go. Alright, good. We got some good news there. Alright.
2500000	2501000	Uh, yes, Darcyra.
2502000	2503000	What?
2504000	2505000	Oh, I thought you were going to say something.
2506000	2507000	Well, now that I'm standing up, no.
2508000	2510000	Would you like to talk down to us now that you're standing up?
2511000	2515000	I have to say that I kind of wish I'd been able to go this year.
2516000	2517000	Oh, really?
2517000	2518000	Really? What for?
2519000	2521000	And then, um, I also then realized that I hate large groups of people.
2522000	2531000	Well, the good news is there's less people than there were in years past. So it wouldn't be as, if you survived E3 2006, you can survive this.
2532000	2539000	Bobby, I'm so confused about your comment there because Lost Planet would be a Capcom property and you didn't sit in a Konami press conference to hear about it.
2540000	2546000	I'm sure they had something more terrible. What was their game that they had on like PSP for a while that was like some first person shooter?
2547000	2552000	Well, I lost them on the PSP because it doesn't have a fucking second analog stick. So, good luck aiming with that.
2553000	2557000	And it was a tiny, I had some time. It was so memorable I can't think of the damn name for it.
2558000	2560000	Darcyra wonders if it was Coded Arms.
2561000	2563000	Maybe. I don't remember.
2564000	2573000	Alright. Um, let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I remember sitting in a 2008 press conference watching Avi Arad talk about some game movie that never came out.
2573000	2581000	It happens. Some things they show off at E3 get cancelled. Where's that Wii Vitality sensor? Didn't happen.
2582000	2589000	Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks. Things that we played since we weren't at E3, but we did play some games here at home.
2590000	2597000	We'll talk about our gaming weeks and then we'll get into the news tonight, which yes, we'll include Nintendo and some more of Ubisoft and some of these other things we haven't mentioned yet about E3.
2598000	2602000	So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with your gaming week. What kind of video games did you play this week?
2603000	2615000	Not much of anything. I played some World of Warcraft. I played some Ingress. I have played a lot of Miitomo. I guess it's kind of playing it. More like interacting with it.
2616000	2627000	I played pop and music yesterday. Whichever one of the ones they have in Japantown is. And I just played the same old songs that I like playing anyway.
2627000	2645000	What else did I play? Oh yeah, I finished all my puzzles. No, I did that the week before. I'm trying to remember because I played something else. Oh yeah, well we played Jairus at my house.
2646000	2653000	I finished your game. You have that arcade cabinet now. That's pretty awesome. Yeah, we have Jairus at my house. Dan got it for free.
2653000	2655000	Yeah, we were all singing along to the song.
2660000	2670000	It's Takata and Fugin D minor, the remix. The remix. Yeah, Jairus happened. Yeah, Jairus.
2671000	2676000	Dan seemed a little impressed that I remembered the ship patterns in the first few stages.
2676000	2688000	Oh, the other thing is that we got an Ultracade. Really? Yeah, Dan's like, don't go spending any money. Buy the $500 Ultracade. Wait a minute. After you left.
2689000	2698000	I seem to remember like a decade ago on this show we used to make fun of Ultracade. Did you kick it? I know, did you kick your Ultracade machine? Yes. Okay, thank you. I kicked it. Can we all come over and kick it? Yes.
2699000	2712000	But Dan's hope is to get it fixed up and then get rid of it. Well, he said, well, if we don't like it, we can sell it for a grand. I'm like, but why? If it's not working, why did you do this?
2713000	2722000	I don't even remember why we had to kick an Ultracade machine that just became a meme out of this show. It was like, send us your pick. That was like a contest we ran. Send us a picture of you kicking a machine.
2722000	2733000	Was it something shady that they did? Yeah, it was something shady. Did they try to like register MAME or something? Ah, something like that. They tried to like copyright MAME or something. I don't remember. Something like that. Yeah, they were shoving out MAME.
2734000	2749000	Well, now, I mean, you know what I wouldn't mind having, to be honest, is an Ultra pin. Yes, those machines are hot. That would be pretty cool. I played a few games on one of those and I think it would be nice to have, but then again, nothing is like having the originals.
2749000	2765000	So, oh, and I did actually play more pinball this weekend because Dan redid the rubbers in our Black, not Black Knight. Well, he did it for Black Knight, for World Cup and for Twilight Zone. Dan bought some new rubbers. They're actually silicone.
2765000	2789000	But they go on the flippers so that they don't get damaged by the ball. Protection is important. But these actually are supposed to last forever and not lose any of their give. So, he also fixed the left flipper in Twilight Zone. So, I played a decent amount of Twilight Zone this weekend.
2790000	2812000	Sounds like Dan's really kind of made a little niche of fixing up broken shit. He's selling the rig. Yeah, the driving rig. Oh, really? Yeah, he's done with it. We've actually taken all those months. He had three 27 inch monitors hooked up to it. And he took one for himself and gave me the other two. Nice. So like, ooh, I can actually play without my glasses. Yeah, he retired.
2812000	2820000	Ragenator in chat over at Live.FogNetwork.com calling out something you had posted on Facebook that Dan had had you hold his balls to while he was fixing the pinball machine.
2820000	2827000	Yes, he said hold my balls and then he gave me three. You're a very special husband.
2828000	2847000	You know, to be honest, I've never felt Dan's balls or anybody's pinballs for that matter. What does a pinball feel like? How much do they weigh? Are they heavy? They're metal balls. Are they heavy or are they kind of light? They're a little heavy-ish.
2847000	2852000	Describe the balls in detail.
2853000	2855000	They're dirty yet kind of shiny.
2855000	2868000	And aren't you really supposed to be touching them with your hands? Because when you would not want getting, you wouldn't want like grime or anything on those balls. You know, wouldn't it affect how they roll? Is it something that you want to like make sure that you're not touching them with like oil from your fingers?
2868000	2872000	I'm sure Darcy would respond to that. This is how I roll, bitch.
2872000	2875000	Do pinballs weigh 80 grams? If that helps you?
2875000	2880000	I don't speak international. I only speak American.
2880000	2884000	They're 2.7 centimeters in diameter.
2884000	2888000	This is all, I don't understand any of these words that you're saying right now.
2888000	2899000	All right. Anyway, okay, look, we need to move on from talking about pinballs, but one of these days I'm going to come over and touch his balls.
2899000	2903000	Because I just want to feel for myself.
2903000	2905000	They're fucking metal balls.
2905000	2907000	Roll them around in your hands.
2907000	2910000	Won't somebody let me touch their balls?
2910000	2916000	I was trying to do the whole goblin thing, king thing with the three of them and I'm not that dexterous.
2916000	2920000	All right. Let's move on with somebody else's gaming week.
2920000	2926000	Misty, you're a nice, super serious person to go to after that exchange. Misty, how was your gaming week?
2926000	2928000	Not too bad.
2928000	2931000	Make sure you're talking right in that mic so we can hear you.
2931000	2935000	So yeah, round one, cross speeds, 2DX, Supernova 2.
2935000	2941000	Did a day trip to Reno, ended up going to Circus Circus and playing the Supernova there.
2941000	2950000	And on the way in, attention spanned, among things, Neko Atsume on my phone.
2950000	2956000	Because if there's any conversation more exciting than talking about pinballs, it's talking about cat butts.
2956000	2958000	Cat butts are the best butts.
2958000	2960000	I feel like there's an OLR dream game in there somewhere.
2960000	2964000	Pinballs and cat butts. I don't like a love story. I don't know. We'll see.
2964000	2968000	I don't want to see where we have to shoot the ball for multi-ball.
2971000	2977000	All right. So it sounds like Misty had a fun, we've been doing so much traveling, getting to go to some of these arcades and stops and stuff.
2977000	2979000	And how was the in and out?
2979000	2981000	It was good.
2981000	2986000	I always have to ask the East Coasters, how'd you feel about it, or Midwesterners in this case, how'd you feel about the in and out?
2986000	2988000	Because, you know, they don't have them past a certain point.
2988000	2991000	All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?
2991000	2999000	I played a few things. One of the things that they announced that we didn't talk about with the, well maybe we're going to talk about it, so I apologize if we are.
2999000	3002000	Out of Ubisoft is they're talking about the new South Park game.
3002000	3007000	And if you pre-order digitally, you also get South Park the Stick of Truth.
3007000	3013000	And since I was going to pick up the new game anyways, I was like, sweet, I will go ahead and just pre-order it.
3013000	3017000	And sure enough, there's South Park the Stick of Truth for the PlayStation 4.
3017000	3023000	And so I played some of that, and it's fantastic still, because I played it a little bit on 360, never finished it.
3023000	3025000	But damn, that game is awesome.
3025000	3027000	So, definitely enjoying that.
3027000	3032000	One of the other ones that they said, you know, hey, it's available now after the press conference.
3032000	3037000	And then it got very pissed off because that's when they started wasting time with the stupid Assassin's Creed movie talk.
3037000	3040000	And all the other shit that they were wasting time with.
3040000	3044000	Was Blood, Trials of the Blood Dragon.
3044000	3054000	It was a cross between Trials, that really crazy, somewhat over-the-top motorcycle, I guess it's like a racing puzzle game.
3054000	3064000	And then of course, Blood Dragon, which was the ridiculous 80s, 90s infused shooter game that was all sorts of retro and cheesy and whatever.
3064000	3067000	So it's both of those combined, and it's pretty awesome.
3067000	3073000	It's very similar to the last expansion they did for Trials, which I don't remember that was called.
3073000	3076000	They had like a flaming unicorn and stuff the last time.
3076000	3082000	But it's kind of similar, this one you actually do some shooting and there's some off-the-bike stuff, which is kind of eh, it's alright.
3082000	3085000	But I do like to have this RC card that you can play as.
3085000	3088000	It's a little bit of a mix-up of the actual game.
3088000	3090000	But definitely check it out, it's worth the money.
3090000	3094000	And then I played a little bit of Ingress, I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.
3094000	3099000	Don't like the new update with Pokemon Go, makes it even buggier, and they made it more grindy.
3099000	3103000	Which, I kind of don't want to play it.
3103000	3108000	I heard around the grapevine that an update came out yesterday to fix a lot of those bug issues.
3108000	3109000	Just in case you haven't seen it.
3109000	3111000	Ah, no. It still has not.
3111000	3119000	And then I downloaded Smash Brothers for the Wii U because it was on sale.
3119000	3121000	Oh yeah, E3 sales.
3121000	3126000	And they don't normally discount that stuff, so I figured out what the hell, so I let my son play that.
3126000	3128000	I actually haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.
3128000	3129000	I didn't download all the characters.
3129000	3135000	And by the way, and I know I'm part of the problem because I did pay the money for them, but it's whatever.
3135000	3139000	I have a real problem with paying for $5 for one DLC character.
3139000	3145000	I mean, yes I know I'm stupid and actually did that as well, but I still don't approve of that practice.
3145000	3149000	And whereas I made the exception this time, I will not be doing that in the future.
3149000	3153000	But seriously, $5 for a fucking character? Come on.
3153000	3154000	That's it.
3154000	3156000	Alright, my gaming week.
3156000	3158000	To be honest, I haven't played a lot of new stuff.
3158000	3160000	Just been kind of still making progress on some of the old stuff.
3160000	3162000	Still playing a little bit of Overwatch.
3162000	3164000	Alan got really into Overwatch.
3164000	3166000	He plays it more than I do at this point.
3166000	3170000	So once in a while I'll try to team up and play some games, but I'm not very good at it.
3170000	3176000	But one of the things I'm continuing to enjoy about Overwatch is that there are characters that do more than just shoot the guns.
3177000	3181000	So that if you aren't good at shooters, you can still kind of do things that still support your team.
3181000	3182000	So I really appreciate that.
3182000	3186000	I think that's part of what is kind of brilliant about the design of Overwatch in the first place.
3186000	3188000	But I've been still having fun with that.
3188000	3193000	And also been playing, I was still playing Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, believe it or not.
3193000	3194000	I don't have any more gym badges.
3194000	3200000	Because I'm at this point where it was like, okay I had to walk down this route to get to this place to get some weird item I didn't even have to be using.
3200000	3202000	Then I have to go like up and all the way around.
3202000	3207000	So anyway, I'm still kind of stuck a little bit in Pokemon, but I'm making progress.
3207000	3209000	So I've still been playing that, believe it or not.
3209000	3213000	And I've been playing, this is weird.
3213000	3216000	Like just on a whim, one of my friends was talking about this game.
3216000	3218000	So I was like, you know what, I should check it out.
3218000	3219000	I haven't played this game in a long time.
3219000	3222000	You remember when I was talking about Path of Exile?
3222000	3224000	I went back and played that a little bit.
3224000	3228000	That is the free to play game that's on Steam and I'm sure a ton of other, those types of places too.
3229000	3231000	It's kind of Diablo-esque.
3231000	3237000	Although there's a lot, there's like Diablo, like Blizzard kind of likes to keep things simple, right?
3237000	3239000	Path of Exile kind of goes a little deeper.
3239000	3242000	Not just with their, you know, very complicated skill tree.
3242000	3247000	But you know, your abilities are in gems that level independently and you can link things together.
3247000	3252000	There's a lot that even I am still trying to learn and figure out and understand.
3252000	3254000	But I'm having fun with it.
3254000	3258000	And considering that I'm kind of at a point where I think I'm a little burned out on Diablo 3.
3258000	3264000	Like I love Diablo 3, but okay, here we are season six and kind of the same grind.
3264000	3267000	And I kind of got my reward and I'm a little bit over it.
3267000	3271000	I'm kind of glad that like Path of Exile, even though I'm a total noob,
3271000	3278000	is kind of satisfying a lot of my urges to play, you know, pew pew, kill all the things, collect loot and all that stuff.
3278000	3282000	So yeah, I guess that would be the other shout out I would give this week would be that.
3284000	3288000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, Path of Exile, it's got a crazy huge skill tree.
3288000	3292000	Yeah, and didn't they like add to it with this ascendancy stuff, which I don't even understand.
3292000	3296000	There's a whole nother, like last time I played the game this wasn't in there.
3296000	3298000	Now there's this prophecy stuff too.
3298000	3303000	Like I find like these coins and this like fortune teller will tell me these things that are going to happen.
3303000	3307000	And my video game logic tells me, oh, these are quests that I'm going to like open a portal and go to.
3307000	3310000	No, they're just things I have to I guess look out for.
3310000	3311000	I'm not even sure how it works.
3311000	3316000	I'm sure there's a Path of Exile fan out there who's getting extraordinarily frustrated listening to my noob ass.
3316000	3321000	But I'm going to keep at it and try to read some more guides this week to figure it all out and see.
3321000	3324000	Because I am having fun with it for what it's worth and that's the most important thing, right?
3324000	3325000	So there you go.
3325000	3328000	All right, let's move on.
3328000	3334000	We need to get into some gaming news and some of the other stuff that happened this week at E3 and outside of E3 even.
3334000	3340000	But first, Loki with, you know, the other company that a lot of people are talking about this week, right, Loki?
3340000	3345000	Right. Yes. So Nintendo, of course, their thing was they're only showing Zelda.
3345000	3352000	So that's what they did. They started off with their stream, the trailer for Zelda, the Breath of the Wild.
3352000	3356000	And it is this very big open world Zelda game.
3356000	3364000	It is what I've been looking for in a Zelda game for a long time because it is very similar art style wise to Wind Waker.
3364000	3366000	And it also shares a lot of stuff from Wind Waker.
3366000	3371000	And there's even like some theory about like some sort of convergence on different timelines within Zelda.
3371000	3379000	But it's basically like, spoiler, in Wind Waker there's a part where you find out, hey, the world is flooded and actually Hyrule is under the world.
3379000	3382000	That these islands that you're finding are just the mountain tops.
3382000	3388000	And I was like, damn, why couldn't they have just made this whole game like Hyrule and in this art style?
3388000	3395000	And sure enough, a few years later, this game comes out and it's basically that game with Hyrule and it's open world and it's awesome.
3395000	3404000	So that's what this is. And so they showed it off, basically showing off a small section of the map, which I want to say they said it was like 2% of the map.
3404000	3409000	But it was goddamn huge. Like I don't even think they explored the whole thing there the entire time.
3409000	3415000	But there's so much you can do with it. Physics are just ridiculous amount of stuff that you can do with the environment.
3415000	3421000	Like set fire to things and the wind takes the fire and all sorts of like unintended things you can do.
3421000	3424000	It's just very neat. A different type of Zelda game.
3424000	3437000	I know one thing you like to do with these open world games like in your Grand Theft Auto type of games is like try to break things, go places you shouldn't go, kill your character in the most horrific way possible.
3437000	3440000	Do you see that you're going to be able to do some of that in the new Zelda?
3440000	3442000	Probably. I mean, why not? Yeah.
3442000	3445000	Apparently the new Zelda will let you run around shirtless too.
3445000	3448000	Yeah, you can put clothes on if you want to.
3448000	3450000	But who wants to do that? Please.
3450000	3458000	You just have Link in his underwear. I don't know. It looked cool. I'm definitely looking forward to it.
3459000	3465000	They didn't really talk about the NX at all or what exactly is going to be different with that version of the game.
3465000	3470000	But I mean, considering this is just on the Wii U right now, it looks pretty damn good for the Wii U.
3470000	3481000	Yeah. I didn't even need E3 to sell me on this game. I think maybe that was part of my quote unquote frustration about Nintendo really dedicating as much as they did with E3 to Zelda.
3481000	3486000	Because for me personally, I was like, I already know I'm going to want this game based on what they've shown of this previously.
3486000	3493000	And I mean, nothing about that has changed. I did not have the time to sit and watch hours and hours of live stream.
3493000	3496000	I was like, I need like a five minute Cliff Notes version.
3496000	3499000	But there's enough stuff on YouTube where I kind of got a sense of what's going on.
3499000	3503000	I'm like, yeah, okay, this looks like it's just going to be a freaking huge Zelda game.
3503000	3506000	And yeah, I already knew I wanted it.
3506000	3511000	Zelda and, you know, what else?
3511000	3515000	Like Shadow of the Colossus, getting the big Shadow of the Colossus vibe from it.
3515000	3521000	The demo obviously was different. It was, you know, earlier on in the development cycle.
3521000	3528000	So they didn't show like, you know, there's going to be more like NPCs and towns and stuff like that in the game as well.
3528000	3532000	But they didn't really show that. So I don't know. It looks good. I'm definitely looking forward.
3532000	3534000	I'm definitely going to be picking it up when it comes out.
3534000	3538000	Let's see. Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3538000	3544000	Stoppy says, I think it looks interesting, but I will need other games to convince me to get an NX.
3544000	3546000	Maybe Nintendo will have a killer E3 next year.
3546000	3552000	Well, that decision to get you to buy an NX has to happen before E3 next year.
3552000	3558000	If the rumors are to be believed that that system is coming out by the end of the fiscal year, which means March, April, right?
3558000	3565000	We're going to get to that very soon, but I don't, yeah.
3565000	3566000	You don't think it's going to happen?
3566000	3573000	I know. I just, I think that we're going to have, I think it's going to be deja vu all over again.
3574000	3583000	I, I'm trying to be a little more optimistic. I, I think the whole reason they did what they did with E3 was so they didn't have to do deja vu.
3583000	3590000	But here's the, well, here's the problem though with that. I mean, yes, I understand that they're getting people hyped about this game and stuff.
3590000	3598000	They've already said that, Hey, um, God, I really should have looked over everything, but they basically said, Hey, guess what?
3598000	3609000	Um, yeah, there's not really going to be, we're not making any more we use. Sorry. There's like less than a million left. Get them while you can.
3609000	3610000	Huh?
3610000	3616000	So I mean, they're trying to get you to buy a console for this game. I mean, I don't know.
3616000	3626000	All right. Well, we will see what develops with NX, but as far as Zelda goes, I'm sold, but I will probably be buying the Zelda game on the NX.
3626000	3633000	Because I can't imagine I'm not going to want Nintendo's next console. I really can't imagine I'm not going to want it.
3635000	3636000	Maybe I'm just meeting a consumer.
3636000	3638000	We'll discuss this in a minute.
3638000	3644000	Fine. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about the Star Trek game that came out of the Ubisoft conference.
3644000	3650000	It's a Star Trek bridge crew, uh, going to be coming for the PlayStation VR, the HTC Vive and Oculus.
3650000	3659000	So it will have, uh, all the VRs, all the things, uh, Red Storm Entertainment is creating the game and, uh, they of course made Far Cry 3 and 4 and The Division.
3659000	3667000	Uh, and so there's actually a whole little, um, um, like, uh, video that they showed where they had LeVar Burton and Jerry Ryan.
3667000	3671000	I think what Carl Urban, I think was, was all playing it. And they were all kind of into the game.
3671000	3677000	You know, VR games can kind of be a hard sell at these conferences because you can't show the VR.
3677000	3679000	Right. And, and I mean, this is like,
3679000	3691000	Just real quick aside, do you think with the PlayStation VR being out by next year, do you think the next E3 I will be able to experience in VR? I bet I can.
3691000	3699000	And so that way they'll be able to show me VR games in VR, but we'll, we'll see. But I, I just have this interesting feeling that that could be a thing. We'll see.
3701000	3705000	I kind of feel like that's what Oculus wants to do with the Facebook and the event. Anyway, anyway.
3705000	3714000	They have, they have VR streaming. So I mean, it could, it could happen. Anyway. Um, so yeah, uh, the game looked pretty fun.
3714000	3723000	Um, but the old, okay, here's the only thing I, I, the only issue I guess I had with it is that these guys were all playing in one room. Right.
3723000	3730000	And I was like, okay, so you have the three Star Trek, um, celebrities, and then you have, you know, the, the guy that was leading the demo.
3730000	3739000	And I'm thinking who's going to have four VR headsets at their house or even tell their friends like, hey, come on over and bring your VR headset.
3739000	3749000	Hopefully we all have the same brand so we can play the game. So not right now, but you know, it sounds preposterous, but well, I guess we'll see.
3749000	3758000	But, and I know you're probably yelling online, online. Yeah. I'm assuming a lot of this has to be online, but there's a big difference between online and in the same room.
3758000	3765000	Well, also like Nintendo banks on all the time for Oculus and like even PlayStation VR and stuff that might be difficult.
3765000	3773000	I can see like your VR is might, might be an option because it's cheaper, like, you know, whatever the Android dream or whatever that is, something like that.
3773000	3786000	Or hell if Apple ever decides to come out with VR, which I'm sure it's a matter of time. Um, that's something a little bit more feasible because everybody has smart devices and you know, it's something that they may be a very,
3786000	3797000	I could see in five years that VR is going to take off to the point where it's going to be just like, no one thought everyone's gonna have smartphones on, you know, it's like, those are expensive. Why would, who would pay $600 for a phone?
3797000	3807000	I mean, that's silly, but then again, uh, Bobby Blackwolf, our, uh, he's of course, super into VR over at live.voggenetware.com says, uh, it is an online game.
3807000	3818000	They were all in the same studio for TV sake. I, again, I kind of say that's one of those things you have to be aware of when you're getting, buying into the marketing of these games is that there's a lot of stuff.
3818000	3825000	To be honest, why was this trailer so short and that stupid Eagle trailer or Eagle gameplay thing that they did was so long.
3825000	3830000	Um, and then, uh, Bobby Blackwolf also mentions if you want to play the game in the same room, play Artemis.
3830000	3836000	Um, while we're on the subject of Star Trek, by the way, there's other two, two quick asides I want to mention.
3836000	3842000	One, I want to mention the, um, Starboard power coupling, uh, our pals over there, uh, at the voice keys network.
3842000	3852000	They just hit their 100th episode. Um, Captain Matt was actually here the other night doing the show live here from the same studio, uh, with his pals, uh, Eddie and Ken over Skype.
3852000	3861000	So big congrats to the cast of Starboard power coupling on episode 100. Yay. Um, on a bit of a downer, um, in which Chad is bringing up right now.
3861000	3868000	Yes, I did hear about the, uh, unfortunate tragedy that happened to, uh, Anton Yelchin today. That's, um, that's horrible.
3868000	3879000	Uh, especially kind of hearing about that it was, you know, literally a freak accident, uh, just kind of, you know, a reminder to, um, make the most of every day.
3879000	3881000	Because, uh, you never know.
3881000	3896000	I, this is going to sound awful for me. It was completely preventable and it's just, it should be common sense that you don't leave your car running in neutral.
3896000	3897000	Mhm.
3897000	3900000	Practice some common sense people. Be safe.
3900000	3901000	Yeah.
3902000	3905000	I mean, it's still, it's a tragedy. It's a great loss.
3905000	3906000	Exactly.
3906000	3910000	But it was still a result of his own negligence.
3910000	3918000	Yeah. So just be careful people. Be careful. All right. Anyhow, um, let's move on with some other gaming news. Dark Sakura.
3919000	3934000	Well, this has been, I think, a little bit of an edgy topic for some people is about things done for Twitch viewers to, to, uh, inflate viewer, uh, and, uh, follower counts.
3934000	3952000	So now, um, it actually is, uh, a part of Twitch policy now that, um, view bots and follow bots and chat impersonation bots are, uh, completely, um, you know, not allowed.
3952000	3977000	You can't have them. And now, um, they are actually, uh, following through with a lawsuit against seven different bot makers who are, uh, selling their products to, uh, increase, uh, follower and viewer count. So, uh, yeah, they're, they're tacking down on them.
3977000	3997000	I just, why would you buy fake viewers when you know they're fake? And I completely understand that Twitch does like the rankings based on view count. And so you're like bolstering yourself in the rankings, but still I'm kind of like to have earned something falsely like that is just like, oh, like your whole thing is tainted.
3997000	4005000	And if you are destined to be a talented, uh, live broadcaster, do it of your own merits. You know what I mean? Just weird.
4005000	4019000	It's just, people will do anything. I think I honestly would like to see that these Twitch streamers who are using these services get reprimanded or even banned in some way.
4019000	4031000	Well, to be fair, devil's advocate, because I think this is important. If people knew that people were going to get banned for these fake streamers, I could hire fake or sorry, not fake streamers.
4031000	4049000	I could hire fake viewers to go on your channel. So you'd get in trouble. That's, that's the only devil's advocate perspective I have is that you have, I mean, you don't want to false ban anybody. Although I agree with you. Yes. They need to maybe lawsuit and then maybe, um, uh, what would you call subpoena the records?
4049000	4056000	So then they can truly figure out who's buying them and do something about it. But yeah, I would, I would be very cautious about false positives. That's my only thing.
4057000	4069000	Um, uh, and then the other thing, there was nothing I wanted to say with that, with the whole, um, Twitch and the buying and all that stuff. Um, damn it. Train left the station. I can't remember what I was going to say. So I guess I'll go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
4069000	4085000	Uh, let's see. Dungeon Buster says, I heard Riot banned a few players for botting their League of Legends streams. Oh, that, that's what it was. Um, World of Warcraft. I seem to remember there was a very similar sort of thing where they sued some of those gold spammer people
4085000	4096000	that kept spamming on their game. So this seems very similar to that whole thing or, or no, it wasn't the spammers. It was the people making the bot programs. That's who they went after.
4096000	4099000	See, that was actually another reason why I quit final fantasy 14.
4099000	4111000	Oh, uh, just an aside though, it was addressed this week and there is going to be a gold spam report thing in the next patch to be fair, but that, but yes, that has been always an annoyance about 14 for way too long.
4112000	4121000	Finally, it's being addressed and you know, the hilarious thing about it, how it came up while Yoshida, the producer was playing final fantasy 14 during the, he got gold spammed.
4121000	4122000	Yeah.
4122000	4128000	So he finally mentioned, by the way, we're going to have a reporting thing in the next patch. So,
4128000	4143000	Well, it needs to have a complete not arriving thing. You know, it's just completely irritating. And that was a big, that was actually, I'd say 50% of the reason I left because Warcraft has that thing licked.
4143000	4148000	You don't have to look at the chat and they can't message you directly. So,
4149000	4161000	All right. Well, uh, we'll hope the appropriate people that are taking advantage of these CD services or the CD services themselves get a nice, good spanking, uh, for being very, very naughty.
4161000	4163000	Let's move on to the next story. Loki.
4163000	4180000	All right. So, um, Reggie was in an interview, um, I want to say, what was it with Bloomberg and regarding, you know, what he thought, you know, about E3 and kind of like the other systems that were available, uh, mainly, you know, now that Sony is talking about the PlayStation
4180000	4192000	Neo, um, or their next system or briefly mentioned it and, you know, the Xbox Scorpio and kind of their comment on it, you know, what, what did they have planned for the NX, that type of thing.
4192000	4202000	And basically he came out, you know, kind of dodged the question by saying, you know, for us, it's not about the specs, it's not about the teraflops, um, or the, you know, processing power.
4202000	4213000	It's about the content, um, basically saying that they're a content company and their focus is to put their entertaining titles on the Wii U and on the NX.
4213000	4215000	Loki, I think we actually have a video of that.
4215000	4227000	Your competitors, uh, you know, talked about their forthcoming, the Xbox and a new PlayStation. How do you think the NX console will stack up to them?
4227000	4236000	You know, for us, it's not about specs. It's not about teraflops. It's not about the horsepower of a particular system. For us, it's about the content.
4236000	4249000	Nintendo is a content focused company. We create entertainment that makes people smile. So for us, we're focused on bringing our best entertainment to both the Wii U as well as the NX in the future.
4249000	4259000	So for us, whatever Microsoft and Sony are doing in terms of talking about new systems, that's for them to fight out in that red ocean.
4259000	4268000	For us, we want to make sure we're bringing our best content forward. And right now the reaction to Zelda has been, uh, has been more than we could have ever imagined.
4268000	4272000	Okay. To be fair, Loki, is he wrong?
4272000	4276000	And I'm not, hold on. I was going to take that angle as well.
4276000	4277000	All right. All right.
4277000	4292000	And you know, to be fair, their content is fantastic. Nintendo's games are fantastic. And you know, their approach, what they're talking about here could be that they're, they're not really focused on talking about specs and stuff right now because they're putting out great games that are just going to run on whatever hardware platform they have.
4292000	4294000	And that's really the draw to these systems.
4294000	4307000	But, but lower your speakers, everybody. But no, no, no. Hold on, hold on. But this is the exact same shit that he fucking talked about with the Wii U and why it was underpowered when it came out.
4307000	4320000	Don't get me wrong. Nintendo content is great. It's been great on the Wii U, but if those specs can't run the games that are running on the higher spec systems of your competitors, you're going to be fucked once more.
4320000	4331000	And that's going to hurt you big time. And granted, yes, there are going to be people that buy your systems for those first party titles, but the Wii U has been the worst selling console that they've had, period.
4331000	4341000	So, okay, I do actually get your point. Part of what has hurt the Wii U so bad is that the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One games can't be easily ported for the Wii U. I get that.
4341000	4362000	However, assuming that NX is going to be on that same level where it does perform as the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, isn't it true that the new consoles don't matter because Sony and Nintendo have been saying the new consoles don't matter because everything will be playable on the original consoles.
4362000	4366000	So therefore, in theory, the games should port to NX.
4366000	4376000	Assuming that the specs of the system are up to that, but being that I'm talking about specs makes me worry and being that he kind of dodged it to content makes me late.
4376000	4383000	Because if they were like, yeah, you know, not to worry, our system spec wise will be, you know, it'll be able to handle like the stuff that they put out.
4383000	4391000	He didn't talk about anything like that. And that worries me because they dodged that last time the same way. And it's like they don't get it.
4391000	4396000	And it just, it, we'll see. I mean, they haven't talked specs yet.
4396000	4401000	That's, I get that. That's valid. I do believe NX, well, not that any opinion is not valid, but you know what I mean?
4401000	4411000	I agree with you to that point is that if the NX is not at least PlayStation 4 powerful, then there's going to be a big problem because you're right.
4411000	4417000	It's going to suffer that same fate where third party don't want to just make their games for this system. They don't want to have to do this whole separate thing for it.
4417000	4429000	I I'm totally with you there. I just don't think the new systems, if, if Sony and Microsoft are being, you know, transparent and what they're saying about these, these upgrades or whatever, that everything should still work.
4429000	4438000	Hopefully that won't ultimately matter. That makes sense. I just, I just, when someone dodges a question like that, I kind of worry. That's all. Yeah.
4438000	4448000	But he did make a damn good point coming out of this E3, everybody's talking about Zelda, which is not on a PlayStation 4 level terafloppy system.
4448000	4454000	That is true. But the sad thing is, it's probably the last great title that's going to be on that system that you've already pretty much killed off already.
4454000	4467000	And it's like, you know, that's cool, but, uh, I mean, I don't know. I, and I'm, I'm with in agreement with him about like, you know, how they're talking about the new systems because so far, I mean, it's very easy.
4467000	4477000	So far, they haven't really told us what those systems are going to be used for. And everybody's trying to follow up with questions to see how exactly they're going to use that because what they're saying doesn't seem to make any sense.
4477000	4488000	And what they're replying with doesn't make any sense either. It's like, well, it's not going to really do much aside from upscale a 4k. Then why do I want to buy this? I mean, I don't know. It just doesn't make any sense.
4489000	4491000	It's like, why is that a knee right now?
4491000	4494000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4494000	4501000	Cajudo in chat says, if the new Nintendo doesn't at least have a hard drive in it and Nintendo might be fucked. Well, the Wii U's got, well, it's not very big.
4501000	4508000	Yeah. I already, I already had the plug in something external because I don't want to download another game. I was like, this is stupid.
4508000	4519000	I kind of don't think that's going to be a problem, but I think what we do need to question is the whole, the rumors about no disc drive. Does this mean that they're going back to flash?
4519000	4528000	I mean, that's still kind of a thing that obviously E3 is not addressing because we're not talking about NX right now, but a very kind of curious question about that.
4528000	4530000	I think that, I mean,
4530000	4534000	Because you can't go download only and not have a gigantic hard drive.
4534000	4539000	Right. But I think that they're, they're going to go cartridge again, which that ups the manufacturing costs.
4539000	4545000	And I mean, you're, you're limited to what you can fit on whatever media that they choose to put it on there.
4545000	4549000	And I understand, I mean, it sounds like they want to do a portable system that way, but.
4549000	4554000	I still stand by my prediction that the reason why they're going back to cartridge is so that you can put that cartridge in a portable system.
4554000	4562000	Right. But my worry is also that, you know, because of the reason people still have optical drives is because one, they like watching Blu-rays and stuff on their systems.
4562000	4568000	And two, it's a lot cheaper to manufacture that stuff and a lot quicker to manufacture it versus putting on cartridge.
4568000	4574000	But then again, they have expertise to do that since they've been putting on cartridges, you know, for the 3DS.
4574000	4578000	I do get that point, but one more devil's advocate question for you, then we're going to move on for time.
4578000	4581000	What do you watch more Blu-rays or Netflix?
4582000	4593000	Netflix. But if you want to get to the point where I have a 4K TV, I'm sure as hell not going to be streaming that because it doesn't come over to 1080p half the time.
4593000	4597000	So, yeah, I mean, granted, yes, we're thinking right now.
4597000	4602000	That's another thing, too. Right now, we're talking spec wise that these systems are going to be around for a while.
4602000	4606000	But at Sony and Microsoft, they already have these new systems lined up.
4606000	4608000	Yeah, they're saying, oh, yeah, it's going to play all the same stuff.
4608000	4615000	But how long is it going to take them to change that decision? I give it a year or so before they're like, oh, but there's these games that only run on these systems.
4615000	4621000	And it's slowly, oh, now we're not making those old systems. Okay, now everything is going to be this.
4621000	4627000	All right, let's move on. I want to talk about something else out of Ubisoft's conference that I think got a lot of people talking.
4627000	4633000	And even even Loki can't hate on this, I don't think, is that they finally showed some information about South Park.
4633000	4638000	The Fractured But Whole was the best part of the whole conference.
4638000	4642000	And even a date for the game, December 6th, is when the game will be out.
4642000	4647000	And it seems like it's riffing on the whole superhero genre, which has been on the Civil War stuff.
4647000	4651000	Yeah, which is all big in theaters right now. So this is kind of like the play on that.
4651000	4657000	Apparently, you will be able to do a fart that will rip time. That's that's classic.
4658000	4663000	There's a dozen different classes in the game. You can mix and match between them.
4663000	4668000	You will be playing as the new kid and be interacting with the other South Park characters.
4668000	4674000	If you preorder, you get a copy of the Stick of Truth, which I did, and I love it because you can play it right now.
4674000	4681000	Nice. So, yeah, I'm I'm excited about the game, too, because the last South Park game was pretty good.
4681000	4686000	I know I know this one will be good as well in chat. There seems to be a lot of excited stuff about that in chat, too.
4686000	4691000	Stoppy says, I love it when serious news agencies have to say that title.
4691000	4694000	I think that's probably half the reason that they...
4694000	4696000	Of course it is. Of course it is.
4696000	4698000	It's called the new South Park game.
4698000	4701000	Yeah, it's all about in the delivery as well.
4701000	4703000	But here's the best part.
4703000	4708000	The fractured but whole. Like if you can kind of say it in a way that doesn't sound like the whole.
4708000	4711000	The best part is, you know, there's going to be some news outlets that just don't fucking get it.
4711000	4713000	They don't realize that it's a pun.
4714000	4720000	The old news lady that's been on the station since the 1970s reporting, you know.
4720000	4722000	The fractured but whole.
4725000	4728000	You can get like a Barbara Walters saying that, you know.
4729000	4733000	Today on 20-20, the fractured but whole.
4736000	4738000	Coming up next on The View.
4738000	4742000	I somehow have combined Barbara Walters and Julia Child. Don't ask.
4742000	4745000	I'm not paid to do impressions.
4746000	4749000	Dark Soccer, are you excited about the fractured but whole?
4749000	4750000	No.
4751000	4752000	You want to know what?
4752000	4753000	What?
4753000	4755000	I don't give a shit about the fractured but whole.
4757000	4758000	Alright, then let's move on.
4758000	4759000	Unintended.
4759000	4761000	Let's move on to another story, Dark Soccer.
4761000	4762000	Oh, good lord.
4763000	4768000	So, this makes me kind of happy, even though I didn't play the second one, which I don't know why.
4769000	4773000	But there is plans for Bayonetta 3.
4776000	4783000	Hideki Kamiya said that he was asked when considering Bayonetta 3.
4783000	4786000	And he said, yes, I've been thinking about it a lot.
4786000	4791000	So, I think that they are looking for opportunities to be able to make it.
4792000	4793000	But that doesn't mean they're making it.
4793000	4794000	No.
4794000	4795000	Yet.
4795000	4797000	It means that they really want to.
4798000	4804000	If Nintendo wants to write a check, so that bad boy is an exclusive to the NX, which they ought to do.
4804000	4805000	It is...
4806000	4807000	Okay.
4807000	4809000	Can I tinfoil hat for a moment here?
4809000	4810000	Sure.
4810000	4814000	A criminal amount of people have not experienced Bayonetta 2.
4814000	4816000	And I understand that's because it's on The View.
4816000	4817000	I wonder those.
4817000	4818000	Go borrow my copy for fuck's sake.
4818000	4820000	You've got to play Bayonetta 2.
4820000	4825000	But you have kids at home and you really shouldn't play that game when they're within 50 feet of the house.
4826000	4827000	But here's the thing.
4827000	4830000	It's criminal how few people have played Bayonetta 2.
4830000	4838000	And I said, and many people have said, that game is not going to ever come out for Sony or Microsoft because Nintendo paid for that game.
4838000	4842000	That doesn't mean it won't come out on the NX.
4843000	4847000	I really hope, if nothing else, so that Bayonetta 3 can happen.
4848000	4849000	Yes.
4849000	4852000	Bayonetta 2 gets a second chance on the NX.
4852000	4860000	I would be totally okay if Nintendo comes out and says one of the launch titles for the Nintendo NX is Bayonetta 2 Remastered.
4860000	4862000	And there's going to be so many people that are going to be like,
4862000	4865000	Remastered? That game just came out.
4865000	4869000	And I'm going to be like, you fucks didn't play it the first time and so you're missing the fuck out.
4869000	4871000	So here's your chance. Eat it.
4873000	4874000	Right, Dark Sakura?
4874000	4875000	Yes.
4875000	4876000	Thank you.
4877000	4878000	Let's see.
4878000	4882000	Going over to a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4883000	4887000	DungeonBuster says it's great at least the first game. Really want to play the second game.
4887000	4888000	Yeah, you got to check it out.
4888000	4890000	Stoppy says one and two remastered.
4890000	4891000	Even better!
4891000	4892000	Why the fuck not?
4892000	4894000	They already put one on the Wii U.
4894000	4895000	Why the fuck not?
4896000	4897000	And you know what?
4897000	4902000	And they can come up with a witty yet sexually charged subtitle for the collection.
4902000	4905000	They can call it the Bayonetta Ménage à Trois.
4906000	4907000	Perfect!
4908000	4910000	Print it. Patent pending.
4910000	4912000	Nintendo owes us a quarter of every copy sold.
4912000	4913000	Trademarked.
4916000	4917000	Alright.
4917000	4923000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things that will be coming to a gaming store a little sooner than Bayonetta 3.
4923000	4924000	Loki.
4924000	4930000	So, this week we've got Deadlight Director's Cut on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4930000	4935000	Pac-Man 256 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4935000	4937000	They're porting Umbrella Corps.
4937000	4944000	If you don't remember, that was as a first person shooter spinoff of Resident Evil that was on PlayStation 4 and is going to be on PC.
4944000	4946000	A game called Valhalla.
4946000	4949000	That's on PC, Mac, and Linux.
4949000	4954000	And then on Friday, Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
4954000	4960000	Hey! What do you know? The Olympics are coming to the Wii U, but maybe not actually to Rio because they're in financial trouble right now.
4960000	4962000	And then Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
4962000	4965000	Sonic's got to run away from that Zika virus as fast as he can.
4965000	4966000	Yes.
4966000	4967000	Bad joke.
4967000	4969000	Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
4969000	4970000	Cross FE.
4970000	4972000	That's coming out on Wii U as well.
4972000	4978000	And then, of course, I couldn't forget, you know, the game that's going to make you cry like an anime fan on Prom Night.
4978000	4985000	Mighty No. 9 is going to be coming out on PC, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U this Tuesday.
4985000	4987000	Not your words. The official words.
4987000	4989000	Those are the official words.
4989000	4994000	The only thing that'll make you cry in that game is the fact of how lame it probably is going to be.
4996000	4999000	Actually, to be honest, I watched a stream of it. It looked okay.
4999000	5001000	It wasn't terrible.
5001000	5003000	Misty, any interest in Mighty No. 9?
5003000	5004000	It was really cheesy as fuck, though.
5004000	5009000	You like classic games. Mighty No. 9 is kind of a throwback to Mighty No. 9. Would you check out Mighty No. 9?
5009000	5011000	Or Steaming Pile of Poopy?
5011000	5013000	What do you think, Misty?
5013000	5020000	Honestly, not sure. I would probably have to at least give it a once over before I actually put more thought into it.
5020000	5024000	Alright. That puts you above 90% of the gaming public right there.
5024000	5028000	Did she just say, I'm not going to have an opinion until I actually play it?
5028000	5030000	I think she did. Good for you.
5031000	5032000	Good for you.
5041000	5043000	Fuck off.
5057000	5059000	At least we get them for the Bethesda conference.
5061000	5065000	But someday if, you know, Jeff were to...
5065000	5071000	If he were not able to fulfill his duties as host of E3, then I would hope that Adam would be able to step up and...
5071000	5073000	What is it, a beauty pageant?
5074000	5078000	Should Jeff Keighley be unable to fulfill his duties as the Dorito Pope?
5081000	5087000	Should the next Papal election actually elect Adam Sessler or Morgan Webb or some kind of...
5087000	5088000	Or both.
5088000	5091000	Conjoined anomaly of the two of them.
5091000	5093000	You just made me think of a news article.
5093000	5094000	What?
5094000	5097000	You saying Dorito Pope made me think of...
5097000	5102000	Instead of the white smoke, they'll be waving the orange cheese dust when he's elected.
5103000	5108000	You made me think of the other Republican that called Trump Cheeto Jesus.
5110000	5111000	Speaking of orange.
5111000	5112000	I know, right?
5112000	5113000	Alright, anyway.
5114000	5117000	Hey, let's go to Japan. Let's check out what's coming out of Japan.
5118000	5121000	I'm coming out on June 23rd over in Japan.
5121000	5127000	Buy this for yourself as a birthday present for Orange Lounge Radio to all of our Japanese listeners.
5127000	5133000	So Akuma JP and anyone else who might be over there who never emails us or calls us or participates in chat.
5133000	5140000	But June 23rd is the 14th anniversary of our show and is the day that you can pick up The Walking Dead in Japan.
5140000	5143000	Which Square Enix is actually publishing over there. It's kind of interesting.
5143000	5147000	Also, Need for Speed gets a price reduction and goes into the EA best hits.
5147000	5152000	And that whole biohazard umbrella core thing that Loki was talking about a minute ago.
5152000	5154000	Also out in Japan this week.
5154000	5156000	That is all on the PlayStation 4.
5156000	5162000	If you want to go over to the PlayStation 3, actually nothing this week on the PlayStation 3.
5162000	5164000	I guess the release is over there slowing down a little bit.
5164000	5170000	But over on the Wii U, you get Minecraft Wii U edition comes out this week.
5170000	5175000	As well as Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is out this week as well.
5175000	5180000	So a little bit more exciting of a week on the Wii U in Japan than it has been in a little while.
5180000	5183000	How about Nintendo's other system, the 3DS?
5183000	5185000	There's really only one game out this week.
5185000	5193000	It's Bokuju Monogatari Mitsu no Rino Taisetsu na Tomodachi comes out this week.
5193000	5197000	So does that mean? I see the word Tomodachi in it.
5197000	5199000	What's the name again?
5199000	5205000	Bokuju Monogatari Mitsu no Rino Taisetsu na Tomodachi.
5205000	5207000	Something about best friend?
5207000	5209000	Perhaps. And it looks like...
5209000	5210000	Legend something?
5210000	5212000	Honestly, this looks like a farming game.
5212000	5214000	And judging by the box art...
5214000	5215000	Is he from the chat?
5215000	5216000	I think he is.
5216000	5219000	That's how I judge Japanese games is by the box art.
5219000	5226000	It looks like this girl's best friend is the puppy and this boy's best friend is the kitty.
5226000	5230000	So this is some type of farming type of game, clearly.
5230000	5236000	And there's also Happy Little Cows and I Believe in Alpaca, which is kind of a win for me.
5236000	5238000	Yeah, weird.
5238000	5241000	So there you go. That is out on the 3DS.
5241000	5244000	I'm sure it's kind of like another one of those farming sim games.
5244000	5251000	So if you eat up stuff like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, this kind of looks like it's right up your sleeve.
5251000	5255000	Lastly, checking on the PlayStation Vita this week.
5256000	5259000	Caligula is out in Japan this week.
5259000	5262000	Not to be confused with the porno from the 70s.
5262000	5270000	Or maybe referring to the original Roman Emperor who spawned such...
5270000	5274000	This looks like it could be a modernization anime version of that, who knows.
5274000	5277000	But also on the Vita this week, Refrain no Chika.
5277000	5279000	I like modern anime porn.
5279000	5284000	To-ma-jo no Riodan comes out this week as well in Japan.
5284000	5287000	And AkumaJP says, yes, farming means...
5287000	5292000	Bokuju Monogatari means farming game.
5292000	5294000	So there it is.
5294000	5297000	And yes, that's what I said, SSG100Matt here.
5297000	5299000	I'll send you this game as well.
5299000	5303000	And yes, no Malcolm McDowell in this game to be seen, but there it is.
5303000	5306000	Alright, let's go to Europe. Dark Sakura.
5306000	5308000	Some stuff.
5308000	5316000	On the 21st we have Pac-Man 256 on PS4, X-Bone and PC.
5316000	5321000	The Tech Remancer on PS4 and Xbox One and PC.
5321000	5324000	And Deadlight Director's Cut on all of the above.
5324000	5330000	So on the 24th we also have Dino Demi's Kick-Off Revival on PS4.
5330000	5334000	And on Wii U, Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE.
5334000	5336000	That's it.
5338000	5342000	Register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
5342000	5345000	Use the passphrase, church.
5345000	5349000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5349000	5352000	Hey, that Pac-Man 256 though, I played that on my mobile phone.
5352000	5355000	Does that mean that game is going to be free on the consoles?
5355000	5357000	I didn't see anything about it.
5357000	5360000	They're going to make me pay for some stuff.
5360000	5362000	You always pay one way or another.
5362000	5363000	I guess that's true.
5363000	5366000	Alright, I was just curious because I'll probably pick that up on PlayStation 4.
5366000	5369000	But if it's too much money then never mind because it's free on the phone.
5369000	5371000	You know, actually there's a real...
5371000	5375000	I could just take a look right now and see on the storefront since you can pull that up.
5375000	5376000	Hooray!
5376000	5378000	I'll take a look at that one line.
5378000	5381000	Alright, we'll look later. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you have in the news?
5381000	5384000	So this is kind of funny. We didn't even really know about this.
5384000	5386000	And I think it was ridiculous in the first place.
5386000	5390000	But No Man's Sky, the game was actually going through a lawsuit regarding its name.
5391000	5399000	Apparently, Sky has been the issue of that.
5399000	5407000	Apparently, Sky TV, they settled a three year long lawsuit with them over the word Sky in that game.
5407000	5412000	I just... I don't know what to say.
5412000	5414000	I mean, glad that they get to keep their name.
5414000	5417000	But that's stupid.
5417000	5419000	There's no confusion whatsoever in that.
5419000	5423000	Apparently, you guys, I'm a motherfucking fugitive.
5423000	5427000	And I didn't even know this until this story came out.
5427000	5428000	Yes, apparently.
5428000	5432000	That is what I've been calling myself in the DDR community and then this show.
5432000	5434000	Well, I usually use Rob Roberts more often than I do anymore.
5434000	5436000	But my Twitter handle is still Sky.
5436000	5440000	So that's kind of funny that I've gotten away with it for fourteen years.
5440000	5442000	Well, you also spell it differently.
5442000	5444000	I do spell it different. I guess that's the big difference.
5444000	5448000	And I also, I don't sell myself. At least not yet.
5450000	5452000	So maybe that helps too.
5452000	5454000	But no, I had no idea that this was an issue either.
5454000	5457000	Which is kind of funny to hear that the word Sky is so...
5457000	5461000	Apparently, this isn't the first time that Sky TV has gone after a company for that.
5461000	5470000	They also went after Microsoft for their cloud service, Sky Drive, which later was changed to OneDrive because of trademark disputes.
5470000	5473000	Oh no, I emailed Microsoft and told them to back the fuck up.
5473000	5475000	That's why that changed.
5475000	5477000	I don't know what this other news thing is all about.
5478000	5480000	Rumors. What can you do?
5482000	5486000	What did you tell them? That you should force them to keep the name of your products?
5486000	5489000	Like you forced them to take Windows 10?
5493000	5502000	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat just kind of rolling it all up in a giant Katamari ball and calling it No Man's Sky Drive with an IE.
5502000	5503000	Thank you.
5503000	5505000	Perfect. No Man's Sky Drive.
5505000	5507000	There's the name of tonight's episode.
5507000	5510000	I don't know, pinballs and cat butts was also pretty good.
5514000	5520000	I don't know if things are allowed to fly in video games since the word Sky is apparently on lockdown.
5520000	5524000	But there's a lot of characters flying around in Overwatch.
5524000	5529000	And since Overwatch already launched, it's not like Blizzard is going to come to E3 and talk about Overwatch.
5529000	5531000	So there really wasn't a lot to say.
5531000	5543000	But there was a post that went out during E3 week where the game director Jeff Kaplan did talk about some of the things that are going to be coming to Overwatch to keep the game at the front of your memories and keep the fan base energized.
5543000	5546000	Didn't talk about any release dates for characters or maps.
5546000	5551000	But did mention that the team's highest priority is competitive play.
5551000	5561000	So this will be a separate multiplayer selection and it's going to be a little bit more of a serious ranked thing than the casual thing that exists today where the serious people have no other place to play.
5561000	5564000	It's kind of a mixing pool right now so hopefully things will be separated.
5564000	5569000	Of course no date on that besides soon or when it's done.
5569000	5580000	But there is talk about a possible public test realm test to get player feedback which is something that they do in their other games such as World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 and so forth.
5580000	5584000	So there you go. That's what's going on with Overwatch.
5584000	5588000	So let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?
5591000	5596000	We're going to go back to a classic time where video games didn't fly around the sky. They were nailed to the ground.
5596000	5601000	This is a trip down memory lane. Every week DarkSakura opens the vault and finds a game where she thinks,
5601000	5608000	Hey! You! Play this game or I hate you. It's the classic game of the week.
5608000	5609000	Poor children.
5609000	5613000	DarkSakura. What is the classic game of the week this week?
5613000	5615000	The classic game is popin' music.
5615000	5618000	What? That's not a classic game. No, I'm kidding.
5618000	5620000	It's more classic than Halo.
5622000	5627000	The first popin' music came out September 29th, 1998.
5628000	5635000	So it is pretty much classic Bimani. I mean, if you want to look at it that way.
5635000	5650000	Basically, popin' music, for those who have lived under rocks and don't know, is not meant to look like a musical instrument or a DJ setup or anything like that.
5650000	5657000	Not like how Keyboard Mania and Gitarura and Beatmania and all that were.
5657000	5662000	Instead, you have little buttons. You have nine colored buttons.
5662000	5669000	And you have to hit the buttons in time with how it hits the bottom line. Very Beatmania in that kind of respect.
5669000	5674000	And then you get great, good, or bad. And as you build up a combo, you get fever.
5674000	5682000	So you can play it in five button mode. I'm sorry, not in five. Yeah, you can play in five button mode or you can play in nine button mode.
5682000	5691000	It is just pretty good. I mean, there's no additional score bonuses like in 2DX. Combos are great.
5691000	5696000	I believe that they introduced Battle Mode in...
5696000	5703000	No, Battle Mode was there, I think, from the beginning where you could have a little mini-game in the middle where you could battle against your friends.
5703000	5710000	But pop and music for the Bimani series has been one of the ongoing mainstays.
5710000	5718000	In fact, there are some crazy, I'd say, ongoing items. So this is pretty cool.
5718000	5725000	You also have your little balls on the screen. Balls are called Pop-Kun.
5725000	5733000	You can play in high speed. You can change the appearance of everything. You can do random so it changes the patterns on everything.
5733000	5739000	Honestly, it was about time I mentioned it, so here you go.
5739000	5748000	And on top of that, it has little characters that have always been, I'd say, mainstays of the series.
5748000	5755000	And now, for some reason, I can't find their names.
5755000	5760000	Yami and Mimi. Yami is the cat. Mimi is the rabbit.
5760000	5764000	And yeah, I'm just gonna go with pop and music.
5764000	5771000	Alright, you do that. There it is, your classic game of the week. Pooping music. I'm sorry, pop and music.
5771000	5780000	Not to be confused with Beaten Groovy on the Xbox 360, which I was very proud of Dark Soccer for not using those words in a sentence.
5780000	5783000	And I apologize for ruining her segment by doing so now.
5783000	5788000	Because that game was really an atrocity to the great fun of pop and music.
5788000	5798000	Which, if you've never played, I always explain this to people where it's like, imagine, what was the best part of playing Trouble, the board game Trouble?
5798000	5804000	It was hitting that pop-o-matic bubble every time you got to, and trying to break it every time.
5804000	5810000	Because you don't just tap the button, you fucking slam your hand on it, and you pop that bubble.
5810000	5816000	Well, imagine if somebody actually made a video game all about pressing the pop-o-matic bubble on Trouble.
5816000	5820000	That is pop and music. You use five or nine of them, and it's beautiful.
5820000	5826000	And that's, god damn it, that's why I love music games. Right there. Love it.
5826000	5830000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, though. We've got plenty more show to come.
5830000	5835000	We've got some rapid-fire news. The Frugal Question of the Week. Yes, we have a Frugal Question of the Week this week.
5835000	5841000	And plenty more to come when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5841000	5844000	Don't go anywhere. We will be back.
5844000	5859000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with our 646th episode for this June 19th of 2016.
5859000	5864000	Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, here in studio with our pal, Misty.
5864000	5870000	A long time OLR listener and fan joining us in studio tonight. Why the hell not? Just because.
5870000	5871000	Basically.
5871000	5876000	Basically. And also because, I guess it's worth noting, you know, next week we are going to be celebrating.
5876000	5880000	We're not really doing anything special for it because, you know, 14 is a weird number.
5880000	5886000	But next week is the 14th anniversary episode of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.
5886000	5890000	Because I don't know if I can after all these years. But we're going to be celebrating that.
5890000	5896000	The official birthday of Orange Lounge Radio is June 23rd, 2002 was episode number one of this program.
5896000	5906000	All those years ago where we sat around playing, we had a bunch of people in the house playing like BeatMania 2DX in one room.
5906000	5912000	And I think DDR, Lord knows what mix in the other. Probably Jamie had her Dreamcast pads over or something.
5912000	5923000	And we were doing our little show in one corner of the room talking about, I think we were talking about a parent who had changed their baby's diapers on a keyboard mania machine.
5923000	5926000	And how mad we were about that. I know that was one of the dark sides.
5926000	5931000	That was the one that I told her to get her baby's ass off the machine.
5933000	5934000	How does one do that though?
5934000	5938000	I believe that the term is, people's fingers touch that.
5938000	5943000	I don't understand how someone would even do that. I mean, because like the machine isn't that big.
5943000	5944000	It was big enough.
5944000	5948000	Isn't this interesting that 14 years later you have a whole new perspective on that story?
5948000	5952000	It's like I just would think that they wouldn't sit still. That baby is going on the floor.
5954000	5963000	So here we are. Anyway, we'll be looking back and taking your calls and just doing the whole Resiquit podcast, patting yourself on the back thing. We'll do a little bit of that.
5963000	5964000	But not too much.
5964000	5968000	I mean, they are holding off the announcement of Half-Life 3 just for the show.
5968000	5975000	Oh, thank heavens. Half-Life 14 confirmed. Well, Loki, 4 minus 1 is 3.
5975000	5976000	It is.
5976000	5978000	Here I am saying 14 is not a big deal.
5978000	5991000	But, actually, I think what next week needs to signify, and this is very important, is that it's not that it's our 14th year, but it's the fact that we are only one year away from the OLR quiceniera.
5991000	5997000	Which, I'll be damned if it's not the biggest fucking thing we've ever done at Orange Lounge Radio.
5997000	6007000	We barely did anything for the 10th. Whatever for the 500th. We need to go all out for the OLR quiceniera.
6007000	6017000	I will get a party dress for the OLR quiceniera. So, hopefully details on that over the next year. Anyhow.
6017000	6020000	Well, that would be one way to get me back quicker.
6021000	6028000	God. Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, you need to find that kid, referring to the baby on the keyboard mania machine.
6028000	6029000	He's all grown up now.
6029000	6037000	And interview him for next week's episode. Because the kid would be 14 years old. Oh my god.
6037000	6045000	That baby, Dark Soccer, is going to high school right now. Help.
6046000	6047000	Alright.
6048000	6050000	His mom won't be changing his diapers.
6050000	6055000	I was going to say, and in some portions of the country, he could even be changing his own baby's diapers.
6056000	6064000	Alright. Let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get to. Let's get to it. Loki.
6065000	6070000	So, they had a real brief thing that they talked about Pokemon Go during their whole Nintendo stream.
6070000	6080000	And, you know, for those not in the know, Pokemon Go is a new location-based mobile game from Niantic, who puts out Ingress.
6080000	6085000	We talk about it sometimes. They're currently in beta right now. Closed beta. We're not supposed to be talking about it, but fuck them.
6085000	6089000	So, well. Whatever. I do what I want.
6090000	6100000	So, Pokemon Go, they're going to have, they announced that they're going to have this device that's going to be sold separately called the Pokemon Go Plus.
6100000	6106000	And it's this little thing. It looks like, almost like a Poke Ball, but kind of in a teardrop shape, I guess.
6106000	6112000	And it has a little button on it that lights up different colors depending on stuff that's happening in the game.
6112000	6118000	So, it may buzz and flash if there's a Pokemon nearby and you push the button and it'll attempt to catch it.
6118000	6124000	Without actually using your phone. So, you don't even need to look at your phone's screen. It just syncs with the Bluetooth.
6124000	6131000	And you can actually catch Pokemon while you're out without actually running the game.
6131000	6137000	It's kind of neat. That would come in handy if I'm playing it in my car, because then I wouldn't have to worry about, you know, fumbling with my phone.
6137000	6141000	I'd just be like, click the button, click the button, you know.
6141000	6146000	Or if I'm like trying to sneakily catch a Pokemon while I'm at work on break or something.
6147000	6148000	Why not?
6148000	6151000	So, that is going to be available for $34.99.
6151000	6157000	And then, of course, Miyamoto did reveal that, oh, it's going to be out at the end of July.
6157000	6160000	And they're like, we're not supposed to be saying that.
6160000	6163000	And they even kind of retracted that as well.
6163000	6171000	On top of that, they're saying that, you know, when the game launches, it's going to be just the red and blue games worth of Pokemon that generation.
6171000	6173000	Which I do see that kind of right now.
6173000	6180000	And then they're saying that maybe in the future there may be some sort of gameplay crossover with Pokemon Go and Pokemon Sun and Moon.
6180000	6182000	So, we'll see.
6185000	6187000	I don't think the game's coming out in July.
6187000	6190000	It is pretty damn early.
6190000	6194000	I think way too many news outlets ran with that Pokemon in July thing.
6194000	6201000	And yes, I understood what was said on the livestream, but I would be very surprised if Pokemon Go is released in July.
6201000	6204000	I think way too many news orgs ran with that.
6204000	6210000	It is very early in that game. That game is not ready to come out any time soon.
6210000	6213000	But then again, we've only been testing it for a few weeks.
6213000	6215000	Yeah, it's not that it's bad at all.
6215000	6219000	It's just that some of the game elements still need to be ironed out, some of the balancing.
6219000	6222000	You know, there's just, there's a little more that needs to go.
6222000	6227000	You know, from what I've heard, because I'm not as brazen as Loki is, but there you go.
6227000	6229000	We're not posting screenshots. They all know who I am.
6229000	6231000	No one listens to this show. Come on, seriously.
6233000	6234000	Fair enough.
6234000	6236000	I've made my peace with that, so that's fine.
6237000	6239000	I did too, about 12 years ago.
6240000	6242000	What else you got, Loki?
6242000	6245000	Alright, and in Activision, I mean, we've been talking about this for a while now.
6245000	6250000	Activision's finally bringing out their Skylanders Academy show.
6251000	6253000	There's Spyro, goddammit.
6253000	6256000	At least he doesn't look like a fucking freak like the actual figure does.
6256000	6259000	But the Skylanders Academy that's going to be coming out on Netflix.
6260000	6263000	And it's got quite a cast in there as well.
6265000	6272000	I'm just excited, well, I'm not really excited about it, but I like that the villain has voice of, you know, Zim from Invader Zim.
6272000	6274000	So, that is kind of cool.
6274000	6279000	Although, I'd really wish that Invader Zim was on Netflix instead, but whatever.
6279000	6284000	Maybe this is something my son will get into, and I'll say, no, we're not fucking buying those games because that's ridiculous.
6286000	6292000	And then finally, you know, with the new Zelda game coming out, it's good to know that they're not doing it alone.
6292000	6295000	They're also going to be getting help from Monolith.
6295000	6301000	And Monolith, of course, will be the developers behind the Xenoblade Chronicles games.
6301000	6306000	So, I could definitely see some sort of influences from that in the new Zelda game.
6307000	6312000	You know, we were talking earlier in the show about Wii U games that are pretty good that people have missed, like Bayonetta 2.
6312000	6321000	There's another, I think if they remade Xenoblade Chronicles for the NX and did that, I don't think anybody would complain or think that it was a bad idea.
6321000	6322000	Just saying.
6322000	6323000	No.
6324000	6329000	Hey, speaking of the NX, apparently there will be more talk on NX this year.
6329000	6331000	Yeah, I know, this is kind of one of those.
6331000	6332000	Kind of has to be.
6332000	6333000	It kind of has to be, right?
6333000	6339000	But, for what it's worth, in a financial post-interview with a representative from Nintendo, Scott Moffat,
6339000	6343000	it was confirmed that they will talk more about NX this year.
6343000	6350000	So, they did talk about, let's see, with The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild being among the titles we're working on for NX,
6350000	6355000	we're very excited, it will be an immediate reason game fans will want to buy the hardware.
6355000	6361000	Second, it's important to have a clear positioning for your proposition and be able to explain it to consumers in a simple and easy way.
6361000	6364000	Those are among the things we're working for on NX.
6365000	6371000	You don't know how to explain your system to people, and it's, I guess it's about a year out, but...
6374000	6376000	Okay, here's the part you really want to know.
6376000	6378000	There will be more information coming out later this year.
6378000	6381000	We certainly understand everyone's desire and interest to learn more.
6381000	6383000	We can't wait to tell you all about it.
6383000	6384000	But E3 was not the time.
6384000	6390000	We wanted to focus our efforts on The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and also on Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.
6390000	6393000	A fantastic new experience in that franchise.
6393000	6396000	Later this year, you can expect to get more information on NX.
6397000	6406000	Interesting, because I sort of feel like, at least in the build-up to E3, the Pokemon stuff was really like a footnote.
6406000	6409000	Like, it's like, no, this is Zelda and nothing but Zelda.
6409000	6410000	We were kind of sitting here going like...
6410000	6412000	Yeah, they showed Pokemon first.
6412000	6415000	They're like, okay, let's get this out of the way and then we can talk to Zelda.
6415000	6422000	Yeah, and then when it kind of came to actually E3 time, it was like, okay, well, Pokemon, you know, between Go and Sun and Moon,
6422000	6427000	got a fair amount of time, although I'm sure some out there, if Shane's out there, would probably argue not enough time.
6427000	6434000	But at least it got more than what we thought, which was nothing with Zelda kind of taking over.
6434000	6441000	So it's interesting that suddenly now folks were saying, well, E3 was about more than just Zelda, let me tell you.
6441000	6443000	Anyway.
6443000	6446000	Hey, backwards compatibility on the Xbox One.
6446000	6449000	Are you a fan of Portal 2 or Left 4 Dead?
6449000	6451000	You should be, because both those games are great.
6451000	6456000	And yeah, they are now on backwards compatibility on Xbox One, so you can play those.
6456000	6463000	Also, if you have the more B-list titles, Flashback, Brain Challenge, and Babel Rising, which I don't know any of those games,
6463000	6467000	and I've been doing this show for 14 years, but they are now backwards compatible.
6467000	6469000	So go have fun.
6469000	6475000	What about the rest of the Orange Box stuff, like, you know, Half-Life 2?
6475000	6478000	That's a great question that I would like to have an answer.
6478000	6479000	I was very surprised...
6479000	6484000	I would assume if they've got those games running that they have the source engine working, so you would think that that would work.
6484000	6491000	I was surprised that Microsoft didn't do more backwards compatibility and, like, fucking lost obviously already.
6491000	6494000	You know what? I still give them props, because they're at least doing it.
6494000	6499000	Fuck you, Nin- you know, not fuck you, Nintendo, but they're doing plenty of backwards compatibility, Nintendo.
6499000	6506000	Fuck you, Sony, for not even fucking addressing it with your fucking system that's gonna put out 4K, but can't run the fucking PlayStation 1 games.
6506000	6509000	Loki. But you can rent them all.
6509000	6518000	Oh, well fuck you. You know what? Nobody rents shit anymore, unless it's from Red Box, and I don't see your fucking backwards compatible games in Red Box.
6518000	6526000	Anyway, let's, uh, I need to get- I need to get less Loki and more Jamie, so let's shift the topic to Mass Effect, shall we?
6526000	6528000	Yes.
6528000	6530000	Perfect.
6530000	6532000	I can go for this course of action.
6533000	6537000	So there is more information out there, just a little bit, about Mass Effect Andromeda.
6537000	6546000	The character name has been revealed via Twitter, and yes, it was the character we saw at the end of the trailer is the main character.
6546000	6556000	And, uh, her name is, but we know it will be able to be male or female, but this time instead of male in the trailers, this is gonna be the default, it sounds like, is the female.
6556000	6563000	And her name will be Ryder. That's R-Y-D-E-R. So, Ryder is the main character's name.
6563000	6570000	Some folks speculating that perhaps, you know, Commander Shepard got their name from Alan Shepard, the first man in space.
6570000	6580000	Some wondering if Ryder could be a reference to Sally Ride, which would be a very appropriate tribute because she passed within the past few years.
6580000	6584000	So, um, that could have been something that crossed their mind during the development of this game.
6584000	6591000	Who knows? But there we go, now we have a name, Ryder. We don't know if it's Commander Ryder, we could kind of assume, but we'll find out.
6591000	6594000	Not soon enough, but we'll find out. DarkSakura.
6594000	6610000	Well, some other news coming out of E3 is a trailer has come out for Dragon Quest VII, Fragments of the Forgotten Past, and it will launch in North America on September 16th, 2016 on the 3DS.
6610000	6616000	I'm excited about this. The StreetPass thing in this game sounds really cool. So, yay!
6616000	6631000	Fun. And then also coming with Final Fantasy XV will be a little bonus game called A King's Tale Final Fantasy XV, which is a side-scrolling beat-em-up that features the main character's father.
6631000	6637000	So, that's kind of cool. Sorry, a little built-in prequel, if you will.
6637000	6649000	And then last but not least, um, some, uh, things for the NX to consider is that of course they want to work on a new kind of Mario game. Miyamoto said so, so we believe him. Right? Right?
6649000	6661000	Um, so, uh, no idea what it's gonna be, but it's something. And it's new, apparently. So, it'll probably be a platformer of some kind.
6661000	6673000	Well, it makes sense because Super Mario Maker was kind of supposed to be the swang song to Mario as we know it. It's gonna be weird if they just put out, you know, Mario games like we've seen when it's like, I could have made that in Mario Maker.
6673000	6689000	Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, by the way, our chat room is, uh, coming up with some names for this, uh, rider character in Mass Effect. Uh, let's see, uh, Tigerclaw is saying now you can make Winona Rider. You could. You could do Winona Rider.
6689000	6700000	Uh, let's see, uh, Raginator is saying Knight Rider. Um, ActDeaf is suggesting Common Rider. Uh, SSG100Matt say you can name your character KK Rider.
6700000	6702000	What about Saber Rider? Who remembers that?
6702000	6715000	Uh, why not? But, uh, I, I love that. I think my female will definitely be Winona Rider, just like my female Shepard was Sherry Shepard. So, I'm gonna have Winona Rider, but my male rider is gonna be Richard Rider.
6715000	6716000	Ha, ha.
6716000	6718000	And I'll leave it to you to fill in the blanks there.
6718000	6720000	Good. I can claim Common Rider then.
6720000	6721000	Yes, you can.
6724000	6728000	Alright, uh, let's move on with the foogle question of the week.
6737000	6740000	What do you want to bet BioWare changes that name before the game's out?
6742000	6744000	Based on, uh, everything coming up in chat right now.
6744000	6745000	No.
6745000	6755000	Bobby Blackwolf suggesting Face Rider. No, it's alright. Anyway, hey, DarkSakura, DarkSakura just looked at her brain with how she rolled those eyes.
6758000	6770000	Alright, let's go to the foogle question of the week. Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio or, uh, Google.com slash PlusOrangeLoungeRadio.
6770000	6778000	And this week we asked, of course, another E3 has come and gone. What got you the most excited about gaming's future from this E3?
6778000	6788000	We're gonna start on Google Plus this week with AJ Twist who said, Microsoft. I'm not excited about them. I'm more interested in what they're trying to do with PC Xbox crossover.
6788000	6796000	What's their plan five years from now? Is the Xbox gonna be a console or a platform like Steam is? What's gonna happen to Steam on Windows?
6796000	6805000	So, maybe we have more questions than answers, but, you know, it's very interesting to see that kind of future of, um, Microsoft.
6805000	6814000	Let's go over to Facebook where we got our first answer from Rhetortainment who said, three words, nude Norman Reedus.
6814000	6825000	That was definitely, that was not on my E3 bingo card. I will say that. Nobody predicted that. Nobody. And if you did, buy a lottery ticket. Seriously.
6825000	6833000	Rhetortainment also closes that saying. Also, failure and despair to Konami. I suppose I have to mention this at some point.
6833000	6840000	Y'all saw the tweet, right? That was a picture of Konami's booth, although somebody sent it to me on Twitter and said,
6840000	6846000	Hey, Rob, you should do your podcast from here cause it looks like a really low traffic area where nobody's at.
6846000	6854000	And it was a picture of Konami's room. And my reply was, I'm sorry, but the room's gonna be so empty that the sound's gonna echo too much.
6854000	6860000	I can't, I can't do a good podcast there. Yeah, an echo chamber. What the hell was Konami even doing at E3?
6860000	6870000	I guess, is there a persona game? My God. Boy was I about to give Konami credit for something that they sure didn't deserve. I apologize to RPG fans everywhere.
6870000	6877000	Don't they have like, they have something coming out. Pro Evo? No, there's something other than Pro Evo that they had coming out. I just don't remember what it was.
6878000	6884000	Pachinko. No, it was some anime game. Oh, well. I don't remember. Alright, anyway.
6884000	6895000	Moving on, Red the Haze over on Facebook says, I'm on the other side of the world right now, but I still gotta see Spiderman by Insomniac live.
6895000	6903000	And for the first time in ages, I got super excited by surprise reveal. I want more recognizable properties handled by proven devs.
6903000	6910000	Dark Tetsuya says, if you've seen my timeline this week, then you know I'm all aboard the hype train for The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.
6910000	6915000	A new generation Zelda, but in the open world style of the NES original. Where do I sign up?
6915000	6926000	Second place would have to go to Kojima's Death Stranding. There definitely seems to be a lot of layers to the game and its theme and all that stuff, as is par for the course with a Kojima trailer.
6926000	6936000	And let's not forget the photoshops that have come out of that trailer, such as the pictures of Norman Reedus crying holding a Playstation Vita.
6936000	6943000	Or holding a Popplio, the Pokemon that's very neglected and the starting Pokemon and the next thing.
6943000	6950000	What else? Norman Reedus crying holding things has been great. Although, Norman Reedus throwing a little shade on his own Twitter.
6950000	6958000	I don't know if you guys saw, but right after that press conference and that was shown, he actually retweeted an Instagram thing where Kojima was drinking from a cup.
6958000	6962000	Where somebody, I'm pretty sure, photoshopped on that Konami Tears. Did you see that?
6962000	6965000	Yes I did. That was on his Tumblr or Instagram.
6965000	6967000	Fucking hilarious.
6967000	6974000	Great. Let's see. Also, moving on to Veronica Isabelle who said The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.
6974000	6982000	And Andy R said I got a fairly decent amount of hands-on, face-on time with Playstation VR and I gotta say I'm loving it.
6982000	6986000	Eve Valkyrie was amazeballs and stuff like Farpoint and Headmaster were pretty good too.
6986000	6988000	Probably has the VR was pretty mad though.
6988000	6997000	Unfortunately, at the moment, I'm still a little concerned about getting actual full games in VR as opposed to bad conversions of non-VR games or short demo-like experiences.
6997000	7006000	But as far as tech is concerned, I'm on board. I'd almost consider even going in on Oculus or Vive now, but I like how Playstation VR doesn't break the bank as much.
7006000	7010000	And honestly, I feel like Playstation VR is the most comfortable of the bunch.
7010000	7017000	Ragenator says I'm excited to see that Tekken 7 is coming to PC. It's about damn time the PC gamers got a Tekken game.
7017000	7021000	As an aside, it's too bad the older Tekken games aren't either on Steam or GOG.
7021000	7025000	I've been a huge fan of the series since Tekken 2 on the Playstation 1.
7025000	7032000	And lastly, Hitstun says I'm running behind on gaming news. Was Freedom Planet 2 at E3? I'm pretty hyped for Freedom Planet 2.
7032000	7038000	The first one is a perfect example of retro-inspired gameplay in a modern engine and I can't wait to see what they do in Unity.
7038000	7043000	You know, I gotta admit, Hitstun, I don't remember seeing a lot coming out about that game at E3.
7043000	7052000	But, speaking of games that I was hoping to hear more on that I didn't see enough on, where was my Civ 6 coverage?
7052000	7054000	Remember when they announced it? I know it was there.
7054000	7055000	Was that during the PC conference?
7055000	7057000	Oh, was it during the PC conference?
7057000	7059000	I don't know, I didn't watch it. I heard it was boring as hell.
7059000	7067000	Okay, somebody on Twitter, I'm not gonna say who, somebody on Twitter posted a selfie with the people making Civilization 6.
7067000	7077000	And I was like, great selfie, where's my news? How was the game? Did you play it? Was it a demo? Did it look good?
7077000	7080000	Have you even played a Civ game before?
7080000	7088000	So I was just a little bit like, I want to know a little more about the Civ 6, but granted I didn't dig deep enough to be fair.
7088000	7096000	I probably just need to get on good old Google News and try to find where all the hands-on was Civ 6 or what it was they were showing at E3.
7096000	7101000	But of course, does it really matter because we all know I'm gonna get that game anyway? Maybe not.
7101000	7108000	I guess it's kind of like the Zelda thing. I don't need to watch 8 hours of Zelda. I'm already gonna buy it. Does it matter at this point?
7108000	7110000	I guess it's the same thing with Civ 6.
7110000	7116000	Alright, moving on, let's get back into some long form news. Again, add us on Facebook.
7116000	7124000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7124000	7134000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Skye, reminds me of the Russians bombarding us with questions when you took a selfie with the farming simulator cow.
7134000	7139000	Okay, to be fair, yes that did happen a couple years ago. I took a selfie with the farming simulator because I thought it was a cute cow.
7139000	7145000	And I was like, look at me with the farming simulator. All of a sudden I'm getting all these fucking questions. Like, tell us about the game.
7145000	7152000	And I was like, oh shit, people, I did not know in Russia a farming simulator was some serious fucking business, but apparently it is.
7152000	7160000	And to be fair, I'm sure it has a cult following here in the States too. There's enough of a following where they would make those fucking games if there weren't people playing them.
7161000	7173000	But I do also want to point out, since that time, I also got addicted to Euro Truck Simulator, so I understand the sim needs. I've been enlightened since those days of selfies with cows.
7173000	7177000	I think they have Euro Truck Simulator for VR too, so.
7177000	7188000	I'm all about, I'll get it. I'm all about that. It'll be fun. Anyway. Alright, let's move on with some other news. Loki.
7188000	7196000	So this I didn't even see at all at E3, but apparently Rock Band 4 is getting an expansion in October called Rock Band Rivals.
7196000	7211000	And with that they're going to be getting an update, I guess, that allows them to add some support for custom set lists, double kick pedal support, I'm assuming for the drums, and then practice mode as well.
7212000	7225000	And, yeah. I guess that's going to be the last update that they're getting? I don't know. That's what it says.
7225000	7238000	Interesting ploy to get Rock Band through a second holiday season now that the game is more fleshed out and probably where it should have been when it released, but we'll see if that pays off or not.
7239000	7241000	They didn't mention a price though, right?
7241000	7243000	No, they didn't say...
7243000	7250000	See, if it's like a $60 game then they can kind of sit on it, but if it's, you know, like $20 or $25 I might be into that.
7250000	7258000	Yeah, it doesn't really say anything as far as that they're just going to be adding new features in the future, which is vague as hell.
7258000	7259000	Yeah, it is.
7259000	7269000	And then along with that, they're supposed to be having a new guitar. It was apparently based off of, was it a Fender Jaguar?
7270000	7277000	Oh yeah, that was that whole stealthy video they put out before E3 was actually pictures of that controller.
7279000	7282000	Yeah, so it looks neat, I guess. I don't know.
7282000	7286000	If you don't have enough plastic instruments in your house, here's a new one.
7286000	7291000	I like the charger that they have where you can set your guitar in it and it charges it. That's kind of neat.
7291000	7293000	That's pretty cool. I like that.
7293000	7297000	What the hell is that? I have no idea what this thing is.
7297000	7298000	What is it?
7298000	7300000	It's some sort of adapter. Oh, Xbox One.
7300000	7301000	Oh, it's the legacy adapter.
7301000	7306000	It's the wired legacy adapter for Xbox One. So you can plug in your instrument.
7306000	7311000	See, that's really the only way I would do that because I have all the instruments for the 360 and just...
7311000	7315000	Yeah, I mean, I need to have those work before I buy that game.
7315000	7325000	Alright, well, believe it or not, E3 was not the only big thing in tech that happened last week because Apple did one of their keynotes as well.
7325000	7329000	Not as a part of E3, but I think Worldwide Developers Conference was also last week.
7329000	7330000	Every year.
7330000	7335000	Yeah, so there's always the great decision that nerds have to make. Am I going to pay attention to E3?
7335000	7336000	It's an easy decision.
7336000	7337000	Well, it just depends on who you are.
7337000	7345000	But anyway, Apple, as a part of WWDC, did announce iOS 10, which is something that we've been anticipating.
7345000	7350000	But there is a new future in there that is of some importance, I think, to gamers.
7350000	7354000	There's going to be something in iOS 10 called ReplayKit Live.
7354000	7359000	This will allow you to livestream apps in addition to being able to record them.
7359000	7363000	So you can also do your own audio or video remarks.
7363000	7365000	So, of course, you have to wait for this to come out.
7365000	7367000	We don't know the date just yet, just kind of a vague timeframe.
7367000	7372000	But, you know, Apple kind of does things like clockwork in this department, so you can probably take a pretty good guess.
7372000	7376000	And, of course, we have to wait for the apps that support it as well.
7376000	7378000	But this is going to be a pretty big deal.
7378000	7381000	Android folks have been able to do this, I believe, through the Twitch app.
7381000	7386000	So it sounds like iOS is going to be able to do that as well with streaming games.
7387000	7395000	So if Loki wanted to, I suppose, he could go out and stream Pokemon Go and be yelling and screaming when the Charmander runs away.
7395000	7398000	And his little poof of smoke, because Loki didn't catch him.
7398000	7401000	No, I wouldn't be able to because I don't have a fucking iOS device.
7401000	7405000	I have an Android device. Technically, I could probably do that now if I wanted to.
7405000	7407000	Fine, then I'll do it. I'll do it.
7407000	7410000	All right. But there you go. That is something to look forward to in iOS 10.
7410000	7413000	Let's move on to something completely different, Dark Sakura.
7414000	7420000	Well, you know, one of my special loves is finding beta and prototype builds of games.
7420000	7422000	Especially if they don't come out.
7422000	7424000	So any EA game? I'm sorry.
7426000	7428000	So this one especially makes me happy.
7428000	7434000	It's put out by someone who owned a Dreamcast developer kit.
7434000	7443000	And found a build of a cancelled Echo the Dolphin Defender of the Future sequel called Echo 2 Sentinels of the Universe.
7443000	7447000	The ROM has already been uploaded. Some of the levels are playable.
7447000	7450000	They are missing, you know, there's no audio.
7450000	7455000	They're missing, you know, textures and certain interactive elements.
7455000	7458000	But the game was well underway.
7458000	7463000	And it actually comes from the Katana Dreamcast development kit.
7464000	7469000	So it's pretty neat. The ROM is available.
7469000	7476000	You can actually find the link to it from I believe that the site is called Hidden Palace.
7476000	7480000	If you go to HiddenPalace.org, there is a lot of information on it there.
7480000	7485000	So Echo fans, go get it. Go play. Maybe finish it.
7485000	7486000	Finish it.
7491000	7492000	Alright.
7492000	7499000	There's some more details coming out regarding Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 and 3.
7499000	7501000	I can't keep track of these fucking numbers.
7501000	7503000	I mean, I don't know what the hell this is.
7503000	7505000	The trailer looked neat.
7505000	7506000	I have not played.
7506000	7510000	See, they really need to come out of the collection of all the Kingdom Hearts games for like Playstation 4.
7510000	7512000	Then I can go back and actually play them.
7512000	7514000	Because I have no fucking clue.
7514000	7518000	I played one, but it was so long ago, like, I don't remember it.
7519000	7521000	And I haven't played any of the other ones.
7521000	7523000	And I can't keep track of that story.
7523000	7529000	But apparently, I guess, they're saying that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep 0.2, a fragmentary passage.
7530000	7532000	Subtitle crazy, yo.
7534000	7540000	They basically said that they can alter the game pretty easily now because of the Unreal Engine 4.
7540000	7542000	And they've improved the lighting.
7542000	7544000	They were saying that...
7544000	7546000	I guess...
7547000	7552000	I was kind of going into details regarding the game, so I'm trying to see if I can get a brief summary here.
7553000	7562000	Basically, they said the intended play order of the games, according to this, is Dream Drop Distance, and then a fragmentary passage, and then Kingdom Hearts 3.
7562000	7564000	And...
7564000	7571000	Basically, they said that the fragmentary passage is not entirely scrapped content from Kingdom Hearts 3.
7571000	7575000	It was something that they felt they needed to make before Kingdom Hearts 3.
7577000	7582000	Was I the only one this whole time up until like two weeks ago when the E3 madness started?
7582000	7587000	I thought that 2.8 was going to be 1 and 2, but on the Playstation 4.
7587000	7591000	And so I was kind of disappointed when I found out, oh, it's just the 3DS one.
7591000	7594000	Except for the fact that means it'll have the Tron Legacy level, which I guess is awesome.
7595000	7598000	Yeah, and they did show that in the trailer, but yeah, I'm kind of with you.
7599000	7603000	The way they numbered this shit with all the stuff, I don't fucking know what content's in here.
7603000	7604000	Just put out a goddamn collection.
7604000	7606000	Can't they just put out the Kingdom Hearts buffet?
7606000	7608000	Here's all the fucking games.
7608000	7611000	Yeah, I get it. 2.8 and 0.2 equals 3.
7611000	7615000	And a 12 volume encyclopedia explaining the story.
7615000	7619000	Exactly. I don't fucking know. Just tell me, okay, here's the game.
7619000	7624000	We're going to order all the fucking chapters of the game. Just play these in order. You'll get the storyline. Done.
7624000	7626000	Thank you. That's all I need.
7626000	7630000	But like this, I don't understand this. Like, I don't know what to buy. I don't know what to play.
7630000	7632000	I don't know the fucking story.
7632000	7636000	Is Sora still in it? I mean, is there a Mickey game?
7636000	7637000	Yeah.
7637000	7639000	I don't know. I don't know who these people are.
7640000	7641000	Yeah.
7641000	7642000	Alright.
7642000	7643000	I think Cloud gets in there at some point.
7643000	7646000	Isn't he a bad guy at one time? I don't know. Sephiroth?
7647000	7652000	I want to just quickly, before I move on to the next story, you know, we have a live chat room.
7652000	7658000	So part of doing this show is that sometimes you get live updates on not just gaming things, but things that happen in the real world.
7658000	7662000	And we were just talking about this earlier, about the whole tragic death of Anton Yelchin.
7662000	7666000	And there's an update here from Stoppy in our chat room.
7666000	7670000	And I thought this was worth mentioning with what we were talking about, Dark Sakura, with the whole negligence.
7670000	7673000	It might not have been based on this report.
7673000	7682000	Apparently, Jalopnik is saying the car that killed him might have been the subject of a recall having a faulty gear selector.
7682000	7699000	In mid-April, Jeep recalled 1.1 million vehicles equipped with 8-speed automatic transmission because, according to the automaker's recall notice, some drivers exited their vehicles without first selecting park, ultimately causing the cars to roll away uncontrollably.
7699000	7702000	Why would it be in neutral, though?
7702000	7708000	I don't know, but if something was wrong with the gear selector, it might have got stuck there on the way back.
7708000	7716000	Anyway, again, that report coming from Jalopnik, I'm sure we're going to be hearing a lot more in the coming days, but ain't that going to be something if it ends up...
7716000	7721000	If that is the case, then we're looking at an even bigger deal.
7721000	7727000	Well, I mean, maybe like I know a lot of the cars, you can't take the key out of the ignition unless it's in park.
7727000	7730000	Maybe it's allowing you to take the key out of the ignition for some reason.
7730000	7731000	Who knows?
7731000	7734000	I mean, my car doesn't let you take the key out if it's not in park.
7734000	7737000	So we're going to hear a lot about this in the coming days, I'm sure.
7737000	7742000	There's going to be a lot more than just, you know, because people are going to want answers.
7742000	7759000	Anyhow, I know that was not directly gaming-related, but y'all are nerds, and I know even if you didn't want to admit you saw it, you all went and saw the new Star Trek films, and despite how you felt about the movies, that kid did a great job playing in those movies.
7759000	7762000	So, he was a lot of fun to watch.
7762000	7767000	Alright, let's move on to some more gaming...
7767000	7770000	Actually, this is the part where we would do the mailbag.
7770000	7775000	Participate at orangeloungerator.com is the place to send emails.
7775000	7781000	However, my understanding is that Dark Sakura went into the emailbag, and what did you find, Dark Sakura?
7781000	7783000	Jack shit.
7785000	7787000	Wasn't there a story, mister?
7787000	7789000	Did we miss a story?
7789000	7792000	Oh, I was supposed to do a story, I'm sorry, I'll get to that.
7792000	7798000	Boy, we're failing on all sorts of levels tonight, but the emailbag tonight is empty.
7802000	7806000	And I failed at reading my story in a timely manner.
7806000	7818000	Anyway, so, in lieu of the emailbag, why don't we talk about Microsoft and Steam and their relationship here?
7818000	7824000	Oh, hey, that reminds me, I mean, completely unrelated, but now that we thought we had all the game show stuff...
7824000	7829000	I love how you just fucking read me for not doing my story! I open my mouth and I start to do the story.
7829000	7833000	Oh, hey, I'm gonna derail you with this random fucking thought I had!
7833000	7836000	Okay, and it's been like 14 years and this is a surprise, come on.
7836000	7838000	Aren't quesadillas delicious?
7838000	7846000	No, what I was gonna say is, you know, I'm sure you've heard that the match game's coming back, right?
7846000	7850000	That I, okay, that is worth talking about. Yes, I have heard that it's coming back.
7850000	7859000	It debuts, if I'm not mistaken, the same night, or no, no, no, the Celebrity Family Feud and the Pyramid start the same, like, it's gonna be a Sunday night thing.
7859000	7861000	But I don't think the match game's a part of that, right?
7862000	7867000	The Pyramid is the guy that just left Kelly Michael Stram.
7867000	7869000	No, not Pyramid, I'm talking about match game.
7869000	7871000	Alec Baldwin.
7871000	7872000	That's right, yes, yes.
7872000	7880000	Which is, it's a little weird for me, but I have to see an emotion. I mean, honestly, it kinda doesn't matter who hosts the show, it's really about who are the mainstay panelists.
7880000	7882000	I wanna see who the panelists are.
7882000	7891000	Yeah, I know that TBS piloted one, complete with the 70s retro set, and one of the standing panelists was supposed to be Sarah Silverman.
7891000	7900000	And I understand she's controversial, and I understand that not everybody likes her, but I think she would have been pretty fucking hilarious on that show.
7901000	7911000	I can't remember who the other standing, you know, usually there's a few that are standing, like Charles Nelson Reilly back in the day, and what Richard Dawson was on it all the fucking time.
7911000	7918000	Brett, not Brett Butler. What was her name? Brett Summers, was that her name?
7918000	7919000	I don't remember.
7919000	7925000	Damn it. Brett Butler was the one that was on Grace Under Fire. What's she doing? I guess she could be a match game panelist.
7925000	7927000	But, yeah.
7927000	7928000	Alright, sorry.
7928000	7937000	No, that's okay. I was excited. I thought we were gonna talk about Casa Diaz. Alright, let's talk about Xbox and Steam.
7937000	7950000	Apparently, there was some talk about what's going on, and this was during a giant bomb livestream that was going on where Phil Spencer was on, talking about Microsoft kinda going back into the, growing, I guess, in the PC gaming space.
7950000	7957000	And they actually talked about Steam, which is interesting because Windows typically has tried to push their own platform, right?
7957000	7969000	So Phil Spencer did comment on this, and I gotta say, Phil Spencer does do a really good job handling the press and the media and kinda showing that he is a gamer that kinda gets it, unlike the guy before him.
7969000	7978000	But anyway, Phil Spencer did mention, I look at Steam today, it's on an incredible growth trajectory. It's a massive force in gaming, a positive force.
7978000	7983000	I think it will be bigger a year from now than it is today, and five years later it will still be bigger again.
7983000	7990000	I look at Valve as an important independent software vendor for us on Windows. They are a critical part of gaming success on Windows.
7990000	7998000	I don't think Valve's hurt by not having our first party games in their store right now. They're doing well. We will ship games on Steam again.
7998000	8003000	Hmm. And then he actually went on to say, talk about some of the shortcomings of the Windows Store.
8003000	8010000	They all haven't gone swimmingly. Some of them have gone well. Forza 6, Apex did well. Quantum Break wasn't our best PC release.
8010000	8015000	Killer Instinct did well on PC. Gears of War Ultimate Edition was okay. We definitely learned there.
8015000	8021000	And then one more comment on Steam here. There's gonna be areas where we cooperate and there's gonna be areas where we compete.
8021000	8025000	The end result is better for gamers. Ain't that the truth?
8025000	8037000	I like hearing Phil Spencer and hearing him talk. Even when I don't always agree with what Microsoft does, I think it's in a much better place now under Phil Spencer than it was previously.
8037000	8049000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week. Since I've messed up the flow of this show so bad, what better way to get things back on track than releasing a little angst?
8049000	8074000	FU to trying hard. Sometimes you try and it's just not good enough. So, fuck it.
8075000	8077000	Um, Loki.
8077000	8087000	Um, FU to the dinner place I went to, the Tofu. I don't even know, some Tofu place. Tofu is in the title. I should have really just said, uh, nope. Not going there.
8087000	8089000	Loki, what the hell were you thinking?
8089000	8090000	I don't know what I was thinking.
8090000	8091000	At least you got a Slurpee.
8091000	8096000	I did get a Slurpee. That was the best part. I should get another Slurpee on my way home. That's really shit.
8096000	8099000	They have banana flavor. That's my fucking favorite.
8099000	8103000	Uh, I don't remember a banana with cherry coke.
8103000	8107000	If you see banana, I want a text message. Banana's my favorite.
8107000	8109000	Blue raspberry. They may have banana.
8109000	8112000	Alright. That's it.
8112000	8117000	Uh, Misty. Since you're here, join in. FU. What do you want to say FU to?
8117000	8122000	I will agree with Jameis somewhat, especially when it comes to people's opinions of what you're doing.
8122000	8128000	Just fuck it. Do what you're going to do as long as it's not going to screw your health over or something like that.
8128000	8135000	Do whatever you- or infringing on somebody else. Do whatever the hell you want to do unless you're going to, you know, piss off somebody else.
8135000	8136000	Basically.
8136000	8141000	Alright. Uh, and then my FU of the week goes to, I think just kind of like, stress.
8141000	8145000	I just, oh my god, like, every little thing has been taking me off today.
8145000	8154000	I don't know if I'm just, like, having, um, the 90 day male PMS thing or what it is, but I swear to god, every little thing's been taking me off today.
8154000	8158000	And it's just been non-stop, so I think it's just all stress. So FU distress.
8158000	8164000	Alright, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys, and we're going to get to the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.
8164000	8167000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8167000	8170000	Uh, but before we get there, just a couple quick stories. Loki.
8170000	8177000	Alright, um, so, you may remember there was that game, Allison Rowe, we talked about how it was cancelled.
8177000	8182000	Um, you know, basically it was like this, almost like an answer to PT.
8182000	8187000	However, you know, they were sitting, they were going to discuss why it was cancelled.
8187000	8191000	It doesn't really answer anything. Basically, their comment was, you know,
8191000	8202000	after long consideration between Team17 and ourselves, we have reached a mutual agreement to end our collaboration on publishing Allison Rowe under Team17's games label.
8202000	8209000	Um, sometimes things pan out differently than expected as game development and publishing have so many layers of complexity.
8210000	8217000	We'd like to especially thank everyone for their support throughout, and this has and always will be appreciated.
8219000	8221000	Okay, then what the hell does that mean?
8221000	8228000	What the hell kind of explanation was that? Sometimes mommy and daddy get very angry at each other and say things they don't mean.
8228000	8232000	Like, what the hell kind of explanation was that? That was weird.
8232000	8239000	Yeah, so it's like, uh, does that mean you're going to still make it?
8239000	8245000	I'm worried Resident Evil 7's not going to come out because it's too close to PT and that fucking game is cursed.
8245000	8246000	Swear to God.
8246000	8250000	Yeah, Dark Tetsuya in chat says, well, at least we have Resident Evil 7 to look forward to.
8250000	8253000	Look out. Be careful.
8254000	8262000	Well, something you do have to look forward to, if nothing else, is the console release of Stardew Valley.
8262000	8267000	That game, I still don't understand why Dark Sakura isn't playing because I do think she'd be a big fan of this, but we'll see.
8267000	8271000	Stardew Valley, I was waiting for a witty retort.
8271000	8277000	Stardew Valley was confirmed during E3 week. It's not like the game was there, but it was confirmed during E3 week.
8277000	8282000	Well, actually, I did see it at one of the press conferences, so maybe they had it on one of the kiosks on the show floor.
8282000	8285000	It was listed, it was under the Xbox Indie Games, I want to say.
8285000	8286000	Ah.
8286000	8290000	They showed that, because they also showed, uh, um, was it We Happy Few?
8290000	8300000	Yeah. So, Stardew Valley was confirmed. It will be coming to the Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, and the Wii U.
8300000	8311000	So, Stardew Valley will be getting some help with the ports from Chucklefish and Sick Head Games, and the game is expected to be out in the winter holiday season, although they don't say a specific date.
8311000	8315000	But, the author did say in his blog post that he posted on this,
8315000	8322000	I'm also excited about the possibility of utilizing special console features like the Wii U's second screen.
8322000	8329000	I hope he, this is one of those games that would really benefit with the whole, like, inventory management and stuff from a second screen,
8329000	8337000	so I really hope he's able to do what Minecraft could not do by actually implementing the second screen.
8337000	8340000	So, uh, Loki, have you checked out Stardew Valley at all?
8340000	8341000	Nope.
8341000	8342000	You really should. You guys are-
8342000	8343000	Nope.
8343000	8344000	Fail, fail, fail.
8344000	8351000	Okay, uh, well anyway, that's going to do it for the scripted news tonight, but it is about time for us to open up the Skype line.
8351000	8357000	That's right, it's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls on anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we missed.
8357000	8358000	I don't know.
8358000	8359000	Skype line is open now.
8359000	8363000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8363000	8367000	Please make sure you've tested your connection with Echo 123 before you give us a call.
8367000	8370000	That is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8370000	8374000	And, well, it's lighting up already, so let's get to it.
8374000	8376000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8376000	8377000	It's Shane.
8377000	8379000	Well, hi, Shane, how are you?
8379000	8380000	I'm fine.
8380000	8383000	I feel like it's been a long time since we've heard from you. How's Ranger Pridecast going?
8383000	8387000	Uh, I'm sure it's okay. I haven't been on the last week, so.
8387000	8388000	Well, uh-
8388000	8391000	I need to mute my TV, because I don't want to hear me through the TV.
8391000	8395000	That's, yeah, you should probably, the first rule of calling into a radio show is to mute your radio.
8395000	8400000	I was busy playing Pokemon, so I didn't care to follow these rules.
8400000	8401000	That's no excuse.
8401000	8406000	And I know you were out of town last week, and I'd mentioned to the listeners, you unfortunately were in Orlan-
8406000	8413000	Well, I mean, you were in Orlando when everything happened there, but you were nowhere near that mess, thank heavens.
8413000	8421000	Yeah, three days of death is basically what I went into Orlando with, I guess, so it's not great.
8421000	8425000	Uh, yeah, there's not been a lot of good news coming out of Orlando, that's for sure.
8425000	8431000	But anyway, let's go on to happier things to take our mind off of all that craziness going on.
8431000	8433000	Video games, what'd you think of E3?
8433000	8437000	Um, you mean the Pokemon Sun and Moon show? It was pretty good.
8437000	8441000	So, let me guess, you called in tonight to talk about Pokemon Sun and Moon?
8441000	8443000	That is my first topic.
8443000	8446000	Alright, well, what would you like to say about Pokemon Sun and Moon?
8446000	8456000	Besides the fact that it looks amazing, I think that for the first time, probably since, I don't know, probably the first time period,
8456000	8467000	I think they're really doing a great job of making the entire game more accessible to people who are not as maybe into it.
8467000	8479000	And don't follow the sites to look up strategies for battling, or just have a very vague understanding of how Pokemon works.
8479000	8488000	I think this entry is really allowing a newer, bigger audience to come in and join the fun that we all have.
8488000	8491000	Why is that? What is it about this game compared to the others?
8492000	8503000	Well, originally, for the first six generations, if you are fighting a Pokemon, you know, you kind of should have an understanding of some sort of like, you know, the weaknesses to the elements.
8503000	8508000	Like if you are a water type Pokemon that you're using, it's going to be strong against fire.
8508000	8519000	Well, that's basically all you kind of know, unless you're like constantly looking up things on the internet about, you know, each move and all this.
8519000	8526000	Well, now what they're doing is not only, you know, if you look that up, you'll know that information.
8526000	8534000	But if you battle, say, like if I'm Popplio, because that's what I'm going to be is Popplio, and I'm fighting Litten.
8534000	8537000	Well, I know that my water attacks can be strong against it.
8537000	8547000	But now when I select that move after the first time I've battled against Litten, I will see on that move, it'll say it is super effective.
8547000	8553000	So no longer will you have to go back and forth trying to remember things like that. It's going to list it for you.
8553000	8559000	And another great thing is during the stream, Popplio leveled up and learned a fairy move.
8559000	8563000	Well, that's a newer, you know, typing that came out last generation.
8563000	8568000	And it's not good against fire. And it showed right there underneath it, not very effective.
8568000	8574000	So you know what moves are going to be, you know, strong against the Pokemon that you're fighting or weak.
8574000	8577000	They probably just figure everyone's going on the internet anyway.
8577000	8584000	Well, yeah, probably. But if you don't have access to the internet, what if you're on like a plane ride and you forget?
8584000	8593000	Another great thing that they've kind of streamlined is the fact that during the battles, without having to go through extra screens,
8593000	8598000	you can select each move and find out exactly how strong it is and what it does.
8598000	8605000	And they have a way instead of writing down on paper that I see all the time when I watch the video game tournaments,
8605000	8610000	they have a little icon of your character on the bottom screen that you touch.
8610000	8616000	And if you have any status effects, like if your speed has been lowered or if you gained attack power, it's going to show it there.
8616000	8625000	So that's brand new as well. And it just looks gorgeous. And I love all the new Pokemon and I want to collect them all.
8625000	8629000	Even the basic Pokemon that are in the game you're excited about?
8629000	8636000	Yeah, like, like Yungoos and the little, like, Donald Trump looking mongoose there.
8636000	8642000	No, okay, there's some, like, there's some parody Twitter account out there that already followed me.
8642000	8651000	That has to be a listener of this show because they tweeted something about it, but it's actually like a Yungoos that is like parodying Trump.
8651000	8655000	Yeah, I just blocked it. I didn't really care. That's annoying.
8655000	8659000	You already blocked, but it's Pokemon, Shane. Why did you block it?
8659000	8666000	If you're going to be annoying with Pokemon, I don't like you. So I'm not going to listen to you or talk to you.
8666000	8667000	You're so mean.
8667000	8676000	I just love that the 40 minute demo, the person playing had Popplio as his Pokemon. Like, this is, this is made for me.
8676000	8678000	I love it. It's so cute.
8678000	8681000	What about, um, what about Pokemon Go? How are you feeling about that?
8681000	8687000	Um, I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm still not in the beta, whatever. I don't care anymore.
8687000	8694000	I preordered my little Go attachment because I just feel like that's going to be beneficial.
8694000	8705000	And I'm interested in seeing how it's going to connect to Sun and Moon because during that presentation, they did say that there is planned connectivity somewhere down the line.
8705000	8711000	And it is not your Pokemon going between the two games. Get that fanfic out of your head right now because the two games...
8711000	8714000	I wouldn't want it. It's just Gen 1 Pokemon cares about them.
8714000	8721000	It's stuff I've been seeing on the Pokemon Go Reddit and stuff is just like, get that fanfic out of your head that is not happening because that would just, that's way too imbalanced.
8721000	8730000	The Pokemon in Pokemon Go, so I've heard, are a lot different than the Pokemon in the games. Like, as far as stats go and how you level them and all that stuff.
8731000	8736000	Yeah, I wouldn't even see a point in that to be quite honest. If it unlocks random little things, that's cool.
8736000	8746000	Yeah, that would be cool. Items or a secret little lair or something. I don't know. Something silly. Maybe like, Flare for your Pokemon Go profile or something. Who knows?
8746000	8747000	Yeah, that works.
8747000	8750000	Was that it or was there something else you wanted to talk about?
8750000	8760000	So the other thing is gaming related but not video game related. While I was gone, I played in this thing called an escape room.
8760000	8769000	I've never even really heard of them before but apparently they're all over the place and you have 60 minutes, you're locked in a room and you solve puzzles to get out.
8769000	8774000	And it is literally the coolest thing I've ever done.
8774000	8775000	Really?
8775000	8782000	I had such a good time. If you like puzzles and thinking, then you're just going to get a huge kick out of it.
8782000	8792000	The first one that me and my boyfriend did, we were in an art gallery, this very small art gallery and the theme was a heist.
8792000	8798000	And somebody had stolen a painting and we had to, it was currently being hidden there and we had to get it and get out.
8799000	8806000	So we're in this little room, there's just like six paintings on the wall and a barred door and we're like, we don't, we didn't really know what to do.
8806000	8812000	And time's ticking away and then you start like reading the placards and they lead to clues that are in the painting, like really small numbers.
8812000	8819000	At some point, we actually unlock the door next to us, which opens up into another room with all these different things.
8819000	8824000	And the coolest part of that one that we played, we played too, because we had so much fun the first time.
8824000	8829000	But the coolest part of that one was we had this number and we didn't know what to do with it.
8829000	8833000	There were no more locks that we could like twist to, you know, put the number in.
8833000	8843000	But he found this keypad on this bookcase and he put the number in the keypad and we hear a click and then we could slide the entire bookcase.
8843000	8848000	And this bookcase is big. It's like takes up half a wall, but we slid it over into another room with bars.
8848000	8853000	And that was so awesome. Like it just blew my mind that things like this exist.
8853000	8858000	Yeah. And actually a lot of people in chat are like, oh yeah, they got one in my town or what have you.
8858000	8862000	And yeah, these things are kind of like a trend across America right now. They're all over. I haven't done one myself yet.
8862000	8868000	And, you know, it's kind of one of those things I always saw and kind of went, oh, that could either be like really awesome or really freaking lame.
8868000	8875000	But you were, you were really excited about that. I mean, you said it's the coolest thing you've ever done and you hang out with me a lot and I'm really cool.
8875000	8878000	So this is cooler than that. Wow.
8878000	8882000	I just, I don't know what to say to that. That's a big ego.
8882000	8888000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they had one of these in the middle of the gaming floor at MomoCon.
8888000	8891000	So now this is the type of thing they bring to conventions and stuff, too.
8891000	8896000	I don't see that's that's my problem, though, is that this one is the first one I did.
8896000	8902000	And what I liked so much about it was that we were not even that's an escape room game.
8902000	8907000	Our rooms had multiple rooms attached to them to, you know, to go through.
8907000	8914000	The second one we did, it was me and Bobby and then these three other people, this family.
8914000	8922000	And the thing was like we had to escape from prison. So me and Bobby are in a jail cell and there's a wall dividing us and the other team who are also in a jail cell.
8922000	8929000	We had to work to get out of that to get into a boiler room to slide down a freaking slide into the warden's office.
8929000	8936000	So it's it's not just one room, but all these other places I'm hearing are like, oh, yeah, we just stick you in a room and you have to figure out all these puzzles.
8937000	8942000	I don't know. That doesn't feel like as cool to me. Well, I wanted to expand.
8942000	8947000	Orlando is the theme park capital of the world, so they kind of have to step their game up. You know what I mean?
8947000	8952000	Well, and this is in other places. I do have a couple in Sacramento, actually.
8952000	8957000	Yeah, there are some I know there's one right by the sushi place that that Shane and I've gone to several times.
8957000	8965000	There's one like literally right in that same shopping center. And then I imagine like didn't this whole trend start in the Bay Area in like San Francisco?
8965000	8969000	So I imagine San Francisco has to have some bang up escape rooms.
8969000	8976000	There's actually because I looked on Yelp last night or Jim did Flaco Jones.
8976000	8985000	And there's one here in my town of Elk Grove. And it's got the highest ratings of like all the local ones, all Sacramento, Roseville, all the our entire area.
8985000	8989000	Interesting. So, yeah, Bobby, I need to do it.
8989000	8995000	Bobby saying there's two of them in Atlanta. Oh, when I come out for Dragon Con, Bobby, I'll be fine, wouldn't it?
8995000	9002000	You know, you say that and I say that because I think it's really fun. But the problem is with these games is you have to have the right temperament for it.
9002000	9008000	You can't get frustrated easily. Are you saying are you saying that I might snap at Bobby Black?
9008000	9013000	Oh, I said I said that to you already. You'd snap at anybody. I don't know how you would do in these.
9013000	9022000	And like, as I found out when we were working with our team, if you've got somebody who's kind of bossy and thinks that they need to take charge, that's a hindrance as well.
9022000	9026000	I would never crazy. I would never do that.
9026000	9032000	All right. If that's what you think, we'll go with that, even though we know better.
9032000	9037000	All right. So I know the escape room concept is kind of interesting. It's like IRL type of stuff.
9037000	9043000	It's like video games IRL and a lot of I think I haven't done like phone apps and stuff to try to capture some of that same magic.
9043000	9047000	I'm sure it's not the same thing, though, because you're not like sliding an actual bookcase across the wall and all that stuff.
9047000	9055000	Yeah, I think there are things like that. And I you know, maybe I try them because I like figuring out puzzles so much.
9055000	9065000	Oh, one of the other cool things about the one that we did with the wall that slid, we also had to put together a puzzle randomly, but we couldn't find all the pieces.
9065000	9072000	And it actually like when you put it all together, it was like a riddle. So we had to figure out that puzzle without having all the pieces.
9072000	9077000	I was like, oh, God. But I got out because we beat we beat both of them, which was awesome.
9077000	9082000	So, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says escape rooms are the new team building exercise.
9082000	9087000	My girlfriend is doing one with her company in a few weeks. I've heard of that being used in like a corporate world, too.
9087000	9093000	How do they get you in the room? Do they say, here's this jail cell for you to walk into? Like what? How do they get you in there?
9093000	9104000	Well, the one that we went to, I see you're going in of your own volition, but it's just like a long hallway and all the doors on the outside.
9104000	9109000	They just look normal, look like normal doors. So they're just like, OK, you go in this room for the jail.
9109000	9114000	And they told us to go in one room and the other team or the other people go in the other room and then you get in there.
9114000	9122000	It's like, oh, this looks like, you know, a really run down prison cell. They did a really good job.
9122000	9127000	Interesting. OK. All right. All right. Well, I'm going to let you go so we can try to get more calls.
9127000	9136000	But thanks for the call. That was. Yeah, I feel like we do need to do an escape room, but I feel like it's only fun if I'm allowed to somehow livestream it or broadcast it.
9136000	9141000	But I feel like you're never going to be able to do one because when you're in there, they don't let you use your phone at all.
9141000	9146000	Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure they don't like it's it's probably they probably watch you, too, huh?
9146000	9153000	Oh, yeah, yeah, because I actually tonight I called the one here in Elk Grove and I just asked some questions about it, like some escape rooms.
9153000	9159000	I guess they have the people like I don't know if you want to call them like monitors or whatever, but the person running the game for you.
9159000	9167000	Sometimes they're in the room, which I think is weird and awkward. But like the one I did and apparently this one here, they actually have cameras in there that they watch you from.
9167000	9174000	We didn't want you to wreck their shit either, you know. So, yeah, but they also can help you out with clues, like if you're stuck, they can see why you're stuck and give you a clue.
9174000	9181000	Interesting. Huh. All right. Well, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before I get convinced to go to one of these.
9181000	9184000	And I'm sure you'll call right back to tell everybody what a horrible bitch I was.
9184000	9188000	Oh, yeah. I'll be like, we didn't beat it because Rob threw a fit.
9188000	9192000	I just sat in the middle of the floor and refused to keep going.
9192000	9195000	Just lock me in here forever, you son of a bitch.
9195000	9199000	No, you'll just pout in the corner because nobody's listening to you.
9200000	9204000	Oh, Rob, I don't know. I'd rather do an escape room with like you than some random mofo.
9204000	9207000	That's true. Who do you want, me or a random mofo?
9207000	9216000	I don't know, because when we had the parents that were older and the girl with the broken leg, which was not helpful when we had to slide down a slide.
9216000	9218000	Don't be inconsiderate.
9218000	9221000	Well, she was inconsiderate to break her leg.
9222000	9228000	Like, they were a hindrance. They were an extra layer of difficulty on top of the difficulty we already had to work with.
9228000	9233000	So, you'd just be like, you'd up the difficulty by five because you were there.
9233000	9238000	Alright, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls. We'll let people know how it goes. Alright, bye.
9238000	9239000	Bye.
9239000	9244000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, if you want to do it the old fashioned way, or Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9244000	9246000	But our phones are lighting up, so let's get back to it.
9246000	9248000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9248000	9250000	Hey, this is Stoppy. How are you guys doing?
9250000	9252000	Hey, good. Hi, good to hear from you, Stoppy. What's up?
9252000	9258000	Hey, not much. I was just going to tell you guys that I went to the Sony Playstation Experience that was in theaters.
9258000	9261000	Oh, okay, cool. How was that whole setup?
9261000	9268000	It was a total circus. Just to get there, there was nothing in my city. There were no theaters in my city that were hosting it.
9268000	9276000	So, I had to go one that was like over 250 miles away because I'm a total Sony pony, so I went ahead and did that.
9276000	9282000	Is that the name? Wait, the Sony Pony? Do you guys call each other Sony Bronies, too?
9282000	9287000	We should, we should. Just condense it all to one thing, I guess.
9287000	9288000	Why not?
9288000	9299000	Yeah, so it was a nightmare to get up there, but I actually did like the show, and it was really interesting to see the show with all sorts of fans and people around you.
9299000	9304000	Because, you know how it started with that whole melodramatic orchestra and all that kind of shit?
9304000	9305000	Yeah.
9305000	9311000	Well, at home, I would have expected that people are like, oh wow, this is a really impressive performance.
9311000	9318000	But in theaters, we were all laughing at that. We could not stop cracking up. We were like, are these guys serious? What the hell?
9318000	9323000	So, it was kind of like a combination of E3 and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
9323000	9331000	Exactly, exactly. Yeah, that's a good way of thinking of it. But yeah, it was just absolutely hilarious right there at the beginning.
9331000	9337000	People were just making fun of it the whole way through. But it was really fun, and there were definitely people who were shocked at certain announcements.
9337000	9344000	And it was just interesting to see the whole crowd, how they reacted to certain things. I had never seen something like that before.
9344000	9351000	Did they give you any freebies or anything to take with you, so you could show the world that you're a Sony Pony?
9351000	9360000	Yeah, yeah. They gave us this cup, which I guess you could get a drink for, but since a lot of us are just nerds, we just collected them and didn't even fill it up.
9360000	9369000	But then also like a poster, a card, which I have no clue what you're supposed to do with it. It's like this collectible card. I don't know, if anybody wants mine, just get in touch with me.
9369000	9373000	What did the cup say? Microsoft Tears?
9373000	9380000	It said, no, it was like E3 experience. It just looked like a really cheap cup that you could get anywhere.
9380000	9387000	And it's not something I would ever want people to see, so they know my shame of being such a fanboy.
9387000	9395000	Then they also gave you a digital code, so you could get, I think it was like $10 in Playstation credit, which is pretty cool.
9395000	9400000	And a whole bunch of other stuff, like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, all this other stuff.
9400000	9405000	Okay, I like that. It's kind of like you get a little bit of that gas money back you spent.
9405000	9408000	Exactly, exactly. I wish.
9408000	9415000	It was the same problem here. If I wanted to go, I would have had to drive to the Bay Area, which I can't have a 9 to 5 and do that.
9415000	9423000	It was fine. Shane and I just sat in the living room and watched it. Kind of a lot of the same thing.
9423000	9431000	We would talk with each other like, oh, is Guillermo del Toro's name going to come up next? How did Norman Reedus' ass go over?
9431000	9436000	Oh, I'm glad that you asked that, because someone right next to me was this couple.
9436000	9444000	And you could tell that it was a guy like me who just dragged his girlfriend over, and she was like, oh my God, when is this fucking thing going to end?
9444000	9452000	So she was quiet the whole time, and I could kind of tell out of the core of my eye that she was looking at a lot of this like, what the hell am I looking at?
9452000	9457000	Why are people going crazy for this bearded guy who's bald and that sort of thing?
9457000	9465000	But then once you got to Norman Reedus, she instantly sparked to life right away. I was like, what the hell?
9465000	9472000	Yeah, he was a big fan amongst many people over there, so yeah.
9472000	9482000	That's awesome. That sounds like you had a good time. What did you personally enjoy out of Sony's conference? What got you hyped? What got your hype to maximum levels?
9482000	9492000	I got to say, aside from Kojima's game, maybe the Spider-Man by Insomniac game, because I have been such a fan of just the Spider-Man games, because it's really weird.
9492000	9500000	I'm not a fan of the movies or the comics, but I'm more of a fan of him as a video game character, because I love a lot of the video games they used to come out with.
9500000	9508000	Some of them are here in this, but this one, it seems like it is going to be a hit. So if they could just recapture what they did with Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox I think it was on,
9509000	9516000	then it's just going to blow everything away, because that is such a good game, and I trust Insomniac that they could get it right.
9516000	9523000	No chance to do the VR thing though, right? Even though they didn't have VRs, I guess probably not.
9523000	9530000	No, I wish, I wish, but no, it was just a wham bam thank you ma'am thing. They just got you in there, got you out, and then that's it.
9530000	9532000	I guess I better drive home.
9532000	9533000	Exactly.
9533000	9540000	So how does the Sony Pony feel about what, because now that's going to be your name, Stoppy the Sony Pony.
9540000	9546000	How does the Sony Pony feel about what Microsoft and Nintendo brought this year?
9546000	9555000	I thought that Microsoft's conference was pretty competent. I kind of felt that the Xbox One S or whatever it's called,
9555000	9562000	I was a little disappointed because it was already revealed beforehand. It was already leaked, so I wasn't really impressed with that.
9562000	9571000	But as far as some of their other stuff, I thought Sea of Thieves was really interesting, but the people that they got to record with it were by far the most unbearable people on the planet.
9571000	9579000	But Nintendo, they were okay, but again it was what you expected. It was what, Zelda, then Pokemon, big surprise.
9580000	9595000	And Zelda's okay, but it just doesn't look like my kind of game. Like I said earlier in the chat, I'm going to need other stuff to get me to get an NX if I get an NX because just having Zelda isn't going to cut it for me. I'd rather just borrow it off a friend if it's just going to be for that alone.
9596000	9604000	Alright, some of our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com. YYR is suggesting, I hope his real name is Tony so he can be Sony Pony Tony.
9604000	9606000	No, unfortunately not.
9606000	9616000	I'm sad to report I can see his name on Skype and it is not Tony. In fact, it doesn't rhyme at all, so sorry about that. But maybe there is a Sony Pony named Tony out there somewhere.
9616000	9619000	If so, I'll take that domain.
9619000	9620000	Alright.
9620000	9621000	Love it.
9621000	9623000	Alright, yeah, go ahead.
9623000	9634000	No, no, one last thing. Also Grow Up, I'm so glad that they, no I'm not telling that to the chat, but no, the game Grow Up, I'm so glad that they announced that because I was a big fan of Grow Home.
9634000	9641000	And it's like my go-to chill game. It's like my Soma. That's why I just plug in so I can just tune out and enjoy myself for a while.
9641000	9653000	But I'm so glad they got a sequel because a lot of these indie games, they're so great, but they're just not getting sequels. I don't know if the publishers don't think there's a demand there or if the companies just don't have the money.
9653000	9664000	But I'm so glad that this one's getting a sequel because I remember finishing that game and I was like, I just wish there was more. It's one of those games where I don't want any improvements, I just want more. And now I'm going to get more. So I'm very happy for that.
9664000	9676000	Yeah, thank you for bringing that to attention because there's a lot of other stuff that was announced too that sometimes doesn't get the spotlight. But yeah, that's part of the reason I play games like Diablo and Path of Exile and all that stuff.
9676000	9687000	For me, those are kind of like my chill games. Click, click, click, get loot, enjoy. It's very zen. Minecraft I think is a very zen game in my opinion. That's how I approach it.
9687000	9692000	Alright, well, Tony the Stony Pony. Stony Pony, Stony Pony.
9692000	9695000	You're trying to incriminate me now, okay? I'm going to get raided by now.
9695000	9701000	Alright, well I appreciate the call. Thank you very much for calling in and telling us about the Sony experience. I appreciate it.
9701000	9702000	No problem. Catch you later.
9702000	9703000	Alright, take care. Bye.
9703000	9704000	Bye bye.
9705000	9711000	Do you like how I just called him Tony anyway? Like, sorry buddy. Your name is now Tony. I don't care what they call you.
9711000	9719000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word. I wanted to check in with Loki real quick and see if there's any last minute stories. Or Dark Soccer if she has any.
9719000	9726000	Um, sure. And of course we can mention that the Steam Summer Sale will be starting June 23rd running through July 4th.
9726000	9727000	Oh dear God.
9727000	9729000	Prepare your wallets.
9729000	9731000	Prepare your wallets. You can't handle it.
9731000	9732000	Winter is coming.
9732000	9733000	Alright.
9733000	9734000	Winter is coming.
9734000	9735000	That's right. Didn't GOG do something recently too?
9735000	9736000	Yeah.
9736000	9737000	Oh boy.
9737000	9749000	Yeah they did. And then also, um, apparently CG Product Red has a developer kit, um, or at least is familiar with the developer kit for the NX and says it will be fantastic. So.
9749000	9750000	Okay.
9750000	9752000	I guess we'll see.
9752000	9762000	And The Witcher 3 kind of, you know, pushed the limits. But anyway, our phone is ringing off the hook and some people are not going to get through tonight. I'm so sorry but, um, I guess Misty being here finally ups our popularity. I don't know what it is.
9762000	9763000	I don't know why. It's only me.
9763000	9769000	Nobody would call it in the past couple of weeks. Maybe it's E3. I don't know. But we do have another call on the line. Hi. You are on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?
9769000	9776000	Well I would call in more. But I've been busy on the weekend so I am sorry, Rama. I am so sorry.
9776000	9779000	Rama, all I'm hearing is excuses right now.
9779000	9783000	Well I am so sorry.
9783000	9790000	I hope you're doing okay though. Better than your cell phone connection is because you're breaking up a little bit but we'll deal. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9790000	9796000	Well I have to apologize for that. I think my mixer is going to be retired any week now, so.
9796000	9800000	Well take it out behind the barn and shoot it. But you sound alright for the moment. What's on your mind?
9800000	9805000	Sweet. Alright, well, first things first. Go to the top of the show, Rob. I want you to know something.
9805000	9807000	Yes?
9807000	9809000	You can hold my balls.
9809000	9811000	You have a pinball machine?
9811000	9813000	Really? No.
9813000	9815000	I should get one of those.
9815000	9826000	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What pinball machine has black balls in it? I don't...
9826000	9829000	Well, actually, I will tell you this.
9829000	9830000	What?
9830000	9836000	Twilight Zone has white ceramic balls for the Powerball.
9836000	9837000	Okay.
9837000	9841000	Because the ceramic balls are lighter and non-magnetic so they're not affected by the magnets in the system.
9841000	9845000	I'm going to speculate Rama does not have white ceramic balls in his pinball machine.
9845000	9847000	So you can get black ceramic balls as well.
9847000	9855000	Oh, I see. Well, I'm glad. Bobby Blackwolf in chat. Delete your account.
9855000	9864000	Thank you for that. What else did you want to talk to us about, Rama?
9864000	9875000	Well, you talked earlier about the whole issue with Twitch. People buying the viewer bots and the fake addings in the comments and all of that.
9875000	9876000	Yeah.
9876000	9883000	They do it to build popularity numbers because I see this on Facebook, on the like pages, cosplayers.
9883000	9890000	They're buying likes to build their popularity. It's like, well, I'm so and so cosplayer. I have over 10,000 likes.
9890000	9899000	I want to be a guest at your convention. And then when you break it down, you notice that they have maybe 2,000 real likes.
9899000	9903000	8,000 likes are coming out in Mexico City.
9903000	9907000	And this is a big thing on Instagram, too.
9907000	9916000	So this is not something unique to Twitch streamers. This is cosplayers. This is probably artists.
9916000	9922000	This is, you know, not to throw everybody under the bus, but my point is it's not unique to any one community, basically.
9922000	9928000	Because if you build up your popularity numbers and let's say you're able to, you know, monetize it, make that money.
9928000	9934000	I've always said it this way. Yes, you may be very popular on social media, but what am I outside of that?
9934000	9940000	Where is your website where I can see like your videos and stuff, you know, or your cosplayers, this or that?
9940000	9944000	I'm not going to sit there and like go through your archives to find stuff, you know?
9944000	9945000	Yeah.
9946000	9950000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'd love to have 2,000 real likes.
9950000	9956000	You know, if we could just buy 50,000 likes on YouTube, we would never have to worry about would we go to E3 or not.
9956000	9971000	But we wouldn't do that. I mean, because it would feel much better to have those 50,000 likes organically and know that people give a shit about what you're posting rather than, you know, emptiness.
9971000	9978000	Because it is weird when people have all those likes on YouTube, yet their actual videos only get, you know, a dozen views.
9980000	9981000	That's for sure.
9981000	9988000	Well, thank you for reminding us that these issues are much more than just one community. How was E3 for you?
9989000	9991000	I didn't go to E3.
9991000	9994000	I know you didn't, but you're watching it at home like everybody else, I'm sure.
9994000	9998000	Yeah, I did. Well, I didn't bother with the Nintendo press because I knew it was on there.
9998000	10004000	Between Sony and Microsoft, I thought it was a bit of a tie. I liked what both sides had, basically.
10004000	10009000	I know I'm getting the Xbox One S, the two terabyte console. That's a wrap.
10009000	10013000	You're not worried about the whole fact that Scorpio is going to be the big thing a year from now?
10013000	10023000	The Scorpio is supposed to be for, let's say somebody wants to get into diehard gaming, but they don't have like the 1,500 bucks to put together a powerful desktop.
10023000	10035000	That's what the Scorpio is supposed to be. And since it's going to be from a manufacturer that can get a good deal, I have a feeling when Scorpio comes out, it's going to be around $600 or $700.
10035000	10050000	It's going to be pretty much like a high-end gaming console, higher-end graphics card, more RAM, like a higher-tier processor, you know. It's just going to be able to handle everything and then some.
10051000	10056000	You know, just tin foil hatting, because I love to do that here on OLR. I have no more favorite pastime.
10056000	10069000	You know, if Sony is going to announce their own thing next year and Microsoft is set to announce the Scorpio thing, I hope Microsoft doesn't put themselves in a position to once again get undercut by Sony on the stage of E3.
10070000	10081000	I hope they negotiate to go second after Sony or announce at a different time frame or something, just because, you know, and you all can see these headlines coming a mile away.
10081000	10090000	Is that if PlayStation's Neo or whatever the hell they call it ends up being $100 cheaper than Microsoft's Scorpio, when you talk about these prices, I'm like, wow.
10091000	10100000	That was just the first thought to my head is that you say, oh, well, Microsoft's going to put it out for $700. I'm going, well, shit, what if Sony does theirs for $600? Then it's going to be E3 from a couple years ago all over again.
10100000	10102000	See, but here's the thing.
10102000	10104000	Terraplops be damned.
10105000	10117000	True that. Now, if supposedly the specs for the PS4 Neo has been leaked and I looked at it, truth be told, that thing shouldn't retail no more than $400.
10117000	10124000	Now, I can see if the Project Scorpio is higher, if it's like more powerful than what the Neo is.
10124000	10130000	I understand that price adjustment, but if there's just something slightly more at that cost, then I'm not seeing it.
10130000	10138000	Me personally, I'm the casual gamer. I have no problem sitting there playing, getting Xbox One S and just playing with y'all and having a good time.
10138000	10147000	I'm not going to sit there and get a Scorpio, get the top of the line headset, top of the line mouse and keyboard and be like, let's kill somebody.
10147000	10152000	That's not me, no. I like to have fun and play.
10153000	10158000	Alright. It's going to be a very interesting E3 next year and in the off cycle.
10158000	10166000	I'm really curious to see what non-E3 stuff, because for all we know, Sony might pull the curtain on their Neo thing at the PlayStation experience.
10166000	10169000	Assuming they do a third one, which I don't see why they wouldn't.
10169000	10172000	Probably. A couple more things I'm going to get out of here.
10172000	10175000	You were talking earlier about the Real Escape games.
10175000	10181000	They had something like that here about a year or so ago for Attack on Titan out in Staten Island, and it was pretty fun.
10181000	10185000	You could actually go with a team of four or they just put people together.
10185000	10189000	So like a branded thing. It was like a themed escape room.
10189000	10195000	Yeah. The company's called Scrap. They're the ones who originated the Real Escape games out of Japan and here.
10195000	10198000	But then now there are other companies popping up doing their versions.
10198000	10203000	And if you just Google Real Escape games, you'll find different ones and so forth.
10203000	10205000	I actually think I remember hearing about that Attack on Titan one.
10205000	10209000	Now that you bring it up, I'm like, I feel like we had a story on this when that first happened.
10209000	10212000	But anyway, interesting to see how that's kind of all the rage now.
10212000	10217000	If Shane is to be believed about how fun they are, which I don't see why he wouldn't.
10217000	10224000	Yeah. Now as for the whole Xbox One, Windows 10 compatibility, it's like this.
10224000	10229000	If your PC is pretty much the same specs as an Xbox One, you can just get it for PC.
10229000	10232000	That's where the benchmark is going to be.
10232000	10237000	As long as your machine has the same specs, pretty much is on par with the console.
10238000	10245000	And if your machine is not up to par, well then you have Xbox One, well you can go that way.
10245000	10250000	Alright, fair enough. We'll see how that strategy works out for Microsoft.
10250000	10256000	It's going to be very interesting, but as somebody who has a pretty nice PC and Xbox One,
10256000	10260000	I am excited that I only have to buy the damn things once to play wherever I want.
10260000	10261000	There you go.
10261000	10264000	Alright. Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,
10264000	10267000	but everybody should be listening to Anime Jam Session on Tuesday.
10267000	10270000	Yes, because we'll be talking about Anime Next 2016, how fun it was.
10270000	10272000	We were right up the street from the casinos.
10272000	10274000	Woohoo! Good times.
10274000	10275000	Alright, my friend, take care.
10275000	10276000	Alright, you too.
10276000	10277000	Alright, bye.
10277000	10278000	Alright.
10278000	10279000	Those are some good calls tonight.
10279000	10282000	Sadly, I am going to close the Skype line and we are still getting calls in.
10282000	10285000	I'm so sorry, but this is a good time for you to email us.
10285000	10290000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, but we are past midnight on the East Coast,
10290000	10291000	9 o'clock here on the West Coast.
10292000	10297000	So, I do want to move on with wrapping up the show and getting on out of here for the night,
10297000	10299000	because some folks have to work tomorrow.
10299000	10301000	Misty, thank you so much for being here tonight.
10301000	10304000	I know you didn't get to talk an awful, awful lot, but I really hope you had fun.
10304000	10306000	It was great to have you here.
10306000	10308000	It's always fun to see it play out live, huh?
10308000	10309000	Indeed.
10309000	10316000	Anything that folks listening should know about how live differs from just listening at home?
10317000	10318000	Huh?
10318000	10324000	I'm actually blanking, but it's just cool being here in person.
10324000	10326000	Well, it was cool to have you here in person.
10326000	10328000	I really appreciate you being here and have a great rest of your trip.
10328000	10330000	Hope you get to play a lot more DDR.
10330000	10333000	Alright, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10333000	10337000	You know shit's going sideways if I sign up for TSA PreCheck.
10337000	10343000	You, the train and bus and every other thing is signing up for TSA PreCheck.
10344000	10348000	Is it that you just don't like flying or you are nervous about it?
10348000	10355000	For me, it's mostly F-U-T-S-A, aside from being that damn high up in the air.
10355000	10359000	I think there's a lot of people saying that right now, especially after some of those lines at the airport.
10359000	10362000	Good luck with that whole process and have a safe trip home, okay?
10362000	10363000	I will.
10363000	10364000	Alright.
10364000	10368000	Hey, as I always say at the end of every episode, thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
10368000	10372000	If you like what you heard here at the show, please tell a friend or five about the show,
10372000	10376000	because we don't buy our likes, we just ask for word of mouth. That's it.
10376000	10383000	We could have 5,000 likes if our listeners would go tell all of their friends a thousand times,
10383000	10385000	but we really appreciate all the support.
10385000	10391000	A nice five star review goes a long way on a place like iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show.
10391000	10394000	Thank you guys so much for your support. It means everything.
10394000	10397000	I forgot to check in if there were any other last minute stories.
10397000	10398000	No.
10398000	10400000	I'm just kind of assuming there wasn't. Yeah, okay, good.
10400000	10403000	So let's wrap it up. Let's say goodnight for the night.
10403000	10406000	Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10406000	10411000	Yes. If you have boys, teach them to ask for consent.
10411000	10414000	Drunk is not consent.
10414000	10416000	Drugs are not consent.
10416000	10418000	Clothes is not consent.
10418000	10420000	Ask first.
10420000	10423000	Don't teach your boys to be rapists.
10423000	10424000	Holy shit, yes.
10424000	10431000	And when you see a little boy push a little girl in the playground, it's not boys being boys.
10431000	10433000	It's this boy has hurt a girl.
10433000	10436000	You teach them that's bad.
10436000	10438000	That's a trip to the naughty step.
10438000	10440000	No more of this boys will be boys shit.
10440000	10444000	That's how you make rapists. Just saying.
10444000	10449000	My final thought for the night is on a less serious notion.
10449000	10453000	The popcorn that Misty brought was delicious, and thank you for making me fat.
10453000	10454000	I appreciate that.
10454000	10455000	You're welcome.
10455000	10458000	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10458000	10464000	My final thought is I got to take time off work tomorrow to fix my stupid refrigerator.
10464000	10465000	Don't.
10465000	10470000	Which is going to be awkward because I have to call, like my work, you can't really call in like that.
10470000	10476000	I mean, so I have to call in and use a sick day, I guess, and lie about why I'm not going to be there.
10476000	10481000	So tomorrow I could call in and unironically ask you, is your refrigerator running?
10482000	10485000	No, it's not. It is running. It's just dripping.
10485000	10487000	Well, go catch it.
10490000	10494000	But at least we found Iron Man behind the refrigerator, so that's good.
10494000	10495000	Oh, hooray, hooray.
10495000	10499000	Because my son threw him like months ago, and I'm like, I don't know where the hell Lego Iron Man is.
10499000	10500000	Oh, there he is.
10500000	10503000	Alright, we'll use Iron Man to plug the leak.
10503000	10506000	Alright, that's going to do it. Thank you guys again for listening to the show.
10506000	10508000	Hope you all had a great E3.
10508000	10510000	Hey, guess what? We're going to be back to do it again in seven days.
10510000	10516000	And if an E3 wrap-up show wasn't fun enough, next week is our fourteenth birthday.
10516000	10518000	What are you going to buy us? Bring your presents next week.
10518000	10521000	You know what I'm thinking next week? Because it's been too long.
10521000	10522000	You know what I'm thinking next week, you guys?
10522000	10526000	We need to do a game, Nick. We need a list list, a match game.
10526000	10528000	We need something fun next week. What do you guys say?
10528000	10530000	A game next week for our birthday? How about it?
10530000	10534000	Alright, we'll see you in seven days. Have a great week and happy gaming, everybody. Bye.
