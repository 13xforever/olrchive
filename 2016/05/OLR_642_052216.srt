Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Agents, it's nearly time to become the very best, like no one ever was.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Put down your XMPs and Resonators, a new encounter has arrived.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Pokemon Go is a go.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, May the 22nd, 2016 with the 642nd episode of our show

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
joined here in lovely Sacramento, California, Studio N7, by my side, as she always is over a very, very, very long time.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No shit.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you, Jamie?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was actually floored the other day telling someone about the podcast and realizing that it's been that long.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I mean, I'm floored every time I think about it having been that long.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sure.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But it's like just what we do.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's just, this is our Sunday night thing.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a thing.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's what we do on Sundays.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Some people watch Chair of Swords.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We podcast.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's right.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Some people join a bowling league.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We podcast.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There it is.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, some people walk around, you know, naked down the street with some enchanting shame after them.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is that what you used to do?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Before O-L-R?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, okay.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I used to go to the Goth Club on Sunday nights.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then there was O-L-R.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You remember my Bachelorette party.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I do.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We watched Barbarella and Xanadu.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait, what does this have to do with Goth?

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And went to the Goth Club right after her.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's right.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We did.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We did.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Anyway, also joining us, say hello to, I don't know how often he went to the Goth Club, but

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
say hello to Techmaster Loki.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think like twice.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Did you really go?

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, twice.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't even remember that.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I do remember-

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You were there every single night.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I do remember the time you entered the DDR tournament and you dressed sort of like Keanu

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Reeves from The Matrix, kind of like you had the big trench coat thing.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And you were doing Dynamite Rave.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I totally fucked it up.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And you failed the song.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In front of all those people.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's because they didn't practice.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's all right.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You tried.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That tourney we named Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was the Scat Tournament.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The Scat Tournament.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was awesome.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So anyway, that is us here at Orange Launch Radio.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You guys in our chat room, if you are listening live, you should join us live in our chat

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific,

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
vognetwork.com.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And you can chime in with comments such as Ragenator in chat who says, bowling?

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Who the holy fuck bowls anymore?

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey, hold on.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I just went bowling like two months ago.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think a lot of people still bowl.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's a lot of old people who bowl.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I wouldn't mind going bowling, but I want to do glow bowling.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Bowling's fun.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's like all bowling is glow bowling now on like Friday and Saturday night.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Some people just like to fondle their balls.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And throw them at things.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Gotcha.

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Tigerclaw defending bowling in chat saying bowling is fine.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a relaxing sport.

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
S2100 Matt talking about the Sunday night thing going, I honestly can't remember what

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I used to do on my Sunday night prior to listening to OLR 10 plus years ago.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's probably watching TV, honestly, because TV, it has all their big shows on Sunday.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
ActDeft in chat says, heck, the Applebee's around the street opened a bowling alley.

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I actually, I want to talk about bowling a little later in the show because it actually

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ties into my gaming week a little bit and I'll hold you with that.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But we got to get to our guests because we have some amazing guests in studio this week.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Very excited to have these guys on the show.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Finally, after just being down the street around the corner with their own show here

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
in Sacramento, say hello everybody to the cast of Video Game Bang is joining us tonight.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Aaron, how you doing?

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think I'm more excited being here than you are excited to have us here because this

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is a full loop.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We spoke before, of course.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm a listener from back then and now I'm sitting right here with you guys like actually

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
on the show.

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's crazy.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I would have never imagined this is full circle.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, I thought that was awesome.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And you said you were listening in the all games days, right?

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All games days.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Interactive and stuff.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not taboo.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're all on good terms.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're all friends.

114
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This was like high school time for me.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay, but now you got to stop because that dates me.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When you talk about, yeah, that's what I used to do in high school.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, sir.

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, but no, that's awesome.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know, I always say, I think the biggest possible compliment you can get as a podcaster

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is that somebody else was inspired to podcast because of what you did.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Not that I'm saying we did that for you.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh no, hands down you did.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, but like Scott and everybody at all games probably played some part in that.

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And that's fantastic.

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, you guys definitely had a hand in the creative thinking behind the show.

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And just the motivation to do the show.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You guys have been doing this for a long time.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I'm just like, I mean, if I can even get a quarter of what you guys have done, I think

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'd be happy with that.

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't know.

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
These are the guys I do the show with.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You guys want to say hello to Corey.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Corey's here, everybody.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm so flabbergasted at Aaron's modesty right now because this is so new.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you guys knew this man in our show, he is Sir Aaron Carter.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The man has knighted himself.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which, was it the Queen of England knighted him?

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a long story, seven year story.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's refused to tell the story.

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And that's, I mean, kind of the back behind that as well.

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
On all games, there was Mayor Young.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He had his title like that.

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Like the mayor of gaming.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Like I just kind of caught being paid from that.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There was a story there.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I believe he had done something involving with politics at one point or somebody had

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
always said he should run for mayor or something.

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There was a story there.

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I just forgot it in my advanced stage.

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean, there's a story behind mine as well, but I mean, I'm just copying the other black

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
guy.

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's all it is.

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's basically what that is.

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If he's out there somewhere.

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Thank you.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's all I had to say.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He is awesome.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lawrence, if you're out there, call me.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Call me, bro.

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's been forever.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Bobby's saying that he wanted to run for mayor of Los Angeles.

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh wow.

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I thought there was a story there about him running for mayor of LA or something.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Of course.

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course Bobby knows that stuff.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So by default, Aaron, what are you trying to accomplish?

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm trying to be the knight of Sacramento, apparently.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah.

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't need to be mayor or king or anything.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Knighted, knighthooded.

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's a go for Duke.

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you were a king, if you were a king, you'd be making millions.

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know how much those guys make?

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The Sacramento Kings?

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, no, no.

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's a bump joke there.

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
All right.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All right.

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Also, I want to make sure we introduce this well.

183
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We have David here also from Video Game Bang joining us tonight.

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey guys, how's it going?

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Good.

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How are you?

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Good.

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Good.

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Awesome.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Good to be here.

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He's the real David Webb.

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay.

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have to ask a question.

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I swear to God I'm not trying to start shit, but I noticed there's three of you here tonight,

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but when I download the Video Game Bang show, I see their pictures.

196
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, see, good thing you guys don't have cameras because Webb is hideous.

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If you could see his face, he's got a giant Jewish nose.

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, now, now, now.

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hold on.

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hold on.

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The neck beard.

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hold on.

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, I mean, initially-

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Jamie's going to back him up here.

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hold on.

206
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Solidarity.

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

208
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Initially it was-

209
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, fine.

210
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Fine.

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Me and Cory, that's, you know, started the whole thing.

212
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, like the first, what?

213
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Most of the time.

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The first most of it.

215
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ten episodes are kind of just us?

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then we kind of just start trickling everybody into the thing and became a giant family.

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And then, you know, people came in and they leave and some people have skills to help

220
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
us in some areas and others get busy with life, but then only a year ago?

221
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah.

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A year ago?

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Webb joined our team and he just takes so much of the load off of our shoulders.

226
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, he does.

227
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He takes a big load.

228
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He takes our loads all the time.

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're a son of a bitch.

230
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Didn't you initially come on as a iPhone expert?

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That was the very first episode.

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, Cory, there was a new iPhone 5S or something.

233
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And Cory was like, hey, I know a guy who's a big Apple fanatic.

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll have him be on the show.

235
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I gave a whole like tutorial on-

236
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, are you the her of this show?

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because she is also the Apple fangirl.

238
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's very accurate.

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's very accurate.

240
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Look at her laptop.

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She's got a little Apple logo on it.

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm a recovering Apple fanatic.

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.

246
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've made the switch.

247
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Uh-oh.

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Uh-oh.

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, then I better watch how far down that road I go then.

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All right.

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But no, no, that's awesome because honestly, it's not also just you three.

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I see some other faces pop up on your show too.

253
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So you have like-

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We have a roster of probably like 10 people.

255
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's an eclectic class of friends from childhood.

256
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like Aaron grew up with some of the people.

257
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Some of them I went to elementary school with.

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And we've all been gamers our entire life, so we hung out with gamers by proxy.

259
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So when we don't have specific expertise in a style of game, we'll bring in,

260
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
oh, well, a friend of mine won a tournament in that, so we'll bring him in.

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And so it keeps us fresh.

262
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It keeps the rotation so that every episode has something new.

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The dynamic changes from week to week.

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's fun.

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's a fun deal.

266
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Awesome.

267
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Awesome.

268
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
For those listening, because I know our audiences, we may not have a ton of overlap,

269
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
tell our audience a little bit about your show.

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If I'm going to download an episode of Video Game Bang, what am I going to find?

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So we do it twice a week.

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The Wednesday shows, you can find your basic news set up, what you're playing,

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and then a lot of interviews as well.

274
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We do interviews with kind of anybody that we can wrangle in from the industry,

275
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
from musicians, like video game musicians.

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We've got indie developers, people like Ashley Burch from Hey Ash, What You're Playing.

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She's come on her brother.

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That was an interesting episode.

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That was your birthday episode.

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We pulled strings to get Anthony Burch for Aaron's birthday because

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's a major gripe.

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We spent way too many hours on our show debating Roland from Borderlands.

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They killed him off in the second one.

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sorry for the spoilers.

286
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Spoiler for like a five-year-old game.

287
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Suck it.

288
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So that happened, and Aaron complained about it week after week.

289
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It didn't sit well with me.

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It didn't.

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It didn't sit well with me.

292
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So we were like, well, we had Ashley like a month ago.

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's send her a message and see if we can get her brother, who wrote Borderlands 2.

294
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We got him on there, and Aaron was able to confront the god of the universe.

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Of Borderlands, for a second.

296
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Were you satisfied?

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He gave me a sufficient answer, but I'm still not happy with the choice.

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

299
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, I'd say that.

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He gave the answer saying that Roland was the number one played character from Borderlands 1.

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So they really wanted to make players have an emotional reaction.

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So what's the best way?

303
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We kill them.

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So that's what they did.

305
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So I was like, I understand where you came from, but there was still no point in the story to kill that character.

306
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, well they could always change their mind on that or something like they do with Saints Row.

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh yeah, everybody loves Gat.

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's kill him.

309
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, exactly.

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But he actually, he said he didn't want to do that.

311
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, they might, because he's not working with them anymore.

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But he said he wanted to keep death permanent.

313
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So it was just like, this character's dead.

314
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is in a game that worked in a mechanic called the New You.

315
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Really?

316
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So every time you die, you get a respawn.

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not just a respawn, they justified your respawn.

318
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But we've talked to them.

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Katrina Law from Arrow.

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It shocks me, some of the people who will talk to us.

321
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Really, yeah.

322
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
They have no reason to, they probably shouldn't.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And how humble that the gaming community, especially independent developers, really are.

324
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, yeah, we'll do your show.

325
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You had a lot of indie developers on leading up to the Sac Indie Arcade, which is when we finally kind of connected.

326
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I know you had a lot of them on your show leading up to that event, and I'm sure they appreciate it.

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Trust me, any indie developer I've talked to over the years, especially if Kickstarter's involved,

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
something where they really have to get the word out, Greenlight especially.

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They are more than happy to do that type of opportunity and have always been very humble and gracious and all that.

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I love spotlighting them.

331
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You get the big names, of course, out there, and you're always going to get a Madden.

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're always going to get a Call of Duty.

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're always going to get Gears of War.

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Nintendo could fart, and it's going to be all over Twitter the next day.

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Some of these indie developers, and that's not a slam against Nintendo.

336
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, people were talking about Star Fox, so I guess you are correct.

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Shut up.

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So they could do the littlest thing.

339
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
People are going to speculate about them rampantly, and that's trending topics on Twitter for the next 24 hours.

340
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hashtag campaigns and everything, but an indie developer who's really trying to push, it can be very difficult.

341
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And they're some of the most creative talent out there.

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
They have no chains on them from somebody saying, hey, we need this game out right now.

343
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We need it to be like this. We need it to be the next FIFA or something like that.

344
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They're like, no, I have an idea. I have creativity. I want to show it through this.

345
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And I love that.

346
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Our show is based on the mentality that we're just going to be honest.

347
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No matter what, we were going to say our feelings, whether we conflict with each other or mass opinion.

348
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In our first couple weeks, Aaron single-handedly pissed off the entire PC gaming master race.

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And he held to his guns. So we just have our opinions, and we highlight the indie developers.

350
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We ourselves are indie.

351
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And other indie podcasts as well. I know in the early stage we were doing cross stuff as well with other people.

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Indie, I don't know. It just needs a bigger light. So if we can help that, definitely.

353
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Have you ever found that you've changed your opinion?

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I know I have. The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, boring.

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But I came back a year later and played it again. I was like, what was I smoking the first time I played this?

356
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Look at me. I'm wearing a hat. I'm up BioWare's ass now.

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
By the way, happy birthday BioWare. 21 years old today. Have a drink.

358
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think the only one... I don't know if I've done that with games. I've only done that now with a movie.

359
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I think the first time that I said about the Warcraft movie, I was like, no, that's going to be terrible.

360
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There's no way this movie's going to come out and do anything. But then I saw the first trailer.

361
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was like, okay, you might have something on your hands here.

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But the movie still hasn't come out. So you might go see the movie and then be like, you know what, I was right the first time.

363
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then my gut, yeah.

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Flip flopper.

365
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Exactly.

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And you own a PC now that's powerful that can do some good gaming.

367
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But how much gaming do I do on it?

368
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, seeing as though you play 99% of Smite.

369
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah. I do one game.

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No, I'm not going to let you pick on him because I play a ton of like Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3 on my PC.

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There it is.

372
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yet I consider myself a console gamer.

373
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There it is.

374
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, I'm both. I'm both.

375
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm right with you.

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Everybody wants to rule the world.

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm right with you. I'm right with you. I'm both.

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
All right.

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
My label.

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Exactly.

381
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Where was this here?

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, Kaijuto had asked this question. Video Game Bang, is this a Pornhub podcast?

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
All right. So obviously there's, is the name supposed to be tongue in cheek?

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Because obviously, am I just a dirty pervert where I go, hee hee, gang bang, hee hee.

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What is that?

386
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's the first time we've heard that.

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We're a good Christian podcast.

388
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What did he say? A porn what?

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Porn hub.

390
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What is that?

391
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I think they sponsor esports teams.

392
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's all well received.

393
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, we are not sponsored.

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, no.

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No, yeah, we definitely fully understand the correlation between the two and we embrace it.

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's a blessing and a Christian.

397
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, we embrace it sometimes. Well, who was it?

398
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Jason David Frank.

399
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Was it Jason David Frank?

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It was Jason David Frank. He was giving us a shout out.

401
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And he's like, hey, you're listening to Video Game Bang.

402
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And we're like, no.

403
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is that the Power Ranger?

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, he was the green Power Ranger and the white Power Ranger.

405
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

406
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And then the black one.

407
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Black.

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He's the Power Ranger who's like 45 and still a Power Ranger.

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, yeah.

410
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hanging out with teenagers.

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And the MMA fighter.

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh my God.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, he couldn't say when we tried to get him to do a promo for us or whatever.

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It was just tough.

417
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Two or three times.

418
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, it was definitely tough.

419
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You'd be really surprised how far a good name can get you.

420
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

421
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And how far a bad name will hold you back.

422
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm not going to say OLR is a bad name.

423
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I love the name of the show and it comes from a very special place and so forth.

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I also realize people go Orange Lounge Radio.

425
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're not going to think, oh, it's a video game show.

426
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Not a lot of people make that connection in this timeframe.

427
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But one star, there was a significant lack of lounge music on your show.

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Maybe some lounge against the machine.

429
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Maybe.

430
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Get some Richard Cheese on.

431
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
In the old days.

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We just talked about Dick Cheese on our show last week.

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's an actual thing?

434
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I thought you guys were making stuff up.

435
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, we didn't make it up.

436
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have no idea what Dick Cheese was.

437
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
My favorite song to this day is the cover of Crazy.

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The Britney Spears one.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes, that's a good one.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We actually listened on the stream Down with the Sickness.

441
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It was a beautiful thing.

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But the name gives us opportunities to come up with little creative things.

443
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like our number one shirt is I'm here for the gang bang.

444
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We call our-

445
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, that's cute. That's funny.

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We call our fans the Bang Gang.

447
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is that what we call them? The gang?

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, we call them the Bang Gang.

449
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No, I think we call us the gang bang.

450
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Whenever I put in the descriptions, that's what the Bang Gang is talking about.

451
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We don't talk about it nearly enough.

452
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There is definitely an explosion of some kind going on.

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, there we go.

454
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Who was the director that did the promo for us?

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm forgetting his name.

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He did Tusk. It was his last movie.

457
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Kevin Smith.

458
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Kevin Smith, yeah.

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes, Kevin Smith.

460
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Whenever he did the promo for us, and he's like,

461
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it doesn't sound as dirty, or it's not as dirty as it sounds, everybody,

462
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
or whatever.

463
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He's like, you're listening to the video game, bang,

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and it's not as dirty as it sounds.

465
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I was like, that's awesome.

466
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He recognized off the cuff, and he said it right, and he plays to it.

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He's a pro.

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Corey, you call you guys the Bang Bros, right?

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's definitely not happening.

470
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, me and Aaron are the Bang Bros.

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We are not.

472
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I really feel like Bang Bros I've heard somewhere else,

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and you may actually not want to be associated with that.

474
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

475
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Exactly.

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's fine.

478
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So the lawsuit comes in, then he'll know exactly what you're talking about.

479
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
All right, just don't Google it, because I don't think you're going to find yourself.

480
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You're going to find something else.

481
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You should see this bus I bought us on Craigslist.

482
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, no.

483
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, my God.

484
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's see.

485
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
ActDeftInChat says, is this crossover episode gang bang at the Orange Lounge?

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess.

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Wow.

488
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Actually, it's a game bang at the Orange Lounge.

489
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
StoppyInChat says, I guess I won't name my podcast video Blumpkin.

490
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Do what you want.

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do it.

492
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'd listen.

493
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We have a cute name for our fans, too.

494
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The OL Army.

495
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's actually good.

496
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah.

497
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It rolls right off the tongue.

498
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We didn't come up with that.

499
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Really?

500
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I like that name.

501
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But I did make a picture of a tank.

502
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes.

503
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That was orange.

504
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Awesome.

505
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It said OL Army on it.

506
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We don't have any logos for our fans.

507
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah.

508
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That'd be something interesting to see.

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We need to get on that.

510
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah.

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Take that load.

512
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I feel like somebody actually registered the domain, the OL Army or OL Army 1 of them at some point.

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It just redirects to Orange Lounge Radio, but I always got a kick out of that.

514
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Now I'm just thinking though of Hook.

515
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can call it the Bangarang.

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, wow.

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh.

518
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How much do you want for that one?

519
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That is trademark right now.

520
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Get me a taco.

521
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Too late.

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I already mailed it to myself.

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah.

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
She'll sell it for two tacos.

525
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Done.

526
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
John Doe's tacos.

527
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ooh.

528
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've actually finally been there, and I got sick.

529
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But it was great.

530
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's the best.

531
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I had a kiss.

532
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Can I have peppers?

533
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
All right.

534
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Before we get into the news this week, I've got to know a little more about you guys as

535
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
gamers for the audience.

536
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They probably want to know what types of games you play.

537
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because I know our show here at Orange Lounge Radio started about we all played DDR together,

538
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
believe it or not, at Roseville Golf Land.

539
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Orange Lounge was one of the bands that was in DDR back in the day.

540
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So we actually all met playing DDR at the arcade.

541
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It was never thinner my entire life.

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, actually, let me ask that first.

543
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How did you guys all come together?

544
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They're going to ask about our weight.

545
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, no, no, no.

546
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We do radio for a reason.

547
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You said something about childhood friends.

548
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Are you all like friends from high school and this stuff?

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Or how did you all come together and say, I'm going to do a video game podcast?

550
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Me and Cory worked at GameStop together.

551
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And actually, a lot of the staff at GameStop are all members.

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We can't call them staff because we don't pay them.

553
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How long ago was this that you were at GameStop?

555
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
2004, I believe.

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That was, I think, when Dan was a manager.

557
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think it was, yeah.

558
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
My husband.

559
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, because I distinctly remember hearing episodes.

560
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And when you said that, I was like, I work at GameStop.

561
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I tried to find this Dan person.

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I promise you.

563
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Like, I have no lie.

564
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
No, no, no.

565
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I was just like, I listened to your hot show.

566
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And it was crazy.

567
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Well, the good news is there's like 5,000 fucking GameStops in Sacramento alone.

568
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So the odds are...

569
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can name all the ones he worked at.

570
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I was Lolo.

571
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I was just a GA back then.

572
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I had no...

573
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
When he started, it was a Funko Land.

574
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes.

575
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You know, I came a little after all that.

576
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
There were no Funkos.

577
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We had just purchased Wii.

578
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't care about that.

579
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They had just purchased Rhino Games was the last thing that I heard from them or something like that.

580
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And then I kind of was deployed.

581
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But a lot of the people were staff at GameStop.

582
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And now they're, you know, VGB members.

583
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And then there's web.

584
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes.

585
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's how that is.

586
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He was just here.

587
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

588
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But that's literally how all of us...

589
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Well, we did a lot of Xbox Live together.

590
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, yes, yes.

591
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I wound up at GameStop because I actually had a real job.

592
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And then I got fired.

593
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And the store manager owed me a big favor from high school.

594
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes.

595
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So I walked in and I was like, hey, time to pay the piper.

596
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I need a job.

597
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Hired me.

598
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I met some pretty cool people.

599
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Aaron was really cool.

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We made friends on Xbox.

601
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Played.

602
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He got free games then.

603
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So we played just about everything.

604
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And we would banter about it.

605
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And then, you know, due to Aaron's ego, he was like, we are really funny.

606
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We should probably do a podcast.

607
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And I was like, well, we're okay.

608
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And I have the technology because I was a drummer for many years.

609
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So I had a bunch of microphones, mixers, and the ability to build a little cheap studio.

610
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We did that.

611
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And then we locked ourselves in a room for two hours, two or three hours.

612
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And it was the worst piece of junk you've probably ever heard.

613
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was amazing.

614
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It was terrible.

615
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We were talking about George Zimmerman.

616
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
One of the Glee members passed away that day.

617
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Cory Monteith.

618
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And we brought that up.

620
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We talked about that for a little while.

621
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Now hold that thought.

622
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm going to bring Glee up later in the show.

623
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Hold that thought.

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay.

625
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Perfect.

626
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because I know exactly what you're talking about.

627
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Our show is the anti-Glee.

628
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I think on our one-year anniversary...

629
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Each anniversary, a Glee member passes away.

630
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

631
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So you're welcome, internet.

632
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You're doing God's work.

633
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And it's odd, because I mean, it's strange the first episode.

634
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We're coming for you, wheelchair kid.

635
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I thought we were going to be expected to bust into a rendition of a Journey song here at the end or something.

636
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I was a little worried.

637
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So now all you need to get is from the Deadpool movie, and you just need to get the Deadpool up there,

638
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
put all the Glee members, and figure out which one's going to die next.

639
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean, it's strange.

640
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's odd the first time, but then when it happens exactly a year the second time, you're like, all right.

641
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Something's going on.

642
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Are we the Madden curse?

643
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're on the clock, Jane Lynch.

644
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

645
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Wow.

646
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is going to a dark place.

647
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You guys have some real Glee issues.

648
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Glee means happy.

649
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
What's your problem?

650
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The first episode was really not video games.

651
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
No, not at all.

652
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The first two or three were not video games.

653
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It was kind of pop culture and stuff.

654
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Even today.

655
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean, we still use some stuff in there.

656
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

657
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We do a lot of video game stuff.

658
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's our focus, but now we're video game and pop culture.

659
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

660
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because there's so much stuff we want to cover and talk about.

661
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Comic books, we're massive comic book fans.

662
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The Marvel movement, the movies and everything, we cover all that stuff.

664
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Tech stuff, we just did a whole episode on Google I.O.

665
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, only Google I.O.

666
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah.

667
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean, even in that episode we talked about the co-op, food co-op downtown, and all the natural foods and stuff.

668
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So we kind of spread a giant range.

669
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You know what?

670
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Food issues speak to us here at Orange Lounge Radio, so I understand completely what you're getting at there.

671
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But that's awesome.

672
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You know what?

673
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I say that for anybody who's new, starting with podcasting and so forth.

674
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Your first few episodes are likely to be terrible, or at least you're going to think they're terrible because we're our own worst critics, right?

675
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And it's not going to necessarily be what you expected.

676
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But you've got to stick with it, right?

677
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If you have that plan, you say, I'm going to do this every Sunday, or in your guys' case, I'm going to do this every Wednesday, every Saturday.

678
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You know, once you get to a certain point, it'll be like second nature, for sure.

679
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah, and it's become a part of just like everyday life now.

680
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
How long have you guys been going now at this point?

681
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Three years.

682
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Wow, good for you.

683
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
About three, three and a half years.

684
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Congrats.

685
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And I say it all the time, it's like therapy for me.

686
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Like I can come after a long, hard day's work or something like that, and then sit.

687
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I've actually come from like, I came with my grandmother, passed away, came right to the show.

688
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That's the interesting thing about the show.

689
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know, it's at my house most of the time.

690
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I run the ones and twos, but I've missed a lot of episodes, you know, because we go to E3 and stuff.

691
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But Aaron has held it down and not missed one episode of our entire history.

692
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Nice.

693
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Pretty remarkable, and got to give him kudos for that one.

694
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You guys do an E3 this year?

695
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes, sir.

696
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We opted not to do it, which I'm not, you know, everybody's got to do what they got to do.

697
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I'm kind of curious because there's been a lot of talk about, is E3 losing relevance and all this stuff?

698
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What's your guys' take on that whole situation?

699
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Like, are you guys still expecting E3 to kick ass?

700
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Are you going in with lowered expectations or what?

701
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
My expectations are like floor low.

702
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It seems like it is losing steam because I think the big eye-opener for me was when last year Bethesda was like the number one.

703
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It used to be who's going to win out of the big three.

704
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Nintendo shows, Sony shows, Microsoft shows.

705
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But then when a game company comes out and is like Fallout 4 mic drop and everybody for the rest of the event.

706
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And have you guys played that new Doom? It kind of kicks ass.

707
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And the Doom is, I mean, all from one company.

708
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So it's just like, all right, they stole the show over three major companies.

709
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It used to be a three-way battle.

710
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Like, what happened to that, you know, the console wars?

711
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't think the console wars are even that big of a thing anymore.

712
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Now wait a minute, because some would, to be fair, some would argue with you,

713
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
because wasn't last year also the same year where Sony like literally just like peed glitter on everybody with this whole,

714
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
like, we're going to give you Shenmue 3 and the Final Fantasy 7 remake. God is real.

715
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So we gave all the wishes and stuff like that.

716
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes.

717
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't know. I talked to a couple of people and I didn't hear any of them say I walked away wanting to be a Sony fan.

718
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like, I can't wait for Shenmue 3.

719
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah, there's a lot of games that they have coming out still that, like, I don't even think of, like, the names for,

720
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
like that one that was kind of the, like, retro futuristic, like almost like Monster Hunter type game.

721
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Was it the one that looked like Rogue Cyberpunk?

722
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah, basically where it's, you know, technology has kind of taken over and there's like dinosaur robot things.

723
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, the main female character, right?

724
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, yeah. I can't remember the hell the names of the game's called.

725
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But yeah, it's like stuff like that that I don't even think about, you know, consciously.

726
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But that's coming and that looks really awesome.

727
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

728
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You know, they had that stuff. But yeah, like right now this year there's, you know, Nintendo's like,

729
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
oh yeah, we're just going to show Zelda, which is cool. I mean.

730
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, this is the first time where I feel like a company's like kind of set the bar low for themselves.

731
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Like, don't expect nothing but Zelda. That's all you're going to see here.

732
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Thank you, Dungeon Buster, Horizon Zero Dawn. That was the game I was thinking about.

733
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But yeah, there's a lot of like games that they kind of show and a lot of it's just, I don't know.

734
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm excited about Crackdown.

735
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, there you go.

736
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Eventually, whenever the hell that decides to come out.

737
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I think it's this holiday. I think they're going to do it.

738
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I hope so.

739
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We'll see. I do love this comment from Stoppy though. It's in our chat, live.vognotework.com.

740
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's good that our expectations are low. Wait for some surprises to show up.

741
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Then ask us whether E3 is still relevant.

742
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I think that's a very good. I think that's a very good way to look at it.

743
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That's very fair.

744
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That's very fair because we may walk after this E3 going, oh my God, I didn't believe.

745
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh my God. They announced it was out today. What the fuck?

746
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Best show ever.

747
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah, I hope they do some. Oh, and it's out today, guys. Like, I really hope.

748
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh, that's all. That's that's just one more thing.

749
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's the shit we live for. Because there's so few surprises in the industry anymore.

750
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Everything's getting leaked.

751
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah. Thanks internet.

752
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah. Internet ruined everything.

753
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But so it's like those genuine surprises that really can like stay under wraps.

754
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I think that's part of what made Sony's press conference such a big.

755
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I mean, in part, and I love Sony in part, it was a huge deflection from look at.

756
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We have no holiday lineup, but here's some. Oh my God.

757
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You guys, Shenmue three.

758
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You know, everything is it was a Kickstarter, but that shit was was secret.

759
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And that's what allowed that press conference to just blow minds.

760
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I my thoughts on E3 a little different than Aaron's. Aaron is 100 percent.

761
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He does not curse on our show. He does not drink any alcohol whatsoever.

762
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So he's our church mouse. I like to partake.

763
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And E3 has been some of the best parties in my life.

764
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And see, I still consider us, even though we're technically going as press, I still feel like we're just guys.

765
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah. Yeah. Are super lucky. Yeah. At this point. So when we get invited to the parties, I like to just go in there and steal T-shirts.

766
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I like to take all the order that you're going to get into the parties to. Oh, yeah.

767
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The first E3 part, do you remember like the first E3 party you went to? Because I remember the first one I went to, I'm like, what am I doing here?

768
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I remember I went to Nintendo's E3 party and they had who the hell do they have playing?

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
They had some big band playing. Black Eyed Peas. They had Black Eyed Peas.

770
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, God. Oh, that year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Because we got in because I not only was there as press,

771
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but I also worked in the industry. So I got invited with my co-workers and stuff to go there.

772
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I mean, it was lame. But, you know, I remember I got yelled at for like filming Black Eyed Peas playing.

773
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
They're like, stop that. Stop that. Well, they were doing you a favor, Loki. Yeah.

774
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'll tell you what I remember, because I was a DDR freak moderator at the time.

775
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
DDR freak parties where we did nothing but just drink and play taboo drunk.

776
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But but that you but OK, but that was that was a lot more fun.

777
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That was an invite only private thing. Benson, that's a lot more fun than going to this industry party.

778
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, really? OK. Because I don't like to be around a bunch of people.

779
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't know. Elbowing people, I don't know. And drinking awkwardly in the corner, looking at a bunch of people.

780
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I listed three of my favorite things. And I think that I love elbowing people.

781
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't know. I think that's just personality stuff for sure, because some people don't like to be in those unfamiliar situations.

782
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm kind of like I'm like kind of like on the fence. Like I do like my environment to be controlled a little bit.

783
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But I get what you're saying. Like, you know, sometimes you just want to be social and go meet everybody.

784
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And this is my time to network, network, network. And I go into solo mode at those things.

785
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I go into solo mode at conventions. I go into solo mode at E3 every time that I went.

786
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's just I avoid every other human being and zigzag through the crowds and go to where I want to go.

787
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Talk to who I want to talk. And then I move on. Well, it's also hard to know, especially even though you get in as pressed.

788
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're not an IGN, so we can't talk to you. I used to turn my way into conferences, though.

789
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah. Jamie was very good. Like, even though she's talking about this whole thing, she's very good at getting what she wanted.

790
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Because all you have to do is just look cute and talk to the Capcom people.

791
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, I tried, Jamie. I tried.

792
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Not everyone can be me, Rob.

793
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,000
My first one was the Wargaming party. They threw a party and it was like, you remember Blade? The first party scene?

794
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's what it felt like to me.

795
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So people died? Is that what you're saying?

796
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It was full of vampires.

797
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Did Wesley Snipes show up and not pay taxes?

798
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
There was a dude who looked just like Wesley Snipes.

799
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You were crawling on the floor and everything.

800
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it was the most fun I've had.

801
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Web, actually, honestly, the reason why Web is our solid number three is because I kind of owe him my life.

802
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We went to a Twitch party once, an industry party, and if it wasn't for him, I probably would have died.

803
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Because it came to a moment where we were with another one of our members, Jada.

804
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And there was these guys, Puerto Rican dudes from Miami, because they let us know a million times they're from Miami.

805
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Like, bitch, you're from a suburb.

806
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It was like in Telltale when you see the two paths.

807
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And Jada and these Puerto Rican guys were going to go off into the night and do who knows what.

808
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And then Web was like, dude, let's go back to the hotel room.

809
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And so life paused, I looked both ways, and I ended up going with Web.

810
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Sure enough, next thing we get a phone call in the morning from Jada, where are you guys?

811
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And I just hear, who are you talking to? Thank you, Web.

812
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Well, that was my first really big convention, and so I was really wanting to be professional.

813
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I had interviews the next day, so I didn't want to be hungover talking to the guy from XSplit.

814
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And this guy, that was our second party, and you had definitely partaken.

815
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And yeah, I was like, it's midnight, it's San Francisco, we gotta walk back, maybe we should head back.

816
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Web will remember that.

817
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

818
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh my gosh. Okay, so before we get into like gaming weeks and everything, I just kind of want to know like you guys as gamers,

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and I always ask new people to OLR this question, so I'll ask you guys as well.

820
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Your favorite video game, and you gotta pick one, of all time, of period, all period, time period, and why?

821
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
My answer never changes, it's always Tetris.

822
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Really?

823
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Hands down, Tetris. I can play that game in every different iteration.

824
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And I just, since high school, to a little bit of college, to now, Tetris is just my jam.

825
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That's what I love about it. I mean, it's a different game each time I try it.

826
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Huh.

827
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And it's the only game that I can think of that has kind of stayed true to its original in almost every single iteration.

828
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Well, we'll ignore the Hatris and the Welltris.

829
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Well yeah, there's others.

830
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We'll just ignore all of them.

831
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's all about Blastris.

832
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But I get what you're saying.

833
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I got a question from the chatroom.

834
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
D'Artessio wants to know which Tetris? Nintendo, Tengen, Atari, or Rika?

835
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Nintendo.

836
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I played it on a whole bunch of different platforms. I even played it on Mac one time.

837
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Game Boy or NES?

838
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Game Boy.

839
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Okay, yeah.

840
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I prefer Game Boy over NES.

841
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So did you do Tetranet?

842
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
No. I did not.

843
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Is that still a thing?

844
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't know, but I did Tetranet for like four years.

845
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Do you like the new Tetrises? Like, Ubisoft did one on the PlayStation 4 that's like,

846
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Tetris Ultimate!

847
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No, they're kind of weird now.

848
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Like, there was one I played, I think, on the 360, Tetris Bubble?

849
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Or something like that.

850
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And I was like, what is this?

851
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There was the one that I think I peeked out and just said, alright, this is the final one.

852
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It was Tetris on the Game Boy Advance. Tetris Advance.

853
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And it kind of stopped.

854
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Wasn't there a DS1?

855
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I think the DS1 was like the best one they did.

856
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, you know what? Yes. The DS1.

857
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I played online versus people.

858
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And I remember, I played on a friend's, and he was like, you're gonna play online? You're gonna get crushed.

859
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And I smashed everybody I went against.

860
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And the DS1 is like Tetranet, if I remember right.

861
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Like, they took some good ideas from the multiplayer there.

862
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So if you've played multiplayer DS, you kind of know Tetranet.

863
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So Tetranet is still a thing, although the last update I have is from 2012.

864
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But it's six person multiplayer online Tetris.

865
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh my god, we need to set up a server.

866
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Bobby, how much would a VoG server cost for Tetranet?

867
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That'll get more use than the Team Fortress 2 thing, I guarantee it.

868
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And the Minecraft server.

869
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And the Minecraft server.

870
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So Tetris, that actually is a great answer.

871
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well, I mean, they're all gonna be great, I'm not gonna tell you.

872
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That's a shitty answer. Get out of my house!

873
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But, you know, Tetris just, you're right.

874
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's like, the game itself, the core game just hasn't changed yet.

875
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's like, this story's been being told for 20 plus years now.

876
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And it'll all come to fruition when the Tetris movie comes out and you guys are gonna love it.

877
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We shall see. We'll get to that in a little bit.

878
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Corey, how about you?

879
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I have more of a plebe answer.

880
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I have a few games that impacted me major throughout my life that I just sunk so many hours into.

881
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like Super Mario World, Tekken, and even like the wrestling games.

882
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Like, you know, WCW versus NWO.

883
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But I have to say Halo 2 is my favorite all-time.

884
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You're gonna win a lot of fans here at OLR with that answer.

885
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Well, I was like in a clan. No offense, Aaron.

886
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, wow.

887
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But I was the commander of a clan as like a high schooler.

888
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
The high wizard? Is that what you were?

889
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No, we were a DoG. I had my own branch called...

890
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You were a dog clan leader?

891
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I was a dog clan leader. Decisals of gaming.

892
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So you were the head bitch in charge.

893
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's accurate.

894
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That's very accurate.

895
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Never thought of it that way.

896
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That's definitely very accurate.

897
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But it was so much fun, man. We organized tournaments.

898
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We brought in new members. We had to run through the do's and don'ts of being in our clan.

899
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You don't circle boost. You don't quit out of matches.

900
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You don't teabag. You don't use races. We would do all these things.

901
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And we'd compete against KSI.

902
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You don't have racism in your clan?

903
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
No, there's no racism. We did not allow for it.

904
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
As backwards as that sound.

905
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Wow, yeah.

906
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But no, I spent a lot of time. And that kind of really pumped me up for gaming again.

907
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because we all play games as kids.

908
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Then it feels like something has to happen in that transitional period.

909
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
To where you're like, okay, I want to continue doing this and not play basketball or football or something like that.

910
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And it was Halo. So Halo 2 is my favorite.

911
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Halo 2 is such a... I mean, as much as we have the inside jokes here on OLR about why Halo is not going to be the classic game of the week.

912
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And Jamie's things and all that stuff.

913
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
We all have to admit Halo 2 and the way that it pushed Xbox Live forward.

914
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Games are forever changed because of it.

915
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I mean, really. In a way, I don't want to be this direct about it, but I guess I'm going to be.

916
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Halo 2 kind of killed the arcade. In a way.

917
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I can see that, yeah.

918
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Just from the soundtrack. That's the only game where I had a soundtrack.

919
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And I'd listen to it over and over again on my MP3. My Zoom player.

920
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It was like movie-style quality music.

921
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh, yeah. And then that guitar riff. I was a rock guy.

922
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
When they put Steve Vai on the track, I was just bought. I was sold.

923
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Satriani? I can't remember.

924
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Love it.

925
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I was going to say David, but I noticed they call you Web. Should I be calling you Web?

926
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah, that's fine. I'm used to that.

927
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Web! Your top game.

928
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Mine's similar to Quarry, but it's Halo 1. The first Halo.

929
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That got me... That was kind of like Quarry.

930
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Halo 2 was this serious game that got him into gaming, and Halo was mine.

931
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Were you in a clan as well?

932
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Were you in a clan as well?

933
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Halo 1 was not live.

934
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Well, you could LAN.

935
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Right. Which is... I did that every weekend.

936
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Every Friday night after high school, we'd go grab our Xboxes, meet up at a friend's house.

937
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We had... His parents, for some reason, let us do that.

938
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But we had five TVs in five different rooms, and we're whispering to each other in the same room trying to like...

939
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yeah.

940
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
True story. That was my husband's bachelor party.

941
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's an awesome bachelor party.

942
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
A Halo LAN.

943
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That's legit.

944
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Do you know the first time I ever got exposed to Halo?

945
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Because I had always kind of written it off as like... That's kind of like... It seems like more of a bro game.

946
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't know if that's something I'd really be into.

947
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
First time I ever played Halo.

948
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Shit you not.

949
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I went to a wedding, and the bride and the groom came down the aisle to the music from Halo.

950
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then the reception was a bunch of TVs with Xboxes, and we played LAN Halo.

951
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Swear to God, to this day, one of the best weddings I ever went to.

952
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That's amazing.

953
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And I bought an Xbox not even a month later.

954
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah.

955
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's light red.

956
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What?

957
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's lightish red, it's not pink.

958
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But anyway, I ended up buying the Xbox not even a month later.

959
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Because I was sold on Halo.

960
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And this was even before the Xbox Live and all that.

961
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's unfortunate what's happened to the franchise.

962
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I mean, I fell off, you know, shortly after 3.

963
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Because 3 was good and all, but they got rid of the clans.

964
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And so with that, I lost a lot of the people I played with all the time.

965
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And then, you know, life kind of takes over.

966
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But man, Halo 2 with the BXRs and the super bounces is just redonkulous.

967
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Let me ask this quickly, since you guys are not shy for controversy.

968
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Let me ask a controversial question in the Halo universe.

969
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
How do you guys feel about Destiny, which is in some ways supposed to be the spiritual successor to Halo in some ways?

970
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
How do y'all feel about that?

971
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
This has been a hot topic in our show.

972
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yay, ratings! That means ratings!

973
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah, right?

974
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Aaron has always been anti-Destiny.

975
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I wouldn't say always.

976
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
99% of the time.

977
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The first time somebody at Bungie said Destiny, I was excited.

978
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Just the word Destiny got you excited.

979
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Then, yeah, the more they revealed, before they even revealed gameplay.

980
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
When they were talking about the story and what they wanted to do, I was all on board.

981
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But then when I saw what they did, I aborted that mission.

982
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That was done.

983
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I was at the E3 right before the launch, and I got to do a meeting with Bungie.

984
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The outlet we go with is Nerd Reactor.

985
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I was like, you have to give me this one, because I'm a huge Bungie fan.

986
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You have to put me there.

987
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The guy who was walking me through the game was a developer.

988
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
He was like, so you played some of our other games?

989
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Of course, because these guys are like, they knew I knew who they were.

990
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
He's like, yeah, I actually did development on Halo 2.

991
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I was like, puppy-eyed.

992
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I started playing the game with him, instructing me.

993
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
He's like, why don't you jump on that sparrow, young lad?

994
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I jump on the sparrow, and I was like, wow, this thing reacts just like a ghost.

995
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
He's like, no, no, no, no, it's not a ghost.

996
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's a sparrow. It's way different.

997
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I jump off, and I grab a shotgun, and I start blasting.

998
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I was like, those guys look just like elites.

999
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
This shotgun reacts just like the shotgun.

1000
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm saying it as a compliment, because I love the game.

1001
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
He's like, no, no, that shotgun's way different.

1002
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Those are not elites. That's the fall.

1003
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's just thing after thing.

1004
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I was like, bro, don't hide it. It's fine.

1005
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Are you sure this isn't a skim? Is this just DLC right here?

1006
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's all I expected.

1007
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is Halo 2, isn't it?

1008
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That's an awesome story.

1009
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That's a perfect E3 story, too, right there.

1010
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That's how it is. I bought it hook, line, and sinker.

1011
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Got the game day one.

1012
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Played it pretty consistently for about four to six months.

1013
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And then just got super bored.

1014
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Once you beat it all, because you can beat it in a week, not even.

1015
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's just a few days to really hit max level.

1016
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
They still have those really passionate fans, though, for it.

1017
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You can beat it, and you max, and you get everything you wanted, all the gear.

1018
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But they still have those passionate fans for some reason.

1019
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
To be fair, I need to go back and probably check out Destiny at some point.

1020
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I played it hard for a month or whatever,

1021
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
but I was just really frustrated in the endgame that you needed light to level up.

1022
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And I was like, what kind of fucking system is this?

1023
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I never knew you could single-handedly screw your entire game by messing up the endgame.

1024
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That's where my head was at.

1025
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But I heard they kind of went back and changed a lot of that.

1026
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Let me ask you guys how you feel about this,

1027
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
because this is one weird trend we've had just in the past five years in gaming,

1028
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
is that you can fix your game with a patch.

1029
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Because Final Fantasy XIV, I don't know if you guys are into MMOs or any of that type of stuff,

1030
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
but Final Fantasy XIV was absolute garbage when it first came out.

1031
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It was garbage MMO, one of the worst I've ever played.

1032
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Now, probably the best one on the market.

1033
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And I wonder how many people really went back and gave it a second chance.

1034
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Amazing.

1035
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Diablo III, not so great when it first came out.

1036
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Now I can't stop playing it.

1037
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Destiny, a lot of people have actually compared to Diablo III.

1038
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Webb, what are your thoughts on that?

1039
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah, because I was the longest playing Destiny player in the group,

1040
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and I kind of related to cocaine.

1041
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Cocaine is really hard to drop, and so was Destiny.

1042
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You speak from experience.

1043
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I do, yeah.

1044
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You can't see me, but I have scars on my...

1045
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah, it was really...

1046
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Especially because I put so much money into it with the two expansions,

1047
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and then after I played the second expansion,

1048
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
just because I had already prepaid for it,

1049
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I was going to drop it, and then the new one came out,

1050
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Taken King, and I was like,

1051
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
okay, it looks like they fixed some stuff,

1052
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but really they just polished a turd and make it look shinier

1053
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
to distract you from it's still a turd.

1054
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Couple thoughts on first impressions for video games.

1055
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
They're so important, especially for me and you, I'm sure.

1056
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
We've got stuff to do. We're doing podcasts.

1057
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We're doing appearances. We're doing articles.

1058
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We have to stay up on what's hot.

1059
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We have to keep playing the new games.

1060
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You have my attention for a short time.

1061
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The biggest example I have is Assassin's Creed Unity.

1062
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So bad. Unplayable.

1063
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm sure they patched it up, and it's fine,

1064
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
but I just don't have time to go back and play it,

1065
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and it didn't hook me.

1066
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The other one for me is Division, and just bad timing.

1067
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Wow.

1068
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
First time I played, of course, servers are down.

1069
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I get it the first night, and I'm excited.

1070
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Nothing launches good anymore. I've come to realize that.

1071
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, no.

1072
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I get it. It doesn't work.

1073
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I decide a week later, oh, let's play.

1074
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Aaron gets on. Web's on. I'm on.

1075
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I sit down to play my game.

1076
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Okay, there's an update, so I wait three hours for an update.

1077
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Get to play the game,

1078
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and they take the servers down for maintenance.

1079
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Never tried to play the game again.

1080
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah, the whole thing of we can fix a game.

1081
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Just put it out there. We'll fix it later.

1082
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That's definitely a trend.

1083
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's a very poor trend.

1084
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But when you have to rehaul a whole game,

1085
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
like how you said they did with Final Fantasy,

1086
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
how they did with the system for Destiny,

1087
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I wrote an article saying, are these just tests?

1088
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Like, are they putting these games out just to see,

1089
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
hey, do you like that? No? Okay, then we'll just wipe it all.

1090
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And I got, first comment was like,

1091
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
you don't know what you're talking about.

1092
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Actually, I said, was Destiny one giant test?

1093
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And, yeah, my first comment was like,

1094
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
oh, you have no idea what you're talking about.

1095
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The game was amazing.

1096
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And I was just like, I just want you to think.

1097
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I didn't want you to, like, I'm not saying it was.

1098
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Besides Destiny's Horde endgame,

1099
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I can get around some of that, but what really killed it for me

1100
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
was how they abused the fans monetarily.

1101
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Like, they screwed everyone who bought the game

1102
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and who was an early adapter when they came out with that big expansion.

1103
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
First of all, that expansion didn't come with the pre-purchase version of it.

1104
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And then second of all, they released a full retail version

1105
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
where if you bought the original game and the DLC,

1106
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
it was like standard price.

1107
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But if you bought the game, you know, spent 60 bucks before,

1108
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
just for the DLC by itself, it was 40 bucks.

1109
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah, so you're well into the century mark

1110
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
by the time you're playing the latest stuff with everybody, right?

1111
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah, reward the people who are playing your game and making it what it is.

1112
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I can't stand when people do that.

1113
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That was the good news about XIV when they rebooted it,

1114
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
was that if you were an early adopter, you got the new one for free.

1115
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So that was kind of nice.

1116
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Jamie, I thought I saw you trying to jump in on the whole Destiny stuff.

1117
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I was just more saying this way.

1118
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I think that BioWare is doing the right thing with Mass Effect Andromeda

1119
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
by delaying the release until they know they have a polished product.

1120
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And honestly, it's like I've said before,

1121
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I would rather wait for something good than, you know, have a turd.

1122
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I mean, really enough.

1123
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Isn't it interesting, though, that most people, I think,

1124
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
will agree with you in what you're saying and they accept that,

1125
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
but yet when it comes to the Nintendo NX,

1126
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
a lot of people are having a difficulty swallowing that pill.

1127
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What do you mean you're going to launch a console outside of Christmas?

1128
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
What are you doing, Nintendo? You're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

1129
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Isn't that interesting? I don't know.

1130
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I've got to see what that thing does.

1131
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's too much of a nobody knows what it's going to be about.

1132
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
There's a whole bunch of rumors and speculations what it might be.

1133
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I mean, I have no problem with them dropping it summer or something like that,

1134
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
but just let me see what it is.

1135
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah, tease me already.

1136
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
God.

1137
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Where's that little video they had with the Wii remote

1138
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
where they just showed people chopping things

1139
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and then they had all the sound effects?

1140
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
They didn't show you any graphics, any gameplay.

1141
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
They showed a remote and then people moving it,

1142
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and they were like, just imagine, and then they left,

1143
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and then they came back and told you what the actual remote did,

1144
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Wii Sports and all that other stuff.

1145
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And, and I can't stress this enough, and then we'll end on this

1146
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and move on to our gaming weeks,

1147
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
but Nintendo has got to have that game that sells that concept

1148
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
because Wii Sports sold the Wii.

1149
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Tetris sold the Game Boy.

1150
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Super Mario Brothers.

1151
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Duck Hunt sold the original NES.

1152
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
If Nintendo, Nintendo Land did not sell the Wii U,

1153
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
that's how, I mean, but that, we laugh,

1154
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
but that's how important that launch game is.

1155
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah, you could say the same, going back to Halo.

1156
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Halo is what made the Xbox one.

1157
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But did it, was Halo a launch game for Xbox?

1158
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't even remember.

1159
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It wasn't a launch, number one.

1160
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It was damn close. It was the first couple months.

1161
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It had me, me and my friends sat in Fry's until it closed playing that,

1162
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and they never put it up again,

1163
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and it definitely sold us on.

1164
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Yeah, by the time I got, I remember my, my original Xbox was different.

1165
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It was actually like a Halo Xbox.

1166
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It was like green and transparent. It was all like weird, different.

1167
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Oh, yeah, that one, yeah, I remember that one.

1168
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, it was a nice looking system.

1169
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
All right, anyway, let's see, going to our comments over at Live.vognetware.com.

1170
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Bobby Blackwolf confirming,

1171
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Halo was a launch title on the original Xbox.

1172
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It absolutely was.

1173
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Dr. Su is saying, just, Halo didn't have live support.

1174
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It just wasn't up at the time.

1175
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Dungeon Buster says, I'm tired of the NX rumors at this point.

1176
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
OMG, they're using colors on the case, whatever.

1177
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Kaijuto saying, in his perspective, Wii Sports didn't sell the Wii.

1178
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The Wii sold the Wii.

1179
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Wii Sports would come, people would come into GameStop all the time

1180
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
with their scratched copies, like, do I, I need another one.

1181
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I need my fix.

1182
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Give me another hit.

1183
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah.

1184
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I will say, Microsoft was not the first one to have multicolored systems.

1185
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Oh, no.

1186
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The Dreamcast had that clear white one that came out in Canada.

1187
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And the Hello Kitty one.

1188
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The Hello Kitty ones that came out in Japan.

1189
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And then there was also a blue one that came out in Europe.

1190
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah.

1191
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And...

1192
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I guess Dreamcast would have been the first one,

1193
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
because they didn't really have, like, different colors on Super Nintendo's, Nintendo's, Genesis.

1194
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
N64 had a...

1195
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh, that's right.

1196
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I had a Pikachu N64.

1197
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah, I had like a, I had a, the basic gray one,

1198
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
but then my neighbor had the blue one.

1199
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Donkey Kong Country Bundle or whatever it was there.

1200
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And then on my Nintendo, I had a Sharpie.

1201
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Alright.

1202
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Let's get into Our Gaming Weeks.

1203
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We're almost an hour into the show, haven't hit a single story,

1204
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but that's what happens here at OLR.

1205
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Oh, whatever.

1206
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Especially now it's two podcasts, so it's like, it's gotta be like,

1207
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
it's gonna be a gigantic show.

1208
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Four hour show.

1209
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But no, I really do want to thank you guys for being here this week

1210
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and bantering with us.

1211
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's awesome, man.

1212
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Good time, good time.

1213
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So we'll get into the news here shortly, as well as Our Gaming Weeks.

1214
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I think it's really where we want to start off.

1215
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So quickly, since there are so many of us this week,

1216
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
we'll just kind of hit a few highlights of Our Gaming Weeks.

1217
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

1218
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There's Sakura.

1219
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I got a terabyte hard drive to add into my system.

1220
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So I've moved my entire Steam library over and my Origin library.

1221
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So I have actually played a little bit of everything,

1222
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
just to make sure it worked.

1223
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I've reinstalled Dragon Age Inquisition.

1224
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I have to remod it.

1225
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I have to remod Mass Effect 3.

1226
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I've been playing some Danganronpa 2.

1227
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm still not to the second trial,

1228
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
so Shane's probably going to yell at me.

1229
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I've played some Happy Home Designer.

1230
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I have Ingress, which, oh, my God, I am so close to eight.

1231
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I don't care what Jason said in our intro.

1232
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I'm going to keep playing Ingress because I'm going to hit freaking level eight

1233
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
this week, if I can help it.

1234
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Rob, you're helping me level tonight.

1235
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I've got some issues with Ingress.

1236
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
We'll talk about that a little later in the show.

1237
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Issues?

1238
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, we'll talk about that a little later in the show.

1239
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And also, I'm still stuck on the Dragon Age.

1240
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Here's a Dragon Age thing on iOS.

1241
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And I actually am going to be getting a controller for my Apple TV

1242
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
so I can play Sonic CD on my Apple TV.

1243
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I think a $64 controller that only works with my Apple TV would be worth it.

1244
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
People do crazy things to play the one game.

1245
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
People do crazy things for love.

1246
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That's right.

1247
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
With a good soundtrack, Bobby, with the Japanese one, which is the best one.

1248
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Don't sass me.

1249
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I do that when I get a new TV.

1250
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I have to play all the games on my consoles just to make sure they work on my new TV.

1251
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
How often do you buy new TVs, Bobby?

1252
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, we also had Killer Instinct on Super Nintendo today.

1253
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
This is important.

1254
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It is very important.

1255
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And we gave away one of our Super Nintendos, one of our six ones.

1256
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Why not me?

1257
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We have six Super Nintendos.

1258
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
There's one.

1259
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Somewhere.

1260
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I gave you games.

1261
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I don't have six.

1262
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, you can borrow some of our spares.

1263
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
All right.

1264
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But we gave it to a young-

1265
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It doesn't have a portable game system.

1266
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, I also have the Retron, so it's like if I want to play any of that.

1267
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We gave it to a young person to introduce him to the history of gaming.

1268
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And I'm going to be buying Julian Mega Man 2 because he watched some of the playthroughs going,

1269
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
this game's cool.

1270
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Good.

1271
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Raise him right.

1272
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Good boy.

1273
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Julian is an eight-year-old boy.

1274
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yes.

1275
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Very good.

1276
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So we'll just go in a big circle here.

1277
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Webb, I'll go to you next.

1278
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
How was your gaming week?

1279
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It was slow.

1280
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm in the middle of a move, so I haven't been able to play a lot.

1281
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But I did play some Smite earlier on in the week with these guys.

1282
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah, it was like each couple nights this week we played like two, three hours.

1283
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah.

1284
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Just smiting about.

1285
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Just play again.

1286
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Just play again.

1287
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You guys ever play it?

1288
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Honestly, no.

1289
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And the reason why, well, but I have more and more friends that are getting into it.

1290
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
It's probably in my Steam library.

1291
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I just haven't checked.

1292
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Well, it's free.

1293
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's free.

1294
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's on PS4 and Xbox One and all that.

1295
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's kind of like League of Legends, but my understanding is the big twist is it's more

1296
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
like from like a Warcraft perspective where it's like over the shoulder.

1297
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah, third person.

1298
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
That type of thing.

1299
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah, right?

1300
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And a lot friendlier community.

1301
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Okay, good.

1302
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Because that's what I'm afraid of because when I play League of Legends, oh my, no,

1303
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like I heard better things in high school than I hear on League of Legends.

1304
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Heroes of the Storm, I like that because I feel like it's dumbed down for someone like

1305
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
me.

1306
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I feel like Heroes of the Storm is kind of like easy mode.

1307
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And I think that's what Blizzard does.

1308
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Not that Blizzard does everything easy mode, but I think Blizzard does a very good job

1309
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
at like mass marketing a good idea.

1310
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So that's why I kind of like Heroes of the Storm.

1311
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's very, very like commercial and easy to get into.

1312
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So that's kind of what's always held me back on smite is that I'm like, oh God, I'm

1313
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
going to be terrible and they're going to eat me alive because they do emo.

1314
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah, no, that community is like a 180 from League and you might get one toxic person

1315
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
every six games, but that's a very forgettable person like real quick.

1316
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Is Corey leading the smite clan where he has all these rules?

1317
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You're not going to do this?

1318
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You're not going to be a respectable gamer?

1319
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Aaron would break the racism rule too quickly.

1320
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
No, I believe I play the most out of everybody.

1321
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
No, there's probably one other guy, Jerry.

1322
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,000
He probably plays more than I do, but definitely I play a crazy amount of that game.

1323
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I think that the community, I think it's probably just as toxic as League, but it's

1324
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
a lot harder to talk shit on a controller.

1325
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah, there's another good point.

1326
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I think most people are using controllers.

1327
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

1328
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
God.

1329
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So you guys are playing on like Xbox one.

1330
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I played on the PC.

1331
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah.

1332
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Oh yeah.

1333
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
We all play on the PC.

1334
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That's the one good thing about the game though.

1335
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Cause Aaron always has issues with PC because there's like the skill gap between mouse and

1336
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
keyboard typically and, and controller.

1337
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Right.

1338
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And in smite, it really seems like that's nullified.

1339
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Like you can do work with just a controller and throw down with people using keyboard

1340
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
mouse.

1341
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah.

1342
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yeah.

1343
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You can go toe to toe.

1344
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Like you can think of a first person shooter versus, you know, controls versus a mouse

1345
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and keyboard.

1346
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Mouse and keyboard smashes all the time.

1347
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Right.

1348
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's why I bought Doom on PC.

1349
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Exactly.

1350
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah.

1351
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But when it comes to smite, it's like you're on a level playing field.

1352
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Like, yeah, you couldn't tell the difference.

1353
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah.

1354
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Like the, the game I do play a lot of Fung-Hezi 14, you know, that exists on PlayStation four

1355
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and PC and I got to say they did a good job.

1356
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So I feel like they're figuring it out now.

1357
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yeah.

1358
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah.

1359
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You can do PVP with the PlayStation four people.

1360
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm on PC and it's there.

1361
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's toe to toe.

1362
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It's, it's same, same.

1363
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Okay.

1364
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So smite.

1365
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Awesome.

1366
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Cool.

1367
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Uh, Corey, what about you?

1368
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, I did play smite with them earlier in the week.

1369
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I made some time to, uh, start playing fallout four again.

1370
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Uh, I'm not jumping into the DLC quite yet.

1371
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
The far Harbor stuff, because I, I started a new, uh, I don't know.

1372
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Did you get a press copy of fallout four?

1373
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
No.

1374
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Okay.

1375
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Yeah.

1376
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So I'm in my version and we played through and it was the first time I've seen this.

1377
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It said press copy.

1378
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And as soon as the, uh, game launched, it disappeared out of my steam library.

1379
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So that was like pretty cheesed.

1380
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It took me a while before I got it back.

1381
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And in, in the interim I had to redo my computer, so I lost my save file.

1382
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Interesting.

1383
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I thought I'd heard about that, that they like had pulled it from steam libraries and

1384
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
stuff.

1385
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It was kind of interesting.

1386
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah.

1387
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So it took me a while to get back.

1388
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,680
So I'm in my second play through having a very hard time getting through the story for

1389
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,560
a second time, just because it's so bad.

1390
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,560
But I'm almost there.

1391
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,200
And then once I get through that, I'll start playing the DLC.

1392
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:20,880
I also got to do my regular street fighter five training and then that's, that's been

1393
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
my week.

1394
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,880
All right.

1395
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,280
Aaron, what about you?

1396
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,400
Lots of smite of course.

1397
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,760
Um, and then I literally on my phone, I picked up this game called a color switch.

1398
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,080
I don't know if anybody's played that before.

1399
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,640
Basically you just tap the screen to have the colored ball go through the same color

1400
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,960
and it'll have obstacles in between.

1401
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,320
So it's like four colors, but you're trying to get like purple through purple, red through

1402
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,000
red and the obstacles will spin or go side to side.

1403
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,320
And if you don't hit the right color with it, it'll blow up and it's literally like

1404
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,360
flappy birds just with a different tape.

1405
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,540
But it's, it's really addicting.

1406
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,240
Like you can sit in a, I don't know, like an office or on your lunch break or something

1407
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,320
and you just tap away and well, that's a phone games are really best.

1408
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,320
Exactly.

1409
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,320
Yeah.

1410
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,680
So I mean, I've kind of been playing the water down and becoming a phone game gamer for a

1411
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,200
little while, but yeah, I like it.

1412
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,200
It's fun.

1413
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,200
So nothing wrong with that.

1414
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,640
Loki, how about you?

1415
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,880
I played all sorts of weird shit this week.

1416
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,440
So um, I finally, I realized that the, Hey, there's an app on my, um, on play, the play

1417
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,640
store that I can actually run cardboard games on my gear VR.

1418
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,980
So I kind of experimented with that.

1419
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:38,600
Next I played a little bit of Vanguard V. I tried this in mind VR and in cell VR, which

1420
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
are kind of neat.

1421
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,420
They're like little tech demo things.

1422
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:50,860
Um, and I'm glad that Vanguard runs, uh, well on my phone and then finally, finally I was

1423
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,480
able to find a controller at retail.

1424
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,900
And the clouds parted and the sun shined down and the angels started singing and blessed

1425
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,900
you.

1426
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,180
And then they started carrying Bluetooth, Android, clearly God heard last week's episode

1427
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,020
was like, I am so sick of this shit.

1428
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:11,500
It was at Best Buy, which, which makes sense because I was like, dude, you guys are selling

1429
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:18,080
gear VRs like by the boatloads and you have Minecraft out on it now.

1430
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,500
It requires a controller and you don't fucking sell the controller.

1431
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,180
I was, I was listening to that episode today and I was feeling really guilty cause I had

1432
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:35,380
two Bluetooth controllers sitting in my office and I haven't even connected them to my gear

1433
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,380
VR yet.

1434
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,860
I'm just looking at him.

1435
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,860
I have two.

1436
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,860
No, I got him.

1437
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,420
I got a steel series.

1438
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,380
Jamie sent me a text message earlier this week.

1439
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,660
Do you want to just go have these, get him a controller, shut them up.

1440
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:51,380
No, she didn't say that I did, but you know, but I did, I did say so because one of one

1441
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,500
of my coworkers listens to the show and he messages me like, why doesn't he just order

1442
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,780
it online?

1443
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,540
Because I'm not shipping that shit.

1444
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,340
I just want to get it out of store and get it.

1445
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,820
We're not going to rehash last week.

1446
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,820
Just don't.

1447
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,820
Prime exists.

1448
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,580
They, yes, I understand that.

1449
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,980
But the good news is he found the controller and now he can talk about playing it.

1450
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,980
Yes.

1451
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:18,620
So now I'm going to talk about playing Minecraft on gear VR and it's, it's pretty awesome.

1452
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:25,360
My only gripe about it would be that the lighting in the game during daytime, it's hard to

1453
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,200
see the world seems very flat.

1454
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,120
Like it doesn't, the 3d doesn't seem to pop on it.

1455
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
The earth is flat.

1456
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,120
Yes.

1457
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,300
The earth is flat in Minecraft.

1458
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:41,280
But yeah, so when it hits nighttime though, or when you have like different lighting than

1459
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,880
it actually kind of pops out a little bit more, but it's pretty fun.

1460
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,440
It's I built a, you know, mine cart and kind of a little roller coaster thing and you know,

1461
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,760
tried that out and yeah, it was nice.

1462
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,760
I'm playing in the mode.

1463
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,760
They have two different modes.

1464
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,240
VR casual mode type thing where, Oh, this is for most people won't get sick by this

1465
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,240
and there's one that's like, yeah, this one probably not for everybody.

1466
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,400
You're probably gonna get sick from it.

1467
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,480
So I'm playing in that mode.

1468
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,000
So VR is now in casual and hardcore.

1469
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yeah.

1470
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,200
They have tolerance modes or like different tolerance levels.

1471
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Actually.

1472
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
That's probably not such a bad idea.

1473
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Yeah.

1474
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
So it depends on how motion sick it gets.

1475
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,600
I'm playing in the actual one that you're probably going to get motion sick on because

1476
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,400
you turn faster and stuff.

1477
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,280
Otherwise it segments, it turns and slower.

1478
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,320
It is a little weird though, because like I'm very used to, you can use the right analog

1479
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,520
stick to turn and I do that to the term I look at stuff so I don't have to like just

1480
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,880
spin around where I'm sitting, but I'll be, you know, kind of forced to have it, trying

1481
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,720
to look up and I'm pushing up.

1482
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,800
I'm like, Oh wait, I got to move my head up.

1483
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
Oh, okay.

1484
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
There you go.

1485
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,800
I'll just take some getting used to.

1486
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Yeah.

1487
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,080
It takes some getting used to, but I love it.

1488
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,080
It's fantastic.

1489
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
It's seriously what would sell.

1490
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,800
I think this is going to sell a lot of people.

1491
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,360
Is there any multiplayer in it?

1492
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,680
Yes, there is actually, it's basically the same multiplayer as, um, any of the pocket

1493
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,680
edition stuff.

1494
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,680
So you can play with windows 10.

1495
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:02,360
Um, you can play with anybody that has the Android iOS, any of the, you know, pocket

1496
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
edition versions.

1497
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,360
Hmm.

1498
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
Yeah.

1499
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,360
I might have to pick that one up.

1500
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
So it's pretty awesome.

1501
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,980
Um, so after all that was said and done on all that angst a couple of weeks ago, it actually

1502
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,680
ended up being awesome.

1503
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,480
I spent $60 to buy a fucking controller to play a $7 game, but it's, but it's great.

1504
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,480
It sounds like you're having a good time.

1505
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,600
Yeah.

1506
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
That's the important part.

1507
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
It's great.

1508
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
And it runs smoothly.

1509
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,600
It's just, it runs great.

1510
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
So, and it's awesome.

1511
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,440
I mean, it didn't, yeah, the galaxy of six, the cooks sometimes when you playing different

1512
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,440
VR games.

1513
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,600
Um, and it actually didn't really seem to bother very much.

1514
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,600
So that was nice.

1515
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,840
Um, the other thing I played on a completely different spectrum since I got that Coleco

1516
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,520
a flashback console, I played some Coleco games.

1517
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,660
So Raz playing Jumpman jr bump and jump and pepper too.

1518
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,640
So loving that stuff.

1519
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,420
Totally going back to, I know Jumpman was on the Coleco.

1520
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,420
Yeah.

1521
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,420
Jumpman jr is on there.

1522
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,420
Yeah.

1523
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,060
I need a Commodore 64 flashback console.

1524
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,100
I need it bad.

1525
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,020
So man, that's the, um, the Drake one, right?

1526
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,020
Jumpman Jumpman.

1527
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,020
Yeah.

1528
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,020
I've played that.

1529
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,980
The only thing I didn't like though, they have like some home brew ones that were on

1530
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,980
there.

1531
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,980
Some home brew games that were made.

1532
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,460
The home brew games aren't good.

1533
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,980
They like overly complicated.

1534
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,540
They have this like mech shooter game that has like eight different buttons on there.

1535
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,380
And I'm like, dude, this is a fucking Coleco game.

1536
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,700
I don't need eight different action buttons on this.

1537
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,140
Uh, Bobby block, Bobby block open chats is Coleco chameleon.

1538
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,220
No, no, no.

1539
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,220
The Coleco flashback.

1540
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,980
There's a, there's a little bit of a difference.

1541
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:28,980
Yeah.

1542
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:32,220
This, I mean, you could probably shove this inside of an S you know, SNES jr, which then

1543
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,060
you can shove into like a Jaguar, uh, you know, console.

1544
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:42,620
It could be like a turducken of video.

1545
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,780
Are you saying that the Coleco chameleon was basically just a turducken?

1546
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,820
Um, it was a turd.

1547
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,820
Stop.

1548
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,860
He in chat says, Loki is actually happy.

1549
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,340
Screw global warming.

1550
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:58,620
We're in for a cold summer because I also got, he wasn't that orange cream milkshake

1551
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,620
in the beginning.

1552
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,620
Oh, well shit.

1553
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,060
See more cream, milkshake controller.

1554
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,060
There you go.

1555
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,060
Look, he's having the best week ever.

1556
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,060
All right.

1557
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,060
Uh, my gaming week.

1558
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,500
I'm going to talk about something a little different cause as far as like console PC,

1559
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,500
it's same old stuff.

1560
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:14,020
I'm still playing fall of SC 14 Diablo three, all that same stuff, but okay.

1561
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:18,700
So I went on a little bit of an adventure this weekend, uh, on Friday, my buddy Shane,

1562
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,820
we talk about on the show a lot and he's here sometimes.

1563
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,860
Uh, it's his birthday by the way.

1564
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,820
Um, which I think is actually, I'm lost track of what day it is.

1565
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,820
It's 23rd tomorrow.

1566
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,820
Yeah.

1567
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,820
23rd tomorrow.

1568
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:29,820
So tomorrow's his birthday.

1569
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,700
We went for an early birthday thing, uh, Friday.

1570
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,760
So we actually went to great America because they just opened up what the new mass effect

1571
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
ride at great America.

1572
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,760
Right?

1573
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
So we rode the ride.

1574
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,180
I would love to tell you what I thought about it, but we're teasing a video that we did.

1575
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,500
So look for that midweek.

1576
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,060
So I can't tell you about that right now.

1577
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,380
Uh, all the details give us just the tip.

1578
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:52,420
Uh, yes, I will say, um, it was not what I expected, which was both good and bad.

1579
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,420
Okay.

1580
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:57,420
So I'm going to watch that video now.

1581
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,340
I can tell you what I will be watching the video now because of that.

1582
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,340
Sounds good.

1583
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,340
All right.

1584
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,340
Um, but here's the other exciting thing.

1585
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:07,740
So also in San Jose, cause, um, you know, great America's in the San Jose area is right

1586
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,620
next door to where they had the super bowl, right?

1587
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:15,920
So not that far away, although an eternity in Bay area traffic, Jesus, God, uh, we went

1588
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,020
to a place called round one, which, um, I don't know if you guys have heard of this

1589
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,020
here cause they're not everywhere.

1590
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,380
It seems like they have a lot of them in like the Texas area.

1591
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:27,620
There's some in California Bay area, so Cal, uh, and I think there's some in Washington.

1592
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:32,180
I think there might be one in the Chicago area, but anyway, it's basically a Japanese

1593
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,260
arcade chain.

1594
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,780
I believe it's Japanese entertainment center, uh, that is starting to make way in the U

1595
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,540
S uh, you can.

1596
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,580
Even it has bowling inside of it.

1597
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,740
I promise more bowling talk.

1598
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,740
You have bowling there.

1599
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,740
You can do darts.

1600
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,140
You can rent a karaoke room.

1601
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,140
Like I don't know what store this used to be at the East Ridge mall, but I'm assuming

1602
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,780
it was something like a Kohl's or a, it was a, yeah, it was like a huge store, like a

1603
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:59,340
JC Penny's type of thing that they have turned into an entire entertainment complex.

1604
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,540
So kind of like Dave and busters, I guess, but without the restaurant.

1605
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,540
Okay.

1606
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,540
It's kind of like that type of thing.

1607
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,620
Um, because I, or at least if there was a restaurant, I didn't fucking see it because

1608
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:14,140
I was too distracted by what was in the arcade because the arcade was like nothing but Japanese

1609
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,140
games.

1610
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,420
So yes, there were the ticket spitters and all that garbage, although there were actually

1611
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,420
some really fun ones.

1612
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,780
Like there was one that was like a giant piano.

1613
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:26,100
And so I would just like you then literally gives you tickets for banging on the keys.

1614
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,180
So I could go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and it was like giving me what they needed

1615
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,180
golf land.

1616
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,340
This is like this is what they need everywhere.

1617
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,100
I had so much fun.

1618
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,180
Um, and this is the crazy thing.

1619
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:42,480
Like the arcade, I would, okay, so this show started because of things like DDR and road

1620
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,580
trips to play things like para para paradise and games they only had in Japan.

1621
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:53,300
Do you know how much 25 year old Rob Robert shit his pants being in this place?

1622
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,980
It was amazing.

1623
01:08:54,980 --> 01:09:03,380
Like dark soccer, rows and rows of UFO catchers with adorable next week, little hamster plushies.

1624
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,480
We're going next week.

1625
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,080
You can take, you can take my card and spend the rest of what we didn't spend.

1626
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,080
Okay.

1627
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,860
So I got to play some music based games that like, you know, cause we still have a lot

1628
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:18,280
of music game fans that listen to OLR and I'm very thankful for you guys, but you guys

1629
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,280
kind of know I've, I've kind of lost touch with some of that and I haven't followed as

1630
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,740
closely as I used to, but now I kind of got to actually play some of those games because

1631
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,380
this round one place had them.

1632
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,320
So I played the newest BeatMania 2DX, the copula or whatever it's called, which is awesome.

1633
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,600
I played a new game called Musica.

1634
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,920
I don't know if I'm saying that right.

1635
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,920
Musica.

1636
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,920
Okay.

1637
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,800
So imagine you take, you guys know pop and music.

1638
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:44,200
It's got these giant buttons and you slam the buttons with the notes to make music.

1639
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,960
Basically when the little note hits the bottom, you hit these, it's like the a problematic

1640
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,600
bubble on trouble, right?

1641
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,600
That's like pop and music.

1642
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
Okay.

1643
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:57,120
Musica is kind of like that, but instead of five buttons, it's five little turntables

1644
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:02,140
and what you do, you can either slam the turntable down like a big button or you can spin it.

1645
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,820
So as the notes are coming down, it's either a note that you hit or it's something that

1646
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,220
you spin and they decided to throw in a foot pedal.

1647
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,220
Why?

1648
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,220
I don't know.

1649
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,220
Foot pedal.

1650
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,620
But I'll tell you, I love that game.

1651
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:21,140
That took me back to being like 25 when this show started and I was like, I would have

1652
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,780
drove to Arcade Infinity to play this.

1653
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,780
This is a lot of fun.

1654
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:24,780
That seems very difficult.

1655
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:27,580
Like it would get challenging quickly.

1656
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,580
These games are.

1657
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:35,140
I've been a musician for 15, 16 years, a drummer, and that takes, you'd think it takes a lot

1658
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,140
of coordination.

1659
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,220
You know, there's a lot of things going on, but I look like a child, an infant when it

1660
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:44,380
comes to some of these games where you're waving your hand below and on top of it to

1661
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,380
make the music keep going.

1662
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,380
Dance Maniacs.

1663
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,380
Is that the one I'm thinking of?

1664
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,380
Yep.

1665
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,380
I see it.

1666
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,380
I try it.

1667
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,380
I'm like, yeah, I'm a musician.

1668
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,380
Screw it.

1669
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,380
Here's my quarters.

1670
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,380
Watch me kick ass.

1671
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,380
And no, it does not work.

1672
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,700
And I think that also kind of ties into like what types of genre games you just might be

1673
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,700
into because like, you know, you talk about the division of some of these shooters and

1674
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,580
when I play a first person shooter, I'm like, I just run in there and get killed.

1675
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,300
I get shot in the face and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.

1676
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,560
You know, so I play those types of games, but music games, like because I played them

1677
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,940
so fucking much, like when this show started and when I was around that age, like I just

1678
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,220
kind of picked it up second nature.

1679
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:19,700
Like when I played the first little song and music, I'm like, this is too fucking easy.

1680
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,700
Come on.

1681
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:24,780
So like I had to like amp up the difficulty and it was, it was crazy, but it was, it's

1682
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,780
fun.

1683
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,540
So like it's neon, it's bright, it's Japanese.

1684
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,540
It's everything I love.

1685
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:35,180
Were you still like, you know, good at two DX or was that just kind of like, oh boy,

1686
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,340
have I regressed on that shit.

1687
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,420
I failed songs.

1688
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,860
I used to be great at like, that was a very humble pie experience.

1689
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:46,540
Uh, some other games quickly I played, there's a game called cross beats, which is by Capcom.

1690
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:50,700
That's kind of like, um, DJ max technica or like elite beat agents.

1691
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,600
If you ever played that on the DS, we're like big arrows will kind of cross at one point

1692
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,400
and that's really, that's why they call it cross beats, but sometimes it's a whole note.

1693
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,680
Sometimes it's a, what was the other one?

1694
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,960
Oh, you flick it like a, like you would on like an iPhone or something like that.

1695
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,840
So I played that and that was cool cause it was by Capcom.

1696
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,520
So it has remixes from like Phoenix Wright and a street fighter.

1697
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,400
So yeah, you can kind of like play those songs and I was having fun with that.

1698
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:19,040
Um, I saw an arcade version of grooves, groove coaster, the iPhone game.

1699
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,040
Yeah.

1700
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,440
Like that is crazy.

1701
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,040
Um, and another iPhone game, the sum sum, the Disney, like the little match three with

1702
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,040
the Disney's head.

1703
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,040
That's very Japanese.

1704
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,040
Okay.

1705
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,040
Sue Sue.

1706
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,720
They have an arcade version of Sue Sue at round one and if you give it enough credits,

1707
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,720
you get a little like it actually spits out a physical, like it has like the fucking amiibo

1708
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,720
thing built into it.

1709
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:44,880
You get a physical Sue Sue that you can tap onto the arcade machine and you get its powers.

1710
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,040
That's where these right.

1711
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,740
That's where these arcade machines are going.

1712
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,980
They're fucking stealing everything from phones now because here's the thing.

1713
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,660
You can buy like an EMUs pass, Konami's like thing, official thing because, because round

1714
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:04,120
one is like a Japanese thing and has a deal with Konami, you can buy an official Konami

1715
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,120
EMUsment pass.

1716
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,620
I can just use the one I already have though, right?

1717
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,420
If you, if you happen to have one, sure.

1718
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:13,680
And you can actually, you tap this card on the 2DX machine or on Musica or on Crossbeats

1719
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,280
has a separate one cause it's Capcom.

1720
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,140
But on any of the Konami scenes machines, you type tap it and it saves your data.

1721
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:24,220
And of course, every time you play, you get coins and you can use coins to unlock skins

1722
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,580
and new songs and bullshit, but that's what you do on the phones.

1723
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,580
Right?

1724
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,580
Yeah.

1725
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,580
But that's awesome.

1726
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,580
Yes.

1727
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,580
That's why.

1728
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,580
I was like, where was this when I was 25?

1729
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,580
That's why we used to go to the arcade.

1730
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:40,020
It's like, damn, you know, max two there's, you know, the songs were so close to unlocking

1731
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,020
those.

1732
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,520
We just have to play more.

1733
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,860
They Akuma JP, our pal in Japan, Tumutumu, not Zoom Zoom.

1734
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,860
I did not know that.

1735
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,860
Tumutumu.

1736
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:49,860
That Disney one.

1737
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,860
But that was cute.

1738
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,860
I liked that one.

1739
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,620
They had a Silent Hill arcade machine.

1740
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,860
Oh my God.

1741
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,220
Like I saw it was just, it was being in little like anime convention heaven.

1742
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,220
It was gigantic.

1743
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,220
Right?

1744
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,780
It was a fucking like JC Penney's converted.

1745
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,780
It was huge.

1746
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,780
It's like a Dave and Busters.

1747
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,380
And I don't mean Roseville, Dave and Busters.

1748
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:09,300
I mean like, like, I don't know if you guys have been to Great Mall, Dave and Busters.

1749
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,300
It was like that big.

1750
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,860
Yeah, the Roseville one was kind of disappointing.

1751
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,860
Yeah, no, no.

1752
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:17,180
That one's like, they say that one's the littlest one in the entire chain next to Times Square.

1753
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,180
That's terrible.

1754
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,180
Yeah.

1755
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:22,460
So anyway, I have to give credit where credit is due.

1756
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:26,140
I don't mean to sound like a commercial whore, but I guess I'm going to a little bit.

1757
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,460
I loved round one.

1758
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,420
I had a fantastic time there.

1759
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:32,060
So this episode brought to you by round one.

1760
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,060
Right?

1761
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,060
And stamp stop.

1762
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,060
Oh my God.

1763
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,260
Just send me a $20 card every month.

1764
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,260
I'll be fine.

1765
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,580
Just build one in Sacramento.

1766
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,720
Well they are building one in Concord, apparently.

1767
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:47,100
So it's closer in San Jose, especially remember Bay Area traffic.

1768
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,140
Thank you.

1769
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:51,280
So I would rather just take the 680 to little John down and go there.

1770
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,860
So they're inching closer.

1771
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,620
So I'm excited.

1772
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,740
So yeah, that was my gaming week.

1773
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:03,180
And I'm sure a lot of the music game fans are going to be very thankful that I finally

1774
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:06,540
got to play some of these games that I'm really behind the times and playing.

1775
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,300
But yeah, man, I'm happy for that place.

1776
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,300
That takes me back.

1777
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,620
Drumscape was my game.

1778
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,980
Oh, the MTV Drumscape?

1779
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:13,980
Yeah.

1780
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,980
Oh yeah.

1781
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:19,580
And on the cruise beach boardwalk, I will put all the money I have in my pocket into

1782
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,900
that game.

1783
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,820
They have another one I'll talk about real quick.

1784
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:27,540
So Konami used to have a series Guitar Freaks and Drummania that was kind of like what there

1785
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,760
was before Guitar Hero.

1786
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,580
And Red Octane used to make controllers for people that imported that game and then Red

1787
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,580
Octane made Guitar Hero.

1788
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,580
So it's kind of like, you know, it kind of evolved one way or another.

1789
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:42,620
Well now Konami kind of bit back and so they have a game, they merged it into a game they

1790
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:46,620
just call Ghidadora and they have the five key.

1791
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,300
Now the guitar has five keys, kind of like Guitar Hero does.

1792
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,100
But the drum thing, okay, like back in the day it used to have only like five.

1793
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,860
But I, and I don't know drumming unfortunately.

1794
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:01,540
So all I can say is like, there was like nine thingies and there was like, like so many

1795
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:05,460
thingies and a foot pedal and I didn't know what the shit was what.

1796
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:12,460
Well they have the bass, two toms, and I want to say a hi-hat and maybe a cymbal.

1797
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,460
Okay.

1798
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,460
He's like, yeah, that sounds right.

1799
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,460
Oh sure.

1800
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:20,180
And a Neil Peart drum cage that lifts you above and spins you around.

1801
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,980
There was like a cymbal above the cymbal and I was like, whoa, this is like some 3D shit.

1802
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,980
Cymbalception.

1803
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:25,980
Yeah.

1804
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:26,980
Crazy.

1805
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:31,020
That's like when you get the like Rock Band 2 drum kit and you get all the extra, you

1806
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:35,020
know, cymbals and shit that you can actually attach to this kit.

1807
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,740
Oh, the Ion drum kit?

1808
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:41,420
No, not the Ion drum kit, the actual Rock Band drum kit they actually had additional

1809
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:46,020
accessories you could add to basically additional cymbals that would, I think it would map

1810
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:52,700
to the same buttons for like the older drum or the older Rock Band games, but the newer

1811
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,460
ones would actually detect them as different things.

1812
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:00,100
But yeah, I actually bought those for my drum kit that I don't play that's sitting in my

1813
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,100
garage.

1814
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,740
So you're not the only one.

1815
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,980
One of these days we're all going to have to do a giant road trip to round one.

1816
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,180
I think, I think you guys would have fun.

1817
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,180
I'm in.

1818
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,180
Be a good time.

1819
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,620
We're going to, uh, Bree and Gabe about it from the indie, they want to go.

1820
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:15,180
I know Bree does, so we're going to have to, we'll just rent a bus.

1821
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,180
Yeah.

1822
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,180
All right.

1823
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:18,180
We'll call it the bang bus.

1824
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,180
Yeah.

1825
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:27,420
But we need a giant logo on the side so everybody is aware of what.

1826
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,780
I'll drive my own car then behind you guys.

1827
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,740
Aaron, do you have room in your car?

1828
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,740
Cause I don't want to be on the big bus.

1829
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,740
Sure.

1830
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,740
Yeah.

1831
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,740
Okay.

1832
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,740
Be by myself.

1833
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,740
I don't care.

1834
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,300
All over random people.

1835
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:45,100
Hey, guys, the bang bus is going around one.

1836
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,620
Would you say you'd be a master banger then?

1837
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,700
All right.

1838
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:55,580
Uh, let's move on, uh, act after saying heck vodcon at round one, you know, they have party

1839
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,580
rooms.

1840
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,580
Why not?

1841
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,580
All right.

1842
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,340
Anyway, let's get, uh, just some quick housekeeping.

1843
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,100
I don't really have a lot to say except, you know, the usual follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

1844
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,100
slash O L R.

1845
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,900
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, Google plus as well.

1846
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,620
If you're, you know, you're still doing that thing.

1847
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:15,900
Um, so yeah, and as far as upcoming shows, I don't think there's anything off that we're

1848
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,940
going to be, uh, taking off until we get to labor day and dragon con, cause I'll be out

1849
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:20,940
at dragon con.

1850
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,460
So I won't be here that week.

1851
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,400
I do want to give though a quick shout out because I think we're only just about three

1852
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,400
weeks away.

1853
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,220
A vog network is sponsoring these Southern fried game room expo in Atlanta.

1854
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:33,980
Um, which, you know, talk about all these cool arcade machines under one roof.

1855
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,980
Okay.

1856
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,980
Instead of like flashy Japanese stuff, make it retro arcade and pinball.

1857
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,820
And that's what they're going to have at this, uh, Southern fried game room expo in Atlanta.

1858
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,820
So that'll be fun.

1859
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:46,180
They do a very, very, very similar thing in California called California extreme.

1860
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,860
If you guys don't know the details on that, I think that's in July.

1861
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:49,860
Check that out.

1862
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,860
Yeah.

1863
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,860
That's a lot of fun.

1864
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:52,860
But that one every year.

1865
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:53,860
Yeah.

1866
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:54,860
Oh yeah.

1867
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:55,860
So that one is a lot of fun.

1868
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,860
So love football.

1869
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:00,420
Super happy if Steve Ritchie makes it again this year cause he was, he was fun.

1870
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:04,020
He designed a lot of pinball tables that probably everyone grew up with.

1871
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,020
Yeah.

1872
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,420
And a lot, a lot of those like retro game making celebrities show up at these types

1873
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,420
of conventions.

1874
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:12,940
So I know Southern fried game room expo has their own, um, our own Bobby Black Wolf is

1875
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,460
going to be speaking on a couple of panels there.

1876
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,460
So check that out.

1877
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,460
That's going to be the Atlanta area.

1878
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:21,420
I think it's June 10th through 12th, a question mark on those dates cause I don't have them

1879
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,700
up in front of me, but I'm sure Bobby will advise me right now if I'm wrong, but that

1880
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,700
sounds right.

1881
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:26,700
Oh, Rob got it.

1882
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,700
Right.

1883
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,420
There you go.

1884
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:34,980
So register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at bognetwork.com.

1885
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,940
Use the pass phrase, Archer.

1886
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,940
All right.

1887
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,340
Uh, let's get into some news for the week.

1888
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,820
And of course you guys, uh, from Video Game Bank, please, please feel free to comment

1889
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,300
on the news as we're going over it here.

1890
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,300
All right.

1891
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:52,300
So Minecraft is making its way to China, um, because you know, just recently they kind

1892
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,120
of lifted the ban from all that, you know, those different game consoles and everything

1893
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,120
coming out there.

1894
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,080
I guess they're just trying to expand the China because, Hey, there's billions of people

1895
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,960
there and why not?

1896
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,860
So they're going to be a teaming up with NetEase to expand Minecraft into China.

1897
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:11,000
They have a five year license to publish the game and should be coming out soon.

1898
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,400
That is going to be massive over there.

1899
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,400
I think so.

1900
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,460
You already said there's billions of people over there.

1901
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,880
So yeah, they were saying, uh, was it a 1.3, 5 billion?

1902
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,880
Oh yeah.

1903
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,880
Most of them are smarter than us anyways.

1904
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,940
So you think we've designed some pretty engineered, some pretty cool contraptions.

1905
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:27,940
It's about to go to a whole new level.

1906
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:30,440
And now the Chinese have their hands on it.

1907
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,800
This is cancer cured.

1908
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,680
This is following what we talked about last week, where there's those two consoles in

1909
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,040
China that they just announced.

1910
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,640
So it's like, I really feel like, okay, we are on, like, there's going to be a game bang

1911
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,780
in China, like in the coming, in the coming years, because like, it really feels like

1912
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,300
ever since they lifted that restriction on, on the consoles, what, like a year and a half

1913
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,840
ago or whenever it was like, now it's like, Oh boy.

1914
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,080
Now the dam's starting to burst and China's going to have gamers everywhere.

1915
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:03,040
And you say that they're smarter than us, but wait till the video games make them dumb.

1916
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,880
So is this a really, it's a giant tactic to bring them down to our level?

1917
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,760
It's a Kim Kardashian game.

1918
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:14,360
I'd be curious to see like how much of, you know, how many, how, how big that market could

1919
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,920
be because a lot of times, you know, you're looking at, you know, America kind of driving

1920
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,720
the market for like the Xbox and stuff, because, you know, we sell most of the consoles here,

1921
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:27,160
but like Japan kind of driving a lot of the Sony consoles and you see different kind of,

1922
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,200
you know, landscapes because of that.

1923
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,920
So I'm wondering if, you know, you have China driving, you know, you know, a marketplace

1924
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,560
for, who knows, one of these consoles be kind of interesting to see how that changes what

1925
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,880
games are released or what types of games they develop.

1926
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,880
Yeah.

1927
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,560
Cause right now, pretty much all your consoles, they're U S like basically Microsoft and Xbox

1928
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,960
or they're Japan like Nintendo.

1929
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,640
And I would really argue half Sony.

1930
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:55,200
I really feel like Sony's console operations, they're Japanese company, but I feel like

1931
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,520
it's all happening in the San Francisco Bay area where that console is.

1932
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,600
So it's kind of like halfsies with Sony.

1933
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,080
It would be very interesting if suddenly now China enters the conversation with whatever

1934
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,720
consoles they're bringing out.

1935
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,720
Be very, very interesting.

1936
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,640
Do we want a Chinese console?

1937
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,640
We will.

1938
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,640
We just talked about two of them last week.

1939
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,640
Yeah.

1940
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,360
I mean, that's the sound like, but I mean, you think it's going to bring communism?

1941
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,320
No, I'm not saying like that, but I don't, I don't know.

1942
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,320
It's going to be competition.

1943
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,320
One way or the other.

1944
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:27,160
Are you worried like, you know, like those, the V or like those other knockoff consoles?

1945
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,160
Yeah, exactly.

1946
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,160
That's what I'm exactly talking about.

1947
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,080
There are a lot of Chinese knockoff consoles.

1948
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,320
You're going into the mall like, Hey, this is kind of cool.

1949
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,880
It's a Nintendo with like some zapper gun.

1950
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,880
It looks like a pistol.

1951
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,880
Yeah, exactly.

1952
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,840
It's got like a hundred games built in.

1953
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,800
I don't think that's legit, but yeah, but I think, I think the restrictions that the

1954
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,760
country had was what was lending to that.

1955
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,840
It was kind of like they had to make their own knockoffs cause they couldn't, you know,

1956
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,640
they didn't, they didn't have the type of freedom that they're going to have now.

1957
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,640
There's a lot.

1958
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,200
I used to watch the YouTube reviews on them just to see what they were and it's like,

1959
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,760
they were all, this feels plastic.

1960
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:05,120
I'm like, well, it's a Chinese console right now and that's all they've been producing

1961
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,200
for the last, like, you know, like grocery store consoles, like you can go find that

1962
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,760
at an Albertsons and it'd be in the aisle with the produce or something like that.

1963
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,880
And you just pick it up and you play with it.

1964
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:22,480
But I mean, if, if you say like the restrictions being dropped and now they're, you make it

1965
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,920
sound like though, in my opinion, you make it sound like now technology is reaching them

1966
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,920
and they can use mic and chips.

1967
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:29,920
Fair enough.

1968
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,920
Sort of.

1969
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:31,920
I don't know.

1970
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:32,920
They're letting them reach them now.

1971
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,440
They have Bluetooth now over there.

1972
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,440
What can they do?

1973
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,440
The possibilities.

1974
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,480
Hey, uh, the phone, aren't there, isn't there a phone game in China, like way beyond where

1975
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,400
we're at or am I, am I confusing it?

1976
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,540
I wouldn't doubt it.

1977
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,440
It's like a mystery over there.

1978
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:52,400
I've been into the show Vikings, you know, so I see us as the Vikings and with them as

1979
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,400
like the English people.

1980
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Highly advanced Wakandians.

1981
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,400
Is that what they are?

1982
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Yeah, exactly.

1983
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,400
All right.

1984
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,400
Uh, let's see.

1985
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:06,420
Uh, go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com uh, Akuma JP says, nah, Chinese copy stuff.

1986
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,420
That's half of their economy.

1987
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,420
Hmm.

1988
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,420
Uh, let's see.

1989
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,900
Dungeon buster says if you walk around Beijing, communism is the last thing anyone gets an

1990
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,320
impression of nowadays.

1991
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,580
So maybe things are, are changing and we'll say this, this is, this is the sign of maybe

1992
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,140
some type of like greater shift or something.

1993
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,140
Who knows?

1994
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,140
Who knows?

1995
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:26,740
Anyway, let's move on and talk about, I think something that a lot of folks been talking

1996
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,620
about on gaming blogs, on Twitter and all this stuff this week.

1997
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,980
And that's that Tetris movie.

1998
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,300
Have you all heard about this?

1999
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:37,220
Uh, Tetris, not just one movie.

2000
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:42,420
Apparently they've already said, go ahead and make a damn trilogy, a trilogy of Tetris

2001
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,460
movies, $80 million budget.

2002
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,500
I am I being punked with this story?

2003
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,500
I swear to God.

2004
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,740
$80 million for the first movie or all three, because that's, that's different.

2005
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,740
Yeah.

2006
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,740
It's probably going to be one of those things.

2007
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:55,740
I shoot them all at once.

2008
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,740
That's, that's what they do these days.

2009
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,740
Right?

2010
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,740
Shoot all the movies at once.

2011
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,820
I know we look at them at CG, live action.

2012
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:01,820
What are we talking?

2013
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:07,860
It is being promoted as a sci-fi thriller, thriller, thriller.

2014
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:13,200
I don't get that feeling every time I play it's gonna be played by Vin Diesel and that's,

2015
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,580
that's why I'm getting a little nervous about this whole lie.

2016
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,580
Am I being punked right now?

2017
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,220
You know what other games, you know, other game was a good sci-fi thriller.

2018
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:25,060
Somebody made their own NX and fooled the entire internet.

2019
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:26,060
Just want to remind y'all.

2020
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,060
I'm sorry, Loki.

2021
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,060
You had a joke.

2022
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,060
Yeah.

2023
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,580
I was going to say, you know what, you know what other game had a nice sci-fi thriller

2024
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,460
movie that made, you know, out to theaters?

2025
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,460
Battleship.

2026
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,460
Remember how that turned out?

2027
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,760
It's the first one that came to mind.

2028
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,760
The Rihanna movie.

2029
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,760
Yeah.

2030
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,760
The Rihanna.

2031
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,760
That's what we think of it as.

2032
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,760
The Rihanna movie.

2033
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,460
Was that the one that had Ralph Fiennes in that epic climatic scene?

2034
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,460
You sunk my battleship.

2035
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,980
You got to put that in there somewhere.

2036
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:48,980
Yeah.

2037
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:53,620
That's why I said, if that line isn't in the movie, fuck it.

2038
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:55,820
Is Tetris going to be a follow up to Pixels?

2039
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,160
Is this like a sequel?

2040
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,040
Like the aliens come back and they're just now all Tetris shapes.

2041
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,040
So we have...

2042
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,040
If Jack Black gets attached, I'm out.

2043
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,280
Do we have anybody attached so far or is it just, hey, we're going to make one?

2044
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,240
I do not think there's a...

2045
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,240
It's going to be...

2046
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,840
They're going to actually film the first movie in China and other locations in 2017.

2047
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,840
Cheap knockoffs, huh?

2048
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,720
Oh, the cast will be Chinese.

2049
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,320
It's a China-US co-production under Threshold Global Studios.

2050
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,280
So the cast will be Chinese.

2051
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:28,200
Bruno Wu and producer Larry Kasanoff are co-producers.

2052
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:33,900
Now Larry Kasanoff was actually a producer on the Mortal Kombat movie, which, say what

2053
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,760
you will, that was probably one of the better video game movies probably to this day.

2054
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,760
Number one?

2055
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,760
Part one?

2056
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,760
Huh?

2057
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,760
Part one we're talking about.

2058
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,760
There's only one anyway.

2059
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,760
All right.

2060
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,760
Yeah.

2061
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,760
Mortal Kombat one, that's it.

2062
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,760
There we go.

2063
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,560
But that has some semblance of a fucking plot to it, whereas Tetris is a puzzle game.

2064
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,600
There's some plot.

2065
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,000
There's some tension there when you're on level 12 and they're coming down pretty fast.

2066
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,080
So when we talk about a Chinese-US co-production thing, I think about the Crouching Tiger

2067
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,080
Hidden Dragon.

2068
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,080
I think it was kind of like that too.

2069
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,080
Yeah, that was very good.

2070
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:11,640
Because you had Ang Lee that had directed that movie, but they had shot and they filmed

2071
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:18,520
it in China and the cast was Chinese, but they ended up releasing it over here.

2072
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,240
When you say sci-fi thriller, I'm thinking it has to be some type of coding movie.

2073
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,280
They're going to make it some type of hackers, but in China.

2074
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,520
And then just surrounding the whole hacking system is Tetris.

2075
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:35,120
And that's what you have to do, is to break some code, you have to play Tetris.

2076
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,120
That's the only thing I can think of.

2077
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:40,600
I don't think they're going to actually have large physical blocks falling from the sky.

2078
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:46,600
They have to build a Tetris wall around Earth to save them from the invading shapeless things.

2079
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
You know what?

2080
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:53,040
As much as you say that as a joke, maybe that's kind of what it is, is that the game it's

2081
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,880
self is kind of non-important, like the Battleship movie, as much as we're kind of like laughing

2082
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:57,880
at that.

2083
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,560
How much you want to bet they're going to have like nanomachines or something in this

2084
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,320
where they're just going to have to like, I don't know.

2085
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,440
It sounds terrible.

2086
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,280
They have to build a wall around the Earth and they're missing the piece that they need.

2087
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,280
Wow.

2088
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,600
So they're searching the galaxy for a straight line?

2089
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:19,520
I vow, here and now, not going to see it.

2090
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,640
I will see Angry Birds before I see that.

2091
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,960
Angry Birds seems okay.

2092
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,880
Angry Birds will actually have a plot because the game has a plot.

2093
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,120
Is there no lore to Tetris?

2094
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,120
Because you're a Tetris guy.

2095
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,000
Is there like a story that we don't know when you just pick it up?

2096
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Is there like...

2097
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I, in high school, being caught playing Tetris in my computer class, my teacher made me write

2098
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:47,120
a four page essay on Tetris and I could not research any lore behind it.

2099
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,120
It was just...

2100
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,120
But the dude got screwed over royally.

2101
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,120
Oh, he got screwed over royally.

2102
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,800
Well, he got his upcoming, so he's good now.

2103
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,000
And then he went on to make other games.

2104
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,200
But yeah, there's no lore in the original Tetris.

2105
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,200
There may be some now in some newer versions, but...

2106
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,520
As long as they don't base it off that horrible fucking PlayStation version with a little

2107
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,960
archaeologist that would walk by.

2108
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,140
I couldn't stand that one.

2109
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:18,600
We have Mr. Pajitnov, drunk in college on lots of vodka.

2110
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Staring at the little pixel blips on his monochrome screen, going, you know, I think

2111
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,680
these would fit a certain way.

2112
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,120
I will make a game instead of doing my job.

2113
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,120
And there's history.

2114
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,120
And there it is.

2115
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:39,760
And then he goes up to the Kremlin and goes, fuck you!

2116
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,760
The Kremlin.

2117
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,760
I made a game.

2118
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,320
Yes, there is no story to Tetris.

2119
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,720
Let's wait and see a trailer.

2120
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,680
Let's wait and see what actors are on it and what kind of talent is in it.

2121
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,680
Let's see.

2122
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:52,680
Let's see what...

2123
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,280
Let's wait till the trailer.

2124
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,280
I'll give it that.

2125
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,280
But I just...

2126
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:00,040
The part that's really weird to me is, A, the sci-fi thriller.

2127
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,520
And B, the fact that it's already a trilogy.

2128
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,520
That's a concern.

2129
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,520
Yeah.

2130
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,920
Sci-fi thriller instead of romantic comedy, because that's what I see Tetris as.

2131
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,760
And then already a trilogy when it should literally be four.

2132
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,840
I mean, it's Tetris, like four is the number.

2133
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,840
That's true.

2134
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,840
A quad...

2135
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,840
A quadri...

2136
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,840
Yeah, a quadri...

2137
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:23,840
A Tetris.

2138
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,840
A Tetris.

2139
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,840
Yeah.

2140
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:31,480
I just think that the producers and whoever thought this was a good idea, the same way

2141
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,080
drunk frat boys think certain things are good ideas.

2142
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,080
Maybe, yeah.

2143
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,120
Dude, I got an idea.

2144
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,400
There's still a Monopoly movie coming at some point.

2145
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,400
Oh, really?

2146
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,600
And it's still a mousetrap movie, I think.

2147
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,920
They released the Ouija movie.

2148
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,040
Mousetrap could be fun.

2149
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,000
Mousetrap was kind of fucking rad, though.

2150
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,600
If it's done like a little first person mousie, like Stuart Little or something.

2151
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,720
Whoever builds those things in the Pee Wee Herman movies.

2152
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,880
You're saying like a hardcore Harry meets Ratatouille?

2153
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,880
There you go.

2154
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,880
You've just made the movie.

2155
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:06,720
And just have it all from that little miniature point of view and having to get through the

2156
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,720
mousetrap.

2157
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,680
Oh, what's the cage thing coming down?

2158
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,080
Like the commercials were, right?

2159
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,080
Yeah.

2160
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,080
Those would be great.

2161
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,240
That would be a crossfire movie.

2162
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,240
You know what?

2163
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,320
I would be down for that now.

2164
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,160
I want the kids, though, who are in the commercial in the movie.

2165
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,680
You know, they're probably like 40 now.

2166
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,680
I think.

2167
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,760
They're pro crossfire players.

2168
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,600
We need to do a list list for the plot of the Tetris movie.

2169
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,000
Okay, we'll have to do that.

2170
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,600
This show is already running way too long.

2171
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,600
I know, that's right.

2172
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,600
We'll do that in a future week.

2173
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,600
All right, that's right.

2174
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,600
I want to read this quick comment from chat.

2175
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,600
Bobby Black Wolf.

2176
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,720
Tetris 1 will be the sci-fi thriller.

2177
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:41,140
Tetris 2 will be the romantic comedy.

2178
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:43,260
And Tetris 3 will be the feel good kids cartoon.

2179
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,260
There you go.

2180
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,860
Maybe some genres switch up.

2181
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,860
Yeah.

2182
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,860
All right.

2183
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:48,860
Let's move on.

2184
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:49,860
Dark Soccer.

2185
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:50,860
What do you have for us?

2186
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,620
Well, we knew it wouldn't end.

2187
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:57,220
We knew there would be another Five Nights at Freddy's.

2188
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:01,500
There is a new Five Nights at Freddy's sequel.

2189
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,860
Oh, that's my version of an echo.

2190
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:07,500
Even after the final Five Nights at Freddy's.

2191
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,500
Right?

2192
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,500
Liar.

2193
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:13,260
There was the RPG that probably should not have happened.

2194
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,280
I want the RPG though to actually come out because I would play the crap out of that.

2195
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,280
It's out.

2196
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,280
That's the problem.

2197
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,460
No, I mean, I want it to like be fixed and come out because they took it down to fix

2198
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:23,460
it.

2199
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,460
Right?

2200
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,460
No, I think it's bad.

2201
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:26,460
I think they don't.

2202
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,660
I think he's going to re-release it for free or something.

2203
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:29,860
I don't remember what the deal was, but anyway, new one.

2204
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:33,340
I still have that as my ringtone thing anyway.

2205
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:38,300
So Five Nights at Freddy's, the sequel is called Sister Location and oh my God, the

2206
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,580
animatronics are even creepier in this one.

2207
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:42,420
Their faces like come apart.

2208
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,260
If it's Sister Location, is it like Francine now?

2209
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,260
No.

2210
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,260
Five Nights at Francine's?

2211
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,540
Is that what they're doing?

2212
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:57,420
It has a new head animatronic called, I think, Dolly.

2213
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:03,100
This little clown face, little girl with pigtails, but the way that the animatronics are is that

2214
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:07,880
they're split down the middle and they're split over the eyes, under the eyes, and across

2215
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:08,880
the mouth.

2216
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,940
So that parts expand and move in and out while the eyes move around.

2217
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:18,340
And I'm like, who the hell was designing these animatronics and thought this will be good

2218
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,340
for kids?

2219
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,340
My nightmares.

2220
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,920
Well, it's not exactly made for kids, but just looking at the trailer, I'm trying to

2221
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:31,680
see because some of the other animatronics are back.

2222
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,840
What was the white one called?

2223
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,840
God, I can't remember.

2224
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,440
That I think became the bangle.

2225
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,400
And I think Chica was in there.

2226
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,440
Chica's the one that always, have you guys played those Five Nights games?

2227
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,960
I played the very original first one.

2228
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:52,400
She gets me to play them on Twitch and I scream like a 12 year old girl when Chica comes out.

2229
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,720
It is an actual scary game.

2230
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,720
It's intense.

2231
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:00,280
I don't know how much the third or fourth iteration is.

2232
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,720
And Freddy's in it too, but it's like a purple Freddy, but I don't think he's the purple

2233
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,720
guy.

2234
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,920
I can't call him the purple man because the purple man was in Jessica was in, no, not

2235
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:13,120
just in the TV series, but it was alias and he was actually purple and his daughter was

2236
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,120
purple.

2237
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:19,220
So just saying, I know my comics, but yeah, it's looking like it's going to be pretty

2238
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:24,140
crazy and instead of being like a, in a little surveillance room where you're in the area,

2239
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:28,500
you're like in a basement surveillance room, like a big circle thing.

2240
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,840
And like they had people going through vents and things, so maybe you have to travel in

2241
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,840
between.

2242
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,960
It's a 360 degree thing this time.

2243
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:40,440
And it also had like the lights out deal like it had with the, um, the flashlight for the

2244
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:43,120
little boy in the last one.

2245
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,360
We'll just put that in the pile of games.

2246
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,360
I won't be playing.

2247
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:50,080
No, no disrespect to the creator who is, you know what, he's made a huge success for himself

2248
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,080
as an indie developer.

2249
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,080
What's his name?

2250
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,200
Thumbs up to you, bro.

2251
01:34:53,200 --> 01:35:00,680
Not going to play also, also Rob, I've decided that you're now going to have what's called

2252
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,240
the pile of nope.

2253
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,760
Well, I will apply one nope to this.

2254
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:12,420
And just looking at these, um, you know, the, the other, you know, suggestions to watch

2255
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,500
on YouTube for their little trailer.

2256
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,720
One of them is a Minecraft five nights.

2257
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,740
Five nights is huge.

2258
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:22,820
I mean, it's, it seems like every year you have that one indie success that like is not

2259
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,400
going to fucking stop Minecraft.

2260
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,400
Obviously.

2261
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,000
I think five nights was kind of like last year's game this year.

2262
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Stardew Valley.

2263
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,960
Someone still needs to buy for me.

2264
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:36,560
I haven't played it myself, but I have a coworker who comes up to me once per day and has to

2265
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,000
tell me everything that happened in the past year.

2266
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Yeah.

2267
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Of her game.

2268
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,800
It's insane how, how, uh, crazy addicted that game is.

2269
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,720
Of course they were also advertising, um, Alaska Thunderfucks last single.

2270
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,720
What?

2271
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,720
In my little thing.

2272
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,000
Cause it read it, read it off of my, uh, YouTube.

2273
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,880
Oh, cause YouTube spies on what you do.

2274
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,880
Cause YouTube spies on me.

2275
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,160
If you watch drag queen videos, it's going to be like, you watch five nights at Fridays.

2276
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,400
You watch, you're trying to be Lady Gaga.

2277
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,400
Scary drag queens.

2278
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,400
All right.

2279
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,400
You know what we need?

2280
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,400
It's a popular category.

2281
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,400
Category is.

2282
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,480
All right.

2283
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,480
So Pokemon go, um, you can actually test or sign up for the field test or beta test, whatever

2284
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,720
you want to call it.

2285
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:25,800
For Pokemon go, um, go to Pokemon go dot niantic.com and go there to our niantic labs.com.

2286
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:26,840
That's what I meant.

2287
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,000
Pokemon Pokemon go dot niantic labs.com to register.

2288
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,560
Uh, they are seeming to, I don't know if they're, you know, um, giving preference to people

2289
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:41,800
that play ingress, but they do ask if, you know, if you play ingress, what's your agent

2290
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,920
ID, what's your level, finally, finally, all that addiction is going to pay off.

2291
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,800
And then of course you need a Gmail address and a mobile device to be able to play it.

2292
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,940
So I signed up for it just to see what it is.

2293
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:55,120
I really have no interest in Pokemon, but I'll, I'll check it out.

2294
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,720
What do you guys think from what you've heard about Pokemon go?

2295
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:00,920
I think it's going to be the, I, I, I, I'm going to kind of go on a rant in a minute

2296
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,120
here, but I still think this is going to be the biggest mobile game since candy crush.

2297
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,120
I really do.

2298
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,000
I think it's going to kill people.

2299
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,280
First of all, I think like they're going to put a Mewtwo in the middle of a penitentiary

2300
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:16,800
and some kids going to go try and catch a Diglett or something.

2301
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,600
Breaking and entering is going to be all time high.

2302
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,760
And then I think what's going to happen though, I think this is for reals, I'm pretty sure

2303
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:26,320
like target, it's going to cut a deal where it's like, if you come to the kid's section

2304
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,760
of target on North gate, you'll get Pikachu in a birthday hat.

2305
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,600
Oh, that's what, that's what they do in Ingress now.

2306
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,200
Like a Jamba juices used to all be portals in Ingress.

2307
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,200
Yeah.

2308
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,200
So that'll happen.

2309
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
Absolutely.

2310
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,200
Yeah.

2311
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,400
It's going to take the world by storm big time.

2312
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,520
I mean it's bringing Pokemon to life.

2313
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,720
I mean all they have to do is start releasing animatronic Pokemon out in the world that

2314
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,720
randomly just walk around.

2315
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,720
That's the only thing that could be bigger.

2316
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:56,000
Kids going to walk into the middle of a freeway trying to catch a Bulbasaur and then the game

2317
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
will be over.

2318
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Yeah.

2319
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,120
Luckily I, you know, and I've played Ingress for a while now, their other game and I don't

2320
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:06,480
see like portals in the middle of freeways, but they do have portals in some like, so

2321
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:11,080
hopefully somebody's screening them a little bit because like I know a guy the other day

2322
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:15,940
that went to go get a portal that's basically right on the Mexican border in the middle

2323
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:21,440
of the desert and I don't know why there's a fucking portal there, but there was, and

2324
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,280
he had to get it for reasons.

2325
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,480
So yeah, I, I, it would be very interesting to see where these Pokemon gyms or whatever

2326
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,480
show.

2327
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,840
A lot of them, especially in our area that just, they're not there anymore.

2328
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:36,280
Like it's, Oh yeah, here's a fountain for this restaurant that's closed down or Hey,

2329
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,860
here's one for this giant mural that's not there anymore.

2330
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:42,560
Here's one for another mural that's was on a building that's torn down.

2331
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,560
Yeah.

2332
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,560
Come on.

2333
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,040
So here's my thing and I got to get this off my chest cause I mentioned I have some reservations

2334
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:52,240
and so obviously I've been playing Niantic's other game Ingress for a very long time and

2335
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:56,000
just within the past few days I'm starting to get really fucking irritated at something

2336
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,600
in Ingress and I think if Niantic is going to be this and that's going to be their niche

2337
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,920
is that we are the GPS global phone game exploration thing.

2338
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,280
They have got to figure this problem out and that problem is people spoofing their phone

2339
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:15,540
location and being places where they really are not because I'm going to tell you it's

2340
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:19,760
extremely fucking frustrating to work with other people.

2341
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,760
That's not the hard part.

2342
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:21,760
I like that part.

2343
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,500
Work with other people to accomplish this big task where I don't know if you guys know

2344
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:30,060
Ingress, but basically like you try to connect these real world places together to make,

2345
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:34,780
make triangles, but no lines can cross, but sometimes you can make very large triangles.

2346
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:39,020
Let's say a triangle that goes all the way from Hawaii to Mount Lassen to Baja, Mexico

2347
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,580
and back like sometimes and you get like 40 people involved to me.

2348
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,580
It's like a fucking raid.

2349
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:44,580
I love that you mentioned Mount Lassen.

2350
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:46,180
That's one of my favorite places in the world.

2351
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,180
Yeah.

2352
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,180
Right.

2353
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,180
Why did you say that?

2354
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,180
Because that actually happened.

2355
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,180
I feel like I had a Batman moment.

2356
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:55,700
Why didn't you just said Martha?

2357
01:39:55,700 --> 01:40:00,420
Because those are all real places that this just happened the other day and you know,

2358
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:05,860
a lot of people worked on it to make it only to have a person spoof their location and

2359
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:13,740
take it down right away and everybody knows that the person was lying because the team

2360
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:19,620
that threw it in Hawaii is right there going, we are on a beach and nobody else is here.

2361
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,180
Like it is just us.

2362
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,580
This is a spoofer.

2363
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:24,900
So here's my thing.

2364
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,460
And it's not like I realize there's always going to be assholes that try to ruin it for

2365
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:32,460
everybody, but Niantic has got to figure out how they're going to police their fucking

2366
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,660
game better because they're not doing it well enough and it's starting to make me really

2367
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:38,660
not want to play that game anymore.

2368
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:40,660
Well I think they are catching those people are doing it, but they're just not really

2369
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,780
doing anything about it.

2370
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,060
They're like banning them for a week and then that's it.

2371
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,060
Yeah.

2372
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:46,060
And then they come right back.

2373
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,820
It's not like there's, there's no other repercussions that the game's not smart enough at catching

2374
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:53,140
if somebody is doing it in the first place and if you're going to make your niche around

2375
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,260
GPS games, you've got to figure this out.

2376
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:00,300
Especially with my phone, like my GPS sometimes will be like way fucked up.

2377
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,380
You know, even as it is, my compass is way fucked.

2378
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:05,420
It's never pointing in the right direction in that game, you know?

2379
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:08,980
So in my GPS, a lot of times they'll be bouncing around all over the fucking place.

2380
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:13,620
And so thank God it doesn't trigger spoofing or anything from that.

2381
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:17,980
I can only imagine that's probably why they haven't, you know, it's hard for them to gather

2382
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:24,180
all that cell data and stuff that might be around as well to kind of verify their location.

2383
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,060
So all I have, so just, you know, just something like that happening is just incredibly demoralizing

2384
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:34,200
and makes you kind of sit there and go, well, why am I spending time and money and gas on

2385
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,660
something that is not being policed effectively?

2386
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:43,140
Like at least World of Warcraft, if I go play PvP, it's all server side.

2387
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:46,880
They got locked down, so it is very hard to cheat on World of Warcraft and there is zero

2388
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,980
tolerance for it, you know, in a game like that.

2389
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:54,340
And I just need Niantic to kind of like step it up a little bit and look at Ingress through

2390
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:58,960
that similar kind of lens where they need to police it better if they want me to continue

2391
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,420
to support Ingress.

2392
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:04,100
Because right now I'm just kind of like, I don't know, I'm like, I'm like, I'm happy

2393
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,460
for Jamie that she's gonna be level eight and I kind of want to help her get that and

2394
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,540
all sorts, but I'm just kind of like, do I really want to take another two hour road

2395
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,920
trip only to have some little kid in their basement fake it?

2396
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:17,500
You know, it's like, I think I'm, I think I'm kind of past that probably some 30 something

2397
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:22,100
that's doing that and you know, the ones that are going to be excellent at Pokemon go are

2398
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:26,020
going to be the same retired people that play Ingress all day long.

2399
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:29,700
Maybe it's a Nintendo property, so maybe they might take a little, little more serious.

2400
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:33,060
They don't want to lose or have a bad relationship with Nintendo.

2401
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:37,660
Well, I don't know like how much it is with, I don't really know the game mechanics too

2402
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:38,660
much.

2403
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:41,980
I know that you can go to different gyms and like deploy your Pokemon there to, and you

2404
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:46,100
go and battle those different Pokemon, but it's not like a war game.

2405
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,460
You got deploy your Pokemon battlefield.

2406
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:52,060
It kind of is like Michael Vick like video game.

2407
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,060
Yeah.

2408
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,060
They're child soldiers.

2409
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,060
That's what the Corey Pokemon.

2410
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,060
I'm not fucking with you.

2411
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:59,060
Pokemon go is real life.

2412
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:04,060
If you fake your location, then I will find you.

2413
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:07,580
I always, I always tell people like, cool, you want to sign up for Ingress?

2414
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,580
That's awesome.

2415
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:11,860
Like you should play Ingress with me, but if you sign up for blue and attack my portal,

2416
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,860
I will kill you.

2417
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:15,860
Cheaters in video games.

2418
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:18,860
We talked about that recently, how it could be game breaking.

2419
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:23,100
And we were talking about whose responsibility is it and what the outcome should be.

2420
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:27,860
So like for Overwatch, they're doing like no tolerance, permabands, right?

2421
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:28,860
Quickly.

2422
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:30,660
I love that.

2423
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:31,660
I think that's the way to go.

2424
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:36,220
And in Overwatch, that's you, you, you wasted 60 bucks because there is no single player

2425
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:37,220
game.

2426
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,220
So if you get banned from Overwatch, done.

2427
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,220
Yeah.

2428
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:40,220
Yeah.

2429
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:44,940
They, I think they need to set an example for some of them.

2430
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,940
If some of you can't control, which I don't know how they can differentiate the ones like,

2431
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:50,380
Oh, my internet connection just bailed out on me.

2432
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:54,940
So I couldn't even, you know, I didn't leave the game, but you know, that's just what happened.

2433
01:43:55,020 --> 01:44:00,380
You can get some leeway on that, but the downright PC cheaters that are like, I went and got

2434
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,860
a third party program to aim bots.

2435
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,860
Yeah.

2436
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:09,660
They definitely need to be, you know, struck and down, smited down definitely with the

2437
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:10,660
biggest ban hammer.

2438
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,660
With great vengeance and curious anger.

2439
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:14,860
Because that stuff doesn't make the game fun.

2440
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,820
And it's just like, why do you do that?

2441
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:20,420
Like why do you make the game unplayable for other people?

2442
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,420
Right.

2443
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:22,420
Exactly.

2444
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:23,980
Anyway, I got to move on.

2445
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:27,500
So because of time, I want to talk a little bit briefly about Nintendo, because they were

2446
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:33,340
kind of, they were kind of turning some heads this week because they revised their incorporation

2447
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,340
articles.

2448
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:38,380
And I don't know if you guys saw this on Twitter and the blogs and all this, but apparently

2449
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:43,220
Nintendo has said, we're getting into other things than just gaming.

2450
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:47,940
They have talked about now that they are doing medical and health services, computer software,

2451
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:52,460
eating establishments, and IP licensing.

2452
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,580
So we don't know like what this all involves.

2453
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:58,180
I don't think this necessarily means that Nintendo is going to suddenly open a restaurant

2454
01:44:58,180 --> 01:44:59,180
themselves.

2455
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:00,180
That would be awesome.

2456
01:45:00,180 --> 01:45:01,240
But what, well, what is...

2457
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,340
They do have cafes in Spain.

2458
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,340
Do they really?

2459
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,340
Yeah.

2460
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,660
Oh, I didn't even know that.

2461
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:07,660
Okay.

2462
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:08,660
Well, so maybe that's part of it.

2463
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:09,660
Like the themed cafes.

2464
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:12,380
Like there's the Final Fantasy one that Square has.

2465
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:13,380
Okay.

2466
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,380
Right.

2467
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:15,380
Right.

2468
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,060
Like Mario milkshakes or Luigi latte or something like that.

2469
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:20,300
I'm really concerned with them starting to get into practicing medicine.

2470
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,300
Medicine?

2471
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:22,300
Yeah.

2472
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,140
Amazing.

2473
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:25,140
Point taken.

2474
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:29,100
But I kind of see that I don't necessarily think Nintendo is going to open up their own

2475
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:33,180
restaurant, but like, you know, let's say we know that Nintendo Universal signed that

2476
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:36,180
deal to do the theme park thing where there'll be a Mario ride.

2477
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:39,500
Well, look, haven't just been at a theme park over the weekend.

2478
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,220
Let me tell you, they also make a shit ton of money off food and selling the food there.

2479
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:46,020
So what type of Mass Effect food do they have?

2480
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,020
Okay.

2481
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:49,940
You got me there because they actually didn't have any.

2482
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:55,120
But they did have, like at their gift shop, they had a ton of Mass Effect merchandise,

2483
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:59,140
but it was mostly the stuff you get in the store because it wasn't really anything new.

2484
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,740
Why did you not bring me back in Elcor?

2485
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:04,460
Because I wanted you to go yourself and they didn't have the Elcors.

2486
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,920
Well, ew.

2487
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,140
But anyway, yeah.

2488
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:10,820
So maybe you'll have like a Mario pizzeria or something.

2489
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:11,820
I don't know.

2490
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:12,820
Wow.

2491
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:13,820
Straight to the pizzeria.

2492
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,820
Coming to a Luigi.

2493
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:15,820
Yeah.

2494
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,820
I can see that.

2495
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:17,820
Yeah.

2496
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:18,820
Just why not?

2497
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,820
Like that'll be the thing.

2498
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,860
I would be down too actually for that.

2499
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:26,620
But see, and that's the thing is I kind of think what's happening now in Nintendo, because

2500
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:30,560
we all know they're under new leadership and I kind of feel like maybe the new leadership,

2501
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:35,020
because I get the sense the new leadership was not as much of a gamer as Miyamoto was,

2502
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:36,020
who was...

2503
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,020
Satoru Iwata.

2504
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,020
Jesus Christ.

2505
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,020
Satoru Iwata.

2506
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,020
My bad.

2507
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:41,020
Sorry.

2508
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,020
Hail Mario.

2509
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,020
Hail Mario.

2510
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,020
Shame.

2511
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:45,020
Shame.

2512
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:49,100
A lot of names spinning in my head, live radio.

2513
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:53,780
So when Iwata was leading the company, he was in the trenches and kind of worked his

2514
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,200
way up and so forth, right?

2515
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:59,900
And so I think the leadership now is somebody that was more of like the business perspective.

2516
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:04,300
And I kind of feel like, whereas there was that hesitation to really license Nintendo

2517
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:05,300
stuff out.

2518
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:08,860
Like we've heard in the past, Nintendo was like, we learned our lesson from the Super

2519
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:11,500
Mario Brothers movie that starred Bob Hoskins.

2520
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,880
Like we are not ever doing that shit again.

2521
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,500
So stop, stop writing your fanwank.

2522
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:22,740
Stop writing the fanwank about the Zelda Netflix series, because that's not fucking true.

2523
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,720
That was like the old Nintendo, right?

2524
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:30,780
But now I kind of feel like I see that we have made a lot of fucking money putting out

2525
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:33,140
Nintendo figurines.

2526
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,340
Why don't we license our...

2527
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,900
We just made a lot of money licensing Mario and Luigi to theme parks.

2528
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,900
We are the fucking Disney of video games right now.

2529
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,620
Why don't we just license our shit everywhere?

2530
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,620
They are making a movie.

2531
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,020
They're making a movie with Sony.

2532
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:49,380
They're going to be doing animated movies.

2533
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,380
Right.

2534
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,380
And I think that is now the future of where Nintendo...

2535
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,620
Because if Angry Birds can do well, wait till Mario.

2536
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,820
I think a Mario movie would do fantastic in this day and age.

2537
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:58,820
As long as it's CG.

2538
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,820
As long as it's CG.

2539
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,820
Yeah, yeah.

2540
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,820
Let's not...

2541
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,200
We're not doing live action.

2542
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,200
Never again.

2543
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Yeah, never.

2544
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:06,200
Yeah.

2545
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,200
Who's the guy that...

2546
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,200
Jack Black is Mario?

2547
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:09,200
No, no.

2548
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,200
Who's the guy that plays...

2549
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,700
I don't want Vincent D'Onofrio putting on a Mario hat.

2550
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:12,700
That would be awesome.

2551
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,700
He's not that fat.

2552
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,700
Yeah, no.

2553
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,420
Yeah, sure he's not.

2554
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:19,900
I can see them branching out and everything else, though.

2555
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,220
You hit it right on the head.

2556
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:23,940
They are the Disney of video games.

2557
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:29,100
They have that marketing appeal to where you know who Mario is as soon as somebody says

2558
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,380
Mario.

2559
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,940
He's like Mickey Mouse, yeah.

2560
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:37,600
But I think some people are reading this to say, oh, Nintendo is contingency planning

2561
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,940
for the NX to flop.

2562
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:40,180
They're no longer a game maker.

2563
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:43,660
I'm just like, no, Nintendo sees dollar signs and they'd like to chase them.

2564
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:48,220
I could see where they're going with that because you can't get...

2565
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:50,660
Consoles lose money generally anyways.

2566
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:54,300
Even a decent console will lose money.

2567
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,860
And they had one massive flop with the GameCube, I think it was, right?

2568
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:02,620
Yeah, GameCube is considered a flop, even though it was a great console.

2569
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:04,260
I think it eventually made its money back.

2570
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,260
It almost broke that.

2571
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,260
Yeah, I think it made...

2572
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:09,460
And it was kind of the same thing with the Wii U, and it's like the gamer in me does

2573
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:14,460
not want to call the system of Mario Kart 8 and the system of like all these fantastic

2574
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:19,020
games that are on it a flop, but from a financial perspective, it did not live up to the expectations.

2575
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,580
Financially, it almost like killed them, right?

2576
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:23,740
And then they did the Wii as like, this is going to be the last thing, and then it like

2577
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:24,740
did gangbusters.

2578
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:29,640
See, here's the thing, I can't say that it almost killed them because you have to remember

2579
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:34,340
Nintendo is sitting on mountains and mountains of cash.

2580
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:35,340
Remember that.

2581
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,340
Nintendo's got money in the bank.

2582
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:40,580
Of course they do, because they're fucking charging $10 for fucking Mario Kart or Mario

2583
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:48,460
64, which I did buy, but I bought it so my son can play it.

2584
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:50,420
I didn't want to pay $10 for it.

2585
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:52,300
I think it's fucking ridiculous.

2586
01:49:52,300 --> 01:50:00,580
That handheld pillar that they stand on is always gold, like they rule the handheld market.

2587
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:04,140
I got to move on to the next story, but I have to get some of these restaurant ideas

2588
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,140
from chat.

2589
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,140
Awesome, here we go.

2590
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:09,860
So Dungeon Buster is suggesting the House of Mario Pancakes, possibly.

2591
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:10,860
I'd eat there.

2592
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:13,100
Stoppy, I'm sorry, wins with this one.

2593
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,700
Stoppy wins with this one.

2594
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:15,700
Yoshi's cookies.

2595
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:17,700
Oh, that just makes sense.

2596
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:18,700
Done.

2597
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:19,700
Yeah.

2598
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,700
Trademark it.

2599
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:21,700
Simplest thing.

2600
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,700
Right?

2601
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,700
Yeah.

2602
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,140
I feel like there should be an app, and I order my cookies, and they're ready for pick

2603
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,140
up.

2604
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:28,140
Wow.

2605
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,140
Yoshi!

2606
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:32,360
So if you put like three of the cookies together, do you get a discount or something like that?

2607
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:37,120
As long as the cookies weren't actually shit out of the dinosaur, I'm fine.

2608
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:41,320
Yeah, I bet that would be really popular, they're like around Easter, where you have

2609
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:42,320
Yoshi eggs.

2610
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,320
Oh, man.

2611
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:44,320
Cream filled eggs.

2612
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,320
They might be, setting themselves to take over the world.

2613
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:47,320
And they're actually like the little white and green.

2614
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:50,680
It's like the little toy Yoshi in the middle, like the Kinder Surprise.

2615
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,680
Oh, I'm sorry, we can't have those in the US.

2616
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,380
Even better with all these stupid YouTube trends, you can have it be like a giant fucking

2617
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:59,720
surprise egg with shit inside of it.

2618
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,720
Oh, unboxing, or un-egging or something?

2619
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,760
Bullshit fucking toys that are worth nothing.

2620
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:09,040
Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

2621
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:13,000
Well, this actually makes me super happy.

2622
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,880
There is an option in Uncharted 4 that makes a lot of people happy, and it's an accessibility

2623
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:26,640
menu for people who have a physical audio or visual impairment.

2624
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:32,100
In fact, there was a comment made by Josh Straub, who is the editor-in-chief of the

2625
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:39,480
Disabled Accessibility for Gaming Entertainment Rating System, or DAGRS, who had a complaint

2626
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:43,840
about Uncharted 2, that there was a series of doors that you couldn't get through unless

2627
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,000
you button mashed through them, and his physical disability lowered his reflexes to where he

2628
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,200
couldn't do it.

2629
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:57,120
They actually went in and rated Uncharted 4, and I'm trying to find the rating.

2630
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:02,480
This one, they pretty much gave it as perfect a rating as they could, that they found no

2631
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:11,600
limitations to playing the game for most visually impaired, audio impaired, or physical disabilities.

2632
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,600
Good for them.

2633
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,600
Yeah.

2634
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:14,600
That's great.

2635
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:22,400
A lot of developers don't always think about people who may not be able to handle certain

2636
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:26,680
things, have any kind of...

2637
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:31,680
I hate to use the word disability, just because in some cases, some people don't find it to

2638
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:41,360
be a disability, especially in terms of autism or other being non-neurotypical.

2639
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:48,380
But at the same time, having those differences catered to, it makes a lot of difference,

2640
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:54,080
and it shows the company respects the people who are buying their games enough to make

2641
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,720
it accessible to a wider market.

2642
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:57,840
Have you guys had...

2643
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:02,760
I know one thing about being a podcaster for this long is that I've really had my eyes

2644
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:07,720
opened up to not just me as a gamer and Loki as a gamer and our soccer, but the other gamers

2645
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:08,720
out there.

2646
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:12,640
I don't know if you guys ever get this, but I know we have people that call into the show.

2647
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:17,200
For example, just I think last week or two weeks ago, we had a blind gamer who sometimes

2648
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:21,080
calls into the show pretty regularly who kind of reminds us like, oh shit, yeah, there are

2649
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:26,840
people who like video games that if game makers don't consider these people when making them,

2650
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,840
they're kind of shut out.

2651
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,840
I don't know.

2652
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,840
Have you guys...

2653
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,240
Do you guys have any fans or people that listen or talk to you guys that are kind of like,

2654
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:37,960
oh shit, I never would have thought that this part of the game would have been a challenge,

2655
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,200
but maybe...

2656
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:42,520
We have one guy who's pretty consistent.

2657
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,320
He does a YouTube channel and stuff.

2658
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:51,520
He actually had brain surgery to remove a tumor and it's messed with his reflexes in

2659
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,520
one of his hands.

2660
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:57,160
And he was a really good tournament level Street Fighter player.

2661
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:01,360
And so I started streaming Street Fighter and he'd come in and give me tips and stuff

2662
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,360
and I was like, well, let's play.

2663
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:07,920
And he's like, I can't because I'm not good because of what happened.

2664
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,400
And we started playing anyways.

2665
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,400
I was like, dude, just play.

2666
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:15,160
Cause he still had the game at Street Fighter IV and we played and it did kind of open my

2667
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:22,520
eyes to that there are people out there and it kind of turned into like a Rocky situation.

2668
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:26,360
He'd go in my streams and be giving me all sorts of amazing tips and stuff.

2669
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,360
And I was just playing through his instruction.

2670
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,360
That's rad.

2671
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:33,440
That like the fact that like, okay, maybe I can't play the game, but that's not going

2672
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:37,340
to stop me from playing the theory crafting of the game and the science of the game and

2673
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,380
all that.

2674
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:42,180
I kind of went through some of that after I had that hand surgery twice where I couldn't

2675
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:45,640
play games on a console as long as I used to.

2676
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:51,620
And it made me into a PC player actually, because I wouldn't play PC games except for

2677
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:55,020
tetranet and like Ragnarok online.

2678
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:58,420
And now, well, you remember when we were playing final fantasy 11.

2679
01:54:58,420 --> 01:55:00,200
I started off with the controller.

2680
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:05,340
All my macros were set through my shoulder buttons and I played an entire MMO on a controller

2681
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,660
that wasn't necessarily meant to be played on a controller.

2682
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:11,460
And then I had hand surgery and I couldn't do it again.

2683
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:18,060
There's still some games I can't play because it's not something I make super common knowledge,

2684
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:20,540
but I am autistic.

2685
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:26,100
And so I can't play with certain levels of depth in a game.

2686
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:32,260
And I can't play with certain flashing because it'll be overstimulating.

2687
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:37,660
So I like when I can find a game that says turn off this feature, like the blur in Mass

2688
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:38,940
Effect.

2689
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:39,940
The motion blur.

2690
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:40,940
I had to turn that off.

2691
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:41,940
You could turn that off, yeah.

2692
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:44,800
Because that would just fuck with me.

2693
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:45,900
Motion blur fucks with most people.

2694
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:47,020
I hate motion blur.

2695
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:51,040
It's the bane of my, like in Doom, I was on the multiplayer beta and there was no way

2696
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,040
to turn that shit off.

2697
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:53,860
Almost killed it for me.

2698
01:55:53,860 --> 01:55:59,140
There's some games I can take it in that has like a fraction of it, but when it's like

2699
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:06,180
that pronounced, it actually, it's not quite like a pain, but I feel like I get tunnel

2700
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:10,820
vision right away, almost like I'm about to shut down, so I have to stop it.

2701
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:14,900
The first time I saw it, I had to close down the game until I figured out you could turn

2702
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:15,900
it off.

2703
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:16,900
But yeah.

2704
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,620
Well, I love this discussion.

2705
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:21,740
I got to keep things moving for time, though, unfortunately.

2706
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:26,020
But yeah, I think the additional accessibility and the fact that they tested it with a greater

2707
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:29,180
audience, I think that's a great thing and I hope more game makers will look to that.

2708
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:32,100
Well, let's travel around the world quickly and check out some release dates and some

2709
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:35,340
games that will be coming out soon near you.

2710
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:40,300
So this week we have Overwatch coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2711
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:41,300
Good.

2712
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:45,900
Also, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mutants in Manhattan on PlayStation 4, PlayStation

2713
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:49,420
3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC.

2714
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:55,140
And that's the game that was from Platinum, so that should be pretty cool.

2715
01:56:55,140 --> 01:57:00,500
Total War Warhammer on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

2716
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,540
Omnibus on PC.

2717
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:07,660
And Table Trap Racing World Tour on PC.

2718
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:10,460
Omnibus looks awesome, by the way.

2719
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:14,620
Looking at Japan and the Japanese release dates, on the PlayStation 4, Guilty Gear,

2720
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:16,860
I think that, do we say Xrd?

2721
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:17,860
Xrd?

2722
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:18,860
Xrd?

2723
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:21,460
I'm not sure exactly how the fans pronounce that, but Guilty Gear X.

2724
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:27,220
Revelator is out in a regular and a limited edition on the PlayStation 4 this week.

2725
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:29,500
I don't know if the Wii U has anything new this week.

2726
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,500
I don't think so.

2727
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,500
I think it's kind of slow there.

2728
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:32,500
I don't think they have anything coming out on the Wii U anymore.

2729
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:36,180
Yeah, even in Japan, I don't think there's anything until June when the Mario and Sonic

2730
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:37,340
Olympic stuff.

2731
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,140
But yet they are still trucking along with the Vita.

2732
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:41,860
In fact, there's a lot of Vita games this week in Japan.

2733
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:44,700
Classic Dungeon Sengoku is out this week.

2734
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:48,220
Kayokai no Shoryuki comes out in a limited edition this week.

2735
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:53,740
Sengoku Hime 4, Tenka Rioran, Tenmei no Koi Imaki comes out this week as well.

2736
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:58,900
And let's see, Koyukai no Shoryaki is in the regular edition as well.

2737
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:02,580
So there's regular and limited edition on the Vita in Japan.

2738
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:05,420
And lastly, on the 3DS this week, nothing.

2739
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:08,020
Things are still pretty quiet until June the 9th.

2740
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:11,220
What was this on Sengoku Hime?

2741
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:14,020
Like Princess of the Three Kingdoms?

2742
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:15,900
I'm not sure if that...

2743
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,020
Yeah, it's definitely a princess game.

2744
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:23,580
Yeah, it looks like one of those like Romance of the Three Kingdoms type of games, but all

2745
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,580
ladies in charge.

2746
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:25,580
I had a feeling.

2747
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:26,580
Yeah.

2748
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:27,580
My turn.

2749
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:28,580
Yes, Europe.

2750
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,580
Oh, Europe.

2751
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:30,580
I'm sorry.

2752
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:33,300
You get one game and you'll like it.

2753
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,300
I think.

2754
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:36,380
Dungeons 2 on PlayStation 4.

2755
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:37,380
Safine.

2756
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:40,340
All right, slow week in Europe.

2757
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:42,340
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2758
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:46,060
A dozen indie developers are like, hey, what about me?

2759
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:49,220
We'll tell Eurogamer to start listing your shit.

2760
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:53,300
A great time to catch up on indies or like the 500 other games in your backlog.

2761
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:54,300
Yeah.

2762
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:56,940
All right, just a couple more quick stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the

2763
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:58,260
classic game of the week.

2764
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,260
Loki.

2765
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:04,620
So this is, I guess, a good demonstration of how YouTube's kind of broken.

2766
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:11,020
Apparently a recent episode of Family Guy had featured a clip from a YouTube user Switched

2767
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:17,580
with one instead of an eye, featuring a glitch from Double Dribble.

2768
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:24,900
And what's kind of funny is, so first they borrowed the footage and used it in the episode,

2769
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:28,980
I'm assuming without licensing it from the original user that made it.

2770
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:34,580
And then on top of all that, after it did air and everything, Content ID said, hey,

2771
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:38,580
hey you with the original clip that was on YouTube, we're going to fucking Content ID

2772
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:44,020
claim your fucking video because it's our video now.

2773
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:51,480
So Fox Content ID claimed the video that they borrowed for the episode of Family Guy.

2774
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,820
Which I'm sure they never contacted the guy to get permission because in a way they kind

2775
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:57,260
of don't have to because it's really Konami's game.

2776
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,260
Right.

2777
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:00,740
Did they contact Konami for license?

2778
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:04,660
And I mean, I guess it could be kind of, I don't know if you want to call it fair use

2779
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:09,260
because they're talking over it and stuff and it's kind of transformative in that way,

2780
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:12,740
which I really wish something like that would go to court because then that would set precedents.

2781
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:14,440
But who knows?

2782
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:17,340
Of course, you know, Seth MacFarlane, you know, on Twitter said, hey, you know, he's

2783
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:23,700
kind of aware, you know, I don't run Fox, but stop tweeting me, but I will look into

2784
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:24,700
the issue.

2785
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:29,620
Apparently the video did get put, you know, the DMCA strike was lifted and it was back

2786
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:30,620
up.

2787
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:34,260
But still though, I mean, they didn't ask permission for that guy's clip.

2788
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:39,540
I mean, it's kind of, kind of lame that they can just steal that off the internet, especially

2789
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:44,620
when, you know, if I were to steal a Family Guy clip, obviously we get content ID strike.

2790
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:51,620
YouTube needs to fix this content ID fuckery soon because Amazon is right behind them,

2791
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:53,300
ready to pounce in for the kill.

2792
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:57,220
And this is the type of thing that's going to send people somewhere else.

2793
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:01,220
And you guys might remember just what last week, Amazon said they're launching their

2794
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:05,460
own thing that is essentially going to compete at least with like the premiere stuff on YouTube,

2795
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:10,460
where basically they're going to open up Amazon Prime, where anybody can put their show on

2796
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,740
Amazon Prime.

2797
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:15,140
And that's going to even, you know, we're not in the business of doing video, but now

2798
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:20,420
even I'm sitting here going, if I did make a video show, because Dark Soccer and I have

2799
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:24,920
talked about it before doing something, you know, inspired by some other things we follow,

2800
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:32,800
like if we did do a video show, would we put it on YouTube or should we go to Amazon?

2801
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,920
You know, these, I think as long as YouTube continues to show that they're going to side

2802
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:42,320
with the corporations long before they side with the people creating the content, I kind

2803
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,760
of think it just inspires people to run the other direction.

2804
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:45,760
I've said this before.

2805
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,320
You should go to Vimeo.

2806
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,960
But then see, but then here's the problem, Vimeo is kind of, it's still kind of niche.

2807
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,880
Vimeo hasn't really, Vimeo is not an app on your PlayStation 4.

2808
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:58,040
You know what I mean?

2809
02:01:58,040 --> 02:01:59,040
What?

2810
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,040
Bianca Del Rio goes through Vimeo.

2811
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:04,280
Oh, well, if it's good enough for her, then it's good enough for us.

2812
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:08,720
I'm just saying the problem is there's no Vimeo app on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but

2813
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:09,720
there is Amazon Prime.

2814
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:10,720
You know what I mean?

2815
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,540
That's why I think there is Twitch.

2816
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:16,200
That's why I think Amazon entering this market is finally, somebody's going to fucking give

2817
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,400
YouTube some competition.

2818
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:20,920
I'm excited.

2819
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:25,860
YouTube has kind of been in some weird space, especially with their major users and stuff

2820
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:26,860
like that.

2821
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:34,520
They're very popular Twitch creators, or YouTube creators, and they've been very vocal about

2822
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:38,480
it too, how they're not happy with the state of YouTube.

2823
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:45,120
I think if one of them, I don't know, who's like a real big one out there that's PewDiePie?

2824
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:49,720
Like if a PewDiePie said, hey, Amazon's doing their thing, I might have to go over there

2825
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:50,720
for a second.

2826
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:54,720
Then they can probably get a big draft of people just be like, well, I mean, PewDiePie's

2827
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,720
over there.

2828
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:56,720
I'm over there now, you know?

2829
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,840
And then you have this giant civil war or something like that, that just people are

2830
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:00,840
choosing sides.

2831
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:01,840
Oh, man.

2832
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:02,840
It's going to be just like the movie.

2833
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:03,840
I'm on T-Putes.

2834
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:04,840
T-Markiplier.

2835
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:05,840
Yeah, see?

2836
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,840
Yeah.

2837
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:08,840
He's my friend.

2838
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:09,840
Yeah.

2839
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,920
So was I. Yeah, you're going to get some of that type

2840
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:12,920
of stuff.

2841
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:15,840
I mean, it'll draw some lines, definitely.

2842
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:21,680
But Amazon, you're right, they have their prime to pounce on this type of thing.

2843
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:22,680
Nice.

2844
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:23,680
Nice.

2845
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:27,440
I wasn't even thinking about that, too.

2846
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:32,580
For once, I actually really agree with Kaijuto on this comment.

2847
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:33,800
All joking aside.

2848
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:37,200
What shocks me the most out of this story is that Family Guy is still on the air.

2849
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:40,240
That was the reaction I had.

2850
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:41,920
I thought it was only in repeats.

2851
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,000
I thought it was just that thing that's always on the stoner television.

2852
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:46,160
That's true.

2853
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,160
New episodes, yeah.

2854
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,160
I haven't watched it.

2855
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,160
Have you seen the clip of the Double Dribble?

2856
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:50,160
Because I've watched it.

2857
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:54,360
Luckily, somebody filmed it with their iPhone and put it on YouTube so that it wouldn't

2858
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,360
match content ID.

2859
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,360
So yes, I did see it.

2860
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:59,200
Yeah, it's a pretty funny clip.

2861
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:02,560
I thought they were talking about another clip, because they did the same one for a

2862
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,920
football game, too.

2863
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:08,240
But it's such like, I guess this is kind of typical of Family Guy, and they're really

2864
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:12,920
long references or very obscure references.

2865
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:15,160
Most people aren't going to know what the fuck that is.

2866
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:18,160
They're like, Double Dribble, what?

2867
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,380
Is that a real game?

2868
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:26,040
They're targeting a very specific audience here, and it's just like, I don't know.

2869
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:28,120
People are going to be kind of pissed off about it.

2870
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:32,760
Since you guys at Video Game Bang do more of the video than we do here at OLR, you guys

2871
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,240
actually do broadcasting.

2872
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:36,360
Have you ever gotten hit by the copyright thing?

2873
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,360
Oh yeah.

2874
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,360
Oh yeah.

2875
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:39,360
We've been hit.

2876
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:43,000
We've been hit by different type of stuff to get banned, too.

2877
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yeah.

2878
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
We get banned for weird things.

2879
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,360
Luckily, they're not as strict as YouTube, because YouTube, there's like three strikes

2880
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,360
and you're out.

2881
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:50,360
Yeah.

2882
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:54,480
For us, we use some music that has gotten caught.

2883
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,480
Yeah, muted.

2884
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:56,480
Yeah.

2885
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,480
We get to mute it.

2886
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:58,480
They'll mute it out.

2887
02:04:58,480 --> 02:04:59,480
They'll just mute the audio.

2888
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:00,480
We've gotten banned only twice.

2889
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:01,480
Once, because idiot over here broke NDA.

2890
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:02,480
Because I didn't read an NDA.

2891
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:03,480
Excuse me.

2892
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:04,520
Yeah, you got to read your damn NDA's.

2893
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:06,640
He didn't read NDA's, and it wasn't even a very good game.

2894
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:07,640
What was it?

2895
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:09,640
Nightwatch?

2896
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:10,640
I don't remember.

2897
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,640
Something.

2898
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:12,640
No.

2899
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:13,640
It was something by...

2900
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:15,640
2K, wasn't it?

2901
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:16,640
I can't remember.

2902
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:20,640
It was one of those zombie horde games where you build...

2903
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:23,640
Oh yeah, yeah.

2904
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:25,640
The Unreal 4 one.

2905
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:28,640
I could have swore people were streaming it, so I was like...

2906
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:29,640
Well, they had permission.

2907
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,640
I was like, well, then I'm going to stream this thing.

2908
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:32,640
Oh, yeah.

2909
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:33,640
That is some bullshit, too.

2910
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:36,640
You know, where, oh, these people can have permission to stream this.

2911
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,640
Yeah, but you can't.

2912
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:38,640
All these other people know about them dollar bills.

2913
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:42,640
So I got 30 minutes of that, and then they shut me down, and I was like, what happened

2914
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:43,640
to the game?

2915
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,640
And, yeah, it's gone.

2916
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:47,640
Our other ban was for nonsense, because...

2917
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:48,640
So this idiot...

2918
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,640
It was April Fools.

2919
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:52,640
Watch Dogs had just come out.

2920
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:56,640
I was like, hey, I'm going to make this article saying that there was a hot coffee mod in

2921
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:01,640
Watch Dogs on Nerd Reactor, you know, as a joke article, and link it to a Twitch.

2922
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:04,640
And then when they get to the Twitch, it was just going to be a picture, like a video of

2923
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,640
my dogs in their crates all day.

2924
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:07,640
Watch Dogs.

2925
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:08,640
Get it?

2926
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,640
Funny.

2927
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,640
Yeah.

2928
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:11,640
Okay.

2929
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:16,640
Twitch didn't think it was funny either, so they banned us for like 48 hours.

2930
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:17,640
Over some dogs?

2931
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,640
Over some dogs.

2932
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:19,640
Over some Watch Dogs.

2933
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:22,640
It would have been great, though, if you actually had a cup of coffee in front of the dog.

2934
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:23,640
There you go.

2935
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,640
See?

2936
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,640
That's why I needed to be here.

2937
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,640
Then it would have been accurate.

2938
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,640
Yeah.

2939
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:29,640
Well, thank God you met us.

2940
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:31,640
Watch out.

2941
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,640
Watch out.

2942
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,640
I think about this stuff regularly.

2943
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,640
Coffee and dogs.

2944
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,640
Yeah.

2945
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:38,640
The SSJ100Matt says, that was a good troll.

2946
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:39,640
Thank you.

2947
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,640
Some folks appreciate that.

2948
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,640
They do.

2949
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,640
Now, thank you.

2950
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:43,640
SSJ100Matt also reminding me.

2951
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:46,640
I promised I would bring up Glee later in the show.

2952
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:47,640
Okay.

2953
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:52,640
So Fox is obviously the one that has the Uber clamp down content ID thing.

2954
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:55,640
Let's not forget, Fox has stolen shit in the past.

2955
02:06:56,640 --> 02:07:01,640
Do you remember when they did Baby Got Back on Glee and they totally stole Jonathan Colton's

2956
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:02,640
version?

2957
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:03,640
Borrowed.

2958
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:04,640
Borrowed.

2959
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:05,640
Borrowed.

2960
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,640
And didn't even credit the guy.

2961
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:09,640
They sold that version on iTunes.

2962
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:10,640
Really?

2963
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,640
Not even a fucking...

2964
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,640
No, that's so cool.

2965
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,640
They probably totally credited the guy that made the YouTube video, too.

2966
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,640
Oh, wait.

2967
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:16,640
No, they fucking didn't because they're Fox.

2968
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,640
See, here's the weird thing about it, though.

2969
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:20,640
But at the end of the day, that was...

2970
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:24,640
If I remember right, the original gameplay clip was like nothing but footage from Konami's

2971
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:25,640
game, right?

2972
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:26,640
Yes.

2973
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,640
So I'm kind of like, do they really have to get the guy's permission?

2974
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:33,640
I don't think they do because it's Konami's fucking game and the guy's face wasn't in

2975
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,640
it.

2976
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:37,640
His commentary wasn't in it as far as I know.

2977
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:38,640
So...

2978
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:40,640
They only have to get someone's permission because...

2979
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:47,640
Well, I think, okay, no, they would not need to get his permission to use footage of Double

2980
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:53,640
Dribble, but being that it's his footage of Double Dribble, they didn't just make footage

2981
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:54,640
up.

2982
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:56,640
Then, yeah, I think they do need to get permission from him.

2983
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:01,640
And how hard would it be to reach out to this guy and there's no way he'd be like, oh, no,

2984
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,640
I don't want my stuff on your show.

2985
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:04,640
Yeah, right.

2986
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:05,640
He's gonna give up his stuff.

2987
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,640
I equate it to a photograph.

2988
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:12,640
Like, you have to ask permission to use a photograph on something.

2989
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:13,640
That's true.

2990
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:14,640
Ask the guy.

2991
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:16,640
I'm literally sure he's gonna be like, yeah, I would love it.

2992
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,640
Sure, they could have just been like, hey, just a heads up.

2993
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:21,640
We're gonna air your stuff.

2994
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:24,640
Here's some free tickets to Megyn Kelly's upcoming talk show or something.

2995
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:25,640
Yeah, there you go.

2996
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:26,640
There you go.

2997
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:27,640
Whatever.

2998
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:28,640
And he'll gladly take that.

2999
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:33,640
Megyn Kelly, what the fuck?

3000
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:35,640
All right.

3001
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:38,640
Let's talk about Resident Evil 7.

3002
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:42,640
Apparently it's happening, which, good, I thought 6 had killed the whole series, honestly.

3003
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,640
It almost did.

3004
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:44,640
So I think a lot of us were thinking...

3005
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,640
Where do you go from giraffe fellatio?

3006
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:49,640
Where do you go from giraffe fellatio?

3007
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:50,640
Which 6 was that?

3008
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:51,640
Oh, the symbol.

3009
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:52,640
The box art?

3010
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,640
Yes, the actual 6.

3011
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:55,640
Now you'll never unsee it.

3012
02:08:55,640 --> 02:09:00,640
I literally was thinking in the game, I'm like, I don't remember seeing giraffe.

3013
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:03,640
It was done so artistically.

3014
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,640
It's like the old Red Bull logo.

3015
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:07,640
You can never forget it and never unsee it.

3016
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:08,640
The Red Bull logo?

3017
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,640
Sold Red Bull logo.

3018
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:11,640
Don't ruin that now for me.

3019
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:12,640
I don't even want to think.

3020
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:15,640
Now I'm gonna have to go and Google search the old Red Bull logo.

3021
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:22,640
Or if you ever go to Final Fantasy XIV's Mog station, it's supposed to be like a little Moogle hat or something like that.

3022
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:25,640
It looks like the Moogle is bending over and showing you his butthole.

3023
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:30,640
And you'll never, now you will never unsee that when you go to look at the Mog station.

3024
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:32,640
All right. Anyway.

3025
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:38,640
Resident Evil 7, apparently a thing that is gonna happen and you are gonna see it at E3.

3026
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:46,640
Apparently some tweets from a Tokyo-based analyst, Dr. Serkan Toto mentioned that it will be shown at E3.

3027
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:57,640
The Resident Evil 7 team hired Jordan Amaro, a designer who had worked on Metal Gear Solid 5 and PT at Kojima Productions.

3028
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:03,640
So, well, it's not Del Toro and it's not, you know, Hideo Kojima.

3029
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:07,640
But it's like we're trying to narrow down the degrees of Kevin Bacon type of thing.

3030
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:14,640
Like so, we got a dude who worked with those guys, maybe like assimilated some of the good ideas.

3031
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:24,640
But the problem is that like Resident Evil, the newer games now seem to be more in line with like the Resident Evil movies which are like ridiculously action-based.

3032
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:30,640
I mean, I want to say that, you know, being that I never actually played Resident Evil 6, just kind of watched different gameplay.

3033
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:36,640
But they had a scene where I think where one of the characters jumped an explosion with a motorcycle or something like that.

3034
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:49,640
Which, that doesn't seem like survival horror to me. I mean, it's not the same like as Resident Evil 1 where you're in a mansion and there's like jump scares and zombies and monsters and shit.

3035
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:52,640
It's just like, I don't know.

3036
02:10:52,640 --> 02:11:04,640
They've drastically moved away from one now. Like it's night and day. Like one, you can even kind of be like, oh, it's survival horror and there's puzzle elements to the game as well, you know.

3037
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:11,640
There are no puzzle challenges whatsoever in Resident Evil anymore. It's run, shoot this, blow that up, and that's it.

3038
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:15,640
I want the terrible voice acting back. I want the terrible, terrible voice acting back.

3039
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:20,640
Just know what you are, you know. There's always a place for a bad horror movie.

3040
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:32,640
Alright, there's always a place on this show for the classic game of the week. Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that is ten years older or more that she thinks,

3041
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:39,640
hey, you little brats, stop blowing giraffes and go play this classic video game.

3042
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:42,640
Break out your ethernet adapter for your dreamcast.

3043
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:48,640
I love this pick. This is one of my very favorite games. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

3044
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:50,640
Phantasy Star Online.

3045
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:51,640
Yes!

3046
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:54,640
Did you choose that because you knew he was going to be on here?

3047
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:56,640
Exactly, like if I had to choose a second one.

3048
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:57,640
Divine Intervention.

3049
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:58,640
Exactly.

3050
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:00,640
Well, I did an MMO last week. I figured I'd do another one.

3051
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,640
Great.

3052
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:09,640
And it's also one that I super love that actually I've been sort of in this rut of MMOs right now because I'm getting kind of bored with Final Fantasy XIV.

3053
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:14,640
Kind of thinking about going back to WoW and then I was like, wait, I could just re-patch Phantasy Star Online 2.

3054
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:20,640
And I could play it in partial Japanese and badly translated English.

3055
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:23,640
But you've probably played it so much that you know how to navigate through that.

3056
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:24,640
Yeah.

3057
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:25,640
No problem, yeah.

3058
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:28,640
I did play Phantasy Star Online 2 for a while actually.

3059
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:34,640
So anyway, Phantasy Star Online 2 came out on December 21st, 2000.

3060
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:36,640
So get this.

3061
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:39,640
16 years old.

3062
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:40,640
No.

3063
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:42,640
15 years old and change.

3064
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:44,640
So, still.

3065
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,640
You don't really think about it, right?

3066
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:50,640
So this one is a full hack and slash.

3067
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:59,640
And it's different than a lot of MMOs in the fact that where you have certain quests to do, you're not in a huge open world.

3068
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:01,640
You're in a sectional world.

3069
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,640
So you're navigating through these different planes.

3070
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,640
I mean, you can freaking memorize entire levels.

3071
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:09,640
I used to just have a pile of them memorized.

3072
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:11,640
But you could get your little...

3073
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:13,640
Crap, now I forgot the names of them.

3074
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,640
Your little floaty things.

3075
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:15,640
Your mags.

3076
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,640
Mags, yes. Thank you.

3077
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:24,640
I ran around with an Oppa Oppa for the longest time because my first favorite game is the Guardian Legend.

3078
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:26,640
My second favorite is Fantasy Zone.

3079
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:32,640
And I ran around with an Oppa Oppa forever and my friend had a Dreamcast and another friend of mine had a Master System.

3080
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:34,640
And it was amazing.

3081
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:45,640
So when we got it in the US, I think that we started with the Phantasy Star Online 1 and 2 which came out in 2002.

3082
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:48,640
In Japan, you had each individual one.

3083
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:56,640
And then we had... There was an Episode 3 which was the card revolution that came out on GameCube in 2003.

3084
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,640
That was terrible.

3085
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:06,640
And so that's where Blue Burst comes from as the fourth installment in the series.

3086
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:09,640
That came out in 2004. So we're still 12 years back.

3087
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:12,640
This video is so crazy because it's a speedrun or something.

3088
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,640
I'm going to switch it up a little bit.

3089
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,640
I did find one that had music.

3090
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:18,640
How about this? Because this is from the soundtrack.

3091
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:20,640
The soundtrack was amazing.

3092
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:22,640
I love the music in this game.

3093
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:28,640
And of course, a lot of us played Blue Burst on PC.

3094
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:34,640
Because after a while, new systems came out. They didn't put out a new one.

3095
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:37,640
But the PC version kept getting updated until...

3096
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:42,640
This was funny. They were allowing people when the US servers closed down,

3097
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:47,640
they were giving them their character data to import into private servers.

3098
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:48,640
Wow.

3099
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:53,640
So Sega was fully cool with people continuing the game with their characters.

3100
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:55,640
They just weren't going to support the server.

3101
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:58,640
Wow. Take a note, Blizzard.

3102
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:00,640
I'll let you do that.

3103
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:04,640
And it did have an offline mode.

3104
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:08,640
Which you can just play through everything and work on the story.

3105
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,640
Take note of everybody that has an MMO.

3106
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:11,640
Exactly.

3107
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:17,640
I still, to this day, have a Red Ring Riku on my desk at work.

3108
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:18,640
Wow.

3109
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:20,640
From a little capsule thing.

3110
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:23,640
I used to have the Sega Ladies one.

3111
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,640
My Sarah Bryant's leg fell off.

3112
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:28,640
Who was the other one that I had?

3113
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:31,640
I still have Arl from P.O.P.O.

3114
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:34,640
But I can't remember the other one I had that broke.

3115
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:39,640
I got that game before it came out in America.

3116
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:43,640
In 2002, I had no system.

3117
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:47,640
And I was like, okay, I'm getting a GameCube because I read up on this game called Fantasy Star.

3118
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:49,640
Whatever this is.

3119
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:53,640
And I remember setting my desktop thing, or my background,

3120
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:57,640
so that picture that's literally on this YouTube playing soundtrack.

3121
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:00,640
And I was like, I'm getting this game no matter what comes out.

3122
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:04,640
I buy four controllers, two memory cards.

3123
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:08,640
We play, me and my three friends play all night long.

3124
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:12,640
Like chuggy graphics, split screen on the GameCube.

3125
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:15,640
Did not matter. We failed so hard for that game.

3126
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:18,640
And it was just, it was amazing.

3127
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:22,640
I didn't actually play online until two years after buying that game.

3128
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,640
We couldn't get it to play online because the ethernet adaptor wasn't supported by the U.S.

3129
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:30,640
One on Dreamcast. And then I played it on Xbox.

3130
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:34,640
In fact, I will actually say that playing on Xbox,

3131
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:37,640
this is before I had a reliable cell phone.

3132
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:41,640
This was back in the Nokia phones that I had my Batsmaru cover on.

3133
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:44,640
You know, the one that everyone had.

3134
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:49,640
I actually had an instance that I needed to go to the hospital.

3135
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:54,640
And I was playing with one of my friends, a local friend thankfully,

3136
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:57,640
who came and got me and took me to the hospital

3137
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:00,640
because I told her in the game, I think something's wrong

3138
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,640
and I need someone to take me to the hospital.

3139
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:05,640
And that's with that little dinky headset.

3140
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:08,640
And so next thing I know, her character beeps out

3141
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:12,640
and I get a call, I'm on my way.

3142
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:14,640
They're saving lives.

3143
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:18,640
Yeah, it turned out to not be anything majorly crazy, but it could have been worse

3144
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,640
had I not gone.

3145
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:23,640
It was just interesting.

3146
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:27,640
And now we hear stories all the time about how people are talked down from suicide

3147
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:29,640
and everything through their online games

3148
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:33,640
or how this one guy logged off from his online games saying that that was it.

3149
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,640
And because one of his online friends knew where he was,

3150
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:42,640
they called the police and then prevented him from hanging himself.

3151
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:45,640
I'm sorry though, nothing will top the Domino's Pizza

3152
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:49,640
where the guy was ordering a pizza every other day for forever

3153
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:51,640
and he didn't order a pizza for 11 days.

3154
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:54,640
So Domino's Pizza called the cops, sent him to the guy.

3155
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:58,640
Yep, the guy had a fall, was on the ground, needed medical intervention.

3156
02:17:58,640 --> 02:17:59,640
Wow.

3157
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:00,640
Crazy.

3158
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:02,640
Did he get free pizza for the rest of his life then?

3159
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:05,640
He'll be in the commercials, you know it.

3160
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:10,640
If that crazy guy can be in the Subway commercials, this guy can get a Domino's commercial.

3161
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:12,640
Anyway, oh yeah, Fantasy Star.

3162
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:14,640
I'd like to go into a little bit of the development of this

3163
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:17,640
because I do think it's pretty interesting.

3164
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:20,640
At the time, the Sega chairman was Okawa Isao

3165
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:24,640
and he said the internet gaming was going to be important.

3166
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,640
It was the future, you know.

3167
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:33,640
And he was very curious about bringing the PC online element into consoles in Japan.

3168
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:36,640
Because I mean, and he also looked back at Sega.

3169
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:39,640
You had, you know, the Sega channel.

3170
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:40,640
Oh yeah.

3171
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:44,640
You had, you know, even that whole satellite thing came out in the US for a short while.

3172
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:50,640
I mean, of course, Nintendo had the Satellaview, but they had really embraced it, I think.

3173
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:58,640
And so, right after Sonic Adventure was completed, Sonic Team was tasked with making a network game.

3174
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:01,640
They didn't quite know what it was, but it was going to be a network game.

3175
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:05,640
And so, they had a working title called Third World

3176
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:12,640
and they wanted to do science fiction and fantasy combined with realistic 3D graphics.

3177
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:17,640
And so, the first piece of concept art was a dragon.

3178
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:21,640
And he showed it to Yuji Naka, the director of Sonic Team.

3179
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:24,640
Who my husband got to meet. He's a really cool guy.

3180
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:30,640
Anyway, he immediately got the feeling of Phantasy Star with it.

3181
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:33,640
And so, that's how it came to be called Phantasy Star Online.

3182
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:39,640
And they actually took a big cue from Diablo for how the game would work.

3183
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:41,640
For basic mechanics.

3184
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:49,640
And pretty much, they went with some of the design staff from Phantasy Star IV.

3185
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:52,640
And now we have it.

3186
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:59,640
That's why I also think that it has such a stylistic tie-in with the Phantasy Star series.

3187
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:03,640
Just because it went immediately with the designers from...

3188
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:04,640
What?

3189
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:05,640
Loki?

3190
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:06,640
Nevermind.

3191
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:09,640
He has a VR thing on his face and I was distracted.

3192
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:15,640
And so, our first review of Phantasy Star Online came with a demo disc for Sonic Adventure 2.

3193
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:18,640
And then, it came out.

3194
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:21,640
This is the game I bought a Dreamcast for, really.

3195
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:25,640
This is my first MMO before I even knew what an MMO was.

3196
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:29,640
I was like, whoa, there's other people on the same game.

3197
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:31,640
Yeah, that game was amazing.

3198
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:35,640
Bobby and some of the people in chat are talking about that it's not really an MMO.

3199
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:38,640
I'm kind of on the fence.

3200
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:41,640
I think it has MMO characteristics and I think it's definitely like...

3201
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:43,640
There were roleplay channels.

3202
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:46,640
I definitely think there is a bridge here.

3203
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:47,640
You know what I mean?

3204
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:50,640
So, it's not EverQuest, but it's...

3205
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:53,640
It's a massively multiplayer online game.

3206
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:54,640
MMO.

3207
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:57,640
Isn't Guild Wars the same type of setup?

3208
02:20:57,640 --> 02:20:58,640
Don't you kind of get into a...

3209
02:20:58,640 --> 02:20:59,640
It's an actual roleplay.

3210
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:00,640
The original was.

3211
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:01,640
You're right.

3212
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:02,640
The original was a very similar type of setup.

3213
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:07,640
I would say Phantasy Star Online was the console's first attempt

3214
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:10,640
at replicating what the PC was doing in the MMO space.

3215
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:13,640
Anyway, but technicalities.

3216
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:17,640
At any rate, the whole basis of the game is that you're trying to find a planet to settle on

3217
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:20,640
and so the Pioneer 1 is sent to check it out

3218
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:22,640
and then you have the Pioneer 2 later on.

3219
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:26,640
They go to this planet, Raghul, to investigate.

3220
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:28,640
I will tell you this.

3221
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:32,640
My friend, Julie, has a Rappy.

3222
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:33,640
Like a plush one or something?

3223
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:38,640
A plush Rappy that she paid 120 bucks for that is like...

3224
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:41,640
That's it? Bitch got a deal.

3225
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:43,640
Four feet tall and it's huge.

3226
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:45,640
It's like the size of a toddler.

3227
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:46,640
What color? Yellow?

3228
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:47,640
A really fat toddler.

3229
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:48,640
Yellow one?

3230
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:49,640
Yeah.

3231
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:51,640
I remember they had those special events where you would go in

3232
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,640
and they had different color Rappy.

3233
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:57,640
They were like a blue one and then you'd have to try to get it

3234
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:59,640
to get a secret item or something like that.

3235
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:00,640
Those were pretty cool.

3236
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:01,640
We did all those.

3237
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:05,640
And then the episodes pretty much keep continuing.

3238
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:07,640
The gameplay pretty much stays a lot of the same.

3239
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:11,640
You had your offline mode which had your stories and everything in there as well.

3240
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:14,640
Your different side quests that you get through the Hunter's Guild and everything.

3241
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,640
And then of course your online.

3242
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:20,640
You can keep working, but you can get up to level 20 for hard mode,

3243
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:22,640
40 for very hard and 80 for ultimate.

3244
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:28,640
And then for blue burst it was actually broken down into series of separate missions.

3245
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:31,640
And then you had special missions coming for the principal's office.

3246
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:32,640
It was pretty cool.

3247
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,640
You had symbol chat as well.

3248
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:40,640
Which I liked because I would every so often play with Japanese players.

3249
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,640
And so it was just really nice.

3250
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:44,640
You could just put out your symbols and boom there you were.

3251
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:46,640
And it was universal for everyone.

3252
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:52,640
The game, I don't know, everybody that played, at least at my house,

3253
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:54,640
because I played on the GameCube,

3254
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:57,640
everybody that made a character, they felt unique.

3255
02:22:57,640 --> 02:22:59,640
And I think that was one thing I really liked about it.

3256
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:03,640
I had a friend who he was just hardcore type of manly type of guy.

3257
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:07,640
And he made this robot and he made them all tall and he had them all black.

3258
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:13,640
And then you pick your name that you go through and it assigns you the color and everything.

3259
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:16,640
So he was all hardcore black.

3260
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:20,640
And then he had Pinkle right in the middle of his chest.

3261
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:22,640
And I was like, you better own that dude.

3262
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:23,640
Just take it.

3263
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,640
And he was like, whatever.

3264
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,640
I always played the Newman Mage.

3265
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:29,640
The Newman Mage?

3266
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:30,640
Yeah.

3267
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:31,640
That was the other thing.

3268
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:36,640
I guess you could say that was how I always thought it was an MMO.

3269
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:37,640
And that was my first experience with one.

3270
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:43,640
So going from that to WoW, I picked a warrior thinking,

3271
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:46,640
oh, I can do a little bit of, you know, I can use any weapon.

3272
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:49,640
I can do a little bit of magic up to a certain point.

3273
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:51,640
That's what I thought a warrior was going to be when I played WoW.

3274
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:52,640
Totally different.

3275
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:55,640
And I was like, this is a terrible fantasy star and I'm playing that again.

3276
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:58,640
And remember, I still have a paladin named Rebecca Black.

3277
02:23:58,640 --> 02:23:59,640
Wow.

3278
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:02,640
Who I got to level 85 during Cataclysm.

3279
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:03,640
Wow.

3280
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:04,640
Oh, no.

3281
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:07,640
There was one time I got followed around by someone just making up words to Friday,

3282
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:09,640
following me around in one of the levels.

3283
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:13,640
I was like, dude, you're cool, but I'm not going to be your friend.

3284
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:14,640
Because that's creepy.

3285
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:16,640
You're not that cool.

3286
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,640
You're cool, but.

3287
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:20,640
I do have screenshots of it.

3288
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:26,640
So with Blue Burst, the other cool thing about that is that it came with the episode one

3289
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:28,640
and two side story quests.

3290
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:29,640
So it was pretty neat.

3291
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:34,640
You also had, you know, your actions or your gestures that you could do and everything.

3292
02:24:34,640 --> 02:24:35,640
Like, come on.

3293
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:36,640
Hi.

3294
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:38,640
You know, all the little cute stuff.

3295
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:44,640
And then, of course, we got Fantasy Star Online version two.

3296
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:48,640
That was the we had the PC one.

3297
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,640
And you also that was the one that introduced the ultimate mode.

3298
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:56,640
GameCube and Xbox had episode one and two that came out in 2002.

3299
02:24:56,640 --> 02:25:01,640
And it had quite a bit more role play element to it with that version,

3300
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:05,640
because it needed to be a more robust game for people who couldn't play it online.

3301
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:12,640
And then Blue Burst, again, came out for Windows in 2004,

3302
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:17,640
which I think it actually kind of works because, I mean, with Fantasy Star,

3303
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:21,640
keep in mind that the Dreamcast ran on Windows CE.

3304
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:26,640
So, well, almost every Dreamcast game ran on a version of CE.

3305
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:30,640
In fact, with every game that comes on a Dreamcast,

3306
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:37,640
it loads a version of CE before it runs the game so that it's running its OS first.

3307
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:41,640
And then the game is tailored to that build of CE.

3308
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:47,640
And so that was, I think, what made it easier for it to come out on, of course, PC,

3309
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:51,640
because you're pretty much translating from one Microsoft OS to another.

3310
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:53,640
And the same, of course, for Xbox.

3311
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:56,640
As for GameCube, well, they're a special snowflake.

3312
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:03,640
Then, of course, we got Fantasy Star Online 2, of course, much after that.

3313
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:05,640
But this is focusing on the original.

3314
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:08,640
Now, you know, this wasn't my first MMO, though, I must say.

3315
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:10,640
You know what my first was?

3316
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:11,640
What are you writing it on?

3317
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:15,640
Gemstone 3 on AOL, text-based MMO.

3318
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:19,640
And I played a crapload of Ragnarok Online.

3319
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:20,640
And that's it.

3320
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:21,640
So, Fantasy Star.

3321
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:22,640
In fact, you know what?

3322
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:26,640
I think I might just have to go back to Fantasy Star Online 2.

3323
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:27,640
Who's with me?

3324
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:28,640
Me, I love Fantasy Star.

3325
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:30,640
I wish we'd get the sequel.

3326
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:31,640
I really do, too.

3327
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:34,640
I understand that it may not be as good and maybe, like,

3328
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:38,640
the whole rose colored glasses thing, but it just depends on you.

3329
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:39,640
I want to try it for myself.

3330
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:40,640
Yeah, yeah.

3331
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:43,640
Let's just find a private server for Fantasy Star Online, Blue Burst.

3332
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:44,640
And do it.

3333
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:46,640
Just message me at DarkSakura on Twitter.

3334
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:47,640
All right.

3335
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:48,640
We'll make this happen.

3336
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:53,640
So, this week, we need a server for Minecraft VR, Tetranet, and PSO Blue Burst.

3337
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:55,640
PSO Blue Burst gets the focus, though.

3338
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:56,640
We'll work on that.

3339
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,640
All right.

3340
02:26:57,640 --> 02:26:58,640
That'll be my task.

3341
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,640
We're going to take a break.

3342
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:03,640
I believe we are now at the point where we're at the halfway point of our show,

3343
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:06,640
and it's already longer than the entirety of last week's show.

3344
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:07,640
But that's all right.

3345
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:10,640
We're having a good time here with our pals from Video Game Bang.

3346
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:14,640
We're going to come back after this quick break with your phone calls here shortly,

3347
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:18,640
1877-GameOLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

3348
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:21,640
and Fugu Question of the Week, as well as maybe the mailbag.

3349
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:23,640
I don't know if we got emails this week.

3350
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:24,640
No emails.

3351
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:25,640
Never mind.

3352
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:26,640
We won't do the mailbag.

3353
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:27,640
But we will do more news when we come back.

3354
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,640
It's a Quota Classic movie.

3355
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,640
We ain't found shit.

3356
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:34,640
Well, we hope you will find us again here after a quick break.

3357
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:35,640
We'll be right back.

3358
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:44,640
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

3359
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:52,640
Live tonight with episode number 642 of our show for this May the 22nd of 2016.

3360
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:58,640
Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, all here in studio with our pals from Video Game Bang,

3361
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:01,640
another Sacramento-based video game podcast joining us here in studio tonight.

3362
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:05,640
We got Aaron, Corey, Webb, all here.

3363
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:09,640
And I'm going to be crashing their show on Wednesday, so make sure you tune in.

3364
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:10,640
That'll be a lot of fun.

3365
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:13,640
I realize, horrible host I am.

3366
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:17,640
I never let you guys, like, tell people where to find your show.

3367
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:18,640
I mean, I figure people know how to use Google.

3368
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:22,640
But where can we find and follow all the good stuff for Video Game Bang?

3369
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:27,640
So the usual places, iTunes, just search Video Game space bang.

3370
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:31,640
We're also on Google Music, so if you have an Android device,

3371
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:33,640
that's probably the easiest way to find it.

3372
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:36,640
Facebook.com slash Video Game Bang bang.

3373
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:39,640
Twitter at Video Game Bang.

3374
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:43,640
And then we're actually going to be launching our website June 1st.

3375
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:48,640
And that will be VGBstudios.com as well as Video Game Bang.com.

3376
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:51,640
Nice. Wow, you got a whole empire going on over there.

3377
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:52,640
Slowly but surely.

3378
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:53,640
Nice.

3379
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:56,640
And only we know about it.

3380
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:57,640
All right.

3381
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:02,640
We're going to pick up some rapid fire news and get into all the rest of the gaming news.

3382
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:04,640
And we want to get into as well our Skype line.

3383
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,640
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

3384
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:08,640
Orange Lounge Radio.

3385
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,640
We'll be opening that in just a little bit.

3386
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:13,640
But we do want to run through at least this rapid fire news here first.

3387
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:15,640
We'll start with Loki.

3388
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,640
All right.

3389
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:19,640
So unfortunately this isn't going to really save this game,

3390
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:24,640
but there's a nice little Easter egg from Home Front Revolution.

3391
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:27,640
And it's featuring Time Splitter 2 levels.

3392
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:30,640
Apparently there's an arcade machine in the game

3393
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:33,640
where you can actually play the first two levels of Time Splitters 2.

3394
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:38,640
Which, that's awesome, but it also pisses me off

3395
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:43,640
because I don't have Time Splitters 2 or even a new Time Splitters game.

3396
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:47,640
Are they upping the graphics on the HD remake for at least the two levels?

3397
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:49,640
It doesn't appear so.

3398
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:52,640
I don't know, maybe that's a sign?

3399
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:53,640
Missed opportunity.

3400
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:55,640
That would be pretty cool.

3401
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:57,640
But yeah, you get to play Siberia in Chicago.

3402
02:29:57,640 --> 02:29:58,640
So check it out.

3403
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:01,640
Oh, Siberia Arrow, I played that level so many times

3404
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:04,640
trying to beat it without being detected.

3405
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,640
Oh my gosh, that's...

3406
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:08,640
Time Splitter is a good one, yeah.

3407
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,640
That's awesome.

3408
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:10,640
That needs to come back.

3409
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:11,640
All right.

3410
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:15,640
And then, so Rockstar apparently has some new projects in the pipeline.

3411
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:18,640
They're seeming to be revealed soon.

3412
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:21,640
The thought is another Red Dead game,

3413
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:24,640
being that it's been hinted at several times

3414
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:27,640
through different social medias, Reddit and Twitter and stuff.

3415
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:30,640
Also, possibly something else coming out.

3416
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:34,640
I guess E3 might be a good place for them to announce that

3417
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,640
since I want to say that they're supposed to be there.

3418
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:39,640
My thought is maybe another Red Dead game

3419
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:43,640
being that they are getting the compatibility working for Red Dead Redemption

3420
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:46,640
and that would be something that I could see them announcing

3421
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:49,640
during Microsoft's press conference

3422
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:52,640
and then doing, hey, by the way, it's going to be a Games for Gold game

3423
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:54,640
and it's backwards compatible now.

3424
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:55,640
That would be awesome.

3425
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:56,640
Games for Gold?

3426
02:30:56,640 --> 02:30:57,640
Yeah.

3427
02:30:57,640 --> 02:30:59,640
So that would be something I could see.

3428
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:00,640
I don't know.

3429
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:02,640
Well, I guess we'll find out soon.

3430
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:05,640
And then, last but not least,

3431
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:09,640
Destiny had some leaks regarding the new expansion.

3432
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:12,640
And this is going to be called Rise of Iron.

3433
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:18,640
And I guess it's leaked from a new poster or key art for some poster

3434
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:20,640
that was said to come out.

3435
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:23,640
So, no idea.

3436
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:27,640
They're saying that I guess some people familiar with Bungie

3437
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:30,640
are saying that I guess it's going to feature a new raid.

3438
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:37,640
And they said loosely based on the earlier Fallen themed one

3439
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:41,640
of initially planned for House of Wolves DLC in year one.

3440
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:42,640
But I guess crap.

3441
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:44,640
I don't know.

3442
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,640
Neat artwork, though.

3443
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:47,640
That's pretty cool.

3444
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:50,640
I still yet, I bought Destiny

3445
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,640
like day one when I got my PlayStation 4.

3446
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:54,640
Still have not played it.

3447
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:56,640
That and Watch Dogs.

3448
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:59,640
Both games still in their case, not played.

3449
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:01,640
Have you actually watched Dogs?

3450
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:05,640
I have not watched Video Game Bang's Twitch story.

3451
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:08,640
But there are dogs on this poster.

3452
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:09,640
Wolves, I guess.

3453
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:12,640
Watch Wolves, the sequel.

3454
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,640
Alright, speaking of sequels,

3455
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:16,640
if you're looking forward to The Witcher 4,

3456
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,640
you might be waiting a little while.

3457
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:21,640
The Witcher 3 was pretty damn good.

3458
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:23,640
And maybe it's time that CD Projekt

3459
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,640
wants to move on to some other things.

3460
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:27,640
And based on some comments this week

3461
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:29,640
from the co-founder over at CD Projekt,

3462
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:30,640
Mark and Iwinski,

3463
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:33,640
they're not really actively working on A Witcher 4.

3464
02:32:33,640 --> 02:32:35,640
They're not denying that it's ever going to happen.

3465
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:37,640
But they're just saying that they're focusing

3466
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:39,640
on some other stuff right now.

3467
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:41,640
Saying there won't be any Witcher anytime soon

3468
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:42,640
if there ever will be one.

3469
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,640
And I would really like to see how people feel about it

3470
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:45,640
if they will enjoy it.

3471
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:48,640
Speaking about some other stuff they're working on.

3472
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,640
Witcher 3 Blood and Wine

3473
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:53,640
is the upcoming expansion there for Witcher 3.

3474
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:56,640
However, the CD Projekt is working on some other games

3475
02:32:56,640 --> 02:33:00,640
including Cyberpunk 2077.

3476
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,640
That is supposed to come out in the next couple years.

3477
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:05,640
There's also a mysterious AAA role-playing game

3478
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,640
between 2017 and 2021.

3479
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:10,640
But apparently it is not The Witcher 4.

3480
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:11,640
It's something else.

3481
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:13,640
And I think they've earned the ability

3482
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:15,640
to do some other stuff if they want.

3483
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:18,640
Another role-playing game I know has lots of people's attention

3484
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:20,640
Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon.

3485
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,640
You kids into Pokémon over at the Game Bang?

3486
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:25,640
Eh, on and off.

3487
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:28,640
I mean, to the Pokémon GO when that comes out.

3488
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:29,640
I know I'll be into that.

3489
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:31,640
But I haven't purchased...

3490
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:33,640
The last one I played was Silver.

3491
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:37,640
So I haven't been into Pokémon in quite some time.

3492
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:38,640
I'm notorious.

3493
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:41,640
I'll play them up through the first gym.

3494
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:43,640
And then the OCD in me gets really overwhelmed

3495
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:45,640
at everything I'm not catching and I quit.

3496
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:47,640
It just happens without fail every time.

3497
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:50,640
Back in my day there was 150 of them and we liked it.

3498
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:51,640
That's right.

3499
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:52,640
151.

3500
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,640
Whoa!

3501
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:54,640
No.

3502
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,640
He didn't catch them all clearly.

3503
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:57,640
152.

3504
02:33:57,640 --> 02:33:58,640
You forgot Missingno.

3505
02:33:58,640 --> 02:33:59,640
Alright.

3506
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:00,640
Oh yeah.

3507
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:01,640
Glitch.

3508
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:05,640
Anyhow, I know a lot of people are very excited about Sun and Moon.

3509
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:08,640
You can get more information on that apparently on June 2nd.

3510
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,640
Because remember, Nintendo ain't bringing it to E3.

3511
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:12,640
So they're kind of dumping the information a little early.

3512
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:13,640
Allegedly.

3513
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:14,640
Allegedly.

3514
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:16,640
So we don't know if it's gameplay footage.

3515
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,640
Maybe the evolutions of the starting characters they've already revealed.

3516
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:20,640
Who knows?

3517
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:25,640
But if you're a Pokémon fan, you probably already took June 2nd off of work.

3518
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:27,640
Also, World of Warcraft.

3519
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:29,640
You know that little movie that's coming out?

3520
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:30,640
The Warcraft movie.

3521
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,640
Not World of Warcraft movie, but Warcraft movie.

3522
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:34,640
Because it's early on in the lore.

3523
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:38,640
But as many people were speculating may happen,

3524
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:42,640
you will have a chance to get World of Warcraft by seeing Warcraft.

3525
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:43,640
Wow.

3526
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:49,640
If you see the Warcraft movie, it's through a promotion at certain regal cinemas.

3527
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:52,640
United Artists Theatres or Edwards Theatres,

3528
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:56,640
which is a whole chain that are kind of related here in the States.

3529
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:59,640
If you actually go see Warcraft through this promotion,

3530
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:03,640
you will get a free, full copy of World of Warcraft.

3531
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:07,640
Not the restricted version, but the full version of World of Warcraft.

3532
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:09,640
Which, they just recently announced,

3533
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:13,640
includes all expansions through Draenor.

3534
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,640
The latest one they just released.

3535
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:19,640
Now, it doesn't include Legion, the one they're about to release in August.

3536
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:21,640
So they'll make some money there.

3537
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:23,640
And yeah, those monthly sub-fees I think is what they're...

3538
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:25,640
That's what they're going to make their money once they get you there.

3539
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:28,640
They also, though, just gave out Warlords of Draenor for free,

3540
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,640
because that's how I have it.

3541
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:30,640
Right, right.

3542
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:34,640
To people who own base Warcraft, you now have that for free.

3543
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,640
So all you have to do is just wait?

3544
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:37,640
Yeah, apparently.

3545
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:39,640
You didn't use to be that way, man.

3546
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:41,640
You would have to, like, I remember when...

3547
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:44,640
I bought every expansion in between so I could get to Cataclysm.

3548
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:47,640
I think when Cataclysm was the newest one,

3549
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:52,640
I think you still had to buy Lich King and Cataclysm to catch up.

3550
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:54,640
Like, you didn't just get it all for free.

3551
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:56,640
And I said for the longest time, I used to do a WoW-focused show

3552
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:59,640
and I was playing more often, and I said for the longest time,

3553
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:02,640
you know, Blizzard needs to just include everything up to the latest expansion,

3554
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:04,640
because that's the only way you're going to get people on board.

3555
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:06,640
That's the way they do it with Final Fantasy XI,

3556
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:08,640
and I'm assuming they do it with, you know,

3557
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:10,640
because I've already bought that a few times now,

3558
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,640
but each time it's always with the additional expansions.

3559
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:16,640
Oh, and I'm sure with Final Fantasy XIV 4.0, whatever their next expansion is,

3560
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:17,640
they're just going to have a base game.

3561
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:18,640
And it's always dirt cheap, too.

3562
02:36:18,640 --> 02:36:21,640
Like, five bucks or something for the whole thing.

3563
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:23,640
Actually, they just announced with Final Fantasy XIV

3564
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:28,640
that their free trial is going to go now from level 20 up to level 35,

3565
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:31,640
so you can actually experience the job system that kicks in at level 30.

3566
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:34,640
So, that's kind of cool that they're expanding that out.

3567
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:36,640
So, there you go.

3568
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:39,640
Anyhow, so, yeah, if you've always been curious about World of Warcraft,

3569
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,640
I guess if you see the movie, this will be your chance.

3570
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:46,640
How nice of them to give me something to spend a bunch of money on.

3571
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:47,640
That's right.

3572
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:48,640
That's right.

3573
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:49,640
How nice.

3574
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:51,640
Exactly. It's drug, it's hood logic.

3575
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:53,640
That's right. It's the first hit.

3576
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,640
Yeah.

3577
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,640
After you've seen the pretty movie.

3578
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,640
All right, Dark Soccer, what do you have?

3579
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:02,640
Well, the thing that everyone on the internet ever has been linking to me for the last week

3580
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:10,640
is there is a fan movie for R-Type that's made by OdaKing 77077,

3581
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:17,640
aka Paul Johnson, who basically animated a little short movie

3582
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:21,640
about some guy who gets sucked into a copy of R-Type.

3583
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:23,640
Yeah, I watched that one.

3584
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:24,640
It was pretty neat.

3585
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:25,640
Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

3586
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:30,640
It was weird. They put a Not Safe for Work sign on it,

3587
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:32,640
and I was like, what's not safe for work?

3588
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:36,640
I guess they meant the language, but I'm like, there are people that curse everywhere.

3589
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,640
I don't understand what's not safe for work.

3590
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:43,640
Just what's baffling is how can anyone ever not know about the safe point

3591
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:45,640
when you're fighting the first level boss.

3592
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:47,640
Oh.

3593
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:49,640
How?

3594
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:52,640
It's just beyond me how people don't know about that now.

3595
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,640
What?

3596
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:58,640
Almost every fight in that game has a sweet spot that you can stay in

3597
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:00,640
where nothing can hit you.

3598
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:03,640
Honestly, I just haven't played R-Type.

3599
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:07,640
It was well done because it was done by mainly one guy, basically, right?

3600
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:08,640
Yeah.

3601
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,640
Yeah, it was very well done.

3602
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,640
The music was done. Actually, I loved the remix of the music in there

3603
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:21,640
because the first level of R-Type has probably my favorite piece of video game music ever.

3604
02:38:21,640 --> 02:38:25,640
And it was a really good homage to it. I thought it was great.

3605
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:35,640
So, also, for folks out there who have some concerns, concerns about,

3606
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:38,640
you know, it would also help if I didn't close the wrong window.

3607
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:43,640
Anyway, there's actually some, for people who had concerns about Yooka-Laylee,

3608
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:48,640
there's some screenshots out, and it's pretty. It's so pretty.

3609
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:50,640
And that's what's really important.

3610
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,640
That's what I look for first in video games.

3611
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:53,640
Exactly, right?

3612
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:54,640
It's pretty, yeah.

3613
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:55,640
Is it pretty?

3614
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:56,640
Nope.

3615
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:57,640
Okay. Gotta move on.

3616
02:38:57,640 --> 02:39:01,640
It is prettier than a little girl and her Sunday best. Is that pretty?

3617
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:03,640
No comment on that one.

3618
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:04,640
You know what?

3619
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:07,640
Yeah, you're wise to just leave that alone.

3620
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:13,640
No jerk photo moments happening on this podcast.

3621
02:39:13,640 --> 02:39:20,640
So, in other news, we have some sales that are on until tomorrow.

3622
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:24,640
For the PlayStation Store, a bunch of games got knocked down to five bucks.

3623
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:30,640
One of them being Journey, which that means I should probably go buy it tonight,

3624
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:38,640
Borderlands, Max Payne, Manhunt, Shin Megami Tensei, Persona 3 Portable,

3625
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:42,640
the Jackbox Party Pack 2, and the Banner Saga.

3626
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:47,640
I only care about the one in there I have not yet played, which is Journey.

3627
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:51,640
And that's it. That's it.

3628
02:39:51,640 --> 02:39:56,640
So, I will, though, there's a little thing on here that did grab my attention,

3629
02:39:56,640 --> 02:40:00,640
which is, alright, did any of you guys ever see Perfect Blue?

3630
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:01,640
No, I don't think I have.

3631
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:02,640
Yes.

3632
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:05,640
It is a crazy anime. Like, completely wild.

3633
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:10,640
Well, it looks like apparently the other thing that the director did,

3634
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:15,640
Millennium Actress, is streaming for free, I think, but I can't find where.

3635
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:18,640
Look it up for yourselves if you care.

3636
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:19,640
Alright, you got Google.

3637
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:21,640
Alright, let's get to the foogle question.

3638
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:23,640
Speaking of Google, let's get to foogle.

3639
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:25,640
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together,

3640
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:34,640
and you get foogle.

3641
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:37,640
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities,

3642
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:40,640
and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

3643
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:43,640
And this one is about, I don't know if you guys saw,

3644
02:40:43,640 --> 02:40:49,640
there's a leaked prototype that just released this week for a Snow White NES game.

3645
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:52,640
Not that it was based on the movie, but I think it was kind of like a sequel,

3646
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:55,640
whatever they, it was called Happily Ever After.

3647
02:40:55,640 --> 02:40:57,640
Sometimes it was like spiritual successor to Snow White.

3648
02:40:57,640 --> 02:41:02,640
And apparently, the joke is, the game is fucking hard.

3649
02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:05,640
So for something like based on Snow White,

3650
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:11,640
it's apparently like ghosts and goblins level like tough.

3651
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:14,640
So anyway, we asked our listeners this week,

3652
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:18,640
what is a difficult video game that frustrated you,

3653
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:22,640
but you stuck with it to accomplish what you wanted in the game,

3654
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:24,640
whether that was like beating it, 100% collection.

3655
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:26,640
How did you make it through all the frustrations?

3656
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:27,640
That's what we asked this week.

3657
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:29,640
What was the game and how did you push through?

3658
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:32,640
Degenerate Johnny starting us off on Facebook saying,

3659
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:37,640
the one game that was difficult but maybe pushed through is Catherine on the hardest difficulty.

3660
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:40,640
If it wasn't for my intervention worthy trophy addiction,

3661
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:43,640
I don't think I ever would have made it through that amount of torture.

3662
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:47,640
However, my determination and perseverance to brag about this accomplishment

3663
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:50,640
allowed me to break through this near suicidal ordeal.

3664
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:53,640
Don't believe me? Look me up on PlayStation Network.

3665
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:58,640
It's amazing what those stupid little achievements and trophies will motivate you to do.

3666
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:03,640
Yeah, that was a bomb whenever Microsoft came out with achievements.

3667
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:04,640
Yeah.

3668
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:06,640
And he's like, I don't need this, but I'm going to do it.

3669
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:11,640
Which is funny because I know I'm going like really old school and showing my age here,

3670
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:14,640
but way back in the day when I was a kid during the Atari 2600 era,

3671
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:18,640
Activision, if you sent them like a Polaroid of your score in like Pitfall or something,

3672
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:22,640
they would mail you a patch that you could put on a jacket or something like that, right?

3673
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:25,640
And of course, I'm sure it signed you up for some mailing list

3674
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:30,640
to send you all the stuff to show mom for Christmas.

3675
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:33,640
But that was truly the first type of achievements.

3676
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:37,640
And I really think somebody at Microsoft thought of that idea and was like,

3677
02:42:37,640 --> 02:42:39,640
what if we just gave them a virtual patch?

3678
02:42:39,640 --> 02:42:41,640
Why don't we get some physical ones out here?

3679
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:42,640
Right?

3680
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:45,640
That's a great idea. We can do that to our games too.

3681
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:50,640
Back in the day when, and I'm surprised there have been no Activision collection

3682
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:52,640
where those patches are the achievements.

3683
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:54,640
That seems so logical.

3684
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:55,640
They've done that actually.

3685
02:42:55,640 --> 02:42:56,640
Did they?

3686
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,640
I want to say they have.

3687
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:58,640
With the full achievements? Maybe they did.

3688
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:01,640
I want to say, I don't know.

3689
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:03,640
It sounds like something.

3690
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:06,640
I want to say they have had an Activision collection with patches.

3691
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:09,640
All right. Fifth Dream on Facebook says Jet Grind Radio.

3692
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:11,640
I had so much trouble with the fast pace and the controls,

3693
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:14,640
but I liked the game a lot, so I kept playing.

3694
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:18,640
I attempted some levels 20 to 30 times before I finally beat them.

3695
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:21,640
I think the fact that I got a little better each time tried to push me to not give up.

3696
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:24,640
I was so proud when I won the game.

3697
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:27,640
Brad B., our buddy from Pod Culture, said BioShock.

3698
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:30,640
But the scenery and soundtrack alone are worth it.

3699
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,640
Sometimes you push through because it's pretty.

3700
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:35,640
Fat Cylon. I love that name.

3701
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:37,640
Fat Cylon replied Witcher 3.

3702
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:40,640
The trick was to not play anything else.

3703
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,640
I learned this the hard way by having breaks and coming back,

3704
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:45,640
only to have my ass handed to me by all and sundry.

3705
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:50,640
So it became my one and only and slowly but surely opened its hearts and legs to me.

3706
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:53,640
All this to make sure Ciri got her happy ending.

3707
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:56,640
Well, congratulations to you, Fat Cylon.

3708
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:59,640
RageNator says the original Super Mario Brothers.

3709
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:02,640
Got it as a separate game alongside my NES and Christmas of 87.

3710
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,640
I got fairly far in it but could never beat it.

3711
02:44:04,640 --> 02:44:07,640
I ultimately gave up on trying to beat it.

3712
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:10,640
Well, then you didn't really push through, did you?

3713
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,640
You're a quitter.

3714
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:12,640
You're a quitter.

3715
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:15,640
You know what? You need to go back and kick that game's ass.

3716
02:44:15,640 --> 02:44:19,640
Winston H. says I love this game but would have to say Persona 3.

3717
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:21,640
For the following reasons.

3718
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:24,640
Teammates leave after X battles due to fatigue.

3719
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,640
Elemental weaknesses work both ways so it can wipe your party out.

3720
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:30,640
Maps randomly generate so finding checkpoints are difficult.

3721
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:32,640
No real quick way to level up.

3722
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:39,640
And ultimate boss with game facts and save state still requires many hours of preparation than I care to admit.

3723
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:41,640
Sometimes you will just do that grind.

3724
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:43,640
Just, again, to say you did it.

3725
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:46,640
And Dark Tetsuya says La Mulana.

3726
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:48,640
Would you expect any different answer from Dark Tetsuya?

3727
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:49,640
I sure wouldn't.

3728
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:55,640
But no, seriously, the first time I made it through the game after 60 hours of exploration, tricky enemies and tough bosses,

3729
02:44:55,640 --> 02:44:59,640
I can't think of any other game that has quite made me feel like that.

3730
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:05,640
And lastly, ActDeft over on Google Plus says Tetris Evolution on the Xbox 360.

3731
02:45:05,640 --> 02:45:08,640
It's actually not a difficult game because it's Tetris.

3732
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:13,640
But there's an achievement called Dirty South Style Back to Back.

3733
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:15,640
I'm not going to look that up on Urban Dictionary.

3734
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:18,640
It's the name of my sex tape.

3735
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:21,640
But it's an achievement on Tetris Evolution.

3736
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:24,640
It asks you to do three Tetrises in a row.

3737
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:27,640
It's not something you can do by skill alone.

3738
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:29,640
It also requires a lot of luck.

3739
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:32,640
Yeah, to get three Tetrises in a row, you have to get three of those pieces.

3740
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:34,640
You also have to set it up.

3741
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:36,640
You have to set it up and just pray.

3742
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:38,640
That's the only way to do it.

3743
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:41,640
It made it all the more frustrating when you filled the screen

3744
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:45,640
and didn't get at least two long Tetrominos.

3745
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:51,640
I spent weeks trying to get that achievement back in the day until I finally got it.

3746
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:53,640
That is a pain in the ass. Good for you.

3747
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,640
Good answers, all you guys.

3748
02:45:55,640 --> 02:46:01,640
Anybody in the room care to give us a very difficult game that you just sucked it up and persevered?

3749
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:04,640
Mischief Makers on the 64.

3750
02:46:04,640 --> 02:46:06,640
Oh, nice treasure game.

3751
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:11,640
Yeah, that game I borrowed from a friend because he was like,

3752
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:14,640
this game is terrible. It's crap. I don't want it here.

3753
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:17,640
So he actually just gave it to me now that I think about it.

3754
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:22,640
And so I just played it one day because it sat there for the longest and I didn't play it.

3755
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:25,640
I put it in and I was like, this game is fun.

3756
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:30,640
Like shaking everything the whole time and then all of a sudden it was just like an addiction.

3757
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:34,640
And I just got into that game and I hadn't played until I beat it.

3758
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:36,640
And it got difficult, definitely.

3759
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:42,640
But it was one of those games that it's so fun that you don't really care how hard it was.

3760
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:45,640
You kind of still went through it.

3761
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:46,640
Jamie?

3762
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:50,640
Level 37 Lavos fight.

3763
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:56,640
Because I was determined to get the first of the special endings for Chrono Trigger.

3764
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:57,640
Good answer.

3765
02:46:57,640 --> 02:46:58,640
And I freaking did it.

3766
02:46:58,640 --> 02:46:59,640
You have to see every single ending?

3767
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:02,640
I think we've had 10 out of the 14 cartridge endings.

3768
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:07,640
Was it? No, 14 was the PlayStation one.

3769
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:10,640
The cartridge had 12.

3770
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,640
10 or 12. Yeah.

3771
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:14,640
We're like too short of all of them.

3772
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:20,640
Because Dan and I went through and did another few rounds of Chrono Trigger together to add on to what I already had.

3773
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:24,640
I would say for me, the original Mega Man.

3774
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:27,640
Just because I remember that game.

3775
02:47:27,640 --> 02:47:29,640
I mean all of those games really are just about muscle memory.

3776
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:31,640
Like you just have to learn the patterns.

3777
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:33,640
You know when the enemies are going to come out.

3778
02:47:33,640 --> 02:47:35,640
What weapons work on what boss.

3779
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:39,640
Like a lot of the great old NES games, it's all about muscle memory.

3780
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:43,640
And you just push through because, I don't know, it's Mega Man and Mega Man's Red.

3781
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:47,640
The music! I wanted to hear all the music in the game. That's why.

3782
02:47:47,640 --> 02:47:50,640
Alright. Any other answers in studio?

3783
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:52,640
Alright. I was going to say VVVV.

3784
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:56,640
Oh yeah. I still never finished it though.

3785
02:47:56,640 --> 02:48:00,640
Because I got tired of playing the one level.

3786
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:02,640
That game is hard.

3787
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:06,640
I'm trying to remember the actual name.

3788
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:08,640
It's like...

3789
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:10,640
Let's see here. I'm just looking up the achievements right now.

3790
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:14,640
It was called...

3791
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:18,640
I guess it wasn't its own thing.

3792
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:24,640
It was the one that they had you where you had to flip through five different screens and then bounce back.

3793
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:26,640
And then get it and then bounce back again.

3794
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:28,640
It was a pain in the fucking ass.

3795
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:31,640
Yeah. No. That game is difficult.

3796
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,640
For sure.

3797
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:35,640
Alright. We're going to do just a few more stories here.

3798
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,640
Since we are after 9 o'clock, I think we'll do just one more round.

3799
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:39,640
We don't have emails this week.

3800
02:48:39,640 --> 02:48:43,640
But if you want to send emails to the show, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3801
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:45,640
if you want to participate in a future episode of the show.

3802
02:48:45,640 --> 02:48:47,640
I think we'll do one more rotation here in the room.

3803
02:48:47,640 --> 02:48:50,640
And then we'll probably dump the rest of those stories while we wait for some phone calls.

3804
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,640
So we'll do one more round here. So, Loki?

3805
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:55,640
Alright. Let's see.

3806
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:59,640
Well, let's just talk about there's a needle exploit that they have on the PlayStation 4.

3807
02:48:59,640 --> 02:49:02,640
I guess they've already got it running Linux, which I guess makes sense.

3808
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:07,640
But you can possibly run Steam games on the PlayStation 4.

3809
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:09,640
How is that possible?

3810
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:12,640
Well, it involves installing Linux.

3811
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:21,640
Basically, I guess, through a jailbreak, you install Arch Linux and then some software libraries.

3812
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:26,640
And once you have that done, you can install Linux version of Steam.

3813
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:33,640
And, yeah, they've got at least running the Steam interface, showing some video of that.

3814
02:49:33,640 --> 02:49:36,640
I'm not sure if they've run any games.

3815
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:41,640
Let's see the spoilery video here. See if they've pulled it up.

3816
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:45,640
Yeah, I don't know if they've run any games.

3817
02:49:45,640 --> 02:49:49,640
Oh, actually, they are running...

3818
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:51,640
Is that Bastion?

3819
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:53,640
They're running Bastion.

3820
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:56,640
Which is already available on the PlayStation 4.

3821
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:58,640
But, hey, hackers gonna hack.

3822
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:00,640
It's still pretty cool.

3823
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:07,640
However, you're not gonna be able to do it unless you've really kept an old version of the operating system.

3824
02:50:07,640 --> 02:50:10,640
You need 1.76 to jailbreak it and install Linux.

3825
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:14,640
And, of course, they're up to 3.5 or something now.

3826
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:17,640
So you have to find an old one on the shelf somewhere.

3827
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:20,640
You have to find one that's never been updated.

3828
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:24,640
Alright, well, I don't know about you guys. I don't know if you guys like to gamble.

3829
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:29,640
But if you are a gambler, this news may excite you, especially if you're a video gamer and a gambler.

3830
02:50:29,640 --> 02:50:32,640
Or it may really get you scared.

3831
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:43,640
Because, apparently, the governor of Nevada and the gambling commission of the state are considering allowing casino bookmakers to accept bets on professional gaming events.

3832
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:49,640
So just like you can bet on, what, horse racing and professional sports. You can bet on professional sports in Nevada, right?

3833
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:51,640
That's why Nevada doesn't have any professional teams.

3834
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:54,640
You can bet on literally anything in Nevada.

3835
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:56,640
Can you bet on salty bets?

3836
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:58,640
Maybe.

3837
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:00,640
That's so meta.

3838
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:09,640
I don't really want to do that because, yeah, you don't normally win, but it's interesting.

3839
02:51:09,640 --> 02:51:14,640
But get this, the casinos are looking into it because they want to keep sports books fresh.

3840
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:19,640
I guess this is a way to hook a whole new generation on gambling.

3841
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:22,640
Very clever, but dangerous.

3842
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:39,640
I feel like the esports community, while I love watching the FGC events, like Street Fighter and Killer Instinct, I feel like for such a small and young sport, it's already gone through so much controversy.

3843
02:51:39,640 --> 02:51:46,640
There's PED usage in esports that people are cracking down on. Sponsors like, what was it called?

3844
02:51:46,640 --> 02:51:47,640
Pornhub.

3845
02:51:47,640 --> 02:51:49,640
Yeah, that's the one. I have no idea what that is.

3846
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:51,640
Of course, of course.

3847
02:51:51,640 --> 02:51:57,640
That has spawned controversy. So now this is just going to get worse. People are going to be throwing matches.

3848
02:51:57,640 --> 02:51:58,640
PED usage? What's that?

3849
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:00,640
Yeah, there's PED usage.

3850
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:01,640
Performance enhancing drugs.

3851
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:03,640
Oh, what Red Bull? Too much Red Bull?

3852
02:52:03,640 --> 02:52:05,640
I read about that on the internet.

3853
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:07,640
They're pissing hot.

3854
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:14,640
Adderall, they say that it's a performance enhancer and they do testing for it now on the esports level.

3855
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:19,640
Isn't Adderall what they give like extreme ADD, ADHD type of stuff?

3856
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:21,640
They say it helps you focus.

3857
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:22,640
It does, actually.

3858
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:30,640
It does, but if the doctor prescribes it to you, you're not supposed to take it unless the doctor knows you're taking it.

3859
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:34,640
Or unless the coach for the esports prescribes it to you.

3860
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:47,640
Well, if they're not medical school, then that's not a good thing. Anyway, apparently the committee who has set up this whole esports, or gambling on esports thing, they did get feedback from Fatality.

3861
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:51,640
Oh, well I'm glad they got him. Thank god he's involved.

3862
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:54,640
The voice.

3863
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:59,640
I'm glad he can speak for all of esports. At least they talked to somebody, whatever.

3864
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:07,640
I feel like gamer culture kind of takes things that are popular already and then just does them worse. Like celebrities, for example.

3865
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:09,640
Twitch celebrities are the worst.

3866
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:11,640
Really? Oh, those are fighting words.

3867
02:53:11,640 --> 02:53:12,640
They are so bad.

3868
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:14,640
They can be very bad, yes.

3869
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:18,640
They get real life celebrities and interview them and stuff and they're amazing people.

3870
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:27,640
The scandal and just the general mentality of YouTube stars, typically, and Twitch streamers are just some of the worst people.

3871
02:53:27,640 --> 02:53:34,640
I think it just has to be like, a lot of it has to do with, I think, their personality because of the audience that they're trying to attract.

3872
02:53:35,640 --> 02:53:40,640
It's the age range is really immature, so a lot of times they're kind of personally very immature.

3873
02:53:40,640 --> 02:53:51,640
Whereas there's some personalities like, I can think of John Bain, TotalBiscuit, who seem very mature and just kind of with it.

3874
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:59,640
Whereas there's just some that they like to do let's plays for Minecraft and Scream. So, I mean, it just depends.

3875
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:00,640
Do you guys go to TwitchCon?

3876
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:02,640
Yes, the two of us do.

3877
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:08,640
I feel like there's a story here because I went TwitchCon for a day even though I was like, I'm not really interested in going because I don't really do a lot with Twitch.

3878
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:14,640
But then my buddy Jason who does the voiceovers for the show was like, dude, I got an extra ticket. It's in San Francisco. Just come.

3879
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:20,640
And I was like, you know what? I do need to stop being such a stubborn old man. This is where things are trending. I need to kind of look into it.

3880
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:27,640
And it was actually kind of refreshing because they had all of these celebrities there. I didn't know who the fuck any of them were. Any of them were.

3881
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:28,640
Great feeling, wasn't it?

3882
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:36,640
I guess, but at the same time, you know, I didn't expect that any of them knew who I was because I knew I was the old podcasting dude. So, like, nobody's going to know who I am.

3883
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:41,640
The only one I think I've ever enjoyed was Lady Insanity because she does Bioware games.

3884
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:51,640
And I'm not to say that like all Twitch celebrities are bad. I'm not saying that at all. It was just kind of like, yeah, there are certainly some and then some are going to ruin it for the rest that do have the diva attitudes.

3885
02:54:51,640 --> 02:55:03,640
Yeah. And so I think it's like reaching over to the same deal in esports. Like, I just don't understand it. You're nobody still. Keep your humbleness. You know, you're just famous on the internet.

3886
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:15,640
They've tried so much to like really make it like a thing. I remember like one time I got invited or it wasn't even, I don't know if I got invited or I had like an invite and there's no way I could go to it.

3887
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:26,640
It was like to the Playboy Mansion for they were doing a draft for like some sort of esports team or so. I know how the fuck I got the invite, but I couldn't go and I was extremely disappointed by that.

3888
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:31,640
Why could this? There's no, you couldn't go. It's the Playboy Mansion.

3889
02:55:31,640 --> 02:55:32,640
I think it was the trap, brother.

3890
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:34,640
Being married with children, though, unfortunately, there is no way.

3891
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:35,640
You take the family, then.

3892
02:55:35,640 --> 02:55:42,640
It was literally like the day before it was going to happen. It's like, okay, I can't do this. You know, arrange work.

3893
02:55:42,640 --> 02:55:47,640
I take the whole family. We pack up and we show on Hef's door right there.

3894
02:55:47,640 --> 02:55:58,640
I'm going to take you way back to the show that preceded OLR that I was on. Way back in the day, 2001, I was co-hosting a show called Understadation Live with my buddy Travis Donovan, who has now since retired.

3895
02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:09,640
And one day on a whim, we called the Bunny Ranch. We got Dennis Hoff on the line interviewing with us for a good 45 minutes because nobody knew what the fuck internet radio was.

3896
02:56:09,640 --> 02:56:19,640
Just like, this is the big fucking thing right now, right? He fucking invites us to the Bunny Ranch to hang just at some celebrity thing, right? We didn't go.

3897
02:56:19,640 --> 02:56:20,640
What the hell?

3898
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:21,640
Opportunities.

3899
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:32,640
And I swear to God, I don't really have regrets because I was like, there was a part of me that was like, well, first off, I'm gay, so there's probably not a lot for me at the Bunny Ranch. Let's be real.

3900
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:34,640
There's tits, come on.

3901
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:36,640
I still love boobies. Who doesn't love boobies?

3902
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:43,640
But, and I'm sure Dennis would have found something for me, but that's kind of past the point.

3903
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:47,640
You serve food there, how are there cheese sticks? Because that's really what I meant.

3904
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:54,640
That's right. How's the food? How's the food? I just, there's that little voice in the back of my head going, you're walking into a situation you don't really want to be in, Rob.

3905
02:56:54,640 --> 02:57:04,640
That one, you dive head on and then you tell people, you tell us now, the 15 years later or whatever, you tell us now.

3906
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:08,640
Tell my grandkids, my gay ass went to the Bunny Ranch.

3907
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:10,640
Was that one of those telltale situations?

3908
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:13,640
A and go this way or B and go this way.

3909
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:17,640
Yeah, Dennis will remember that. That was the last time we ever spoke to him.

3910
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:29,640
Anyway, let's see. Where were we? Oh, yes. More stories. Dark soccer, I care to follow up the Bunny Ranch story.

3911
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:34,640
Good lord. I started watching a Yo-kai Watch games anyway.

3912
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:36,640
Were you there during that episode when that happened?

3913
02:57:36,640 --> 02:57:37,640
What?

3914
02:57:37,640 --> 02:57:38,640
That was a long, because you used to guess.

3915
02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:40,640
Yes, I was, actually.

3916
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:41,640
I used to guess on Education Live all the time.

3917
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:44,640
Was it, I was either a guest or filling in for Jessica?

3918
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:46,640
I feel like Jess was there.

3919
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:48,640
I was sitting in the stereo chair.

3920
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:49,640
Yeah, yeah.

3921
02:57:49,640 --> 02:57:50,640
That was it.

3922
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:51,640
Anyway.

3923
02:57:51,640 --> 02:57:54,640
So yeah, because I think I've been like a guest on that show like more than anyone.

3924
02:57:54,640 --> 02:58:05,640
So anyway, we had brought this up a few episodes ago about concerns about Miitomo, about what happens with all those weird questions they ask you.

3925
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:08,640
Who in here other than me is still playing Miitomo?

3926
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:10,640
Every day they go to the NSA.

3927
02:58:10,640 --> 02:58:15,640
Every day. I missed one day. The day I went to Great America this week was the first Miitomo day I've missed.

3928
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:17,640
That was the thousand coin day.

3929
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:25,640
You get it the next day.

3930
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:29,640
You're never going to get your Miitomo Sojourner that way.

3931
02:58:29,640 --> 02:58:36,640
Well, Nintendo released a statement and I'm just going to read it because they sum it up pretty nicely.

3932
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:44,640
The goal of our Miitomo questions is to spark fun conversations with your friends and for you to discover new facts about them as they answer the questions being posed.

3933
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:48,640
In your dreams, how many blooming flowers do you see? What the fuck question was that?

3934
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:50,640
That's how many people do you want to fuck?

3935
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:51,640
Yeah, which is, it's code for...

3936
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:53,640
Let me finish reading it.

3937
02:58:56,640 --> 02:59:00,640
That's why Miitomo generally avoids yes or no questions.

3938
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:12,640
As to the answer information our customers provide through the Miitomo app, it is only used to provide a better experience for Nintendo consumers and to support the application.

3939
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:17,640
Neither Nintendo or any of its partners sells or shares that answer information for any other purposes.

3940
02:59:17,640 --> 02:59:20,640
However, Nintendo knows.

3941
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:25,640
Now, one of my friends on the app just said fuck it to their questions and started asking his own.

3942
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:29,640
I'm taking over.

3943
02:59:29,640 --> 02:59:31,640
He numbers them so you know which one's which.

3944
02:59:31,640 --> 02:59:36,640
Yeah, because you have the little chat threads and I didn't really realize that until you pointed it out.

3945
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:38,640
They're like, no, we have conversations on Miitomo, Rob.

3946
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:44,640
I'm like, oh yeah, I guess because you can leave comments and the comments will usually go completely off track.

3947
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:48,640
Yet you get alerted whenever somebody posts a new comment.

3948
02:59:48,640 --> 02:59:51,640
It's basically LiveJournal for the modern era.

3949
02:59:51,640 --> 03:00:01,640
This same friend, by the way, is an excellent maker of Miitomo photos that involve spread legs, open mouth kisses and buttholes.

3950
03:00:03,640 --> 03:00:04,640
Three of my favorite things.

3951
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:06,640
On the next episode of OLR.

3952
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:09,640
He's actually pretty cool, but he's also hilarious.

3953
03:00:09,640 --> 03:00:15,640
My coworker is trying to get me to play Miitomo because she doesn't have any friends that play that.

3954
03:00:15,640 --> 03:00:18,640
And so she's like, well, the only way you can play it is if you have friends.

3955
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:22,640
I'm like, I'll add your sad friend if you want.

3956
03:00:22,640 --> 03:00:26,640
No, no, no. You add the friend and then they make friends with all your friends and then they talk shit about you.

3957
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:29,640
If they're not following me on Twitter or Facebook, I don't add them.

3958
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:31,640
I've added a few people.

3959
03:00:31,640 --> 03:00:33,640
Am I being a Twitch celeb?

3960
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:34,640
Yep.

3961
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:35,640
Let's go.

3962
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:36,640
I've added a few people.

3963
03:00:36,640 --> 03:00:37,640
What's that?

3964
03:00:37,640 --> 03:00:38,640
I've added a few people.

3965
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:40,640
Just a bunch of actually random people.

3966
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:43,640
Some have gone like, oh, this is so-and-so.

3967
03:00:43,640 --> 03:00:44,640
Oh, OK.

3968
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:45,640
But yeah.

3969
03:00:45,640 --> 03:00:52,640
I figured if they're friends of my friends, they have to be OK because I don't hang out with shitty people.

3970
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:56,640
And if they turn out to be, you know, shit stains, they get wiped.

3971
03:00:56,640 --> 03:00:59,640
I'm easy.

3972
03:00:59,640 --> 03:01:00,640
That's what bleach is for.

3973
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:03,640
I will end you.

3974
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:07,640
I won't just cut you. I will dismember you.

3975
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:09,640
Wow, the wonderful world of Miitomo.

3976
03:01:09,640 --> 03:01:13,640
I want to know from this comment because, you know, we're talking about LiveJournal and throwback and all that.

3977
03:01:13,640 --> 03:01:16,640
I want to know when the first Miitomo hookup is going to happen.

3978
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:18,640
If it hasn't already, it probably has, right?

3979
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:21,640
Like we met in Miitomo and then day one, I'm sure.

3980
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:26,640
Tonight on Channel 10 News.

3981
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:27,640
Did you guys get in Miitomo?

3982
03:01:27,640 --> 03:01:28,640
Would you check it out at all?

3983
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:29,640
I have not.

3984
03:01:29,640 --> 03:01:32,640
I literally just looked it up right now to see what's all.

3985
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:33,640
And you're the phone guy, too.

3986
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:35,640
It's like five million.

3987
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:37,640
Five million downloads right now for it.

3988
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:42,640
Eleven year old Stacy was drawn across state lines.

3989
03:01:43,640 --> 03:01:46,640
So you've got Miitomo?

3990
03:01:46,640 --> 03:01:52,640
Someone in here who I'm not already friends with needs to have Miitomo so I can get the face to face challenge met.

3991
03:01:52,640 --> 03:01:55,640
I downloaded it for, I think I had it for a week.

3992
03:01:55,640 --> 03:01:57,640
I played it the first day.

3993
03:01:57,640 --> 03:02:04,640
I bought like new clothes and then I go, I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with this app.

3994
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:06,640
And then so I just kind of left it and then I needed space on my phone.

3995
03:02:06,640 --> 03:02:08,640
So I deleted it.

3996
03:02:08,640 --> 03:02:10,640
I don't understand it.

3997
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:11,640
I don't know.

3998
03:02:11,640 --> 03:02:16,640
It's like for me, I get more useful information on my friends out of Miitomo than I do on Facebook.

3999
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:19,640
Because Facebook is just like, here's this clickbait article.

4000
03:02:19,640 --> 03:02:24,640
Here's this picture of my friends and I at something you weren't invited to.

4001
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:26,640
Like all this stuff.

4002
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:30,640
And then Twitter is just like, random, random, random again.

4003
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:32,640
Twitter is like, hi everybody.

4004
03:02:32,640 --> 03:02:33,640
I'm on this place.

4005
03:02:33,640 --> 03:02:34,640
Look, this bathroom looks shitty.

4006
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:37,640
P.S. I want X person to adopt me and be cool.

4007
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:42,640
Thank you Facebook app for telling me every single time there's a new view on Orange Lounge page.

4008
03:02:42,640 --> 03:02:44,640
Like, I don't need to know this.

4009
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:50,640
And the things, I do love Twitter, but the things people post are like, you guys have to try the new burger at Red Robin.

4010
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:52,640
Or, hi, I'm pooping.

4011
03:02:52,640 --> 03:02:55,640
Like, you know, it's just people write, you know, sometimes like weirdly weird stuff.

4012
03:02:55,640 --> 03:02:58,640
I am pooping after trying the brand new burger at Red Robin.

4013
03:02:58,640 --> 03:03:00,640
I tweeted that once, okay guys?

4014
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:02,640
It was once.

4015
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:05,640
Alright.

4016
03:03:05,640 --> 03:03:07,640
Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.

4017
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:09,640
I'm not going to keep it open very long though, you guys.

4018
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:11,640
So if you want to get in, you should probably do that now.

4019
03:03:11,640 --> 03:03:15,640
If you have a question for us, or possibly for our friends from Video Game Bang, you can do that.

4020
03:03:15,640 --> 03:03:16,640
Call us now.

4021
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:18,640
1-877-GAME-OLR.

4022
03:03:18,640 --> 03:03:20,640
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4023
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:21,640
All one word.

4024
03:03:21,640 --> 03:03:26,640
If you want to give us a call, Skype line is open right now for you to call in.

4025
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:28,640
So, let's get to it.

4026
03:03:28,640 --> 03:03:30,640
We've got calls already coming in.

4027
03:03:30,640 --> 03:03:32,640
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

4028
03:03:32,640 --> 03:03:34,640
Hey, this is RagingNator.

4029
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:36,640
Hey, RagingNator. How's it going, buddy?

4030
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:38,640
Oh, pretty good.

4031
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:42,640
I'll try to make this short and sweet just in case someone else wants to call in.

4032
03:03:42,640 --> 03:03:44,640
Yeah, we're pretty popular.

4033
03:03:44,640 --> 03:03:56,640
Yeah, I don't know if you heard the story, but apparently there's been a leak regarding an upcoming steam sale.

4034
03:03:56,640 --> 03:04:05,640
Supposedly, the next major steam sale is going to be the final week of June leading up until July 4th.

4035
03:04:05,640 --> 03:04:07,640
Don't they do like a big summer?

4036
03:04:07,640 --> 03:04:08,640
Yeah, it's usually around then.

4037
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:12,640
Yeah, I feel like, cue the whole Gaben.tv, the whole,

4038
03:04:12,640 --> 03:04:14,640
How do you believe in miracles?

4039
03:04:14,640 --> 03:04:18,640
The whole thing, because there's going to be a steam sale. It's going to come raining down and everything you've been wanting will be on sale.

4040
03:04:18,640 --> 03:04:20,640
They've correlated it with E3 the past couple of years.

4041
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:24,640
I feel like every time an E3 and then Humble also usually comes out with something really cool.

4042
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:28,640
Yeah, because steam's got a lot more competitors these days, I feel like.

4043
03:04:28,640 --> 03:04:32,640
Everything I see on sale, it's just all in your library, in your library, in your library.

4044
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:35,640
I don't remember purchasing that, but it's in my library. Okay, cool.

4045
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:40,640
Yeah, I guess that wouldn't really surprise me. I'll be curious about two things.

4046
03:04:40,640 --> 03:04:43,640
Do they put any of the new stuff on sale? That's the first one.

4047
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:48,640
Are they going to knock 10%, 25% off Doom or something? That's always the big question.

4048
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:54,640
And then, is there going to be a mini game? Because sometimes steam does these meta games for the sales that are really fun.

4049
03:04:54,640 --> 03:05:02,640
That last one was ridiculous. They did their own version of Cookie Clicker or whatever that just went fucking nuts.

4050
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:15,640
One thing that I noticed in previous sales though is that the particularly old, old games that are on steam.

4051
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:22,640
Let's say, just to pick something off the top of my head, Everyday Shooter.

4052
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:33,640
It's not very likely to be marked down. Now, you're kind of hoping that something like that would be marked down.

4053
03:05:33,640 --> 03:05:37,640
It probably seems to say it's not going to happen.

4054
03:05:37,640 --> 03:05:44,640
Yeah, if there's something on your wish list you very badly want to go on sale, that is going to guarantee that it will not go on sale.

4055
03:05:44,640 --> 03:05:59,640
But on the semi relay though, is there like a top three games that you definitely want to go on sale in?

4056
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:04,640
If they do go on sale, you're going to jump on those like Hungry Dog jumping on steak.

4057
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:15,640
Well, I do keep a steam wish list going on and steam is very kind enough to email me every other day when a game on my wish list is on sale for 10% off or 20% off.

4058
03:06:15,640 --> 03:06:21,640
So, I'm pretty sure that will come into play. I still haven't picked up Final Fantasy 9, that little remake, so I think I want to pick that up.

4059
03:06:21,640 --> 03:06:27,640
I ended up buying Doom, that was on my wish list, but I was just like after I heard all the positive feedback on it.

4060
03:06:27,640 --> 03:06:29,640
It was like 15% off on some of the websites right now.

4061
03:06:29,640 --> 03:06:38,640
God, don't fucking tell me that. Let's see, I'm trying to think of what else is on my wish list that I want. I don't know, there's some other stuff too, Raginator.

4062
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:41,640
You should play Danganronpa.

4063
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:46,640
Okay, I'll just put that in the queue with the 500 other games I have to catch up on.

4064
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:51,640
What about you? What's your number one thing you want to see go on sale, on sale, on sale, Raginator?

4065
03:06:52,640 --> 03:07:00,640
Kind of hard to say, and honestly I should slow down on my game purchases, because my God, do I already have a backlog.

4066
03:07:00,640 --> 03:07:04,640
Sell that stuff in your closet that the cat keeps getting into.

4067
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:18,640
Yeah, seriously though, I kind of want to get some of the Final Fantasy games that I'm still missing, like I'm missing 9.

4068
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:20,640
Square Enix has taken over.

4069
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:23,640
Yeah, 4, 5, and 6.

4070
03:07:23,640 --> 03:07:32,640
I will say this, I did think of a new answer. The game that I would most like to see go on sale during the summer sale would be Half-Life 3.

4071
03:07:32,640 --> 03:07:36,640
Yeah, that's probably not going to happen.

4072
03:07:36,640 --> 03:07:42,640
Raginator, you're ruining my dreams. You're ruining my dreams, buddy. Alright, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls. Take care, my friend.

4073
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:44,640
Alright, you too. Bye.

4074
03:07:44,640 --> 03:07:47,640
1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, orange lounge for you.

4075
03:07:48,640 --> 03:07:52,640
They need to put Darius Burst on sale soon, because I want that game.

4076
03:07:52,640 --> 03:08:00,640
Do you guys have disgusting Steam backlogs like the rest of us, or do you really stick to console? Because I know you give Aaron a hard time about being a PC guy.

4077
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:03,640
No, I play PC mostly. These guys are the console dudes.

4078
03:08:03,640 --> 03:08:05,640
Oh, did I get it switched around? I'm sorry.

4079
03:08:05,640 --> 03:08:09,640
Yeah, no, I give him crap because he always comes back to Papa.

4080
03:08:09,640 --> 03:08:12,640
I go everywhere. I'm a gaming whore.

4081
03:08:12,640 --> 03:08:16,640
Alright, we got another call coming in. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

4082
03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:18,640
What's up, everybody? It's Ranma.

4083
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:24,640
Hey, Ranma. Your connection's a little fuzzy tonight, but we'll try to push through it. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

4084
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:29,640
Sorry about that. My headset is kind of like when it's last stages of dying, so it's got to be replaced soon.

4085
03:08:29,640 --> 03:08:33,640
Well, stay in whatever position you're in and don't move because it's working fine. What's up?

4086
03:08:33,640 --> 03:08:40,640
Well, I slightly adjusted the mic, so a couple of things, then I'll be on my merry little way. So, Rob, I have a question for you.

4087
03:08:40,640 --> 03:08:42,640
Well, I have an answer for you, I hope.

4088
03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:50,640
The guests that are on your show, Video Game Bang, you said earlier that they were inspired by your show O.L.R.

4089
03:08:50,640 --> 03:08:52,640
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

4090
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:54,640
Wait a minute, what?

4091
03:08:54,640 --> 03:08:58,640
I don't want to sound like a Twitch celeb. I didn't quite say that.

4092
03:08:58,640 --> 03:09:06,640
I think what I said was that Aaron was listening to the all-game shows, and all of those shows kind of inspired in part,

4093
03:09:06,640 --> 03:09:10,640
but I really think All Games Interactive was probably the big one that really, you know...

4094
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:11,640
Forefront, yeah.

4095
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:15,640
No, so I'm not, like, my head isn't that big, Rama. Knock it off.

4096
03:09:15,640 --> 03:09:23,640
Okay, because I wanted to know, because if that was the case, O.L.R. has another sibling, and since I am the half-sibling,

4097
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:30,640
we talk about something different, we might have to call Maury and find out who the parents are, figure out why this podcast isn't doing video games.

4098
03:09:30,640 --> 03:09:34,640
Cue Aaron's happy dance, you know, when they find out he's not the father.

4099
03:09:34,640 --> 03:09:40,640
Am I correct that you just called O.L.R. to demand that Video Game Bang take a paternity test?

4100
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:42,640
Wow.

4101
03:09:42,640 --> 03:09:43,640
Wow.

4102
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:47,640
But I have been taking notes, so I do have a couple other things I do want to talk about.

4103
03:09:47,640 --> 03:09:48,640
Okay, all right, go for it.

4104
03:09:48,640 --> 03:09:50,640
You don't even look like me.

4105
03:09:50,640 --> 03:09:54,640
Well, Rama, I do agree with you about Miitomo, so I'm there with you on that.

4106
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:58,640
If I don't know who they are, I do not add them. I don't have time for it.

4107
03:09:58,640 --> 03:10:00,640
Thank you! Am I just being a diva?

4108
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:01,640
No.

4109
03:10:01,640 --> 03:10:04,640
I only accept people in my life that I clearly inspire.

4110
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:08,640
If I can't speak, what's your Facebook connection, who you are?

4111
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:18,640
No, simple as that. I've actually had to say no to some people, and I've had some people actually ask me if I've actually accepted their friend request,

4112
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:25,640
or I got them just like, um, let me get back to you on that, you know, so, yeah.

4113
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:31,640
The worst is when I know I've sent somebody a friend request, and I see them posting pictures on Twitter from Miitomo,

4114
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:36,640
and I'm like, I know you're checking that fucking app, and you still haven't accepted my friend request. What did I do to you?

4115
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:37,640
Jason.

4116
03:10:37,640 --> 03:10:40,640
Oh, shit, naming names.

4117
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:41,640
Shot fired.

4118
03:10:41,640 --> 03:10:48,640
I wasn't thinking about Jason, but I think he'd added me, but you have to remember to check that.

4119
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:54,640
So just a friendly reminder, be sure to check your friend requests on your Miitomo app, especially if your name is DJ.

4120
03:10:55,640 --> 03:11:03,640
Um, by the way, darktosuyu in chat says, I thought the pod father was Travis Donovan, since Undersedation Live inspired our show.

4121
03:11:03,640 --> 03:11:09,640
Travis Donovan would actually be retired grandfather at this point. He has gone off to the home.

4122
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:21,640
Rob, that makes you the new Don, okay, because you are the made man, and you've learned everything from him, so you are currently at the helm, pod father.

4123
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:27,640
I'll be appearing at TwitchCon 2016 in San Diego, but do not look directly at me.

4124
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:35,640
It is pretty safe to say, like, we all were very aware of Orange Land Radio. Aaron was an avid listener.

4125
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:42,640
When we started getting into it, I of course started researching, like, who's in the area doing this? What do they do? How could we learn from them?

4126
03:11:42,640 --> 03:11:46,640
You know, what's the do's and don'ts? You know, what makes a successful show?

4127
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:48,640
Did you find some don'ts?

4128
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:52,640
Uh, nothing specific from Orange Land Radio. No way. No, okay.

4129
03:11:52,640 --> 03:11:54,640
I was going to say, I can name some names, just don'ts.

4130
03:11:54,640 --> 03:11:56,640
Oh, there's some podcasts out there?

4131
03:11:56,640 --> 03:11:59,640
We like to support all indie podcasts, so we won't go there.

4132
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:02,640
This was back 15 years ago. I don't even think they're around anymore.

4133
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:03,640
Well, that's why.

4134
03:12:03,640 --> 03:12:05,640
Except you game and talk, Joey Ferris.

4135
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:07,640
Wow, he's a regular on the show.

4136
03:12:07,640 --> 03:12:08,640
We love him.

4137
03:12:08,640 --> 03:12:10,640
His show is good, too.

4138
03:12:10,640 --> 03:12:17,640
But no, no, no. There were some podcasts in my experimental days that really I would listen to.

4139
03:12:17,640 --> 03:12:20,640
And like I said when I first got here, they were like 30 minutes long.

4140
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:27,640
And, like, they would kind of quickly shoot past every single little detail, bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, and then bye.

4141
03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:28,640
And that was it.

4142
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:32,640
And they just had no room for, I don't know, casual banter sometimes.

4143
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:34,640
And, you know, it didn't feel, it just felt like a spreadsheet.

4144
03:12:34,640 --> 03:12:39,640
I do agree that, you know, if you're going to do a video game podcast, don't just read the news to people.

4145
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:43,640
Because people that have seeked out a video game podcast are already reading the news kind of thing.

4146
03:12:43,640 --> 03:12:48,640
Although, I do think there is a niche that a couple people feel very well at.

4147
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:54,640
If you do want to be the, you know, CNN and that journalistic side of it, then I think there is a little room there.

4148
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:55,640
You know what I mean?

4149
03:12:55,640 --> 03:13:01,640
But, yeah, you're right. For the most part, like, people that download gaming podcasts already kind of know what's going on in the gaming industry.

4150
03:13:01,640 --> 03:13:06,640
True. And, like, for us, one of the big moments, I was a fan of gamertag radio.

4151
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:09,640
That's the one I listened to and actually became a fan of.

4152
03:13:09,640 --> 03:13:14,640
So, I met them at an E3, exchanged information, and had Danny Pena on our show.

4153
03:13:14,640 --> 03:13:16,640
He was on our show a long time ago.

4154
03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:22,640
We did a holiday special one year where we got, like, we just invited a ton of, like, indie broadcasters on the show and he was there.

4155
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:26,640
But I met him at, like, Penny Art. One of those shows I met him at. He's a good guy.

4156
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:27,640
Super solid dude.

4157
03:13:27,640 --> 03:13:35,640
And, actually, we didn't even plan it, but the day he was on our show, maybe he did because he's smart, but it was International Podcast Day.

4158
03:13:35,640 --> 03:13:36,640
Oh, get out.

4159
03:13:36,640 --> 03:13:39,640
Yeah, so we had him on our show on International Podcast Day.

4160
03:13:39,640 --> 03:13:41,640
We got to just nerd out about podcasting.

4161
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:47,640
He told us about the good old days, you know, of recording on Xbox and his first time recording, like, in a pickup truck.

4162
03:13:47,640 --> 03:13:52,640
Yeah, and his jeep in the middle of the snow with his brother, like, on a laptop he recorded, he said.

4163
03:13:52,640 --> 03:13:57,640
Like, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, the rough times.

4164
03:13:57,640 --> 03:14:00,640
Oh, yeah, we did all that, too.

4165
03:14:00,640 --> 03:14:13,640
Yeah, and everybody scratches a different itch. Like, for us, we do kind of cater to more of a urban, you know, we have a lot of pop culture references, you know, like, on our show.

4166
03:14:13,640 --> 03:14:15,640
Urban? Is that what you're going with?

4167
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:16,640
I'm trying to be PC here.

4168
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:17,640
Wow, okay.

4169
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:20,640
I mean, people on our show come from so many different backgrounds, though.

4170
03:14:20,640 --> 03:14:21,640
Yes, yes.

4171
03:14:21,640 --> 03:14:23,640
We have, you know.

4172
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:27,640
We have a rainbow of characters that definitely come on the show.

4173
03:14:27,640 --> 03:14:28,640
And so do we.

4174
03:14:28,640 --> 03:14:29,640
Religions.

4175
03:14:29,640 --> 03:14:35,640
Yeah, we don't exclude anybody, definitely, and try to include everybody.

4176
03:14:35,640 --> 03:14:36,640
I agree.

4177
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:37,640
Except terrorists.

4178
03:14:37,640 --> 03:14:38,640
Wow.

4179
03:14:38,640 --> 03:14:41,640
So, no, yeah, we have terrorists on the show as well.

4180
03:14:41,640 --> 03:14:43,640
I mean, they have a point, right?

4181
03:14:43,640 --> 03:14:44,640
Great.

4182
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:46,640
Hey, Rama, you're still there, right?

4183
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:48,640
Yes, two more things, I'm getting out of here.

4184
03:14:48,640 --> 03:14:50,640
Oh, sorry. I thought you were there.

4185
03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:52,640
I think they forgot a collar was on the line.

4186
03:14:52,640 --> 03:14:55,640
The last guy had video, Rama, you're gonna have to get that back.

4187
03:14:55,640 --> 03:14:58,640
All right, anyway, sorry, go ahead, what was your other thought?

4188
03:14:58,640 --> 03:15:03,640
I wanna tip my hat to Jamie about her PSO talk tonight,

4189
03:15:03,640 --> 03:15:06,640
because I remember our good old days of playing Blue Burst.

4190
03:15:06,640 --> 03:15:07,640
Yes.

4191
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:08,640
It was a very good pick.

4192
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:11,640
I think everybody can agree that was a solid pick.

4193
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:12,640
Very good.

4194
03:15:12,640 --> 03:15:14,640
We'll have to revive that.

4195
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:15,640
I'm down.

4196
03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:17,640
We'll have Blue Burst night.

4197
03:15:17,640 --> 03:15:19,640
We'll burst something blue.

4198
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:22,640
I'll get a case of Blue Moon.

4199
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:27,640
Blue Moon and Blue Burst, that's so much fun.

4200
03:15:27,640 --> 03:15:29,640
There's better beer, I wouldn't do that to you.

4201
03:15:31,640 --> 03:15:34,640
I'll tell you this, anything is better than Budweiser.

4202
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:35,640
True.

4203
03:15:35,640 --> 03:15:39,640
Aren't they renaming to, like, America, or was that just a fucking Facebook prank?

4204
03:15:39,640 --> 03:15:44,640
They're renaming to America as a little homage to what's going on, and then there's another-

4205
03:15:45,640 --> 03:15:51,640
I won't drink it, I won't drink it, unless the very bottom or, like, under the thing says fuck yeah.

4206
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:53,640
I'll put it this way, I wouldn't drink it if it were free.

4207
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:58,640
Because I have something called self-respect.

4208
03:15:59,640 --> 03:16:03,640
You can't get in trouble for drinking in public, because are they gonna arrest you for drinking America?

4209
03:16:03,640 --> 03:16:05,640
You drunk off America?

4210
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:08,640
What, you a terrorist for arresting me?

4211
03:16:09,640 --> 03:16:17,640
And you know what? I have been so good that I'm gonna entertain myself with a Guinness tonight.

4212
03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:19,640
And y'all can't have any.

4213
03:16:20,640 --> 03:16:21,640
Because that's my shit.

4214
03:16:22,640 --> 03:16:27,640
Actually, believe it or not, I still have some of the buffalo sweat that, um, that Code Man sent us.

4215
03:16:27,640 --> 03:16:28,640
Sent me, really.

4216
03:16:28,640 --> 03:16:30,640
I just love some of these comments in chat.

4217
03:16:30,640 --> 03:16:32,640
Act deft, I'm drinking freedom.

4218
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:35,640
Uh, Scoppy says, uh, DWA, driving with America.

4219
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:37,640
Alright, anyway.

4220
03:16:37,640 --> 03:16:38,640
Uh, alright.

4221
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:42,640
There is an indie brew called Morica that's out.

4222
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:43,640
Fuck yeah.

4223
03:16:43,640 --> 03:16:44,640
Uh, anything else, Rama?

4224
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:46,640
Um, the Tetris movie.

4225
03:16:47,640 --> 03:16:53,640
It should be based off of the YouTube video, The Complete History of the Soviet Union, as a range to the melody of Tetris.

4226
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:58,640
I will be upset if the theme from Tetris, which I realize is like a classic song-

4227
03:16:58,640 --> 03:16:59,640
Isn't that an excerpt from Troika?

4228
03:16:59,640 --> 03:17:00,640
Yeah, it is.

4229
03:17:00,640 --> 03:17:01,640
It is.

4230
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:03,640
But it's the- I'm sorry, it's the Tetris theme.

4231
03:17:03,640 --> 03:17:08,640
It's one of those things where, like, they've just taken over the song and now it's theirs.

4232
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:10,640
It's like when Johnny Cash covered Hurt.

4233
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:13,640
Like, I love Nine Inch Nails, but, like, now that's Johnny Cash's song.

4234
03:17:13,640 --> 03:17:14,640
Like, sorry, it's just- it's done.

4235
03:17:14,640 --> 03:17:17,640
So, that is the Tetris song.

4236
03:17:17,640 --> 03:17:21,640
And if that song is not in the movie, we're not- I'm not- I can't handle it.

4237
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:23,640
Heads will roll.

4238
03:17:23,640 --> 03:17:24,640
Alright.

4239
03:17:24,640 --> 03:17:25,640
That's right.

4240
03:17:25,640 --> 03:17:27,640
Alright, take care of my friend, we're gonna let you go.

4241
03:17:27,640 --> 03:17:28,640
Alright, take care.

4242
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:29,640
Alright, bye.

4243
03:17:29,640 --> 03:17:30,640
Alright.

4244
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:31,640
Alright.

4245
03:17:31,640 --> 03:17:34,640
I am so sorry, guys, we are gonna close up the Skype line because we are- we're starting

4246
03:17:34,640 --> 03:17:39,640
to run a little bit long and we gotta wrap things up here in studio because it's about

4247
03:17:39,640 --> 03:17:42,640
9.30 and, you know, it's about time for the show to be done.

4248
03:17:42,640 --> 03:17:46,640
So, I wanna go around and get everybody's final thought here before we say goodnight.

4249
03:17:46,640 --> 03:17:51,640
I do wanna say, though, first off, a big thank you to the crew from Video Game Bank for being

4250
03:17:51,640 --> 03:17:52,640
here tonight.

4251
03:17:52,640 --> 03:17:53,640
We had a really good time tonight.

4252
03:17:53,640 --> 03:17:54,640
This was a lot of fun.

4253
03:17:54,640 --> 03:17:55,640
Lots of fun.

4254
03:17:55,640 --> 03:17:56,640
I thought 6 was gonna be a lot of people, but we made it work.

4255
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:57,640
This is good.

4256
03:17:57,640 --> 03:18:00,640
And I do wanna say, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, first off,

4257
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:02,640
support indie podcasting.

4258
03:18:02,640 --> 03:18:06,640
Just, you know, download our show, download Video Game Bank, download other shows at VOG

4259
03:18:06,640 --> 03:18:10,640
Network, download other shows at Nerd Reactor, download- just download indie stuff and support

4260
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:13,640
indie stuff because God knows we need it.

4261
03:18:13,640 --> 03:18:16,640
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two

4262
03:18:16,640 --> 03:18:17,640
about the show.

4263
03:18:17,640 --> 03:18:18,640
Help spread the word.

4264
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:21,640
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't air those voices if they're not

4265
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:24,640
here to use them, so please spread the word.

4266
03:18:24,640 --> 03:18:25,640
Spread the word.

4267
03:18:25,640 --> 03:18:29,640
A nice 5 star review wherever you found this show, such as iTunes or Google Podcasts or

4268
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:30,640
what have you.

4269
03:18:30,640 --> 03:18:33,640
Those go a long way and are appreciated as well.

4270
03:18:33,640 --> 03:18:36,640
Video Game Bank, thanks so much for being here tonight.

4271
03:18:36,640 --> 03:18:38,640
We'll do this again sometime if you guys are down.

4272
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:40,640
I know it's long, but we'll do this again sometime.

4273
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:41,640
So, yeah.

4274
03:18:41,640 --> 03:18:45,640
I'm looking forward to coming on your show on Wednesday, so we'll have to- what are we

4275
03:18:45,640 --> 03:18:47,640
gonna talk about Wednesday?

4276
03:18:47,640 --> 03:18:49,640
You can expect a mixed bag.

4277
03:18:49,640 --> 03:18:51,640
A lot's gonna happen between now and Wednesday.

4278
03:18:51,640 --> 03:18:52,640
That's true.

4279
03:18:52,640 --> 03:18:54,640
In this beast that we call video game.

4280
03:18:54,640 --> 03:18:55,640
Yeah.

4281
03:18:55,640 --> 03:18:57,640
But lots of laughs.

4282
03:18:57,640 --> 03:18:58,640
We can guarantee the laughs.

4283
03:18:58,640 --> 03:19:00,640
Alright, I'll try my best to be funny.

4284
03:19:00,640 --> 03:19:01,640
Alright.

4285
03:19:01,640 --> 03:19:03,640
I'm gonna go down the line.

4286
03:19:03,640 --> 03:19:05,640
Aaron, thank you so much for being here.

4287
03:19:05,640 --> 03:19:06,640
Appreciate it.

4288
03:19:06,640 --> 03:19:08,640
And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

4289
03:19:08,640 --> 03:19:09,640
Any party words?

4290
03:19:09,640 --> 03:19:12,640
Vote with your dollars when it comes to video games.

4291
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:13,640
You know?

4292
03:19:13,640 --> 03:19:15,640
They won't make crappy games if you don't buy them.

4293
03:19:15,640 --> 03:19:16,640
That is solid advice.

4294
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:18,640
You gotta vote with your wallet.

4295
03:19:18,640 --> 03:19:19,640
Very true.

4296
03:19:19,640 --> 03:19:20,640
Corey.

4297
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:21,640
It's just been great being here.

4298
03:19:21,640 --> 03:19:25,640
This is like a 15 plus year institution of podcasting, right?

4299
03:19:25,640 --> 03:19:26,640
Not quite that old.

4300
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:29,640
Don't over age us.

4301
03:19:29,640 --> 03:19:36,640
But actually, funny enough, next month, June 26th, happens to be my birthday and OLR's

4302
03:19:36,640 --> 03:19:37,640
14th anniversary show.

4303
03:19:37,640 --> 03:19:38,640
Geez.

4304
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:39,640
14 years of podcasting.

4305
03:19:39,640 --> 03:19:41,640
That's podcasting before podcasting.

4306
03:19:41,640 --> 03:19:44,640
Yeah, technically it wasn't a podcast when it started.

4307
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:48,640
We were just on Live 365 doing a live show, but we've carried that into podcasting.

4308
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:54,640
It's been an honor to be here and I'm so glad we met at that convention because it's

4309
03:19:54,640 --> 03:19:56,640
like we gotta work together.

4310
03:19:56,640 --> 03:19:57,640
So thanks for having us.

4311
03:19:57,640 --> 03:19:59,640
Thanks to Sac IGDA for bringing us all together.

4312
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:02,640
Yeah, those dudes were super awesome in putting that together.

4313
03:20:02,640 --> 03:20:04,640
So yeah, it's been an honor.

4314
03:20:04,640 --> 03:20:05,640
Thanks for having us.

4315
03:20:05,640 --> 03:20:06,640
Thank you.

4316
03:20:06,640 --> 03:20:07,640
It's been an honor to have you.

4317
03:20:07,640 --> 03:20:08,640
Webb.

4318
03:20:08,640 --> 03:20:09,640
Yeah, it's been awesome being here.

4319
03:20:09,640 --> 03:20:13,640
You guys have a really cool show and it's cool being able to hear from the audience

4320
03:20:13,640 --> 03:20:15,640
and yeah, it was a lot of fun.

4321
03:20:15,640 --> 03:20:16,640
It's very cool.

4322
03:20:16,640 --> 03:20:17,640
Thank you very much.

4323
03:20:17,640 --> 03:20:18,640
Thank you guys all so much for being here.

4324
03:20:18,640 --> 03:20:19,640
Check them all out.

4325
03:20:19,640 --> 03:20:22,640
Google, iTunes, just video game.

4326
03:20:22,640 --> 03:20:23,640
Bang.

4327
03:20:23,640 --> 03:20:24,640
How can you forget that name?

4328
03:20:24,640 --> 03:20:25,640
Jesus.

4329
03:20:25,640 --> 03:20:27,640
Just go out, Google it and follow them on everything.

4330
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:31,640
All right, let's go around and get the final thoughts here in studio.

4331
03:20:31,640 --> 03:20:32,640
I'll do my final thought.

4332
03:20:32,640 --> 03:20:37,640
My final thought is I'm going to try to forgive Ingress, but it may take me a little.

4333
03:20:37,640 --> 03:20:39,640
Jamie, you gotta help me find the love again.

4334
03:20:39,640 --> 03:20:40,640
Just help me level.

4335
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:41,640
All right, we'll see.

4336
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:42,640
We'll see.

4337
03:20:42,640 --> 03:20:43,640
Maybe.

4338
03:20:43,640 --> 03:20:44,640
I will give you the love.

4339
03:20:44,640 --> 03:20:49,640
I'm only going to continue to be on them because I really want that Pokemon Go invite.

4340
03:20:49,640 --> 03:20:51,640
I really want the beta invite.

4341
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:53,640
I put in for it.

4342
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:56,640
I'm going to cry if I don't get in.

4343
03:20:56,640 --> 03:21:00,640
What will be the absolute worst, this is my nightmare, if Shane gets in and I don't.

4344
03:21:00,640 --> 03:21:04,640
I will be so, like don't call me if that happens.

4345
03:21:04,640 --> 03:21:06,640
You know what would be awful though?

4346
03:21:06,640 --> 03:21:11,640
Given his absolute love of all things Pokemon, if you got in and I got in.

4347
03:21:11,640 --> 03:21:13,640
I would love that.

4348
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:14,640
He did not get in.

4349
03:21:14,640 --> 03:21:19,640
Or better yet, if I got in, I just don't give a crap about Pokemon Go.

4350
03:21:19,640 --> 03:21:21,640
Yeah, that would be the worst if Loki got in.

4351
03:21:21,640 --> 03:21:22,640
Like, Loki, tell us about the game.

4352
03:21:22,640 --> 03:21:25,640
I don't know.

4353
03:21:25,640 --> 03:21:27,640
Spot on impression.

4354
03:21:27,640 --> 03:21:29,640
It's like your guys' impression of me.

4355
03:21:29,640 --> 03:21:32,640
Loki, your final thought tonight.

4356
03:21:32,640 --> 03:21:37,640
Well, since we didn't have last minute stories, I thought I'd just leave everybody with this nice little story to piss you off.

4357
03:21:37,640 --> 03:21:42,640
So, thank you Nintendo for pulling another Nintendo.

4358
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:44,640
They decided that, hey, guess what?

4359
03:21:44,640 --> 03:21:47,640
You know that really awesome Minecraft thing that we put out?

4360
03:21:47,640 --> 03:21:49,640
That has all the Mario levels in it?

4361
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:57,640
Guess what? Even though Minecraft videos are really awesome and Mojang and 4J studios are totally allowing you to put it on there.

4362
03:21:57,640 --> 03:22:00,640
We're going to copyright claim all that shit because it has our fucking music in it.

4363
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:02,640
And we're assholes, by the way.

4364
03:22:02,640 --> 03:22:05,640
So disable the music if you're going to do it.

4365
03:22:05,640 --> 03:22:10,640
Apparently, yeah, they're being copyright claimed because you got to be that Nintendo partner in order to post those Nintendo videos.

4366
03:22:11,640 --> 03:22:13,640
God, is that really a thing? I thought it was a joke.

4367
03:22:13,640 --> 03:22:20,640
And we're hearing, basically they tweeted out, we're hearing reports copyright strikes on Super Mario mashup videos.

4368
03:22:20,640 --> 03:22:24,640
We're sure this wouldn't happen. We're following up with Nintendo.

4369
03:22:24,640 --> 03:22:26,640
Thank you, Nintendo.

4370
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:27,640
Thank you, YouTube.

4371
03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:30,640
Coming soon to Amazon Prime Minecraft videos.

4372
03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:35,640
Lastly, but not leastly, ladies last night, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

4373
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:44,640
I'm a little bit too obsessed right now with making my face look not like my face.

4374
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:48,640
But you have a very pretty face, but you also do very pretty makeup work.

4375
03:22:48,640 --> 03:22:49,640
Thank you.

4376
03:22:49,640 --> 03:22:50,640
It's art.

4377
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:55,640
It's all practice, practice, practice, because you know it's coming in the beginning of October.

4378
03:22:55,640 --> 03:23:00,640
I just, I literally can't believe like you are, you are, you are having your life changed by drag queens.

4379
03:23:00,640 --> 03:23:04,640
Well, you know my love of cosplay.

4380
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:11,640
And you know I've been wanting to change up what I do because it's gotten stale and everyone does the same shit that I've never seen.

4381
03:23:11,640 --> 03:23:14,640
I've seen drag queens do character perfect cosplay.

4382
03:23:14,640 --> 03:23:19,640
I have seen normal cosplayers do regular cosplay.

4383
03:23:19,640 --> 03:23:23,640
I have not yet seen drag cosplay and I'm going to make that happen.

4384
03:23:23,640 --> 03:23:29,640
All right. Well, but about the face, Dark Soccer, remember, remember what, what, what is said every week.

4385
03:23:29,640 --> 03:23:32,640
If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love anybody else?

4386
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:36,640
I already love myself and enough to love everybody else and myself some more.

4387
03:23:36,640 --> 03:23:37,640
All right.

4388
03:23:37,640 --> 03:23:41,640
We love all of you out there in OLR and VOG Network.

4389
03:23:41,640 --> 03:23:42,640
Thank you so much for listening.

4390
03:23:42,640 --> 03:23:46,640
We will be back in seven days to do it all again during Memorial Day weekend.

4391
03:23:46,640 --> 03:23:48,640
Oh boy, a Memorial Day show.

4392
03:23:48,640 --> 03:23:49,640
That should be fun.

4393
03:23:49,640 --> 03:23:50,640
That means three day weekend.

4394
03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:51,640
That means I don't work Monday.

4395
03:23:51,640 --> 03:23:53,640
Should we break out the liquor?

4396
03:23:53,640 --> 03:23:55,640
We'll find out in seven days.

4397
03:23:55,640 --> 03:23:56,640
Have a good one.

4398
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:57,640
Good night.

4399
03:23:57,640 --> 03:24:00,640
