Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.620
This week EA and BioWare are continuing the drip of Mass Effect Andromeda news and they've

00:17.620 --> 00:21.160
confirmed that we will see more at E3 which is now less than one month away.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.600
There's more news on things that will be in our hands before 2017 and we'll tell you about

00:24.600 --> 00:27.520
them right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.520
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.520 --> 00:34.520
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.520 --> 00:40.520
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 641

00:40.520 --> 00:48.320
for this May the 15th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento,

00:48.320 --> 00:55.120
California. You might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me are my co-hosts.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.120
Here with me every week, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.120
I'm not a happy bunny anymore, am I?

01:00.120 --> 01:07.120
I'm like the spiteful leftover from Mary Kay Makeup Testing Factory bunny.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.120
For like the first four years of the show I think I used to introduce you as like the

01:10.120 --> 01:13.120
happiest bunny on the farm or something like that. That was when you were obsessed with

01:13.120 --> 01:17.120
the little happy bunny cartoons. I think I still see them on Hot Topic once in a while.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.120
They're not funny anymore. They just got mean.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.120
And they ran out. I think they just ran out of good ideas at some point.

01:24.120 --> 01:31.120
Yeah, but I feel kind of too crusty to be a happy bunny anyway.

01:31.120 --> 01:37.120
You're getting a little too, I don't want to say too old, but too...

01:37.120 --> 01:38.120
Jaded.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.120
Jaded, I think is a good way to put it.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.120
You know what I am? I'm cynical.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.120
Yes. Although, you are certainly a happy bunny, and I don't want to spend too much time on

01:47.120 --> 01:50.120
this because it's a video game show, but you are certainly a happy bunny on Friday night.

01:50.120 --> 01:54.120
Dark Soccer and I don't get to hang out a lot a lot outside the show just because of

01:54.120 --> 01:58.120
our conflicting schedules, but we went out to the club on Friday with Alan. We went to

01:58.120 --> 02:01.120
go see drag queens because you know Jamie and I love drag queens. So we went and saw

02:01.120 --> 02:05.120
like the drag queen of the now, Kim Chi. It was a lot of fun.

02:05.120 --> 02:12.120
I have to fan myself now. I literally just pulled out my fan because oh my god. And like

02:12.120 --> 02:14.120
she gave me this big bear hug.

02:14.120 --> 02:19.120
Yeah. I was going to ask her what her favorite Pokemon was because that's what I asked

02:19.120 --> 02:23.120
Trixie when I met her. But I just, you know, in the moment you forget things.

02:23.120 --> 02:30.120
Well, I had spent like most of the afternoon trying to memorize how to say thank you in

02:30.120 --> 02:35.120
Korean, which now I haven't memorized. But I said that she's like, Oh my God, thank you.

02:35.120 --> 02:41.120
And let me sneak out my phone for a selfie. And then we and then like right before I left,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.120
she just says, just gives me this huge hug.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.120
I'm like, Oh, she's such a sweetheart.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.120
She's a sweetheart. So you were a very happy bunny on Friday.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.120
I was. I've been touched by greatness.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.120
All right. Also here in studio, someone who could care less about all these drag queens

02:53.120 --> 02:55.120
say hello to tech master Loki.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.120
I don't have any sort of opinion.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.120
Just neutral. Just very neutral. That's fine.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.120
If he could care less than he could care less. Anyway, he couldn't care less.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.120
How are you doing, Loki? Do you have a good week?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
All right.

03:08.120 --> 03:15.120
Yeah. So last week, you hurt some of our listeners like physically when you started screaming.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.120
Come on. How many years have you been listening to this show?

03:18.120 --> 03:22.120
You don't know what you're in for. I mean, seriously,

03:22.120 --> 03:27.120
I'm keeping my finger near his volume slider just in case because I'm about to ask this.

03:27.120 --> 03:32.120
But I notice in studio tonight you brought in you bought yourself this flashback console.

03:32.120 --> 03:37.120
I can see through the bag. Yeah, because no one sells Android Bluetooth gaming controllers.

03:37.120 --> 03:43.120
Yes, I could get extremely angry about that. But I have food today that was a somewhat

03:43.120 --> 03:50.120
try to absorb some of Jamie's happiness. Try to just promise like an end.

03:50.120 --> 03:56.120
And I complained about it on Twitter because that's kind of like teasing the show type thing.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.120
But, you know, active said, you know, we told you that last week, you know, you should just order it online.

04:01.120 --> 04:05.120
Yes, I know perfectly well that I can get it online.

04:05.120 --> 04:10.120
This I feel like this is becoming a thing for you, like this is the dude who won't stop and ask for directions.

04:10.120 --> 04:15.120
No, it's not that I won't ask for directions. It's listen.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.120
Oculus is trying to be a gaming platform.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.120
OK, you want me to take this platform seriously?

04:23.120 --> 04:27.120
So the Gear VR, which is, you know, I think it's a pretty great device.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.120
And now it has Minecraft for which is really major.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.120
I mean, you Minecraft on VR is awesome.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.120
You sell these devices in stores with the phones.

04:37.120 --> 04:43.120
So I, you know, theoretically, I could go there, purchase a phone, purchase a Gear VR,

04:43.120 --> 04:47.120
but I can't play Minecraft because they don't sell the controllers.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.120
Is it something because I feel like a lot of the listeners are going, you are literally crazy, Loki.

04:51.120 --> 04:56.120
And yes, I said literally because people don't have problems in their areas.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.120
It seems like it seems like something like this weird, like it's like local or something that you have.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.120
Do you just think about maybe just driving a Reno?

05:04.120 --> 05:07.120
No, I'm not wasting time driving the Reno.

05:07.120 --> 05:12.120
You can go have Steak and Shake in Reno. It's never a waste.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.120
But no, seriously, I've been to almost all the major retailers around here.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.120
I went to Fry's today. I went to even Toys R Us is where I got this.

05:20.120 --> 05:28.120
But Fry's like electronic store that literally carries everything like things that you don't even know you need.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.120
They have it there. They have everything.

05:31.120 --> 05:37.120
But they don't have one single goddamn controller for an Android or even iPhone device.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.120
I mean, they carry a billion different iPhone case covers and headphones and all the stuff,

05:42.120 --> 05:47.120
but not one, millions of different tablets, but not one of them.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.120
Like somebody out leaning in towards the volume slider.

05:51.120 --> 05:59.120
Somebody out there has to like seriously have some sort of inkling of wanting to play a game with a game, you know, gaming controller.

05:59.120 --> 06:07.120
Honestly, if Oculus and Samsung want me to take this platform seriously, it's like going to the store and saying,

06:07.120 --> 06:11.120
okay, I'm gonna go purchase an Xbox One. Oh, but I'm sorry, they don't sell the controllers at the store.

06:11.120 --> 06:17.120
You can order those online. If I'm going online to order something, I'm not going to your store.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.120
You're trying to get me into the store. Best Buy is like terrible at this.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.120
They're selling these in their own store.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.120
But yet they do not have a gaming controller for which half the games use.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.120
It's like, does it make any sense? It boggles my mind.

06:32.120 --> 06:41.120
All right. We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

06:41.120 --> 06:46.120
And if you are listening live, you can participate with the show in our chat room live.vognetwork.com

06:46.120 --> 06:50.120
where SSG100Matt says, this is Loki's white whale. He won't give up.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.120
Just like winning the DeLorean or building an arcade machine.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.120
He'll never give up trying to buy a controller in a retail store. Yes.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.120
No, it's seriously like I think it's a terrible excuse.

07:01.120 --> 07:07.120
I mean, let's look at this way. GameStop. I went to GameStop and that was one of the first places I went to because, you know, they should have controllers.

07:07.120 --> 07:12.120
They carry Android devices. It makes sense that they should have that.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.120
I went there and they're like, sorry, we don't carry it, but we carry it on our website.

07:16.120 --> 07:23.120
So you're telling me you have this in a warehouse somewhere. You get regular shipments from that warehouse.

07:23.120 --> 07:28.120
They can't throw a controller into that package and send it to your store.

07:28.120 --> 07:34.120
They want me to go online to order from their website, which I won't go to their website to order it. I'll go to a different website.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.120
SSG100Matt, he won't admit it, but you're absolutely right.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.120
StopianChat says, the world too. Loki zero.

07:42.120 --> 07:47.120
Alan Alchemy trying to remind you of happier times based on some things you were posting on social media.

07:47.120 --> 07:52.120
Loki is full of Brazilian cooked meats that were fed to him for hours. That is something that happened.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.120
It wasn't hours. I got full after 30 minutes because I didn't pace myself long enough.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.120
And I had too much pizza earlier in the day, so it just...

07:58.120 --> 08:03.120
No, never eat. If you know you're going to the Brazilian grill, you starve yourself for three days in advance.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.120
You have like a granola bar.

08:06.120 --> 08:11.120
I could have, but my body digested extremely quickly. So like, had I known that, I would have just sat there a little longer.

08:11.120 --> 08:16.120
We ran out of time. I knew we had to pick up the kids because, you know, they have to go to bed at some point.

08:16.120 --> 08:21.120
But it was good. I also pet a cow, so there's that.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
You pet a cow.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
I pet a baby cow.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.120
Congrats. That's an accomplishment.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.120
And then like an hour later, I went and ate a hamburger.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.120
That's farm the fork right there.

08:33.120 --> 08:38.120
Not if it wasn't the cow you just pet.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.120
That's true, but it's symbolic.

08:40.120 --> 08:46.120
Because, well, you know, in a similar thing, my aunt and uncle raised pigs for a living.

08:46.120 --> 08:54.120
When the swine flu went around, my uncle was on the news saying, don't stop eating pork, it's safe, and that whole thing, right?

08:54.120 --> 09:01.120
And I remember like as kids, we used to go to where they lived, the farm or whatever, and we would go pet the baby pigs and all that.

09:01.120 --> 09:06.120
And then we would come in the house and there would be like ham dinner, bacon, like everything.

09:06.120 --> 09:12.120
And like it didn't hit me when I was younger until like I hit a certain age where I kind of look back on it.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.120
And I went, that was like incredibly fucked up.

09:14.120 --> 09:22.120
I had to take my son to like a field trip. They took it to a farm, which is awesome because that farm had portals that no one can access until October.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.120
Because the farm's not open to the public until October.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.120
Anyways, so.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.120
Did you get keys? We need to anchor fields off of them.

09:29.120 --> 09:38.120
Keys, yes. So anyways, they had a bunch of baby animals for the kids to pet, and all the kids were like super excited, myself included, to pet the animals.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.120
And my son's like, I'm not touching those dirty animals.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.120
I mean seriously, that's what he says, he's like, I'm not touching them. I'm like, why aren't you petting the animals?

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
He's like, they're dirty and germy.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
I'm like, that is my wife.

09:49.120 --> 09:57.120
You are channeling my wife right there. In fact, it's funny, like I mentioned, I'm like, yeah, he didn't want to pet any of the animals.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.120
And she's like, yeah, because they're dirty and germy.

10:00.120 --> 10:06.120
And I asked him, so why isn't they even petting the animals? Because they're dirty and germy. I'm like, where'd you learn that one?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.120
What have you done to him?

10:08.120 --> 10:14.120
SSG100Matt says, Loki taking his kids to fun places for portals. Yeah, I wondered why you volunteered for that trip.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.120
Now I know.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.120
I volunteered for all of his field trips.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.120
No, that's true. He does.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.120
I missed the one in downtown Sacramento because that would have been nice.

10:22.120 --> 10:30.120
All right. Let's get into video games. It's what you guys are here to hear about, not just farm to fork and all this other stuff.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.120
We want to talk about video games. We usually do a kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

10:34.120 --> 10:40.120
I want to ask a little bit about this because, you know, and I got into this just a tiny bit on Bobby's show,

10:40.120 --> 10:43.120
because you were talking about like upcoming games we're going to play and all that stuff.

10:43.120 --> 10:47.120
And we're kind of getting into a period of the year that's going to get a little bit slower.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.120
I mean, yes, I know Overwatch is coming out and I know there's some big games.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.120
I know a big game just came out this week and we'll talk about that in a minute.

10:53.120 --> 10:59.120
But for all practical purposes, things are starting to slow down a little bit until we at least, you know,

10:59.120 --> 11:02.120
hit E3 when we're going to get whatever surprises out of E3.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.120
And then the holiday period is when things will ramp up again.

11:04.120 --> 11:09.120
So now seems like a really good time to catch up on gaming backlogs.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.120
So I post this to all of you in the chat room.

11:11.120 --> 11:16.120
And those of you here in studio as well, over the next, you know, six months, let's say,

11:16.120 --> 11:18.120
until the holidays get here in full force.

11:18.120 --> 11:25.120
What is the game that you feel like you've been putting off way too long that you need to play already?

11:25.120 --> 11:30.120
For example, if this was like three years ago, Mass Effect would have been a great answer for Jamie.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.120
But now that she's played it, we'll have to think of a new answer.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.120
So what is the game in your backlog that you really need?

11:36.120 --> 11:41.120
And I realize Loki might have like 400 games in his Steam library that is his backlog.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.120
But I want to know, like, what's the game?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.120
Four hundred and sixty-something games.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.120
What's the one game you really need to make a point to play?

11:49.120 --> 11:51.120
And it might not even be a game from this year.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.120
This could be a game from like four years ago, five years ago, just something where it's like,

11:55.120 --> 11:58.120
I need to shut up and play this game.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.120
Uh, Darcyra?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
I still need to finish Link Between Worlds.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.120
Oh, that's a good one on the 3DS.

12:04.120 --> 12:12.120
I'm just looking at my list on here. I have, like, Lift Razors on here and Never Alone, which I really wanted to play.

12:12.120 --> 12:16.120
Um, Nihalumbra. I'm actually looking at my list right now.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.120
Okay, but you can't just read your whole list. What's the one game?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.120
No, I'm picking the best of them.

12:20.120 --> 12:25.120
Um, I still need to finish The Shiva as well. It was a good game.

12:25.120 --> 12:31.120
And, um, yeah, I just got a bunch of shit on here that I might have started or never finished.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.120
Um, I thought it would be great.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.120
Um, I apparently have The Witcher 2. I don't even remember buying that.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.120
That happens all the time on Steam.

12:39.120 --> 12:45.120
Actually, The Witcher 3 would be a great answer for me, because I played, like, a little bit of it, but I never finished it.

12:45.120 --> 12:49.120
And I think that's one I really need to sit my ass down and finish.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.120
Um, because, you know, everybody loved that game.

12:51.120 --> 12:55.120
I was interested in it until I found out you couldn't play as a woman.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.120
I thought you did for a little bit.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.120
I want to play the whole game as a woman.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.120
I thought it was, um, I mean-

13:01.120 --> 13:03.120
I didn't think you could choose your gender.

13:03.120 --> 13:11.120
Uh, well, I think the character is not, like, it's not like Skyrim where the character, like, the character is based on, like, a book character.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
So there's only, like, one imagining of it.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.120
It's like, it's like a, it's like a third person as opposed to a first person.

13:16.120 --> 13:20.120
Yeah, but I still don't care. I didn't, that just sort of was a game breaker for me.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
So.

13:23.120 --> 13:28.120
Okay. But you'll, you'll play Zelda even when you can't play a woman, right? I mean, I don't-

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
Because it's a different kind of game.

13:29.120 --> 13:35.120
I know. Don't get me wrong. Like, I don't, because I totally understand that, yes, there needs to be more representation in games. I totally get that.

13:35.120 --> 13:43.120
But at the same time, like, if your story is a book type story and stuff, like, sometimes in the narrative, you know, I agree.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.120
But there should also be a game, like Witcher 3, where maybe that has a woman character.

13:47.120 --> 13:52.120
I think it was the concept of playing a male character with a romance option.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.120
Hmm.

13:54.120 --> 14:03.120
Because, I mean, I don't mind playing a female character with multiple romance options, but it just made it kind of uncomfortable for me because I can't put myself in the mindset.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.120
Hmm. Interesting.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.120
So I didn't do it.

14:06.120 --> 14:11.120
Well, and I suppose at the same time, you can kind of look at a story and go, that's not a, that's not a book I want to read.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.120
That happens.

14:13.120 --> 14:19.120
Maybe, maybe I will find the books and read those. See, it would be different reading the books, but playing a game that's supposed to be immersive.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.120
Yeah.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.120
That's different.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.120
Maybe that's a way, maybe that's a way to find out.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
Yeah.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.120
Yeah. Okay. Cool.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.120
Uh, Loki, what about you? What's, what's something in your backlog where you're like, oh, I gotta play this.

14:29.120 --> 14:34.120
Well, I already, you know, tell you when I'm playing over the summer, it's going to be No Man's Sky.

14:35.120 --> 14:39.120
So there isn't going to be touching any of the backlog. It's going to be No Man's Sky.

14:39.120 --> 14:44.120
Okay. But you got a good month before No Man's Sky. What is the, what is the game in your backlog you've got to catch up on?

14:44.120 --> 14:53.120
Well, I've already kind of started, uh, um, you know, mainly, I guess I'd be playing more Fallout 4 because the new expansion is coming out this week, I think.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.120
So I'll be playing that.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.120
Alan could tell you all about that one.

14:57.120 --> 15:08.120
Yeah. So I'm playing that. I mean, I haven't really been playing too much of it lately. I haven't played any of the new expansion or new update, I guess, or DLC or whatever you want to call it.

15:08.120 --> 15:17.120
And then they have the actual physical expansion that's going to be coming out, um, that I'm looking forward to playing, but I still haven't finished the game once yet.

15:17.120 --> 15:24.120
So, I mean, and I'm, I don't even know how many hundreds of hours in the game. So I'll play that.

15:24.120 --> 15:28.120
No, it's just stuff that's probably on my PlayStation 4. Not really Steam so much.

15:28.120 --> 15:35.120
I mean, I'm just purchasing games on there and just kind of throwing money away. I mean, even stuff that I have on console, like,

15:36.120 --> 15:39.120
At least when it's Humble Bundle and you know a lot of it's going to charity.

15:39.120 --> 15:45.120
No, this isn't even Humble Bundle. Like, last week, you know, during the show, I was like, man, my wife never lets me play on the TV. She's always watching her shows.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.120
When she got into another Shonda Rhimes series, I'm like, ah, crap.

15:49.120 --> 15:54.120
By the way, there's another one coming out on ABC this fall. There's yet another one. Like, didn't Shonda already have a whole entire night?

15:54.120 --> 15:59.120
Well, she has, like, this new series called How to Get Away with Murder or something like that.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.120
Oh, yeah.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.120
She's like, yep, I'm going to be watching this. So I'm like, ah.

16:05.120 --> 16:10.120
So I got entered into the Gungeon on PC now so I can actually play that.

16:10.120 --> 16:15.120
It doesn't run that well on my PC, but whatever, it's enough. I'll play that.

16:15.120 --> 16:19.120
Okay. All right. For me, there's a lot of stuff in my backlog.

16:19.120 --> 16:28.120
I almost want to say, like, The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls are two games from PlayStation 3 that are on PlayStation 4 that I really need to play.

16:28.120 --> 16:35.120
But I do think the game that most of all, like, I really need to sit down and play, which, not to say I don't need to play those two games because I still do,

16:35.120 --> 16:38.120
I really need to play Life is Strange. That's the one I really want to play.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.120
No, you really need to play Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 5.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
I do. I do.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
Grand Theft Auto 5.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.120
I need to play Grand Theft Auto 4.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.120
No, just skip the 5.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
Just skip 4 and go to 5.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.120
You don't really need to play 4.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.120
What if I play Saints Row 4, which is on the Xbox One?

16:54.120 --> 16:57.120
That's fine. Saints Row 4 is pretty good. You'd probably like that, actually. It's pretty funny.

16:57.120 --> 17:04.120
I downloaded that as the free games of gold or whatever, and I haven't really played that yet.

17:04.120 --> 17:09.120
I watched you play it, or maybe I saw Alan play some of it too, but I have not played it myself.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.120
And I hear the opening is hilarious like it was in 3.

17:11.120 --> 17:18.120
It's okay. The opening isn't as good as 3, I think. I don't know. It's all right.

17:19.120 --> 17:23.120
Stobby in chat is confirming skip to Grand Theft Auto 5.

17:23.120 --> 17:28.120
Kaijuto says, wow, 2016 and everyone is excited about playing old-ass games.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.120
Now, hold on, because this question was about backlogs.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.120
I am playing new games and stuff, but there's...

17:33.120 --> 17:39.120
Again, unless you do gaming all day every day, you can't play everything.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.120
You're going to miss something.

17:41.120 --> 17:46.120
And, you know, contrary to popular belief, we don't do OLR for a living, and we don't make money off this show.

17:46.120 --> 17:50.120
We don't make a dime off this show. In fact, we pay money to do it, which is fine.

17:50.120 --> 17:54.120
We love the community and everything and the people that turn out for it and everything.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.120
It's like a hobby.

17:56.120 --> 18:03.120
But some people think that because this is what it is, like we can play games during the week all day.

18:03.120 --> 18:08.120
No, we all got to work. We all got jobs, 40 hours or more.

18:08.120 --> 18:13.120
So, yeah. But we play when we can, when we can.

18:13.120 --> 18:19.120
Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.120
Some people talking about Shonda shows in chat now.

18:22.120 --> 18:29.120
S2100matt says, I really want to buy Firewatch, but I'm forcing myself to at least play, beat five other games for my Steam library.

18:29.120 --> 18:38.120
At least the thing about Firewatch, you can kind of beat that in like a night, or if you're a little slower like me, two or three nights tops.

18:39.120 --> 18:44.120
Firewatch is not a very long game. It's like, it's like sitting down to watch a really long movie.

18:44.120 --> 18:49.120
So that's the good thing about Firewatch is that at least that's when you could beat quick.

18:49.120 --> 18:54.120
It's, you know, it's another one of those games. It gets put in that, they call it walking simulator,

18:54.120 --> 18:59.120
but I don't, I kind of feel like that genre title is meant to kind of demean that genre.

18:59.120 --> 19:05.120
I don't really like it. It's more, I would say it's just more of a story heavy type of game.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.120
It's just a first person adventure game.

19:08.120 --> 19:15.120
Yeah, something like that. I don't know. It's just, it's, you know, it's more of a very narrative driven type of game,

19:15.120 --> 19:19.120
which, you know, Gone Home fits in that category, but that's definitely worth playing if you never have.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.120
Just, just, you know, at least one time play through the story. It's great.

19:23.120 --> 19:28.120
Although I worry it's, it's a little hyped up now all these years later, but I think it's worth your time.

19:28.120 --> 19:34.120
I really think my, my absolute favorite and I've made no surprise or made no secret to this was everybody's gone to the rapture.

19:34.120 --> 19:38.120
And I think that one just came out on PC. I want to say I read somewhere.

19:38.120 --> 19:44.120
So I played it on PlayStation four, but somebody in chat named Tiger Claw told me to tune in.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.120
Well, thank you. And thank Tiger Claw said, I need to start on Rise of the Tomb Raider.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.120
I bought it when it came out on Steam a few months ago, but never got around to it.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.120
That's a really, yeah, you are correct. It's 20 bucks on Steam.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.120
Thank you. Appreciate that. And Rise of the Tomb Raider is also on my list.

19:59.120 --> 20:03.120
And I feel really bad saying that, but that's true. I just, so many games.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.120
Stopy says, I need to finish Metro Last Light.

20:06.120 --> 20:11.120
Trying to look at a couple more here in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

20:11.120 --> 20:16.120
S.G.O. 100 Matt says, I just beat Roundabout this week, which was a silly and fun game.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.120
That game was one of those games that's like so stupid. It's kind of funny.

20:19.120 --> 20:23.120
I have, that's something I haven't played that I haven't and I've played some of it.

20:23.120 --> 20:30.120
I just haven't finished it. It's so stupid. But I say that in a John Waters movies are stupid and I love them type of way.

20:30.120 --> 20:35.120
Rob, you must play Danganronpa.

20:35.120 --> 20:41.120
Oh yeah. You and Shane both talk about that a lot. Shane especially. You know how he is.

20:41.120 --> 20:44.120
Well, you can blame me for that.

20:44.120 --> 20:48.120
I do blame you and I blame him. I got plenty of blame to go around.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.120
One of these days, but you've just heard like 800 hours.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.120
I thought you Undertale and you played what, five seconds of it?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.120
I played at least the beginning.

20:55.120 --> 21:00.120
Okay. Did you play Stardew Valley yet?

21:00.120 --> 21:01.120
No one's bought it for me yet.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.120
Well, there we go. All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks.

21:05.120 --> 21:11.120
Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week instead of the ones that we still need to.

21:11.120 --> 21:15.120
Going around the room talking about what games we've been playing this week and what we thought. Dark Saga.

21:15.120 --> 21:22.120
I played like five seconds of Final Fantasy 14, which I'm still on the fence about going back to World of Warcraft,

21:22.120 --> 21:27.120
especially since they gave out Warlords of Draenor for free.

21:27.120 --> 21:36.120
So I nabbed that while I could. Words, making things, saying words.

21:36.120 --> 21:46.120
I played Danganronpa too. I played some at work because I wanted to show Shane the magical girl Usami mode.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.120
And he's like, oh, that's so cute. But it sucks without a controller.

21:50.120 --> 22:00.120
And then I played some Animal Crossing, Happy Home Designer a little bit and Ingress, a ton of Ingress.

22:00.120 --> 22:06.120
And I'm so close. I'm so close that a little bit more to the left and I'll be there.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.120
That's the that's the that's when the real game begins.

22:09.120 --> 22:16.120
And then. Oh, yeah, a little Heroes of Dragon Age, still me, Tomo.

22:16.120 --> 22:20.120
So, yeah. All right. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

22:20.120 --> 22:27.120
I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I played a little bit of Ingress. I did play Earth Defense Force 4.1.

22:27.120 --> 22:33.120
So I played that a little bit last night, actually. I don't know. That was pretty much it.

22:33.120 --> 22:41.120
I mean, I haven't played a whole ton. I've thought about buying things. I've stopped myself from almost buying things.

22:41.120 --> 22:47.120
And then I bought a ColecoVision flashback, which, funny enough, I'm looking at the games on the back here like a lot of these.

22:47.120 --> 22:51.120
I don't even remember some of these. I do. So I'm looking forward to playing those again.

22:51.120 --> 23:01.120
But some of these I'm like wondering if these are like independent games that someone made that they ported to the ColecoVision like they did with the Atari flashbacks and stuff.

23:01.120 --> 23:06.120
Because, like, I don't remember Mecha eight or anything like that.

23:06.120 --> 23:14.120
But they have Bump and Jump and Jumpman Jr., so that's pretty awesome. I don't remember Ms. Space Fury.

23:14.120 --> 23:20.120
Well, I know those flashback consoles did have some, like, late homebrew type of stuff that came on them.

23:20.120 --> 23:27.120
Like, the Atari one definitely has, like, indie titles, basically, that were made after the fact that they include on there.

23:27.120 --> 23:32.120
I like that they have Pepper Tookes. Sad that they don't have Mr. Do. Mr. Do is awesome.

23:32.120 --> 23:38.120
I thought Mr. Do was by Data East, so the rights to it are probably somewhere else.

23:38.120 --> 23:46.120
Like, I'm surprised, like, if it's something that old, it's like, dude, just license it. I mean, seriously, what the fuck are you doing with that property right now?

23:46.120 --> 23:51.120
Okay, it's like the Atari 2600 would be so much better if the Activision stuff could be included.

23:51.120 --> 23:58.120
Because Activision, you know, say what you will about the company now, but back in the 80s, you know, especially in the Atari age,

23:58.120 --> 24:03.120
they were making games that many times were even better than what Atari was making themselves in-house.

24:03.120 --> 24:06.120
It was really kind of the birth of the third-party game makers.

24:06.120 --> 24:12.120
And so, you know, that's why Activision will usually do their own collections, basically.

24:12.120 --> 24:20.120
But, you know, Atari did that Atari Vault recently on PC, which is on Steam, and it has the iPad, you know, and all that.

24:20.120 --> 24:26.120
And there's a lot of great Atari games in there, but on the forums, it's just non-stop people bitching.

24:26.120 --> 24:34.120
Where's Pitfall? Where's Kaboom? Where's Keystone Capers or anything like that? Those are all Activision games.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.120
They don't have the rights to them.

24:35.120 --> 24:42.120
I just don't understand why you wouldn't want to license this stuff out. It's like, why hold that stuff, like, get money?

24:42.120 --> 24:46.120
Well, because Activision did a shitty iPad thing of their own, I think, at some point.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.120
But, you know, I don't know. It wasn't as good.

24:49.120 --> 24:56.120
Okay, I understand Activision, but, like, Data East. I mean, dude, Data East, what the hell are you doing with this stuff? Nothing.

24:56.120 --> 25:02.120
I want to say, on Xbox, they did something. Not like the ColecoVision, but some of their arcade titles.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.120
Like, I feel like Bad Dudes and all that sort of-

25:04.120 --> 25:06.120
Well, they had that on Wii. They had a collection on Wii.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.120
Was there? Okay.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.120
There was a Data East collection, but-

25:08.120 --> 25:09.120
That's right.

25:09.120 --> 25:15.120
I just don't understand why you wouldn't, like, you're sitting on those properties, like, shit, we're making nothing off of this.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.120
You want to license it? Cool. Okay, money.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.120
Yeah.

25:19.120 --> 25:24.120
Alright, my gaming week. I played a lot of the same old standby stuff.

25:24.120 --> 25:29.120
You know Final Fantasy XIV, can't get enough of that. Still playing Diablo III here and there as well.

25:29.120 --> 25:38.120
But I did play a new game this week. On the PC, I think a lot of you were excited on Friday that Doom came out on the PC, as well as consoles.

25:38.120 --> 25:44.120
I opted to get the PC version because I felt, alright, if I am going to play a first-person shooter, I think I'm going to do this with keyboard and mouse.

25:44.120 --> 25:49.120
Even though, I don't know, like, some days I feel like I'm better with controllers, some days I feel like I'm better with keyboard and mouse.

25:49.120 --> 25:55.120
But I was like, okay, well the old-school Dooms I remember on PC, so somehow in my mind, it worked.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.120
It justified and I said, alright, I'm going to get it on PC.

25:58.120 --> 26:02.120
And if I wanted to do the controller thing, I can always play it on Steam Box.

26:02.120 --> 26:06.120
And I think that's what really sold it for me, was that I would really be able to do both.

26:06.120 --> 26:11.120
So I bought Doom, and although I haven't played a ton of it, so I can't tell you about, like, the entire game,

26:11.120 --> 26:15.120
I think I've played enough of it to get a pretty good sense of the game.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.120
I like the graphics, first off, are really good.

26:18.120 --> 26:26.120
Especially, you know, my computer, I had like a top-of-the-line computer two years ago, but it still runs Doom very, very well.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.120
So I'm very happy for that. It looks great.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.120
In fact, I don't even think I have the graphics turned all the way up.

26:32.120 --> 26:36.120
I think it's just on whatever the defaults are, and some folks in chat are saying, you should turn it up to Ultra.

26:36.120 --> 26:42.120
I'm like, alright, it's not on the GeForce Experience thing yet that tells you what's best for your cards.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.120
I'm kind of waiting for that. But I'll tinker with the settings later.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.120
It looks good enough for me right now.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.120
I will say, I noticed the game is very fast-paced. That is one thing I noticed.

26:50.120 --> 26:59.120
It's very fast, which is what I liked about the old PC games like Quake and Doom and stuff, was that they were always very fast.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.120
And these games are definitely no different.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.120
And I don't even play on a very difficult skill level.

27:04.120 --> 27:15.120
I play on a pretty easy one because I'm not good at first-person shooters, even though I enjoy the occasional one, especially the old-school ones, which is what kind of possessed me to get Doom in the first place.

27:15.120 --> 27:20.120
So they did change some things. You can upgrade the weapons now.

27:20.120 --> 27:23.120
When you find things in the level, you might get weapon upgrades.

27:23.120 --> 27:27.120
So for example, your shotgun, you could charge it with the right mouse button.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.120
You can pick what type of charge you want it to do.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.120
Like the one I did, you charge it and it goes tick, tick, tick.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.120
And then when you do your next blast, it does three rounds all at once, which is kind of awesome.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.120
Do all the old codes work?

27:39.120 --> 27:41.120
I doubt it. I haven't tried.

27:41.120 --> 27:46.120
Well, the ones to try, remember? IDDQD.

27:46.120 --> 27:49.120
Yeah, and then there was what? What's the one that lets you walk through walls?

27:49.120 --> 27:51.120
IDQFA.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.120
IDQFA. IDBFG.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.120
IDBFG is to get the BFG.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.120
I hope that's in the game. It's gotta be. It's gotta be.

27:58.120 --> 28:02.120
I mean, you still have blue key cards like you had in the old games. A lot of the weapons.

28:02.120 --> 28:08.120
The suit that you wear, you see in the very beginning of the game is just like the old ones.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.120
And you find these little, they look like little Funko toys.

28:11.120 --> 28:15.120
Little collectibles you find in the levels that are old Doom characters, basically.

28:15.120 --> 28:19.120
So that's cool. I just can't believe I still remember all those codes.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.120
The ones I don't remember are the level skip codes.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.120
Because I used to just skip right to the Castle Wolf and Steam levels.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.120
Bobby Black Wolf is reminding us of some of the good old codes.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.120
Black Wolf says IDCLP.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.120
The wall one.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.120
Yeah, and IDSPISPOPD is the wall one.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.120
So, nice.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.120
So yeah, I'm enjoying Doom. I haven't really played the multiplayer yet.

28:40.120 --> 28:44.120
I played the beta a while ago, but I've just been trying to get through the single player campaign.

28:44.120 --> 28:50.120
And I think if you like a really fast paced first person shooter, I think you're gonna enjoy Doom.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.120
If you like the old games as well.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.120
If you like something that was fast paced like Quake was back in the day and all that.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.120
I think this is really right up the same alley.

28:58.120 --> 29:06.120
And Alan Alchemy says there are also hidden doors that you can open that let you play in original Doom hallways but with new enemies.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.120
Yeah, I haven't found any of those yet.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.120
But I haven't exactly really been looking for them either.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.120
So, yeah.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.120
So I think Doom, if that sounds like it's up your alley, might be worth it.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.120
60 bucks is a lot of money though.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.120
I think a lot of you guys are probably gonna wait for a Steam sale.

29:19.120 --> 29:25.120
Although, you know, the people who made the game do deserve to make a little money because they worked very hard on it.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.120
So you'll have to decide how soon you need it, I suppose.

29:27.120 --> 29:30.120
But that was otherwise it for my gaming week.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.120
Just a little bit of Doom over the weekend after it came out.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.120
In addition to all the standby other stuff I've been playing all the time.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.120
Hopefully catching up on my backlog soon.

29:39.120 --> 29:44.120
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.120
And then we'll get into the news this week.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.120
I don't have a lot to say for housekeeping.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.120
We're still gonna be here for the upcoming shows and so forth.

29:52.120 --> 29:58.120
I believe next weekend, I still have to cross all the T's and dot all the I's so stay tuned to Twitter.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.120
And you guys don't even know this, surprise!

30:00.120 --> 30:05.120
Next weekend is when we're gonna be joined by another podcast here in Sacramento.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.120
Oh yeah.

30:06.120 --> 30:12.120
At the SAC Indie Arcade, the Video Game Bang guys are gonna be here in the studio next week.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.120
We're gonna do a crossover episode so that'll be fun.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.120
I don't know if we play the same types of games.

30:18.120 --> 30:22.120
They're probably playing a lot more Doom than I have and we'll see.

30:22.120 --> 30:26.120
I think they're more like Call of Duty guys and I don't really play that a lot.

30:26.120 --> 30:30.120
And I don't know if they know necessarily music games but we'll see.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
So we're gonna have fun.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.120
That should be next week but don't hold me to that.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.120
You know what would be great?

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
What?

30:36.120 --> 30:38.120
Is if there was an anti-Doom game called Mood.

30:39.120 --> 30:44.120
And it was just walking through flowers and little birds chirping.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.120
But you still have to explore.

30:46.120 --> 30:51.120
You want like a whimsy Shire level in Doom or something where it's rainbows and kittens and unicorns.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.120
Not really but I just think it would be funny.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.120
So is that like Chick's Quest?

30:55.120 --> 30:57.120
Wasn't that something in like Hexen?

30:57.120 --> 31:00.120
Wasn't there like a secret level in one of those games that was like silly?

31:00.120 --> 31:02.120
I don't know, I don't know why.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.120
Maybe it was probably a mod.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.120
It's probably the whole game of Rise of the Triad.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.120
And confusing mods for reality.

31:09.120 --> 31:16.120
No, the best mod they ever did for one of those old school games was in Wolfenstein 3D.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.120
When you could download the Mortal Kombat one.

31:19.120 --> 31:23.120
And it would turn like the little mecha Hitler into like Sub-Zero.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.120
And like all the end bosses and all this would become like Mortal Kombat characters.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.120
That was the best.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
So anyway.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.120
Alright, let's get into some news and talk about some things that are happening here and now.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.120
And not mods from the 90s.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.120
Loki, starting us off.

31:38.120 --> 31:42.120
So there's been some updates to backwards compatibility on Xbox One.

31:42.120 --> 31:47.120
Now they have figured out a way to enable support for multi-disc games.

31:47.120 --> 31:50.120
So that's pretty awesome.

31:50.120 --> 31:53.120
And that will open the doors for a lot of different games.

31:53.120 --> 32:00.120
Such as Mass Effect or L.A. Noire, Red Dead Redemption, Lost Odyssey hopefully.

32:01.120 --> 32:08.120
They also announced that this week they're going to be having DSX Human Revolution Director's Cut.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.120
As one of the free games.

32:10.120 --> 32:16.120
And actually that will be the first game supported by the new updates to that.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.120
And then yeah.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.120
That should be it right now.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.120
So that's pretty cool.

32:22.120 --> 32:26.120
I mean because there was a lot of multi-disc games on the 360 being that it was on DVDs.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.120
And they couldn't really cram the content in there.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.120
So I'm looking forward to it.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.120
I feel like we should have a counter in studio.

32:34.120 --> 32:40.120
Like one of those tote boards that says number of days we've had backwards compatibility without Lost Odyssey.

32:40.120 --> 32:44.120
And every week we're going to check in on the board until they finally give us Lost Odyssey.

32:44.120 --> 32:49.120
But this is a really good, especially because I swear we were just talking about this on last week's show.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.120
Or two weeks ago, but really recently.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.120
But this is a really good sign that it's coming.

32:55.120 --> 32:59.120
And not just Lost Odyssey, but Mass Effect 3 was on multiple discs right?

32:59.120 --> 33:05.120
So I mean there's a lot of good games that are on multiple discs that I'm looking forward to.

33:05.120 --> 33:10.120
Red Dead wouldn't be such a problem because single player was on one disc and multiplayer was on the second disc.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.120
So it wasn't such a big deal.

33:12.120 --> 33:16.120
But yeah I mean I can understand where you'd want that for other games.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.120
Well the multiplayer servers are still up.

33:18.120 --> 33:23.120
So hypothetically if the backwards compatibility you ought to be able to play multiplayer still.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.120
So.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.120
Do you think maybe they're going to sit on a bunch of these big ones until E3?

33:30.120 --> 33:32.120
Because I kind of think that's what's going to happen.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
Probably.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.120
I think especially like Red Dead Redemption.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.120
Yeah I can see that.

33:36.120 --> 33:40.120
And then because you're telling us the sequel is coming at E3 right?

33:40.120 --> 33:43.120
Well Rockstar is supposed to be there.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.120
It's been hinted at quite a bit.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.120
Rockstar hasn't had a booth in a long time.

33:47.120 --> 33:50.120
Well they're not going to have a booth. They're going to be at E3 though.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
Oh then they've got something to show.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.120
Yeah something to show.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.120
During one of the press conferences.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.120
So it's either going to be like an expansion to Grand Theft Auto.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.120
Maybe both.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.120
I think it's probably going to be another Red Dead game.

34:01.120 --> 34:05.120
Pre-order now and get the first game free on backwards compatibility.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.120
Bang.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
That's what they'll do.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.120
That's the big thing to do now.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.120
Well that's what they can do on Xbox One.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.120
Not so much PlayStation 4.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.120
I really wish that would change.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.120
Who knows what Sony could have up their sleeve.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.120
You're going to get it on PlayStation now.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.120
For free.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.120
You could.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.120
Hypothetically.

34:25.120 --> 34:30.120
ST100Matt says yeah they will say Red Dead Redemption will be available right now kind of deal.

34:30.120 --> 34:36.120
I'm pretty sure with this backwards compatibility they're sitting on something big that they'll unveil at E3.

34:36.120 --> 34:41.120
If it's not this then it's going to be Skyrim or something that people have really really been asking for a lot.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.120
Backwards compatibility for Final Fantasy XI.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
Oh damn.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.120
Oh wait.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.120
Wait a minute.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.120
Maybe not.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.120
Alright.

34:50.120 --> 34:55.120
Kaijuto in chat says if they waste E3 talking about backwards games they're going to lose big time.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.120
Dude, it would take like 15 seconds.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.120
It's like an update on backwards compatibility.

35:00.120 --> 35:03.120
It now will do 50% of the games.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.120
It doesn't even have to be about that.

35:05.120 --> 35:10.120
It could just be like hey we just rock stars there to present a trailer for Red Dead.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.120
Exactly.

35:11.120 --> 35:16.120
And then hey by the way as an added bonus we're going to have this all available now.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.120
Exactly.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.120
Or Mass Effect Andromeda you can now get 2 and 3 are available.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.120
It would take literally 15 seconds.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.120
I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.120
Alright.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.120
Moving on.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.120
Talking about the future of another series.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.120
I was very excited this week.

35:31.120 --> 35:35.120
You know I was very very excited when this series gets talked about.

35:35.120 --> 35:40.120
And I want to say I speculated not that long ago that this was a likely thing for E3 this year.

35:40.120 --> 35:44.120
And sure enough Civilization VI was announced this week.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.120
Yay!

35:45.120 --> 35:48.120
Civilization VI is coming out on October 21st.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.120
They even dated it already.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.120
It's ready to go.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.120
60 bucks is what it's going to cost you.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.120
Civilization not games that really show up on consoles.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.120
I mean yes there was Civilization Revolution.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.120
Speaking of backwards compatibility I'd like to have that one.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.120
But Civilization is more of a PC game.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.120
You've just got to have a keyboard and mouse to play.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.120
There's too much to do with it.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.120
So Civ VI is going to be a game and you can pre-order it now on PC.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.120
And it's going to be out on October 21st.

36:13.120 --> 36:17.120
I was reading a little more about what they're actually changing with it.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.120
And I think they're sitting on most of it until E3.

36:19.120 --> 36:24.120
I'm pretty sure they'll have a theater or something at E3 where you can watch some of the gameplay.

36:24.120 --> 36:28.120
I remember that's what they did with Beyond Earth when I went to E3 at one point.

36:28.120 --> 36:35.120
But with Civ VI they're keeping the hexagon format.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.120
So they're keeping that from 5.

36:37.120 --> 36:41.120
They are I guess changing a bit with city management.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.120
So now instead of just staying in your city like,

36:43.120 --> 36:47.120
Oh I want to build a coliseum in my city.

36:47.120 --> 36:52.120
Now it's what grid or what square on the grid do you want to put the coliseum on.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.120
Because it's going to change possibly the characteristics of that square.

36:56.120 --> 37:02.120
Which in older Civilization games you use settlers to do different things to squares.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.120
Like build a railroad or irrigate them to make more food.

37:06.120 --> 37:12.120
You could do a variety of things but it sounds like that's really going to expand with the city management.

37:12.120 --> 37:16.120
So very very curious to see where that goes.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.120
So I'm looking forward to E3.

37:18.120 --> 37:23.120
I'm not a big fan of what I'm hearing about this city stuff.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.120
But I need to see it in motion before I can really be critical.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.120
Let's face it, it's a Civ game. Of course I'm going to buy it.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.120
Of course.

37:30.120 --> 37:33.120
And then I'll stay up until 6 in the morning playing a game.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.120
Because that's what happens with Civilization is that,

37:35.120 --> 37:37.120
Oh woah where did the time go?

37:37.120 --> 37:40.120
It's actually 4 o'clock in the morning all of a sudden.

37:40.120 --> 37:44.120
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

37:44.120 --> 37:47.120
Bobby Black Wolf says, Civilization Revolution was great.

37:47.120 --> 37:51.120
I agree. A lot of hardcore Civ fans shit on that game.

37:51.120 --> 37:56.120
But again I think it's because it's a game that's geared a little more towards dirty casuals and that's okay.

37:56.120 --> 38:03.120
I think Civ Rev was the most like the original Civilization but on consoles.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.120
I mean it wasn't exactly like the original Civ but it was close enough.

38:05.120 --> 38:10.120
And I think they did a really good job making it available for consoles.

38:10.120 --> 38:16.120
I didn't bother with the iPhone Android version they did of it. I didn't bother with that one.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.120
And Rage Nator says, Wasn't the original Civilization on the Super Nintendo?

38:19.120 --> 38:24.120
I believe it was but Civ was less complicated back then.

38:24.120 --> 38:28.120
I even want to say on the Super Nintendo it was a little bit, they had to cut some corners.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.120
It wasn't quite the same.

38:30.120 --> 38:33.120
Let's move on DarkSakura.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.120
Well it's finally happening. I kind of saw this happening.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.120
And then I was actually kind of surprised and then sort of not.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.120
It's kind of a weird mixed feeling about this.

38:43.120 --> 38:48.120
But Disney is finally ending Disney Infinity.

38:48.120 --> 38:51.120
They're shutting down Avalanche Software.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.120
There will be no more Disney Infinity.

38:53.120 --> 38:56.120
I think they're going to do like two more sets and then that's it.

38:56.120 --> 39:02.120
So yeah, according to Bob Iger, the Disney CEO.

39:02.120 --> 39:14.120
They said that they thought that they had a really good opportunity to do something along the lines of what Skylanders and all that were doing.

39:14.120 --> 39:20.120
And they thought it was doing pretty well but the business is changing and they don't want to keep up with it.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.120
That's the official word.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.120
It is what it is.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.120
You now have plenty of cute little toys.

39:29.120 --> 39:32.120
I've never played the game ever.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.120
But I have a Rocket Raccoon and I have a Quora.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.120
Thank you Loki.

39:37.120 --> 39:41.120
So take it as you will.

39:42.120 --> 39:49.120
I think that they might look into more like outsourcing or something.

39:49.120 --> 39:56.120
But I think that the series is kind of a difficult market to play.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.120
Because how much do you produce?

39:59.120 --> 40:01.120
What type of market are you going to go to?

40:01.120 --> 40:04.120
Are people going to keep playing it and stay interested in it?

40:04.120 --> 40:13.120
What new can you do to keep it something that's going to draw people in or convince them that when you have a new iteration of it that it's worth it to buy?

40:13.120 --> 40:17.120
Well and I think Disney at some point is just more...

40:17.120 --> 40:20.120
I wouldn't say so much outsourcing but just licensing.

40:20.120 --> 40:27.120
They would just much rather, hey somebody wants to pay us a shit ton of money to make a Star Wars Battlefront game and it's actually really good.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.120
Or well, whether it's good or not it doesn't matter. It sells a lot.

40:31.120 --> 40:38.120
Sure, why not. Or hey, Square wants to throw us a lot of money to use Disney characters in Kingdom Hearts 3. Sure.

40:38.120 --> 40:42.120
I also think it's absolutely hilarious and I'm going to call them on this.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.120
It has nothing to do with the article.

40:44.120 --> 40:47.120
Polygon, you got a typo on your webpage.

40:47.120 --> 40:50.120
Skylanders does not have a J in it.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.120
Just saying. Just saying.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.120
Jai-landers.

40:55.120 --> 41:00.120
It's Skylanders. It's like S-J-Y-L-A-N-S-D-E-R-S.

41:00.120 --> 41:07.120
I had to screenshot it and I'm going to email it to them because I'm just that person.

41:07.120 --> 41:19.120
Oh boy. So I think it's surprising a little bit that this went away because I thought Disney Infinity was doing relatively well.

41:19.120 --> 41:28.120
But then when you read the thing about, oh well they have to put one million Hulk things back in a storage bin somewhere because they didn't sell enough of them.

41:28.120 --> 41:34.120
You kind of go, well it sounds like their expectations kind of did them in. They couldn't find that happy balance.

41:34.120 --> 41:39.120
There wasn't enough toys in the first go around and there's way too god damn many of them in the second go around.

41:39.120 --> 41:47.120
Like they couldn't find that happy medium and it just kind of, I don't know, it just kind of sucks that the whole series gets done in by a series of bad decisions like that.

41:47.120 --> 41:59.120
So hopefully whoever wants to get into the physical toys and games business next considers that. Although I doubt there will be many more players in that realm.

41:59.120 --> 42:06.120
Isn't there another, like even though, and this is the thing that gets me, and I haven't heard a lot about this.

42:06.120 --> 42:14.120
When I go to Target and I see Disney Infinity on the shelf, I notice it's by Skylander, it's by Amiibo, but it's by this other one.

42:14.120 --> 42:22.120
And I don't remember the name of it but somebody in chat probably does. It's like a direct to your TV thing and it's all Marvel characters.

42:22.120 --> 42:27.120
So Disney is actually competing against itself in this space.

42:27.120 --> 42:34.120
And that's kind of where I go, well what did you think was going to happen?

42:34.120 --> 42:42.120
So I kind of, I really blame some higher ups at Disney for these types of planings.

42:42.120 --> 42:49.120
Because when I saw the one that was the plug direct into the TV, and it's taking up a lot of shelf space at Target too.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.120
I don't know if there's some type of arrangement.

42:50.120 --> 42:59.120
That one is a little bit different if it's the same one I'm thinking of because they have some that have characters, but then you also have actual costume stuff that you wear.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.120
It's Playmation, thank you Tigerclaw.

43:01.120 --> 43:10.120
Yeah, exactly. So you have like shields, like you can have Iron Man's gauntlet or something and you're actually shooting the characters and stuff.

43:10.120 --> 43:14.120
Okay, again, how is that not Disney competing against itself?

43:14.120 --> 43:20.120
It's more of a toy than it is Disney Affinity. It's a little bit different. It's less complicated as a game.

43:20.120 --> 43:26.120
It's more of like those, they've had them before where toys interact with infrared things and stuff like that.

43:26.120 --> 43:30.120
Yeah, I guess. Now did the plug get pulled on that series?

43:30.120 --> 43:31.120
No.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.120
Isn't that interesting?

43:33.120 --> 43:35.120
Just saying.

43:35.120 --> 43:46.120
I don't know, like when I was at the different stores today, I mean they still have a very big section of Disney Affinity, so their figures are marked down to $9 at Toys R Us. I almost got some.

43:46.120 --> 43:49.120
Were they? Because I need to get the core out of Complete My Tron collection.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.120
All the figures are $9.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.120
I might need to look for that. I'll send Shane help for me.

43:54.120 --> 43:59.120
I almost got some today, but I was like, yeah, I'm gonna get yelled at by the way if I bring any more of those home.

43:59.120 --> 44:00.120
You can keep them here.

44:01.120 --> 44:05.120
Yeah, I don't really want any more anyways. They don't really add anything.

44:05.120 --> 44:08.120
I just want the core out of Complete My Tron collection, then I'm good.

44:08.120 --> 44:09.120
You want the core?

44:09.120 --> 44:10.120
Yeah.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.120
Wait, don't give me yours.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.120
Too bad?

44:12.120 --> 44:13.120
Don't give me yours. Just, you know.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.120
Did you hear what I said?

44:15.120 --> 44:16.120
What'd you say?

44:16.120 --> 44:17.120
Too bad.

44:17.120 --> 44:23.120
Too bad. Yeah, funny. No, I looked on Amazon the other day and they were still up there and I'm sure I can find one.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.120
They're like everywhere.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.120
Need to do it sooner rather than later, that's all. Not put it off.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
You know what?

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
Huh?

44:30.120 --> 44:32.120
I just forgot what I was going to say, so never mind.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.120
You're right tonight.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.120
No.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.120
You're having a hard time functioning.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.120
No.

44:38.120 --> 44:39.120
You need more coffee.

44:39.120 --> 44:43.120
Well, no, I don't need more coffee. It's just I got things I'm worried about.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.120
Well, I hope everything's all right.

44:45.120 --> 44:57.120
Sure, they can have a whole giant section of those toys and a whole giant section of those race car things that we were talking about last week that were there with all the iPads and everything.

44:57.120 --> 45:05.120
But God forbid we could carry one fucking controller. Like one single controller for that stuff.

45:05.120 --> 45:09.120
Oh, we'll carry a billion of these things that no one's buying, but one controller that is asking too much.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.120
Do you want a Hulk figure? Because we got plenty of those.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
Dear Loki.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.120
Internet. Can you use it?

45:19.120 --> 45:22.120
He already went into why he's not going to buy it online.

45:22.120 --> 45:26.120
Too bad. Buy it online if you want it. If you don't want it bad enough, you're not going to go for it.

45:26.120 --> 45:35.120
Well, then they don't want to treat it as an actual platform then because, you know, all the other gaming platforms that I see out there in the marketplace have their fucking accessories in retail stores.

45:35.120 --> 45:39.120
If you don't have your accessories in retail stores, then I'm sorry you're not a gaming fucking platform.

45:39.120 --> 45:42.120
Dungeon Buster in chat says, Captain Loki, controller war.

45:47.120 --> 45:52.120
I think we just need to pool the money together, buy one online and just have it sitting on the couch next week for him.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.120
Oh, and don't get me started about how-

45:56.120 --> 45:58.120
With the card attached, it says shut up.

45:58.120 --> 45:59.120
Exactly.

46:00.120 --> 46:08.120
And don't get me started on how expensive those controllers are too. It's like, you do realize I'm trying to give you $60 to play an $8 game.

46:08.120 --> 46:10.120
Oh my god, nevermind. They're $60? Keep talking.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.120
That's cool. That's $30 each.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.120
There's so many few people making those things.

46:15.120 --> 46:18.120
$30 could buy like dinner at Benihana.

46:18.120 --> 46:19.120
You want to go to Benihana and stuff?

46:19.120 --> 46:20.120
Fuck yeah.

46:20.120 --> 46:24.120
Alright, let's do it. Let's go to the grill place, the church screen.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.120
Alright, alright.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.120
Alright, we're gonna go get-

46:27.120 --> 46:29.120
We're gonna spend your controller money on beef.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.120
Yeah, we're gonna go-

46:30.120 --> 46:31.120
I support that.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.120
Alright.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.120
It's a plan.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.120
Let's see.

46:37.120 --> 46:42.120
Ragenator in chat says, Loki went Amish and refuses to internet for controllers at a spike.

46:42.120 --> 46:48.120
Or here's an idea if you don't want to sell me a controller, how about you just fucking make the Dual Shocks work with the stupid-

46:48.120 --> 46:50.120
Wait, Loki, this is right up your alley.

46:50.120 --> 46:55.120
Doesn't Steam have that thing where you can like download how to make your own damn controller?

46:55.120 --> 46:58.120
Like I thought that was a thing or is that only a Steam controller that won't work?

46:58.120 --> 47:03.120
I think you're thinking of the Ouya and you can print your own shells for the Ouya, but no one's gonna buy an Ouya.

47:03.120 --> 47:09.120
I swear to god we had a story on the show a couple weeks ago where you could like download the schematics to make your own Steam controller or something.

47:09.120 --> 47:12.120
Can you? You still have your Ouya, right?

47:12.120 --> 47:13.120
Fuck no, I don't.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.120
Okay, well then nevermind.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.120
I was wondering like if they could network.

47:17.120 --> 47:24.120
Loki, my point is, if you can't find one, you're gonna have to build one. If you build it, they will come.

47:24.120 --> 47:29.120
I'm not gonna build a control- I probably could build it cheaper anyways, but I'm just saying to you, I'm not gonna-

47:29.120 --> 47:32.120
If you build it, they will come.

47:33.120 --> 47:40.120
Just sell a fucking controller. There's so many controllers out there that are available. You can carry one fucking controller.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.120
Stoppy in chat says you can even 3D print it.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.120
I'll tell you what-

47:44.120 --> 47:46.120
If you print it, they will come.

47:46.120 --> 47:54.120
Hey, how about you buy one less iPhone case? You'll carry 199 iPhone cases and one controller.

47:57.120 --> 48:05.120
And then here's the other thing. It's a Bluetooth controller for fucking- they have Bluetooth controllers for iPhone, but they're not compatible with Android.

48:05.120 --> 48:10.120
It's Bluetooth! It's supposed to be compatible with everything. That doesn't make any sense to me.

48:10.120 --> 48:15.120
Loki, Loki, before you get the engines revved up again, I think I'm gonna need you to do the next story.

48:18.120 --> 48:19.120
Fine.

48:20.120 --> 48:35.120
So, Warren Spector, who kind of worked on the whole Epic Mickey series, says that there's some sort of unreleased Disney property that was gonna become a game that he would like to get his hands on.

48:35.120 --> 48:42.120
Basically saying, hey, now that you're out of games, can I have the IP I created at Junction Point back? You're never gonna do anything with them.

48:43.120 --> 48:53.120
And since Disney acquired Junction Point, they own my near future action modern day ninja and epic fantasy concepts. It'd be nice to get them back.

48:54.120 --> 48:58.120
So he's basically like, can I get my dress back? Because you're not gonna wear it.

49:01.120 --> 49:03.120
You're too fat for the dress anyway.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.120
I loaned you those shoes last year.

49:06.120 --> 49:13.120
So the games that he was working on, one of which was called Necessary Evil, and it's like a game that's supposed to be similar to Deus Ex.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.120
And then, I'm not really sure what the other one was.

49:18.120 --> 49:26.120
I'm kind of surprised what these are have been put out there, because now if he does get ahold of these IPs by some miracle, it's already out there what it is. It's kind of surprising.

49:27.120 --> 49:38.120
I don't know. I mean, I'm fine with them licensing their properties. It'd be kind of cool, though, if they could license Marvel to Lego Dimensions.

49:39.120 --> 49:46.120
I'm sure they're gonna license the shit out of their characters. They're not gonna stop doing that. Kingdom Hearts 3 isn't gonna suddenly not happen.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.120
So, I mean, they're gonna continue to license out the Disney stuff.

49:50.120 --> 49:52.120
Kingdom Hearts 3 with the Avengers would be fucking amazing.

49:52.120 --> 50:01.120
My assumption is they're still doing fine in the mobile marketplace. I didn't hear anything about what's happening in the mobile development area, which is still pretty big for Disney.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.120
So I think this is just the console space.

50:05.120 --> 50:13.120
Yeah, it's just they decided to not make a game, because they really only have a game coming out each year, and they're just gonna make money by licensing their properties.

50:14.120 --> 50:20.120
Kind of like how LucasArts was gonna be licensing their properties instead of actually making games themselves.

50:21.120 --> 50:31.120
Alright, well, even though there may be no more physical Disney toys, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Nintendo fills the space with physical versions of these toys.

50:32.120 --> 50:39.120
Pokemon! Did you guys hear there's some big Pokemon news this week? And it actually has nothing to do with toys. I'm just forecasting the future.

50:40.120 --> 50:48.120
But what we know for a fact is going to happen is that Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon will be launching for the Nintendo 3DS on November 18th.

50:48.120 --> 50:52.120
Dude, that's awesome! But where are the Wii U games?

50:53.120 --> 51:01.120
I was like, no, no. Loki doesn't just say that's awesome with something like that. There's a hidden joke or a punchline.

51:02.120 --> 51:05.120
They only have the new Paper Mario game, which looks pretty cool.

51:06.120 --> 51:09.120
Haven't you heard? Zelda! And that's all we're gonna show at E3 this year.

51:10.120 --> 51:14.120
Zelda's coming out this year? Oh, wait, it's not fucking coming out this year. That's right.

51:14.120 --> 51:21.120
No, it's not. Yeah, it's not. Maybe NES Remix 3 just to hold you up. Maybe there'll be NES Remix 3 to hold you up.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.120
Maybe not that.

51:24.120 --> 51:25.120
We should get the first one.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.120
We'll get some new skins in Mario Maker.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.120
Don't we always get that?

51:31.120 --> 51:38.120
Hey, the baby metal thing? That was pretty rad. Like, an unexpected. So, you know what? Baby metal is endorsed by Rob Zombie.

51:39.120 --> 51:41.120
You know who's playing Mario Maker now? My son's playing Mario Maker now.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.120
Good for him!

51:44.120 --> 51:46.120
He just builds levels and then, like, that's it.

51:47.120 --> 51:49.120
He just draws bricks everywhere. I did it. Funny.

51:50.120 --> 52:00.120
By the way, also huge, huge, big news that started all types of Twitter wars that I may or may not have been involved in directly over the new starter Pokemon.

52:01.120 --> 52:07.120
You have this, oh my god, this adorable fat little owl with a little leaf bow tie named Rowlet.

52:07.120 --> 52:17.120
It, oh my god, does it look like, yes, you should sing show tunes like the old WB frog does in a top hat and a cane.

52:18.120 --> 52:23.120
Well, this is like the old, um, uh, Mooney Tunes owl. The family.

52:24.120 --> 52:29.120
Okay, so I like Rowlet. Rowlet is really cute. And Litten, adorable.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.120
The best!

52:31.120 --> 52:37.120
Yes, little fire kitty. Looks very sassy, looks very mean, but also adorable at the same time.

52:38.120 --> 52:43.120
Uh, that's Litten. And I think I'm gonna be Team Litten, because it seems like the rest of the internet is Team Rowlet.

52:44.120 --> 52:47.120
Um, and, uh, you know, fire type beats grass type, so that makes sense.

52:48.120 --> 52:51.120
So those are, those are the two starter types you have to look forward to in Pokemon.

52:52.120 --> 52:55.120
Oh, yeah, there's another one. It's, um, Pooplio.

52:56.120 --> 52:57.120
Like, Shane is after the seal.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.120
I think it's Pooplio that looks like a derpy clown dog seal.

53:01.120 --> 53:03.120
It's probably gonna be like a crazy ass sea lion.

53:04.120 --> 53:10.120
Oh, Pooplio! Yes, Pooplio. Sorry, I just, my eyes. Can't read.

53:11.120 --> 53:13.120
It's just the derpy visuals.

53:14.120 --> 53:15.120
I'm sure it dooshed.

53:17.120 --> 53:23.120
So, uh, there you go. No, in all seriousness, Rowlet, I'm just, I'm just waiting for act after somebody starts screaming at me in chat.

53:24.120 --> 53:27.120
Uh, Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio are the three starter Pokemon.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.120
So what do those evolve into?

53:29.120 --> 53:35.120
They haven't shown those yet. We only know what the starter types look like, so we can only kind of guess.

53:36.120 --> 53:43.120
I would imagine Rowlet is gonna be a very, you know, kind of bird, like a full bird type of thing, like a hawk type of thing, probably.

53:44.120 --> 53:46.120
How does an owl evolve into a hawk?

53:47.120 --> 53:54.120
It never made sense. Uh, and Litten will probably be like a big lion, like a fire lion, and then Lord knows what the Popplio's gonna turn into.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.120
That's an even dumber looking seal.

53:56.120 --> 53:59.120
Stop. Maybe, maybe a whale or something, I don't know.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.120
A beached whale.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.120
Like a magic carp. It'll just lie there. It has splash.

54:08.120 --> 54:13.120
Uh, this is how I know Shane's not listening right now because my phone isn't blowing up with hate.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.120
You know, is Ash still in these games?

54:18.120 --> 54:20.120
Uh, no. He was, Ash was technically never in the games.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.120
No, it was red and blue the first time.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.120
Yeah, fine, you know.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
The character is you. You can name whatever it is.

54:27.120 --> 54:31.120
Okay, well whatever. So I'm gonna use Sea World on Popplio, and it was very effective.

54:36.120 --> 54:45.120
Alright, let's move on, cause just, I already know I'm gonna get a three hour hate monologue from Shane later when he hears this. Hopefully he won't.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
So let's move on. Dark Sakura, what do you have?

54:47.120 --> 54:53.120
Well, I seem to have this theme of stuff just closing or quitting or not doing things anymore.

54:54.120 --> 54:58.120
So Microsoft has thrown in the towel for Project Spark.

54:59.120 --> 55:04.120
Project Spark was supposed to be a game making tool for Xbox One and for Windows PC.

55:05.120 --> 55:11.120
It is no longer available to download as of two days ago, May 13th.

55:12.120 --> 55:19.120
Online services, including the ability to download and upload, will be unavailable after August 12th.

55:20.120 --> 55:25.120
So finish your shit by then, get it up, cause you will be done after that.

55:28.120 --> 55:37.120
It was supposed to be there to let different game designers create things that they want to and then play homemade games on a community level.

55:37.120 --> 55:49.120
And there were people who used it for all kinds of things, including a Conker series. A little episodic adventure type thing.

55:50.120 --> 55:54.120
Yeah, didn't they put Conker out as an asset you could get in Project Spark at one point?

55:55.120 --> 55:56.120
But now it is no more.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.120
It conked out.

55:59.120 --> 56:05.120
What? Did nobody else see the easy pun that just writes itself? Come on.

56:05.120 --> 56:11.120
Out of all the places that they should have put Conker, Project Spark was probably the dumbest thing they could have done.

56:12.120 --> 56:16.120
It's like, hey, we've got Conker. Everyone's like, new Conker game? It's going to be in Project Spark. Oh, fuck.

56:18.120 --> 56:22.120
Look, I'm not going to hate on Project Spark, cause I know there are fans and stuff.

56:23.120 --> 56:28.120
I feel like this is another one of those things that Microsoft kind of killed, maybe a little too soon.

56:29.120 --> 56:32.120
Yeah, they were jumping on the little big planet bandwagon like five years late.

56:33.120 --> 56:36.120
I feel like it was a little more than just a little big planet.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.120
Well, we can't help you, Mario Maker.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.120
But I guess it's done now.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.120
Stoppy says, Spark is such a dumb name. This is from our chat room.

56:44.120 --> 56:48.120
If it's a versatile and easy to use tool set, they should have named it Spork.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.120
Good night, everybody. Thanks for listening.

56:53.120 --> 56:55.120
KFC presents Project Spork.

56:55.120 --> 57:03.120
All right, I'm done. I'm done packing up my computer. I'm going the fuck home.

57:04.120 --> 57:07.120
Actually, fuck that. I'm going to go get cheesecake and drink until I get over this.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.120
Extra crispy edition.

57:11.120 --> 57:14.120
Let's travel around the world to check out some release dates.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.120
Seriously, balls.

57:17.120 --> 57:21.120
Check out what games are coming out in a store near you, Loki, here in the US.

57:21.120 --> 57:24.120
It's a store near me. Well, Homefront The Revolution.

57:25.120 --> 57:29.120
That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

57:30.120 --> 57:35.120
Also on PlayStation 4, Shadow of the Beast and Valkyria Chronicles Remastered.

57:36.120 --> 57:40.120
And then we also have Shadwin on PlayStation 4 and PC.

57:41.120 --> 57:45.120
And then later in the week, Last Fight on PC.

57:45.120 --> 57:49.120
If you're a fan of... what is it?

57:50.120 --> 57:53.120
Fuck me, I can't remember the name of the series now.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.120
It'll come back to me.

57:56.120 --> 57:57.120
Let's take a fighting game.

57:58.120 --> 58:04.120
And then finally, Time Machine VR coming to PC for the Vive and the Rift.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.120
And that's it.

58:09.120 --> 58:14.120
Okay then, we'll travel over to Japan and check out what's going to come out over there.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.120
Starting on the PlayStation 4.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.120
You know, it's been kind of a slow couple weeks in Japan.

58:20.120 --> 58:22.120
I think Golden Week was just recently.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.120
Power Stone, that was the game I was thinking of.

58:26.120 --> 58:27.120
Last Fight is very similar to Power Stone.

58:28.120 --> 58:29.120
But things are picking up again in Japan this week.

58:30.120 --> 58:34.120
And we have Doom coming out in Japan this week, getting its release there on the PlayStation 4 on May 19th.

58:34.120 --> 58:36.120
Battleborn also making its way to Japan this week.

58:37.120 --> 58:39.120
And Homefront the Revolution arrives in Japan this week.

58:40.120 --> 58:42.120
Again, all of that on the PlayStation 4.

58:43.120 --> 58:47.120
Seeing if there's anything on the PlayStation 3, because we're still seeing some stuff from that generation.

58:48.120 --> 58:53.120
No, we don't really have any releases until the 26th when Guilty Gear XRD comes out.

58:54.120 --> 59:02.120
So I guess I can skip ahead to the PlayStation Vita and tell you that Period Cube, Torikago no Amadeus is out this week in a regular and limited edition set.

59:02.120 --> 59:06.120
I can't help but think of Intelligent Cube, but I don't think those games have anything in common.

59:07.120 --> 59:14.120
And then on the Nintendo DS this week, Boku no Hero Academia Battle for All comes out this week from Bandai Namco.

59:15.120 --> 59:18.120
This is My Hero Academia comes out.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.120
Which looks like, I think it's a fighting game.

59:22.120 --> 59:28.120
Yeah, it's a little fighting game, little anime boom boom wham, kind of looks like Batman with the big explosions and stuff.

59:29.120 --> 59:31.120
So that is what you have to look forward to on the 3DS.

59:32.120 --> 59:34.120
How about Europe Dark Sakura?

59:35.120 --> 59:42.120
There's some stuff. There is Shadwin on Mac coming out, Valkyria Chronicles remaster for PlayStation 4, those are all on the 17th.

59:43.120 --> 59:52.120
On the 19th we have Time Machine VR for PC, and on the 20th Fire Emblem Fates for 3DS, Homefront the Revolution for everything else.

59:53.120 --> 59:58.120
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.120
Alright, so this is kind of neat, there's new game consoles coming.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:08.120
And these are both coming out of China, so there's a couple different things being announced.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:16.120
One was the Tencent TGP Box, that's being announced at CES Asia.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:24.120
And that is going to be running off of an Intel Core processor, and it runs Windows 10.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:40.120
And also something called TGP Box Mode, and they're basically saying that the console can download and stream games, including League of Legends, FIFA Online 3, NBA 2K Online, Monster Hunter Online, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Tournament.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:48.120
So a console that plays League of Legends, that's kind of a big deal. But that sounds like a Steam Machine, the way you describe it.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.120
It's almost like a PC, but it's got some sort of special mode in it or something that runs those.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:06.120
Interesting. Let's steam big picture. I'm just saying, it kind of sounds similar, I mean, it sounds more like this is actually just a computer that hooks up to your TV than necessarily a dedicated gaming console.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120
Yeah, it sort of looks like that.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.120
To be fair, gaming consoles and PCs, the line is getting more and more blurred, maybe this is just a further example of that, I don't know.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:21.120
Yeah, they basically said it's basically a Windows 10-powered gaming console with smart features designed to transcend traditional gaming.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:31.120
Okay, that sounds like a bunch of marketing PR buzz crap hype. But there's that. So, interesting, I guess. We'll have to see if that ever makes it out anywhere else.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:44.120
Also, the Fuse Tomahawk F1. And this game system looks like it's sort of like, I guess they're saying it's like an Android console.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.120
But here's the thing though, it's got quite a lineup of different titles that are supposed to be coming out for it.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:02:05.120
Including Assassin's Creed Chronicles, Dynasty Warriors X Extreme Legends, BlazBlue, Chrono Phantasma Extent, Mighty No. 9, and the, once Kickstarted but dropped from Kickstarter, Red Ash.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.120
Red Ash is going to be coming out to it. That's one that's supposed to be like Mega Man Legends.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:30.120
Also, other things that they're talking about, other titles, Saints Row IV and Saints Row Gata out of Hell, Salt Android Cactus, I mean, they got quite a lineup of titles on there. I mean, that's pretty interesting. And I guess that is the company that funded Red Ash.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.120
Okay, when I first heard about this, I was like, okay, so it's basically the Ouya in a bigger box. But, I mean...

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120
It sounds like they got quite a bit of titles on there.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.120
Some of those games you would think, like Saints Row IV is at least going to take an Xbox...

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
I don't think that runs on Android yet.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120
No, no, it's going to take a little more punch to...

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.120
I mean, that's at least, you know, Xbox...

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120
360 level stuff.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120
You know, level graphics, so...

01:02:52.120 --> 01:03:02.120
Well, this is going to be very interesting if China starts to get into the market like this. Like, you know, I don't think that Windows box, you know, because again, that first one you talked about sounds like it's just basically a PC that hooks up your TV.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.120
Yeah, and the controller is basically a rip-off of an Xbox 360 controller. I mean, it looks almost identical.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.120
And then the actual console itself looks like a rip-off of the PlayStation 4, so...

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120
It's an interesting combination.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.120
If there's a good idea, why change it? But that would be interesting if you get a console like this that, you know, becomes highly desirable.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.120
You would have to wonder if maybe one day consoles may come from China.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:42.120
I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow or this year even, but it could be very, very, very interesting if a company like Tencent or something starts to join Sony and Nintendo and some of these other companies in this console space that's already kind of crowded.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.120
Yeah, I mean, definitely looks interesting. I'd be curious to see...

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.120
Oh, here's another one. Grid Autosport also runs on it as well.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:04:03.120
Dungeon Buster brings up a good point that I do believe is worth correcting, Loki. Red Ash was funded by a Chinese company, but they ended the Kickstarter early. Not that the Kickstarter was doing all that well to begin with.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.120
Well, yes, that's what I'm saying. They ended the Kickstarter because it got funded by a company.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:14.120
I thought they still ran it for stretch goals, I thought was the thing. I could be thinking of something else on Kickstarter these days.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120
There's several of those games that do that too.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.120
And Bob Coffey in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, better launch lineup than the Wii U.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.120
Well, I don't know if all those games are necessarily the day it launches, though.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:35.120
Well, that's true, but I mean, you basically have an Android console, you know, theoretically. So they're saying, okay, here's some price points to kind of give you an idea of how much this is going to cost.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:42.120
And it's pretty impressive, actually. So they're saying the Play Edition of the console will launch for 899 yen, which is just about $140.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:49.120
And it's considerably cheaper than everything else that's on the market right now. They're saying that it even has VR support for it later on.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:05:04.120
The specs on it, Nvidia Tegra K1, 4-core processor. They've also got 4GB of RAM. It's got 32GB of on-board storage, or 500GB if you have an Elite console.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:12.120
And then HDMI USB 3.0, and then it runs some Fuse OS, which is Android, and then OpenGL 4.4.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.120
Which looks a lot like the Sony crossbar, if you've seen the pictures.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:31.120
Exactly. But think about this, though. This is a $140 console that basically runs games that are graphically similar to an Xbox 360 or even a Wii U, which is pretty impressive.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:42.120
It'll be interesting to see what happens, especially what this is going to do for gaming in China, because we look at this and go, okay, well, this is a bunch of kind of last-gen games for the most part.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:47.120
I mean, there's some current stuff in there, especially Mighty No. 9 and stuff, but nothing that's really pushing the envelope and so forth.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:53.120
But you have to remember, China is a very big place. There's a lot of people in China.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:00.120
And, you know, they just lifted that whole ban on making consoles in the first place. Like, what? Not even two years ago.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.120
What do you think? Most of these consoles are manufactured anyways. I mean, a lot of this stuff comes from China and Hong Kong.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Yeah, but you couldn't sell them within the country for a long time. So now you can. So it's going to be very, very, very interesting to see, like, what this does.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:22.120
I mean, this, I feel like a lot of people are just kind of writing this off as, oh, this console, you know, something we'll never see here, and it looks like it's shit anyway compared to what we have.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.120
But hold up, because as gaming continues to grow in China, it could be very interesting.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:36.120
Let's put it this way. The lineup of titles that they're talking about coming to it right now is already more impressive than what the Ouya had with several million dollars worth of funding.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:44.120
I mean, it sounds like these guys are at least, you know, more on board with that. And I guess the leaked version of the console, which has the larger hard drive and everything, is like $230.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.120
But that's still not bad. It's still cheaper than you can get a Wii U for.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:58.120
I wonder if that's something people over here will try to get just to have. I mean, I don't know, because again, the games are all kind of things you can play other places anyway.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.120
But I'd be very curious to see, like, what maybe kind of exclusives they get and if they're any good.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.120
Well, Red Ash, I mean, that's...

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120
Yeah, but we're going to see that here.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120
I don't think we... I don't know if we are.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120
Nothing's been said so far.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:17.120
When the Kickstarter ended, it got funded for the base consoles. We'll see it. We're going to see Red Ash here. Believe it.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120
I mean...

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.120
Am I going to believe it like I'm going to see Mighty No. 9 here?

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.120
It might be six years from now, but you'll see it eventually.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.120
Alright, we got one more story for you guys here and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.120
This is about a modern classic, however, and I think Dark Sakura would agree.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:43.120
Mass Effect. Mass Effect Andromeda, in fact. More information, a little bit more, out this week about what to expect at E3.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.120
And yes, you will get an update on Mass Effect Andromeda at EA's press conference this year.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.120
In fact, many people kind of fully expecting this is the full fucking reveal this year.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.120
You're going to see the gameplay footage. You're going to get everything this year.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.120
Kind of similar to a couple years ago when they first showed Dragon Age Inquisition, right? And then it came out that holiday.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.120
Well, unfortunately, Mass Effect Andromeda also confirmed this week it's not going to be a holiday.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120
It's going to be 2017.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.120
CFO Blake Jorgensen said to investors,

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:18.120
As we've been playing the game in the studio recently, it's showing us that we're taking the game in the right direction.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.120
But we also know we need the right amount of time to make sure we deliver everything the game can be and should be.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:30.120
That's our commitment from all of us to all of you. Because of that, Mass Effect Andromeda will now ship in early 2017.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120
Thank. God.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120
Yeah, don't rush it.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120
Seriously, I want a good game. I don't want a rushed piece of crap.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.120
Even if that's now going to be, what, how many years since Mass Effect 3?

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120
I still don't care if it's going to be worth it.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.120
Mass Effect 3 came out in March, I think.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.120
Yeah, and it came out in the March window as well. It'll be fine. I'm not really worried about the timeframe.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.120
And if that's what they need to make it right, then I will shut up.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.120
So, there you go. Excited to see more of that at E3, except that I'm not going.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.120
But I wouldn't really have to go to E3 anyway. I just have to go to the EA Play event.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.120
Which, I'm assuming they're going to have some type of playable little thing there.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.120
I mean, that's a huge assumption, but why wouldn't they?

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120
Especially if multiplayer is going to be back.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.120
I would think a great thing to show at E3, or this EA event, would be the multiplayer.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.120
And just let people play that a little bit to get a little bit of the action.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120
We'll see.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.120
Anyhow, let's travel back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:39.120
Every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you little shits, you should be playing this instead.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:47.120
This is a very interesting pick this week. Remember, the rule for what a classic game should be is it has to be at least ten years old or more.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.120
And this is one that is ten years old or more. But it's one that is kind of still a thing for a lot of people, right?

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.120
I balanced on the technicality.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.120
Fair enough. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120
Classic game of the week is World of Warcraft.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.120
How could you pick World of Warcraft?

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120
Because it's all this shit.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120
It kind of is, though.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120
And I did find the first sign-in music.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120
Yeah.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120
So that was pretty cool.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.120
It was a game that took me a long time to finally get into because I've played for every expansion, remember?

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.120
And then I quit.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120
And then I'd get the next expansion and then I'd quit.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:34.120
And finally I really liked it around Cataclysm and have several 85s and then I quit after Pandas.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.120
Fucking Pandas.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.120
I still have a level 90.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:47.120
But World of Warcraft is an MMORPG that was released in 2004 by Blizzard, now owned by Activision.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:54.120
It was a pretty much direct sequel to Warcraft III, The Frozen Throne.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.120
And it was set about four years after the events of that game.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.120
It is pretty much still an entity.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:15.120
We make fun of it for still existing and I may have called you an addict for years and years.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.120
But the people who love it really love it.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.120
And it took me a while and I really loved it.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.120
In fact, I'm actually considering quitting Final Fantasy XIV to go back to it.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120
Just because it's been so long.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:34.120
And I have a bajillion friends that play, but every time I log into Final Fantasy XIV, no one's freaking on.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:44.120
And pretty much you get the opportunity, I think in the vanilla version you had humans.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:55.120
On the Alliance side you had humans, dwarves, elves, night elves, and gnomes.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.120
Just the four, right?

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120
I don't think so.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.120
And then on the Horde side you had orcs, you had trolls, you had...

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120
Taurens.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.120
Taurens, yeah. Remember I had cowgirl for a while?

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.120
Yes.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
Undead, that's right.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.120
I kept thinking of the goblins as the counterpart to the gnomes.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120
Yeah, some of that came later.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.120
Yeah, blood elves.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.120
The pretty ones.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.120
We had our twinsie blood elves.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.120
I do.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120
That was great.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120
Rob, you should rejoin with me if I do it.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120
One MMO a few months.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120
I tried World of Warcraft already.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120
I wasn't really interested in going back.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120
I mean, there's some cool people playing, but I'll see them on Twitter.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.120
Yeah, I'm still deciding.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120
I haven't done anything yet.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.120
But you have all kinds of different play modes as well.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.120
You have normal questing and doing stuff.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120
And you've got your roleplay server still.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120
Some of them.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120
You have PvP, player versus player.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.120
You have all kinds of different stuff you can do.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120
You can travel around.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120
There's plenty of hidden, really weird shit in the game.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.120
Like if you follow the children into the village where they stand in a pentagram

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.120
and then they run off and weird things play.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.120
All kinds of neat little Easter eggs in there.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.120
And even for people who are clip masters, you can find content

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.120
and complete dungeons and everything and explore them.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120
A lot of that's up on YouTube.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.120
And then you have your holiday things like Children's Week and Halloween and all that.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120
And there's an auction house.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.120
It's just World of Warcraft.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.120
I mean, if you don't know what it is by now, then...

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.120
But it's been an ongoing story.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.120
I really like the lore for it.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120
I couldn't get into the turn-based strategies, but this was pretty fun for me.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.120
And it's still pretty much going strong.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:14:01.120
We've maybe lost some subscribers, but it is still, I think, have the Guinness World Record for it.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.120
It's still the biggest MMO out there, even to this day.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.120
I see some folks in the chat going, you know, WoW's not a classic.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.120
Hold up. Hold up.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.120
Because WoW kind of changed it all for MMOs.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.120
There's been nothing like World of Warcraft.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.120
I would even argue World of Warcraft was probably one of the most impactful games.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.120
I felt like we talked about this at the end of the last decade.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:32.120
I feel like between Xbox Live and World of Warcraft, those are two of the biggest things in gaming in the past decade.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.120
That's why I picked it as a classic, especially since we've got the movie coming out.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120
Yeah, it's timely, the movie and the expansion.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:47.120
But I think that it's just, yeah, it's still being updated and kept new and everything.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:56.120
But if you look at when it came out, and the fact that it's a 12-fucking-year-old game, and a million people are still playing it.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.120
More than a million.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120
I know what you mean. Lots.

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.120
Millions are playing it. That has to count for something.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.120
I think it would be the same as if I had mentioned Lineage or EverQuest.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.120
But I think that World of Warcraft has actually surpassed them.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:19.120
It depends on what you're into, but I think on a commercial level, for sure.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.120
But also, something to consider is how did the game make it for 12 years?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.120
It's basically innovated itself every few years by adding new features and things of that sort.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.120
And you look at, you know, classic World of Warcraft is not the same game that it is today.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.120
So in some ways, when you look back at Vanilla Warcraft, yeah, it is a different game.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.120
In fact, and this is also timely because you have a lot of people talking about, we miss Vanilla WoW.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.120
Remember that pirate server that got shut down recently?

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.120
Now there's all these people that are hammering the blizzard about, bring that back.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.120
We want vanilla servers. We want to play the game like it was in 2004 when it first came out.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:06.120
Because that game will never exist again otherwise, even though I kind of go, it wasn't as good as it is now.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.120
I mean, the game gets better, I think.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120
People beg to differ though. It's all that we like.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.120
And it's that certain retro charm. I get it. Why do we go back and play Atari 2600 games?

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120
Well, it's the same reason why I go back and play Ragnarok Online.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:25.120
You know, I love freaking Ragnarok Online. I'd even say that that is my favorite MMO of all time.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.120
But I really do like World of Warcraft enough to consider going back to it.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.120
Even against my, you know, husband's desires because he just doesn't want me to play any of them.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.120
But still.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.120
AkumaJP with a good point in our chat room, can't play in Japan.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.120
Yeah, somehow World of Warcraft, for some reason, never crossed over to Japan.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.120
It went to China, but it never went to Japan.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:55.120
It went to, I mean, obviously it's been in Europe. I'm trying to think of other Asian countries it's been to.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.120
But yeah, somehow it always skipped Japan.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:06.120
I think it really did just innovate and bring something new.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.120
And really, I think, also introduced a wider market into the concept of an MMORPG.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120
It really did break a lot of ground.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:25.120
And even if, you know, you've never touched a video game, most people, when you say World of Warcraft, they go, oh, that's that time sink game, right?

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.120
So, just saying.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.120
Yeah. And even though, you know, you guys know I kind of prefer Final Fantasy XIV these days.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.120
You know, Final Fantasy XIV owes a lot to World of Warcraft.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.120
In fact, even the producer of Final Fantasy XIV has said that some of the influence came from World of Warcraft.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:49.120
And when they re, after the horrible fucking 1.0 Final Fantasy XIV, the idea to nuke the world, yeah, did come from cataclysm.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.120
And kind of showed that, you know, you can push the reset button on a living world like that.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.120
And for the better, thank God.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.120
So, anyhow.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.120
Even though I think Final Fantasy XIV now innovates in ways that World of Warcraft should.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.120
But that's the fun thing about competition now.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.120
Well, maybe later tonight, if someone is going to be awake after I've cheesecaked, we might have to play some XIV.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120
We'll see. I should, I should.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.120
Vince me why I should stay.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.120
I should be around.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120
Alright. Anyhow.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.120
I think I am right and I'm standing by my decision and y'all don't judge me because this is our show and not yours.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.120
I couldn't help that.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.120
Well, no, and I don't think you need to defend that World of Warcraft is not a classic game.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.120
It's ludicrous.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.120
It's ludicrous to say it's not.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.120
I honestly believe, in my opinion, it's ludicrous to say that World of Warcraft is not a classic game.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120
It's more of a classic than fucking Halo.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120
Well, now I don't know if I go that far.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120
Fucking more of a classic than Halo.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.120
Halo is never.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:19:03.120
If Halo is going to be on the Sam show, someone in this room who does not have a vagina is going to be the one putting it on the list.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120
Hey, she said if.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:16.120
I said, if I, who is the queen of classic game of the week, I will not choose Halo.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.120
I would, I, you know, what's funny.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:29.120
I don't know if I would necessarily pick Halo before I would pick Halo 2 anyway, because I think Halo 2 was the real one that kind of innovative, especially for Xbox Live and everything.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120
She's starting to give a little bit, you guys.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.120
That doesn't mean, no, no, no.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.120
I can say something.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.120
All right, girl.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.120
Where's the fan?

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.120
All right, you ready for this?

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.120
Yes.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.120
I never once said that Halo is not a good game.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.120
I never once said that it doesn't deserve recognition.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:00.120
I just said that I'm a stubborn bitch and I'm never going to put it on the list.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:11.120
And Bobby says, for the record, I think World of Warcraft is a totally acceptable classic game.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120
I also think that EverQuest would be a good candidate as well.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:20.120
I almost did EverQuest, but I figured I would do World of Warcraft given that the movie's going to be out whenever.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120
A lot of people are talking about it right now.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:29.120
But I also am considering Lineage and I think I've done Ragnarok online though.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:39.120
But yeah, I've got my eyes on those other two, so probably you'll see them come up in a future classic game.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.120
All right, fair enough.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.120
But not Halo.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.120
All right. We are going to take a break though, you guys.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:50.120
We're going to take a rest and stuff and relax our voices, get some water and all that good stuff.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:58.120
But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come, including rapid fire news as well as we're going to get into the mailbag.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.120
Your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.120
We will get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:29.120
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on this May the 15th of 2016 with episode number 641 of our show in progress.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.120
Thank you very much, by the way, DarkSakura.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.120
She gave me her fortune cookie with her meal because I guess for whatever reason she doesn't want to eat the cookie.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:43.120
So I actually read the fortune here, DarkSakura. It says, happy events will take place in your home.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120
Aw, like this show.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.120
Exactly.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.120
Of course, if you were to add embed to that, happy events will take place in your home in bed.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.120
Happy endings will take place in your home in bed.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.120
Let's hope.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:06.120
Anyway, by the way, also, I kind of failed tonight because I forgot to do a FUGO Question of the Week.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.120
I know, God, I'm sorry guys, I've been slacking.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.120
We will do some Ask Orange Lounge tonight instead.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.120
So if you want to send a question for Ask Orange Lounge, since I forgot to ask you, you can ask us.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.120
It's cool if it's gaming related, but if it's not, that's alright too.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.120
So you can ask Orange Lounge right now while we do these rapid fire questions.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.120
I put the instructions there in our live chat.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:29.120
You can also tweet them to us at OLR. I have the Twitters up.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:35.120
So if messaging us in chat is too damn hard, you can tweet us at OLR right now.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:43.120
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Africa.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.120
While we wait for those questions to come in, let's do some rapid fire news.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.120
Alright, so this is cool if you're still in the market for a 2DS or a 3DS.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:58.120
Instead of 2DS, they have dropped the price, or they will be next week, to $79.99.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.120
Actually, it's already been dropped in certain locations like today at Toys R Us.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.120
It was actually less than that. It was $60 something, $68.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.120
So, keeping an eye out for that.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.120
I almost purchased one, but then I didn't.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.120
Because, I don't know. I don't need it.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.120
There's a new Dead Island game coming out.

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.120
And it's kind of a throwback, a retro game.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120
It's a Dead Island Retro Revenge.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.120
It's a 16-bit style beat-em-up.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:35.120
And it will be a part of the Dead Island Definitive Collection.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:44.120
And you can purchase both games in the collection digitally for $19.99 or $39.99 for the retail price.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.120
And, yeah. That's pretty cool.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.120
So, I guess check it out when it comes out.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120
May 31st.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.120
And then, Grand Theft Auto Online is getting some more updates.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.120
I think they've kind of taken note that a lot of people like to make really crazy racetracks in that game.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120
Doing all sorts of stunt jumps and that type of thing.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.120
So, the newest set that they're including a lot of stunt driving options.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.120
Different vehicles, gear, and different props for creators.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:21.120
Including, like they have in this picture here, these giant metal tube cage things.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.120
That you could basically create this giant tube that you could drive through.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.120
Which looks all sorts of awesome.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:34.120
So, I really do need to go back and play some more Grand Theft Auto Online since it's been years since I've done that.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.120
And I haven't really done much in Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PlayStation 4.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.120
I need to go back.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.120
Is this a reason enough to go back for you?

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.120
Yeah, actually I think it'd be pretty fun.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.120
The problem is a lot of the friends, a lot of the people I used to play with that were like,

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.120
Oh yeah, we're totally gonna play all the time.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.120
They just don't.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.120
So, I just need to go back and try it.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.120
Alright. Well, moving on to something a little less violent.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.120
Minecraft is, believe it or not, celebrating its four year anniversary on consoles.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.120
Microsoft and Mojang did some birthday DLC to celebrate.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.120
There's a new skin pack out to celebrate the birthday.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.120
It looks very bright.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.120
So you can check that out.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.120
And all of the previous skin birthday pack bundles are also available now for a limited time.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.120
This is on Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.120
You can download all four of them through tomorrow.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.120
But if you haven't gotten on that, you might want to hurry up and get on that.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.120
You have through May 16th or tomorrow.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.120
Which is probably today for many of you folks listening on the podcast.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:49.120
Also, Minecraft on the Wii U also getting a pretty big update.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.120
And yeah, the Super Mario Mashup Pack.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120
It's happening. That's right.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.120
Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess, now gonna be characters in Minecraft.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.120
And get this, it's a free update.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.120
So they're really trying to make Minecraft Wii U something you want to check out.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.120
Even though it's been four years since Microsoft came out on other consoles.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.120
My son is totally stoked about that DLC.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.120
I told him about it, I'm like, you're gonna like this.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.120
He's like, oh, can I play it now? Can I play it now? No.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.120
Fifteen pieces of Super Mario music, item textures, forty skins,

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.120
and a pre-made, I guess, Mushroom Kingdom world is gonna be there.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.120
They say the inspiration comes from Super Mario World, Super Mario 64,

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.120
and yes, even Super Mario Sunshine.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.120
You can get a retail version June 17th for $29.99,

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.120
and that includes the Super Mario Mashup content.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.120
The eShop game, by the way, will set you back $29.99,

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.120
which I swear is more expensive than Minecraft on other consoles, am I right?

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.120
I think so.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120
That's the Nintendo premium.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.120
No, that's $29.99 is what it normally goes for.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.120
Alright, fair enough.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:08.120
Citizens of Earth is a game that has also now been delisted from the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120
Oh, it's in that bundle too.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.120
It was, it was just in that Nintendo Humble Bundle,

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120
but now it is unavailable for purchase.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.120
Now, here's the thing, it's temporary, it's not permanent.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.120
This is similar to why VVVVV was removed recently,

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.120
because there is an exploit in the game which will let hackers run unsigned code on the 3DS,

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.120
God forbid we let them do that,

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.120
which is pretty hilarious considering this game just was in that bundle.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.120
However, this was also the game where you got to pick,

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.120
you could get it on the 3DS or the Wii U.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:46.120
You didn't get both, so hopefully you opted for the 3DS if you like to run unsigned code.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.120
The demo, also unavailable on the 3DS,

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.120
so no word yet when they're going to be back up, but I would think soon.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120
But if you did get these as part of the bundle, you're not affected.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.120
You just can't buy them yet.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.120
Music game fans, I'm sure, are excited to hear that DJ Max is going to get a new title coming out.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.120
It's coming out for the PlayStation 4 in January 2017,

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.120
according to NeoWiz and developer Rocky Studios.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.120
It is DJ Max Respect.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.120
There will be a local two-player mode.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.120
You're going to be able to play online against other players, that's pretty cool.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.120
And I guess the track list is kind of like a greatest hits thing.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:28.120
DJ Max Portable 1 and 2 and 3 and Clasiquy and Black Square, Technica and Technica 3.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:35.120
So I'm assuming this is kind of a way to reintroduce DJ Max to people that may have missed it.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:43.120
I know that Technica was out on the Vita and stuff, but it kind of came and went.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.120
If you weren't really looking for music games, I don't know if you ever saw it.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.120
So hopefully they're going to give this one a little more exposure.

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.120
I'm actually looking forward to this.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.120
As a music game fan, and especially I like BeatMania 2DX,

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.120
and I feel like this is the closest thing we're ever going to get,

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.120
even though it's not going to have a BeatMania controller.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120
You use the controller to do it instead.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.120
I think it'll work okay. So I'm looking forward to it.

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.120
So check that out. DJ Max Respect coming in January,

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.120
which is not the greatest time to release a new game,

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.120
but we'll see how that strategy plays out for him.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120
Dark Sakura.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.120
Well Sega is doing a little bit of investigation.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.120
They are looking into seeing if they are going to do Shenmue remasters.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:35.120
They put out a fan inquiry from Sega Europe saying that it's something that the company would like to do,

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.120
but it's not a simple process.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:43.120
So they're looking into it, and of course Shenmue 3 is currently in development by Eastnet,

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120
which is Yu Suzuki's studio.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.120
So hey, that'd be pretty cool.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.120
There's also found footage now.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.120
It's from a group that I really like, which is Unseen 64.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.120
I think it's the same people who have to do Beta64.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:07.120
A cancelled Akira game that was supposed to be on one of the 16-bit systems.

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:12.120
It looks like both Genesis and SNES.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:19.120
So, I mean it would have been cool, but I'm looking at the intro of it right now,

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.120
but there's like, yeah, the footage is basically from some kind of trade show.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.120
Although some of this I have to say, just with cutscenes and whatnot,

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.120
kind of reminds me of TurboGrafx. You know, PC Engine stuff.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.120
Oh well. Looks like it was a neat little platformer.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:42.120
And then, last but not least, something I'm kind of excited about is the World of Warcraft cookbook.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.120
And it actually, I did find it on Amazon today.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.120
It says it's supposed to be released in October, but the Amazon pre-orders are up.

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:55.120
And there are some pretty neat recipes in there.

01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:02.120
There's a variation of bear claws called Rylak claws,

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:05.120
which are basically, you know, cinnamon buns in the shape of claws.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:14.120
There is a cherry grog, which basically, it's a sangria, but it looks pretty yummy.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120
You know, all kinds of different stuff on there.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:23.120
Even a complete roast and several casseroles and a really good chili.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:29.120
So, I think I might actually end up buying that one because I could use some new ideas for cooking.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:37.120
Yes, and I will happily volunteer to eat all the food that you cook, provided that it's safe.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:49.120
Alright, well, let's get to it. We didn't get a ton of questions for this, but we got enough to do a little segment here for Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:32:01.120
Since I failed in doing a Fugu Question of the Week, instead we will provide answers to your questions.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.120
You also failed with playing the music too.

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120
In this segment, maybe I changed it.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:15.120
Alright, let's get to it. If you still want to send one, because I see Dark Tetsuya going, oh dang, I just had one, hurry up and get it in.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120
We still got time because I only have a couple questions here.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:25.120
Let's get to it. Tonight from Stupi, Stoppi, not Stupi, Stoppi, two P's.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:32.120
Stoppi asked our first question tonight saying, what do you think about fans wanting a new Crash game?

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:39.120
I think the fact that they want a return of Crash is a sign that reboots have gone too far and need to stop already.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:46.120
What's next? Hashtag bring back Bubsy? Well didn't the Bubsy thing already happen?

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.120
And that turned out to be that it actually was in no way official and like a big scam sort of thing?

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.120
I don't know.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.120
It was a mess. So be careful what you wish for, Stoppi.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:08.120
As far as Crash goes, see, I don't know. Early in the show, at the beginning of the show, I talked about Doom, which in some ways is a relaunch of an old franchise.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:13.120
It's kind of good. I'm enjoying it more than I enjoy Doom 3, to be quite honest.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:23.120
So I don't necessarily think that all reboots are bad. And I think Crash Bandicoot is one of those platformers, like if you were playing in the PlayStation era, you remember Crash Bandicoot.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:27.120
And so I think there's people that would really like to see what that would turn into now.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:34.120
I just, at the same time, I also understand that innovating new IPs is a great thing too.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.120
And that's how you get things like Splatoon. So it's a difficult little line to walk.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:50.120
But I really would mind, like if they came out and announced at E3 that we're going to do a new Crash Bandicoot game and all the rumors are true, he's back, here it is, I would check it out for sure.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.120
I'd be into that. Because I love the Crash Bandicoot games on the original PlayStation.

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.120
What about you guys? Loki, Dark Soccer, would you be into a Crash reboot?

01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.120
I never played the first one.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120
Really? Yeah, I wasn't really a fan of Crash Bandicoot.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.120
Wow. So I don't really care.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.120
Alright. I'm sure people want it. Good for them. I hope you get your reboot someday.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.120
Someone in chat says, bring back Jak and Dexter in Spyro the Dragon. Isn't Skylanders kind of a Spyro the Dragon spinoff?

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.120
Yeah, Skylanders is the continuation of the Spyro story.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:24.120
I mean, it's kind of, you know, another universe. But I mean, it's what it is.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.120
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Crash remake is Frog Fractions 2.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.120
Whatever happened to Frog Fractions 2? Where is it?

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120
I think we've asked this last week.

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.120
That frog now rides a unicycle.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.120
Maybe that's the joke all along. Who knows?

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:53.120
William Murderface asks Orange Lounge Tonight, we have seen the RTS, the FPS, and no, the MOBA experience long periods of extreme success over the last 16 years.

01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:00.120
What do you think the next genre is that will experience such a sudden and robust burst of popularity?

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.120
Well, shit, if I knew that, I'm going to be a fucking millionaire because I'm going to make that game.

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:12.120
This is the twerk controller. You have to control it with your ass and the faster that you twerk, the further your car goes along.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.120
Twerk Racer! There we go.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:21.120
I was going to make the easy joke, well, whatever brings us one step closer to the holodeck because that's what gaming is, right?

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:33.120
But that leaves the easy answer to be VR. So my thought is maybe there's something in the VR space that can't be done in the regular space.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:42.120
And that's going to be the next big genre of gaming. I know that's a really vague answer, but again, if I knew the answer, I'm going to go make that game and make a ton of money.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.120
You can't really just create new genres. I don't know about that.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.120
Well, I mean, it's hard to come up with something completely different.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:59.120
It's hard, but you can do it. I mean, the MOBA came from somewhere, right? MOBAs came from the Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:09.120
So they haven't been around since the dawn of time. There's no MOBAs on Atari 2600. So the genre got invented at some point. It's just, yeah, who knows where it's going to come from, right?

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.120
Combat was the first MOBA.

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:25.120
Combat. Do you want to be the blue tank or the red tank? Let's see. William Ritterface potentially suggesting you can have existing genres experience sudden popularity booms.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:34.120
So, okay. So like maybe there's an existing genre that will suddenly get lifted up. Well, you know, our hearts are going to say music games. They're going to make a comeback.

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:43.120
They're going to make a comeback. They're going to, they're going to make that DJ Max will do it y'all. I don't know. I don't know. I wish. I hope. Maybe in VR.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:59.120
Um, I don't know. I just don't see anything really changing anytime soon. They've tried a lot of things and there are things that like last for a few years, like the whole Toys Life stuff, but like eventually it just kind of goes away.

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:10.120
So, you know, I think we're going to get a lot of those different gimmicky types of gameplay, but I don't really know what exactly is going to be just there.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:21.120
I don't know. Um, okay. Let's see. How about like more kind of, uh, you know, interaction with your phone.

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:37.120
So basically a lot of those games, like just dance, like all the Jackbox games are basically your phone is the controller. You know, you're able to just, you know, just load up the game on your TV and all your friends in the house can play because they have phones or something.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:47.120
I don't know exactly how you would, you know, narrow that down to a genre. Maybe that'll take off more party games, I guess. Yeah. All right. Fair enough. Phone enabled party games. How about that?

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:59.120
All right. Jackbox is onto something a little early. All right. Uh, last question here from dark Tetsuya. So I was planning a best hits three, and I think that means a compilation of great OLR moments from the past.

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:11.120
Um, I'm just missing episode 169 for one more clip and I seem to recall it aired on VOG sometime ago. Maybe you can hook a brother up, um, for you, of course, if I, if I have it in my archive somewhere.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:23.120
Uh, 169 sounds like around the time we would have been airing the repeats on DDR freak, which happened for a very short time. You guys might not remember, but OLR was on DDR freak radio.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:37.120
Like in repeats, I think it was like probably a year or two before the, the all games thing. And one didn't have anything to do with the other. It's just DDR freak kind of closed at one point or they closed DDR freak radio at some point.

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:47.120
Probably. I think when we got off live 365, they got off like 365. I think is what happened. I think that's a, that was the whole deal. How is live 365 doing nowadays?

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:56.120
Actually, you know what? It's fucking funny. You ain't, well, not funny, but it's interesting. You asked that because I was curious about that same question. They closed this year.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:11.120
They are gone as of, I think January 31st was their last day running. So life is five ended. Uh, yeah. So it was kind of, I, I remember making a tweet about it going, wow, I just found out like three weeks after the fact that life is five is done.

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:28.120
Um, in fact, I know, uh, there's a lot of websites out there that sell like radio streaming stuff, um, that are actually catering to former live 365 broadcasters saying, Hey, come host your stuff with us and all that. So life is five went away.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:40.120
Um, and I don't know all the reasons that went into it, but you know, it's just, I guess with all the laws and everything, it got too expensive to do things the way they wanted to do them. So there you go.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:40:02.120
Uh, all right. Let's see, uh, dark Tetsuya in chat says that was the last episode before you guys switched to the podcast and discontinued the to go technically. Was it really? 169 was that episode. So that would have been the one cause it wasn't, wasn't that the last time mistress Tia was here on the show before she moved to New York.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:16.120
I almost positive. It was, I feel like she was on the very, very last show, uh, before we merged the live show and the podcast and all that. Ah, the history of orange lounge radio. At one point we were doing a three hour live show and a one hour podcast.

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:28.120
So if you weren't here for the three hour live show, you didn't hear it, but anybody could hear the podcast. But then suddenly we all kind of sat here going, you know, four hours is a long time to be here.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:43.120
So we changed things a little bit and I think it worked out all right. Anyway, thank you for the questions tonight. Appreciate that. And I apologize for failing on the football question. Uh, but you know, ask orange lounge is fun to do once in a while too. Let's get back into some more news. Loki.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:41:05.120
All right. So there's some, it's another week. So you know what that means? More NX rumors. Yay. So this week we have that the rumor that the NX is not going to be using x 86 architecture and that, um, if you're expecting the graphics to be blowing away the PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:23.120
Yeah, that's not going to be the case. So, you know, what they're saying is that it might be, you know, graphics wise, it might be a little bit closer to like the Xbox one instead of the PlayStation four. Um, but it's not going to be anything like, you know, two times as powerful as the PlayStation four or anything like that.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:35.120
There's basically the NX has a very, like a custom made chip. The overall design is very modern. Um, it's not going to be, you know, based off of like the Polaris chip or Polaris architecture.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:49.120
And you know, basically, you know, um, everything that, you know, this person's heard Emily Rogers is indicates that the NX isn't going to blow away any of the consoles on the market today, except for the Wii U.

01:41:49.120 --> 01:42:18.120
Well, that's a little bit of a disappointment, but whatever. I'm so sick of NX rumors. Show me the fucking console already. I don't like, I don't know. I just, I hear NX rumors. No, no offense to you, Loki. It's just, just in general on the internet, on Twitter, I hear NX rumors and my eyes just kind of glaze over and I'm just like, the other thing, the other rumor I had, which wasn't necessarily a part of that story, but I was gonna bring it up later anyway. So I just figured this right about the same time. Um, this is coming from, let's see here.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:44.120
Uh, Kimishima and basically saying that, you know, the NX, it's not going to be a successor to the Wii U nor the 3DS. It's going to be something different. And basically saying that since it's neither a successor to the Wii or 3DS, it's a new way of playing games, which I think will have a larger impact than the Wii U, but I don't feel that it's a pure replacement for the Wii U.

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:59.120
I don't know what that means. Once again, we still don't know what the hell this is. And I think they really should come out and say what it is because right now we are having all these like crazy expectations and then they're going to reveal it and it's gonna be like, oh.

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:19.120
Well, gamers start now, set that bar really low. That way, when this is announced, it can exceed your expectations. So I'm just gonna tell y'all, set the bar low. So maybe I am okay with rumors that, well guys, the chipset in it isn't very good. That way the bar is set pretty low.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:36.120
And even still, I mean, you know, look at like the Wii U and how they, you know, first showed off. Hey, we've got this like tech demo that's gonna show you the equivalent, you know, of the graphics that you're gonna see on the Wii U with Zelda and is like, no, we never really saw that.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:47.120
I love this. Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, I remember when they said the DS was not a successor to the Game Boy. Yet it was fully backwards compatible with Game Boy games.

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:56.120
You can play Game Boy games, yes. So just props to Nintendo for at least being backwards compatible for the previous generation. So I will give them that.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:05.120
Well, except for GameCube, of course, obviously I didn't play Nintendo 64 controllers or, you know, cartridges, but so far they've been not bad.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:14.120
Tigerclaw in chat says, what can Nintendo possibly do that hasn't been done already? Have sex with me.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:21.120
I don't know. They had, what can they possibly do that hasn't been done already? They did that with the Wii, so I think there's lots that they can do.

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:28.120
Well, but even with the Wii, it wasn't necessarily that motion gaming had never been done. It just had never been done well or on that level.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.120
And to be honest, it did it okay. I mean, it wasn't great.

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.120
Which is why I was afraid that the NX might have been virtual reality at first. I don't think it is at this point.

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:47.120
But, you know, when these, you know, when the hype first started, that's why I was kind of like, I wonder if they're going to try and get into VR things since this is where everybody else is.

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:52.120
And yeah, go ahead and make all the Virtual Boy jokes you want, but it's different now. It's different now.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.120
I think it could be pretty cool if they did that.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.120
Yeah.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.120
I mean, who wouldn't want to see Nintendo games in VR?

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.120
Ooh, depend on the Nintendo game, but yeah.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:07.120
It would be, but like, imagine if like their controller wasn't like just a normal controller, but I'm not saying like a power glove.

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:14.120
I can't wait for them to put F-Zero in VR so I can just throw up every projectile vomit everywhere because that's what would happen.

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.120
Oh, you can play that in VR now.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.120
I know, and I have, and I've been like, okay, this might be a bit too fast.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.120
There's no such thing.

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:31.120
TigerKlon chat says, maybe the NX is a system that you jack into like the Matrix and you're in the game.

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:41.120
I mean, realistically, like if they could do something that would like, I want them to surprise me in a way that's like, holy crap, that is an amazing idea.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:48.120
I just, right now, my expectations are so low with them and it's, it's like they do the bare minimum to get by.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:55.120
It's not going to help, especially if they're going to make a system that's going to be on par with the Xbox One.

01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:01.120
That may work for a while, but now all these other consoles are getting upgrades and now their games are going to be compatible.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.120
You're going to be in the same fucking position again.

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120
Yeah, I do worry about that for sure.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:10.120
Moving on to talk a little bit about EA and their comments on the Nintendo NX.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.120
They have actually told the BBC in an interview this following quote.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:20.120
I personally and the company are huge fans of Nintendo. They're the reason why I started making games.

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.120
We're in constant communication with them and when they come to market something, and if it makes sense for us, we'll be there.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:35.120
So, kind of a, I don't know, very walking the line type of response where they're not committing to developing for the NX, but basically saying,

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:43.120
if we see dollar signs, we're going to go chase those dollar signs, which, duh, that's how it works.

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:50.120
And for whatever reason, they didn't see dollar signs on the Wii U, probably because of the not so great sales in the first year, so everybody ran away.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.120
And also the fact that most of their engines, everything was like in frostbite, so that didn't run on the Wii U.

01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:07.120
True. Which is, although, again, as a reminder, which is why everybody ran away, or which is why, excuse me, why the NX got pushed back,

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:15.120
was because I think they're trying to attract more of these third parties and have that stronger launch so that out the gate they sell a ton of them.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:22.120
Interesting though, since we're thinking EA, we just had that story earlier on about Mass Effect is coming out in the first part of 2017.

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:31.120
We know that Mass Effect Andromeda is a new story, it's not going to tie to the original trilogy really,

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:38.120
certainly the save games are not going to import, so could we see Andromeda on the NX?

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.120
Or whatever Nintendo ends up calling it. I hate that we still call it the NX to this day.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:48.120
Well, because we don't know anything because Nintendo's not telling us anything, and I find that very frustrating.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:57.120
Alright, well, yeah, so EA just basically saying if it makes money then we're going to go get some of that money. Yep, makes sense.

01:47:58.120 --> 01:47:59.120
DarkSaga!

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:09.120
Well this makes me super happy because Dan, first of all, super freaking loves the crap out of this game.

01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.120
And I super love the crap out of this game too, but not to the extent that Dan does.

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:22.120
Natsume is rebooting an old SNES game called Wild Guns for Playstation 4.

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:35.120
The original Wild Guns came out in 1994 and it had a shooting gallery style of gameplay with these,

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:43.120
well I guess the only good word to describe it is anachronistic weapons, so just things that didn't belong at that time.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:52.120
But now Natsume is going to be working on Wild Guns Reloaded and they're bringing back the original characters, Clint and Annie.

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.120
And who knows, we might have some more characters, but they're going to be revealing something at E3.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.120
I mean, how many of you guys remember this game?

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.120
Wild Guns? I don't think I ever played it. Yeah, I never played it.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:09.120
I didn't. It was good. I mean, there were better games, but it was good.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:15.120
I knew you'd be into this when you heard about this though, because I figured this was a game that was more up your alley.

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.120
Well, it's an actual classic as opposed to Halo.

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.120
Stop. Stopeianchat says, I haven't played the first, but looking forward to the new Wild Guns.

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.120
Yeah.

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.120
Alright. Well, moving on. Loki.

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.120
Alright.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:38.120
You know, I want to say I think I played Wild Guns at the arcade a long time ago.

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:46.120
You know, something that actually is kind of interesting, and I hate reading this news because I so wanted them to fail with this,

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:55.120
but apparently Konami has had profits go up since they decided to not make console games anymore.

01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:05.120
And yeah, I mean, I guess that's cool. They're saying that the mobile and fitness revenue has gone down 2.8%,

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:12.120
and I guess Pachinko fell 17.8%, but the gambling division climbed to 1.4%.

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.120
I'm trying to see where they're making up all their money.

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:23.120
Company-wide though, the revenue is up 14.6%, and with a major jump in operating income.

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:32.120
So don't expect console stuff from Konami in the future. What about, how does Metal Gear Solid 5 play into that?

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:38.120
Yeah, I kind of wondered that as well, and they're saying, you know, despite the successes in fiscal year 2016,

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120
Konami expects revenues to decline in the new year.

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:48.120
So I want to see, is that like, could they be up because of like, you know, Metal Gear Solid 5?

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:57.120
I mean, are they talking about that they're down as far as operating costs because they don't have to pay for the development of Metal Gear Solid 5?

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:01.120
Well, yes. Yes, actually, I'm pretty sure is part of it.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:08.120
I don't know. I'm not a financial analyst, but we'll see. We'll see how they actually do in the long term,

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.120
because right now, I mean, it's too early, I think, to see.

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:17.120
And especially when they're talking about, you know, that their mobile and fitness and Pachinko has gone down,

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:20.120
that doesn't sound good if that's all you're going to be relying on.

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:27.120
So we'll see what happens from Konami in the next year, but it doesn't seem like they're going to really be developing a whole lot of games.

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:32.120
Although, I mean, we talked about one last week. It was a small one, but it was like that Japanese, you know, board game.

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:38.120
So there's little things here and there, but it's just, it's not going to be what it was. Those days are gone.

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:42.120
Could you maybe license out Dance Dance Revolution to somebody else?

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:45.120
Dream on. Dream on.

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.120
All right, well, hey, I know a lot of you guys are looking forward to Overwatch.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.120
Overwatch is going to be coming out at the end of the month on May 24th, but don't cheat.

01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:01.120
Don't be a dick and cheat at Overwatch. And there is no single player mode in Overwatch, which, you know, I have my issues with.

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:05.120
So if you're cheating in the game, you're really only doing it to hurt other people.

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:10.120
And so Blizzard is going to fuck you up if you try to cheat in Overwatch.

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:15.120
A community manager for Blizzard actually posted on the Battle.net forum saying, quote,

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:21.120
If a player is found to be cheating or using hacks, bots, or third-party software that provides any sort of unfair advantage,

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.120
that player will be permanently banned from the game. Full stop.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:29.120
Not only does cheating undermine the spirit of fair play that all of our products are based on,

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.120
but it works to diminish the fun and enjoyment of others.

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.120
This goes on to say, basically, first-time offenders will be permanently banned.

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.120
There's not going to be a cheater island or anything like that.

01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.120
Not even going to be a temporary ban. Just buy.

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:50.120
Which is going to be very interesting considering if they ban you from Overwatch, you just spent $60 on a turd,

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:54.120
because there is, again, no single player campaign.

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.120
So you will have nothing left to play if you get banned from Overwatch.

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.120
So I'm really waiting to see how this whole,

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:06.120
Oh, that was my little brother that played on my account that did that and got me banned.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.120
Please unban me. Although, honestly, my response would be,

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.120
Well, you shouldn't have let your little brother play on the fucking game then.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.120
But you know people are going to be, quote, unquote, falsely banned,

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.120
and this could come back to bite Blizzard.

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.120
So I wonder how strong they're really going to be.

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:29.120
But we'll see. They're saying they're going to ban them the first time, but I don't know.

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.120
We'll see.

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.120
You wouldn't cheat at Overwatch online, would you, Loki?

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.120
I know sometimes you use hacks and mods, but you wouldn't use it in Overwatch, would you?

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120
I wouldn't even play Overwatch again.

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.120
I guess that works.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.120
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:49.120
Every week you guys send us emails over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:56.120
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and she will pull out some emails to read here.

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.120
Or one.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.120
Just one email to read live on here?

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.120
Just one.

01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.120
Alright, well let's get to tonight's emails.

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.120
First one and only one. Hi, OLR.

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:19.120
I recently enjoyed your gaming stories about your mothers and grandparents in the Mother's Day episode and just wanted to share my own.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.120
This is about my grandmother.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:26.120
She was the big gamer and the one who got myself and my sister into gaming.

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:32.120
I remember summer days when school was out and Grandma would just watch us while my parents were at work during the day.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:34.120
She had the NES, the SNES, and the Sega Genesis.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:40.120
When it was too hot and humid to play outside, she would let us sit on her bed and we would all take turns playing the game systems.

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:42.120
She had basically every game you could dream of.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.120
She bought my sister and I the N64 when it came out.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.120
She had an ulterior motive. She wanted to play Yoshi's Story.

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.120
And I will always cherish the memories of sitting in her room on rainy days watching her play Echo the Dolphin.

01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:01.120
When she passed away my freshman year of high school, I couldn't bring myself to game for two years.

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.120
Final Fantasy X and some time to heal finally pulled me back into the gaming hobby.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:11.120
And I came to realize how much I could honor her memory just by doing this thing we both love so much.

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:17.120
She left my sister and I, bad grammar, sister and me, the SNES and Genesis.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:23.120
All her save files were still there and all her manuals had level codes written in the back under the notes.

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:26.120
And we could hear her in our minds saying, don't mess with my save.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.120
That's lovely.

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:35.120
So much from my mom in gaming. She had a Game Boy and played so much Tetris. So. Much.

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.120
Thanks so much for making my Monday mornings at work so much more bearable, Megan.

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.120
Or I think I'm Megantron on your forums.

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.120
Well, thank you, Megantron, for the email. I appreciate you sharing the story.

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.120
And I give everyone crap for bad grammar, so don't worry about it.

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:52.120
And Akuma JP in our chat says, wow, cool grandma.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.120
Seriously.

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.120
Agreed.

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:58.120
Mine would be like, Jamie, turn that down. I'm trying to read the Bible.

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.120
Something like that anyway. I don't know.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:10.120
All right. Well, if you want to email us some cool stories, do it. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.120
In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:43.120
FU to a particular intersection and a particular camera that lies

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.120
lies. I'm an L.A. lies. Video doesn't lie.

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.120
What?

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120
Take video.

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.120
There's no video attached to mine.

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.120
They usually do. Lies.

01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:02.120
That's my story and I'm sticking to it. So I got to go stick it to the man tomorrow.

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.120
Maybe he likes getting sick. I don't know.

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.120
Loki.

01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:10.120
Yeah, because I see like I got one of those two making a right turn.

01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:13.120
I'm like, ah, you know, I stopped in time.

01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:15.120
Were they going to link to the vehicle?

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.120
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.120
Enough of that.

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:25.120
I guess just F.U. to do my headache right now and, you know, in general F.U.

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:31.120
I really I don't understand why they can't carry Android gaming consoles or controllers.

01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:36.120
I mean, not like just even as a supply and demand thing.

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:44.120
I mean, you'd think that if like you pass by, for example, that sells both the phones and tablets and the Samsung Gear VR,

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:50.120
you think that they would want to carry a controller that because a lot of the games do use especially Minecraft,

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:54.120
which my fucking God is like one of the biggest games out there that requires a controller.

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:56.120
You're reiterating everything you said.

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:02.120
I understand that. I'm just saying I don't I don't understand why they don't just this is something we don't care.

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:04.120
You're still mad two hours later.

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.120
You do want me to come into your store, right? Because that's the only reason I was coming in there.

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.120
All right. My F.U. of the week goes to the fact that the weekend wasn't long enough.

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.120
I went to San Francisco recently yesterday to see a friend that was missing from Hawaii.

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.120
And it's like, oh, my God, the night just like flew by like we got into the city at like five.

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.120
And then like I turn around and it's nine o'clock like already it's crazy.

01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:28.120
So, yeah, the weekend just flew by.

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.120
But I'm actually thankful because I took Friday off.

01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:35.120
Why?

01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.120
Because I can go ride that new Mass Effect ride.

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.120
And I'm hoping that it's so good.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.120
Jamie will go back.

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.120
They won't let me get off on Friday.

01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.120
Don't. Well, we're going to we'll go another time.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.120
Saturday.

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.120
All right. I'll go back the next day.

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:54.120
Exactly. But I'm very excited.

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.120
So on the next episode of the show, I'll be able to tell you all how that was.

01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.120
Oh, shoot. Next Saturday.

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:01.120
What?

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:03.120
I'm going shopping for makeup.

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:04.120
Oh, gee.

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:06.120
No, no, no. Not just any makeup.

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.120
Not not just any makeup.

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:14.120
I'm going to this place in an old Sacramento called Evangeline's Closet Man.

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.120
Yeah, I know that costume and costume mansion.

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.120
Yeah. Why does he closet?

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.120
Tell everybody where you're going to be so the fans can find you.

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:27.120
I'm going to be buying my makeup for my very first drag cosplay.

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.120
Fun.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.120
And it's specifically drag cosplay.

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.120
OK, because this is something you're doing for GamerX.

01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.120
It is. All right.

01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.120
Oh, I know what you're doing, too. It'll be fun.

01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:40.120
Yeah. Yeah. So but I've got to Jamie does elaborate cosplay.

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:42.120
She doesn't like she doesn't do it.

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:44.120
I don't fuck around.

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:50.120
Fair enough. And from here forward, I've decided that all of my cosplays are not going to be conventional.

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.120
And just for the record, I am not cosplaying when I go to Green America to ride the ride.

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.120
But I will wear the hat and I'll have the red beard.

01:59:58.120 --> 01:59:59.120
So like, I'll be casual Joker.

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:01.120
OK, you'll be Joker's day off, is it?

02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:03.120
You'll be shore leave Joker.

02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:07.120
And that's exactly what it is to shore leave Joker, shore leave Joker.

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.120
So there you go.

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:23.120
All right. I would I would love to do a nice little video like Bobby does, because, you know, Bobby takes a road trip and suddenly there's a Tesla road trip video on Vogue that people are finding and commenting on, which, by the way, he just recently did one, if you didn't know.

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:30.120
And it's it's cool. Like, if you like to see parts of America that you might actually not drive on yourself someday, these videos are a lot of fun.

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:33.120
And he talks about some of the little Easter eggs and stuff in the Tesla.

02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:35.120
So he he just put one of those videos on Vogue Network.

02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:41.120
If I had the kind of camera he had, I would just I don't think they'll let you film the ride because it is a movie.

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:43.120
But you could see the show building.

02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:45.120
You could see the queue.

02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.120
You could see if they have any characters.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:56.120
Like, I would try to get you an immediate reaction. I try to show you everything but the actual movie itself, which is probably illegal to film, although it'll probably turn up on YouTube soon enough anyway.

02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.120
But yeah, I don't have those same toys, sadly.

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:09.120
Bobby Blackwolf, though, says if I use my phone camera and send him the files, maybe maybe we can work something out.

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.120
We'll try to I'll see what I can do.

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:13.120
All right.

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.120
There we go. So that's it for the FUs of the Week. Let's go on to Loki.

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:27.120
All right. So Capcom has promised that they're going to be giving their games a little bit more polished time.

02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:29.120
They're not in a hurry to release them.

02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:36.120
Apparently, you know, Street Fighter V was plagued with a number of issues and they promised that they're not going to do that again.

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.120
They're going to give it more time.

02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:45.120
It's trying to release the game so that it can make it for fighting game tournaments and get some extra money out.

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:47.120
I don't know.

02:01:48.120 --> 02:02:00.120
They say this now, but then, you know, I want to say that both PlayStation and Xbox have talked about having those early access type games available.

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.120
So it makes me wonder if they're not just going to release this shit anyways.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:08.120
And they also promise this now, but doesn't mean that that shit's not going to come out un-bolish anyways.

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.120
Act. Or Ubisoft. Looking at you.

02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:25.120
You know, I don't know if this is true or not, but there was a story float around the interwebs this week that, um, Pokken Tournament has sold more than Street Fighter V has at this point.

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.120
Now, that strikes me as one of those, like, Facebook memes that isn't really true.

02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:32.120
But I just thought I'd throw that out there because I see that float around everywhere.

02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:38.120
And it's one of those things where it's like, I kind of could see it. Like, it does make sense.

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.120
But I don't know. I really need to see the cold hard facts first.

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:45.120
Let's see here.

02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:48.120
This is apparently early April NPD numbers. Or something.

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.120
Early April. Well, they don't have numbers anymore. They just have ranks.

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.120
Because they don't give out the full breakdowns of those anymore.

02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.120
Interesting.

02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.120
They just do, like, here's the top ten selling games of whatever.

02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:09.120
Somebody tweeted it. But it would, for the month of April, it wouldn't matter anyway because Pokken came out a month before.

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:14.120
So you're not going to be able to see, like, it's not going to be the same month.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:18.120
Well, you should see, like, we'll see right now. Let's take a look.

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.120
Alright, alright.

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:24.120
So, April. Okay, so the global top sellers. Let's see here.

02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.120
I don't even see Pokken on there. Was this in all regions or were they just talking about US?

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:34.120
I don't know.

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:41.120
Let's look at US. Okay, that's... I need more than just the top ten here.

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.120
Let me dig and see what I can find.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.120
Alright, fair enough.

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:52.120
Okay, so meanwhile, I'm surprised you didn't do this one Dark Sakura, but I guess we saved this one for the very, very end.

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.120
We saved the best for last Dark Sakura.

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:59.120
And that is that the Five Nights at Freddy's series is getting remade for consoles.

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.120
That's right, you can poop your pants all over again playing Five Nights at Freddy's, but this time on consoles.

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:10.120
Just wait for the avalanche of Let's Play videos on the PlayStation 4.

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:15.120
Not that I'm one to make fun because that was probably the last Let's Play I did, was Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:22.120
So, yeah, the original Five Nights at Freddy's games, Scott Cawthon has said on the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Steam forum,

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:29.120
Yes, it will happen. I'm talking with a few companies who are interested in doing console remakes of the original games.

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:35.120
Assuming that original games means no Five Nights at Freddy's World, but I don't think anyone's gonna miss that.

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:37.120
So, there you go.

02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:45.120
Remember, Five Nights was made in Clickteam Fusion and it's not exactly something you can just, it's not like Unity where you can just pretty easily port it over to the consoles.

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:48.120
So, they may have to rebuild these games.

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:53.120
So, you may not get the exact same Five Nights games that we had before.

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.120
So, these are looking to be maybe a full-on remake.

02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:00.120
I wonder if a company isn't just gonna make one giant game that's all four games kind of in one.

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:03.120
I wouldn't doubt that that's gonna end up being the thing, but we'll see.

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:11.120
We'll see. Possible E3 announcement? Wouldn't Sony or Microsoft love to say that they got that one? Coming out this Halloween?

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.120
We'll see.

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.120
We will see. Alright. That is it for Stories tonight.

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:26.120
So, let's go to our Skypline 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:31.120
And while we wait for the Skypline ring, we can do some last minute stories.

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:34.120
I don't know if you have any, Loki. I know I got one real quick.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:36.120
I am still looking at the chart.

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.120
Oh, you're still trying to figure out that whole chart thing?

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:46.120
Well, Alan had actually sent me this one that he talked to me about, and I forgot to mention this earlier in the show, but we were kind of laughing about this the other night.

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:55.120
EA was on a phone call with investors this week and said that they are making an action game, that they have an action game in the works.

02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:01.120
And I guess it's supposed to be an Assassin's Creed style game, which is interesting because that's an Ubisoft game.

02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:09.120
But EA is doing it, and it is slated for fiscal year 2020 or 2021.

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:11.120
Who cares at this point?

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:17.120
So, we're talking about games that are four to five years out already.

02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:26.120
Well, I mean, we kind of laugh and all that, but at the same time, dude, high definition games and all that, they take a long time to make sometimes.

02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:33.120
And, you know, it's an interesting follow up to your whole fact that Capcom is saying they need to spend more time on the development cycle and so forth.

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:40.120
That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm spending more time on my development cycle, which is why I don't have any progress whatsoever on my game.

02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:49.120
Alan Acme in chat says, why talk about it? Who cares? I guess the investors, I guess investors want to know. We got plans to keep us fiscally...

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:54.120
We got first person shooter game coming out in five years. Whoa, that's totally unique.

02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:00.120
William Murderface says, that is the same year we will finally see Kingdom Hearts 3.

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:06.120
Sadly true. Very, very, very true.

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:11.120
Alright, so we'll have that to look forward to, I guess.

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:18.120
They could show the trailer for this mysterious game and then release it in five years. I mean, shit, look at Final Fantasy XV.

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:26.120
When was that first shown? Is Final Fantasy XIII vs. 2004? I don't remember. It was a while ago.

02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:33.120
Anyway, again, 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:38.120
Meanwhile, Loki, are you alright over there? No, IRC keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. It's annoying.

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.120
Well, that's not nice.

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:52.120
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, hey, there's that movie with John Malkovich where they said they released the trailer and said it wasn't going to be shown until 2115.

02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:59.120
Yeah, but you expect that at an art film. That type of thing is going to happen.

02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:07.120
Although, hey, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't they have their releases calendared through at least, like what, 2019 at least, right?

02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:13.120
If not 2020. How far does the Marvel schedule go out? At least 2019.

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:18.120
It's not that far. I mean, I guess, yeah, 2019 is not that far, all things considered.

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:29.120
Yeah, the rumor is Street Fighter V sold 670,000 units and Pokken Tournament was 680,000.

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:37.120
But they're saying, you know, that's what VG charts says. I looked at VG charts, they don't have numbers for those.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.120
So I, that's a whole load of shit.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:47.120
That's what, when I read that, I'm kind of like, I'm taking it with a grain of salt. Not that I think it's impossible and can't be true, but it just, it does seem kind of steep.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:53.120
And they're saying that's just on PlayStation 4, you know, so if you add the PC numbers, that puts it over your Pokken Tournament.

02:08:54.120 --> 02:09:00.120
And I, that seems awfully high for Pokken Tournament too, to be honest. I just don't see it selling that well.

02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:09.120
Alan Alchemy pointing out to my Marvel example, yes, the Marvel and DC timelines go to 2020 and 2021, but we know their names and logos already.

02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:14.120
Even though, you know, that is a difference. This EA thing, we don't even know that.

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:26.120
SHO 100 Matt is pointing out some random Bimani DDR news. Apparently a few classic licensed DDR songs are going to be removed from DDR A, according to Bimani style, and then links us to the story.

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:37.120
Yeah, I heard about that. Dark Tetsuya had posted somewhere about that. And yeah, I read like some of the, some of the old DDR songs, like If You Were Here With Me and what, Bad Girls, all this stuff that's like licensed.

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:47.120
Well, not all of it, but a big chunk of like licensed classic songs. I'm assuming the license just kind of ran out. So that's why those are going away, I suppose.

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:55.120
All right. I'll put out one more call for calls 1-877-GMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:03.120
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I just looked it up here at the individual tiles and that's where they're showing. I, it's still, I don't, I'm not buying it.

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:09.120
And also I don't know if these are complete figures because that's not, I don't know if this is including digital sales as well.

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:11.120
So there's a lot of stuff that we don't know.

02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:20.120
Well, good for you fact checking before you just reblog it or re Tumblr it or, or what do they call it on Facebook? Share it.

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:29.120
Here you go. All right. Well, the phones, the phones are not lining up tonight. People are, people are being shy or I, I know Rama's not in chat.

02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.120
So some of our, I don't think I see ActDeaf either. So I think some of our frequent callers are away tonight. Are they Game of Thrones fans?

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:37.120
Yeah, that's on tonight.

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:39.120
Sharing of swords.

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:45.120
I guess. All right. Well, that's going to do it. I guess, I guess we're a little early, but I'm not going to drag the show out. We're done with the news and everything.

02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:51.120
So that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show and sticking with us.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:56.120
Hope we were able to entertain you either on Sunday night or Monday or whenever throughout the week you listen to this.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:01.120
And thank you, by the way, for checking out OLR. Thank you for spending some of your week with us. We appreciate it.

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.120
Hey, we don't ask for your money. All we ask, help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show.

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:13.120
Spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio, because as you can see, if we don't get some of your friends here, nobody's going to call us.

02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.120
This was kind of cool. One thing, one last-minute story.

02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:22.120
We didn't mention it. There's a new Dreamcast game that's being developed.

02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.120
Xenocider is a game that they're developing right now for PC, 3DS, and Dreamcast.

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:29.120
And Dreamcast?

02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.120
And it's a similar game to like Sin and Punishment. It's an on-rails shooter game.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:34.120
And Dreamcast?

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:35.120
And Dreamcast.

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:40.120
I love that they're still making Dreamcast games in 2016. That warms my cold, black little heart.

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.120
Alright, I need to get out my Dreamcast, play some Space Channel 5 and then some NES emulators.

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:47.120
Let's do some Power Stone.

02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:49.120
Good times.

02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:51.120
Powerful!

02:11:52.120 --> 02:12:02.120
Alright, well, that is really going to wrap it up. I already gave you the spiel about telling a friend or five about the show, but I didn't say a nice five-star rating on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast goes a long way.

02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:05.120
We're going to go around and give everybody's final thought for the night.

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:07.120
Dark Soccer, you get to go have cheesecake early.

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.120
I'm going to get some cheesecake.

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.120
Final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:20.120
Um. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh.

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.120
I think you broke. We broke Dark Soccer, everybody.

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:30.120
My final thought for the night is I am looking forward to Mass Effect and roller coasters on Friday.

02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:35.120
And Bobby has worked out a plan where, yes, we can do video. Bobby Black Wolf saves the day.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.120
I don't like to say that a lot. I'm not going to say that phrase a lot on the show, but it's true in this case for sure.

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:42.120
Uh, Loki, your final thought?

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:44.120
Maybe I'll work on my game tonight.

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:46.120
You say that every week.

02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.120
Maybe I'll go learn to skydive tonight.

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:52.120
Don't do it, Lodi.

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:57.120
Skydiving is really not that hard. You just kind of let gravity take you and not die.

02:12:58.120 --> 02:12:59.120
I hope you don't have holes in your parachute.

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:03.120
Especially the indoor skydiving. They have a new thing in Roseville, like indoor skydiving.

02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:05.120
They do in Roseville?

02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:07.120
I would do that shit.

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.120
Oh well, our team building day, you guys. Let's all go indoor skydiving.

02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.120
And then we'll film it. That could be another thing that I'll film and send to Bobby.

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:18.120
Guess what? I'm going to fill up your inbox, Bobby.

02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:21.120
Indoor skydiving. That'll be fun.

02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.120
Alright. Look forward to it.

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.120
In the meantime, happy gaming, you guys. Whatever you're going to play this week, whether it's Doom or catching up on your backlog.

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.120
Have a great week and we will see you in seven days, hopefully with some more guests in the studio as well.

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.120
Looking forward to another fun OLR next week.

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:37.120
Thanks for listening. See you next time.

02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:05.120
You may not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:09.120
See you next week.

02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:40.120
See you next time.
