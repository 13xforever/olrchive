Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,620
This week EA and BioWare are continuing the drip of Mass Effect Andromeda news and they've

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,160
confirmed that we will see more at E3 which is now less than one month away.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,600
There's more news on things that will be in our hands before 2017 and we'll tell you about

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,520
them right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,520
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 641

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,320
for this May the 15th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento,

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,120
California. You might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me are my co-hosts.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Here with me every week, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm not a happy bunny anymore, am I?

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm like the spiteful leftover from Mary Kay Makeup Testing Factory bunny.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,120
For like the first four years of the show I think I used to introduce you as like the

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,120
happiest bunny on the farm or something like that. That was when you were obsessed with

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,120
the little happy bunny cartoons. I think I still see them on Hot Topic once in a while.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,120
They're not funny anymore. They just got mean.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,120
And they ran out. I think they just ran out of good ideas at some point.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Yeah, but I feel kind of too crusty to be a happy bunny anyway.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,120
You're getting a little too, I don't want to say too old, but too...

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Jaded.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Jaded, I think is a good way to put it.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
You know what I am? I'm cynical.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Yes. Although, you are certainly a happy bunny, and I don't want to spend too much time on

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,120
this because it's a video game show, but you are certainly a happy bunny on Friday night.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Dark Soccer and I don't get to hang out a lot a lot outside the show just because of

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,120
our conflicting schedules, but we went out to the club on Friday with Alan. We went to

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,120
go see drag queens because you know Jamie and I love drag queens. So we went and saw

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,120
like the drag queen of the now, Kim Chi. It was a lot of fun.

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,120
I have to fan myself now. I literally just pulled out my fan because oh my god. And like

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
she gave me this big bear hug.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Yeah. I was going to ask her what her favorite Pokemon was because that's what I asked

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Trixie when I met her. But I just, you know, in the moment you forget things.

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Well, I had spent like most of the afternoon trying to memorize how to say thank you in

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Korean, which now I haven't memorized. But I said that she's like, Oh my God, thank you.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,120
And let me sneak out my phone for a selfie. And then we and then like right before I left,

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
she just says, just gives me this huge hug.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm like, Oh, she's such a sweetheart.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,120
She's a sweetheart. So you were a very happy bunny on Friday.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
I was. I've been touched by greatness.

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
All right. Also here in studio, someone who could care less about all these drag queens

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
say hello to tech master Loki.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,120
I don't have any sort of opinion.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Just neutral. Just very neutral. That's fine.

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,120
If he could care less than he could care less. Anyway, he couldn't care less.

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,120
How are you doing, Loki? Do you have a good week?

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
All right.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Yeah. So last week, you hurt some of our listeners like physically when you started screaming.

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Come on. How many years have you been listening to this show?

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
You don't know what you're in for. I mean, seriously,

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm keeping my finger near his volume slider just in case because I'm about to ask this.

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,120
But I notice in studio tonight you brought in you bought yourself this flashback console.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,120
I can see through the bag. Yeah, because no one sells Android Bluetooth gaming controllers.

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Yes, I could get extremely angry about that. But I have food today that was a somewhat

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,120
try to absorb some of Jamie's happiness. Try to just promise like an end.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,120
And I complained about it on Twitter because that's kind of like teasing the show type thing.

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,120
But, you know, active said, you know, we told you that last week, you know, you should just order it online.

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Yes, I know perfectly well that I can get it online.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,120
This I feel like this is becoming a thing for you, like this is the dude who won't stop and ask for directions.

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,120
No, it's not that I won't ask for directions. It's listen.

62
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Oculus is trying to be a gaming platform.

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
OK, you want me to take this platform seriously?

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
So the Gear VR, which is, you know, I think it's a pretty great device.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,120
And now it has Minecraft for which is really major.

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,120
I mean, you Minecraft on VR is awesome.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,120
You sell these devices in stores with the phones.

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,120
So I, you know, theoretically, I could go there, purchase a phone, purchase a Gear VR,

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,120
but I can't play Minecraft because they don't sell the controllers.

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Is it something because I feel like a lot of the listeners are going, you are literally crazy, Loki.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,120
And yes, I said literally because people don't have problems in their areas.

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
It seems like it seems like something like this weird, like it's like local or something that you have.

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Do you just think about maybe just driving a Reno?

74
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
No, I'm not wasting time driving the Reno.

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,120
You can go have Steak and Shake in Reno. It's never a waste.

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,120
But no, seriously, I've been to almost all the major retailers around here.

77
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,120
I went to Fry's today. I went to even Toys R Us is where I got this.

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:28,120
But Fry's like electronic store that literally carries everything like things that you don't even know you need.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
They have it there. They have everything.

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,120
But they don't have one single goddamn controller for an Android or even iPhone device.

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I mean, they carry a billion different iPhone case covers and headphones and all the stuff,

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,120
but not one, millions of different tablets, but not one of them.

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Like somebody out leaning in towards the volume slider.

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Somebody out there has to like seriously have some sort of inkling of wanting to play a game with a game, you know, gaming controller.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Honestly, if Oculus and Samsung want me to take this platform seriously, it's like going to the store and saying,

86
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
okay, I'm gonna go purchase an Xbox One. Oh, but I'm sorry, they don't sell the controllers at the store.

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,120
You can order those online. If I'm going online to order something, I'm not going to your store.

88
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,120
You're trying to get me into the store. Best Buy is like terrible at this.

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
They're selling these in their own store.

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
But yet they do not have a gaming controller for which half the games use.

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
It's like, does it make any sense? It boggles my mind.

92
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:41,120
All right. We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,120
And if you are listening live, you can participate with the show in our chat room live.vognetwork.com

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,120
where SSG100Matt says, this is Loki's white whale. He won't give up.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Just like winning the DeLorean or building an arcade machine.

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,120
He'll never give up trying to buy a controller in a retail store. Yes.

97
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
No, it's seriously like I think it's a terrible excuse.

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,120
I mean, let's look at this way. GameStop. I went to GameStop and that was one of the first places I went to because, you know, they should have controllers.

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,120
They carry Android devices. It makes sense that they should have that.

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,120
I went there and they're like, sorry, we don't carry it, but we carry it on our website.

101
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,120
So you're telling me you have this in a warehouse somewhere. You get regular shipments from that warehouse.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,120
They can't throw a controller into that package and send it to your store.

103
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,120
They want me to go online to order from their website, which I won't go to their website to order it. I'll go to a different website.

104
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,120
SSG100Matt, he won't admit it, but you're absolutely right.

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,120
StopianChat says, the world too. Loki zero.

106
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Alan Alchemy trying to remind you of happier times based on some things you were posting on social media.

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Loki is full of Brazilian cooked meats that were fed to him for hours. That is something that happened.

108
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120
It wasn't hours. I got full after 30 minutes because I didn't pace myself long enough.

109
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
And I had too much pizza earlier in the day, so it just...

110
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,120
No, never eat. If you know you're going to the Brazilian grill, you starve yourself for three days in advance.

111
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
You have like a granola bar.

112
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,120
I could have, but my body digested extremely quickly. So like, had I known that, I would have just sat there a little longer.

113
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,120
We ran out of time. I knew we had to pick up the kids because, you know, they have to go to bed at some point.

114
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,120
But it was good. I also pet a cow, so there's that.

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
You pet a cow.

116
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I pet a baby cow.

117
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Congrats. That's an accomplishment.

118
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
And then like an hour later, I went and ate a hamburger.

119
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
That's farm the fork right there.

120
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Not if it wasn't the cow you just pet.

121
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
That's true, but it's symbolic.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Because, well, you know, in a similar thing, my aunt and uncle raised pigs for a living.

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:54,120
When the swine flu went around, my uncle was on the news saying, don't stop eating pork, it's safe, and that whole thing, right?

124
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,120
And I remember like as kids, we used to go to where they lived, the farm or whatever, and we would go pet the baby pigs and all that.

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,120
And then we would come in the house and there would be like ham dinner, bacon, like everything.

126
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,120
And like it didn't hit me when I was younger until like I hit a certain age where I kind of look back on it.

127
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,120
And I went, that was like incredibly fucked up.

128
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I had to take my son to like a field trip. They took it to a farm, which is awesome because that farm had portals that no one can access until October.

129
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Because the farm's not open to the public until October.

130
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Anyways, so.

131
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Did you get keys? We need to anchor fields off of them.

132
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Keys, yes. So anyways, they had a bunch of baby animals for the kids to pet, and all the kids were like super excited, myself included, to pet the animals.

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
And my son's like, I'm not touching those dirty animals.

134
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I mean seriously, that's what he says, he's like, I'm not touching them. I'm like, why aren't you petting the animals?

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
He's like, they're dirty and germy.

136
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I'm like, that is my wife.

137
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:57,120
You are channeling my wife right there. In fact, it's funny, like I mentioned, I'm like, yeah, he didn't want to pet any of the animals.

138
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,120
And she's like, yeah, because they're dirty and germy.

139
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,120
And I asked him, so why isn't they even petting the animals? Because they're dirty and germy. I'm like, where'd you learn that one?

140
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
What have you done to him?

141
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,120
SSG100Matt says, Loki taking his kids to fun places for portals. Yeah, I wondered why you volunteered for that trip.

142
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Now I know.

143
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I volunteered for all of his field trips.

144
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
No, that's true. He does.

145
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I missed the one in downtown Sacramento because that would have been nice.

146
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:30,120
All right. Let's get into video games. It's what you guys are here to hear about, not just farm to fork and all this other stuff.

147
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,120
We want to talk about video games. We usually do a kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

148
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,120
I want to ask a little bit about this because, you know, and I got into this just a tiny bit on Bobby's show,

149
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,120
because you were talking about like upcoming games we're going to play and all that stuff.

150
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
And we're kind of getting into a period of the year that's going to get a little bit slower.

151
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
I mean, yes, I know Overwatch is coming out and I know there's some big games.

152
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,120
I know a big game just came out this week and we'll talk about that in a minute.

153
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,120
But for all practical purposes, things are starting to slow down a little bit until we at least, you know,

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,120
hit E3 when we're going to get whatever surprises out of E3.

155
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
And then the holiday period is when things will ramp up again.

156
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,120
So now seems like a really good time to catch up on gaming backlogs.

157
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
So I post this to all of you in the chat room.

158
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,120
And those of you here in studio as well, over the next, you know, six months, let's say,

159
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
until the holidays get here in full force.

160
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,120
What is the game that you feel like you've been putting off way too long that you need to play already?

161
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,120
For example, if this was like three years ago, Mass Effect would have been a great answer for Jamie.

162
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
But now that she's played it, we'll have to think of a new answer.

163
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
So what is the game in your backlog that you really need?

164
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,120
And I realize Loki might have like 400 games in his Steam library that is his backlog.

165
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
But I want to know, like, what's the game?

166
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Four hundred and sixty-something games.

167
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,120
What's the one game you really need to make a point to play?

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
And it might not even be a game from this year.

169
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
This could be a game from like four years ago, five years ago, just something where it's like,

170
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I need to shut up and play this game.

171
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Uh, Darcyra?

172
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
I still need to finish Link Between Worlds.

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Oh, that's a good one on the 3DS.

174
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:12,120
I'm just looking at my list on here. I have, like, Lift Razors on here and Never Alone, which I really wanted to play.

175
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Um, Nihalumbra. I'm actually looking at my list right now.

176
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Okay, but you can't just read your whole list. What's the one game?

177
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
No, I'm picking the best of them.

178
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Um, I still need to finish The Shiva as well. It was a good game.

179
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,120
And, um, yeah, I just got a bunch of shit on here that I might have started or never finished.

180
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Um, I thought it would be great.

181
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Um, I apparently have The Witcher 2. I don't even remember buying that.

182
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
That happens all the time on Steam.

183
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Actually, The Witcher 3 would be a great answer for me, because I played, like, a little bit of it, but I never finished it.

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
And I think that's one I really need to sit my ass down and finish.

185
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Um, because, you know, everybody loved that game.

186
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
I was interested in it until I found out you couldn't play as a woman.

187
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I thought you did for a little bit.

188
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
I want to play the whole game as a woman.

189
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I thought it was, um, I mean-

190
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
I didn't think you could choose your gender.

191
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Uh, well, I think the character is not, like, it's not like Skyrim where the character, like, the character is based on, like, a book character.

192
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
So there's only, like, one imagining of it.

193
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
It's like, it's like a, it's like a third person as opposed to a first person.

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Yeah, but I still don't care. I didn't, that just sort of was a game breaker for me.

195
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
So.

196
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Okay. But you'll, you'll play Zelda even when you can't play a woman, right? I mean, I don't-

197
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Because it's a different kind of game.

198
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I know. Don't get me wrong. Like, I don't, because I totally understand that, yes, there needs to be more representation in games. I totally get that.

199
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,120
But at the same time, like, if your story is a book type story and stuff, like, sometimes in the narrative, you know, I agree.

200
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
But there should also be a game, like Witcher 3, where maybe that has a woman character.

201
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I think it was the concept of playing a male character with a romance option.

202
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Hmm.

203
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Because, I mean, I don't mind playing a female character with multiple romance options, but it just made it kind of uncomfortable for me because I can't put myself in the mindset.

204
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Hmm. Interesting.

205
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
So I didn't do it.

206
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Well, and I suppose at the same time, you can kind of look at a story and go, that's not a, that's not a book I want to read.

207
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
That happens.

208
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Maybe, maybe I will find the books and read those. See, it would be different reading the books, but playing a game that's supposed to be immersive.

209
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah.

210
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
That's different.

211
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Maybe that's a way, maybe that's a way to find out.

212
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Yeah.

213
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah. Okay. Cool.

214
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Uh, Loki, what about you? What's, what's something in your backlog where you're like, oh, I gotta play this.

215
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Well, I already, you know, tell you when I'm playing over the summer, it's going to be No Man's Sky.

216
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,120
So there isn't going to be touching any of the backlog. It's going to be No Man's Sky.

217
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Okay. But you got a good month before No Man's Sky. What is the, what is the game in your backlog you've got to catch up on?

218
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Well, I've already kind of started, uh, um, you know, mainly, I guess I'd be playing more Fallout 4 because the new expansion is coming out this week, I think.

219
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
So I'll be playing that.

220
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Alan could tell you all about that one.

221
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Yeah. So I'm playing that. I mean, I haven't really been playing too much of it lately. I haven't played any of the new expansion or new update, I guess, or DLC or whatever you want to call it.

222
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:17,120
And then they have the actual physical expansion that's going to be coming out, um, that I'm looking forward to playing, but I still haven't finished the game once yet.

223
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,120
So, I mean, and I'm, I don't even know how many hundreds of hours in the game. So I'll play that.

224
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,120
No, it's just stuff that's probably on my PlayStation 4. Not really Steam so much.

225
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I mean, I'm just purchasing games on there and just kind of throwing money away. I mean, even stuff that I have on console, like,

226
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,120
At least when it's Humble Bundle and you know a lot of it's going to charity.

227
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,120
No, this isn't even Humble Bundle. Like, last week, you know, during the show, I was like, man, my wife never lets me play on the TV. She's always watching her shows.

228
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,120
When she got into another Shonda Rhimes series, I'm like, ah, crap.

229
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,120
By the way, there's another one coming out on ABC this fall. There's yet another one. Like, didn't Shonda already have a whole entire night?

230
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Well, she has, like, this new series called How to Get Away with Murder or something like that.

231
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Oh, yeah.

232
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,120
She's like, yep, I'm going to be watching this. So I'm like, ah.

233
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,120
So I got entered into the Gungeon on PC now so I can actually play that.

234
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,120
It doesn't run that well on my PC, but whatever, it's enough. I'll play that.

235
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Okay. All right. For me, there's a lot of stuff in my backlog.

236
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I almost want to say, like, The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls are two games from PlayStation 3 that are on PlayStation 4 that I really need to play.

237
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,120
But I do think the game that most of all, like, I really need to sit down and play, which, not to say I don't need to play those two games because I still do,

238
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I really need to play Life is Strange. That's the one I really want to play.

239
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,120
No, you really need to play Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 5.

240
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
I do. I do.

241
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Grand Theft Auto 5.

242
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I need to play Grand Theft Auto 4.

243
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
No, just skip the 5.

244
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Just skip 4 and go to 5.

245
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
You don't really need to play 4.

246
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
What if I play Saints Row 4, which is on the Xbox One?

247
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
That's fine. Saints Row 4 is pretty good. You'd probably like that, actually. It's pretty funny.

248
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,120
I downloaded that as the free games of gold or whatever, and I haven't really played that yet.

249
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,120
I watched you play it, or maybe I saw Alan play some of it too, but I have not played it myself.

250
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
And I hear the opening is hilarious like it was in 3.

251
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,120
It's okay. The opening isn't as good as 3, I think. I don't know. It's all right.

252
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Stobby in chat is confirming skip to Grand Theft Auto 5.

253
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Kaijuto says, wow, 2016 and everyone is excited about playing old-ass games.

254
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Now, hold on, because this question was about backlogs.

255
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,120
I am playing new games and stuff, but there's...

256
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Again, unless you do gaming all day every day, you can't play everything.

257
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
You're going to miss something.

258
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,120
And, you know, contrary to popular belief, we don't do OLR for a living, and we don't make money off this show.

259
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,120
We don't make a dime off this show. In fact, we pay money to do it, which is fine.

260
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,120
We love the community and everything and the people that turn out for it and everything.

261
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
It's like a hobby.

262
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:03,120
But some people think that because this is what it is, like we can play games during the week all day.

263
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,120
No, we all got to work. We all got jobs, 40 hours or more.

264
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,120
So, yeah. But we play when we can, when we can.

265
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

266
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Some people talking about Shonda shows in chat now.

267
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,120
S2100matt says, I really want to buy Firewatch, but I'm forcing myself to at least play, beat five other games for my Steam library.

268
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:38,120
At least the thing about Firewatch, you can kind of beat that in like a night, or if you're a little slower like me, two or three nights tops.

269
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Firewatch is not a very long game. It's like, it's like sitting down to watch a really long movie.

270
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,120
So that's the good thing about Firewatch is that at least that's when you could beat quick.

271
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,120
It's, you know, it's another one of those games. It gets put in that, they call it walking simulator,

272
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,120
but I don't, I kind of feel like that genre title is meant to kind of demean that genre.

273
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,120
I don't really like it. It's more, I would say it's just more of a story heavy type of game.

274
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,120
It's just a first person adventure game.

275
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Yeah, something like that. I don't know. It's just, it's, you know, it's more of a very narrative driven type of game,

276
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
which, you know, Gone Home fits in that category, but that's definitely worth playing if you never have.

277
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Just, just, you know, at least one time play through the story. It's great.

278
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Although I worry it's, it's a little hyped up now all these years later, but I think it's worth your time.

279
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,120
I really think my, my absolute favorite and I've made no surprise or made no secret to this was everybody's gone to the rapture.

280
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,120
And I think that one just came out on PC. I want to say I read somewhere.

281
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:44,120
So I played it on PlayStation four, but somebody in chat named Tiger Claw told me to tune in.

282
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Well, thank you. And thank Tiger Claw said, I need to start on Rise of the Tomb Raider.

283
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,120
I bought it when it came out on Steam a few months ago, but never got around to it.

284
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,120
That's a really, yeah, you are correct. It's 20 bucks on Steam.

285
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Thank you. Appreciate that. And Rise of the Tomb Raider is also on my list.

286
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
And I feel really bad saying that, but that's true. I just, so many games.

287
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Stopy says, I need to finish Metro Last Light.

288
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Trying to look at a couple more here in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

289
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,120
S.G.O. 100 Matt says, I just beat Roundabout this week, which was a silly and fun game.

290
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
That game was one of those games that's like so stupid. It's kind of funny.

291
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
I have, that's something I haven't played that I haven't and I've played some of it.

292
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:30,120
I just haven't finished it. It's so stupid. But I say that in a John Waters movies are stupid and I love them type of way.

293
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Rob, you must play Danganronpa.

294
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Oh yeah. You and Shane both talk about that a lot. Shane especially. You know how he is.

295
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Well, you can blame me for that.

296
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,120
I do blame you and I blame him. I got plenty of blame to go around.

297
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,120
One of these days, but you've just heard like 800 hours.

298
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
I thought you Undertale and you played what, five seconds of it?

299
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
I played at least the beginning.

300
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Okay. Did you play Stardew Valley yet?

301
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
No one's bought it for me yet.

302
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Well, there we go. All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks.

303
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week instead of the ones that we still need to.

304
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Going around the room talking about what games we've been playing this week and what we thought. Dark Saga.

305
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I played like five seconds of Final Fantasy 14, which I'm still on the fence about going back to World of Warcraft,

306
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,120
especially since they gave out Warlords of Draenor for free.

307
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:36,120
So I nabbed that while I could. Words, making things, saying words.

308
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I played Danganronpa too. I played some at work because I wanted to show Shane the magical girl Usami mode.

309
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,120
And he's like, oh, that's so cute. But it sucks without a controller.

310
00:21:50,120 --> 00:22:00,120
And then I played some Animal Crossing, Happy Home Designer a little bit and Ingress, a ton of Ingress.

311
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,120
And I'm so close. I'm so close that a little bit more to the left and I'll be there.

312
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,120
That's the that's the that's when the real game begins.

313
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,120
And then. Oh, yeah, a little Heroes of Dragon Age, still me, Tomo.

314
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,120
So, yeah. All right. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

315
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:27,120
I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I played a little bit of Ingress. I did play Earth Defense Force 4.1.

316
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,120
So I played that a little bit last night, actually. I don't know. That was pretty much it.

317
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I mean, I haven't played a whole ton. I've thought about buying things. I've stopped myself from almost buying things.

318
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,120
And then I bought a ColecoVision flashback, which, funny enough, I'm looking at the games on the back here like a lot of these.

319
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't even remember some of these. I do. So I'm looking forward to playing those again.

320
00:22:51,120 --> 00:23:01,120
But some of these I'm like wondering if these are like independent games that someone made that they ported to the ColecoVision like they did with the Atari flashbacks and stuff.

321
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Because, like, I don't remember Mecha eight or anything like that.

322
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:14,120
But they have Bump and Jump and Jumpman Jr., so that's pretty awesome. I don't remember Ms. Space Fury.

323
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Well, I know those flashback consoles did have some, like, late homebrew type of stuff that came on them.

324
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Like, the Atari one definitely has, like, indie titles, basically, that were made after the fact that they include on there.

325
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,120
I like that they have Pepper Tookes. Sad that they don't have Mr. Do. Mr. Do is awesome.

326
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I thought Mr. Do was by Data East, so the rights to it are probably somewhere else.

327
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Like, I'm surprised, like, if it's something that old, it's like, dude, just license it. I mean, seriously, what the fuck are you doing with that property right now?

328
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Okay, it's like the Atari 2600 would be so much better if the Activision stuff could be included.

329
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Because Activision, you know, say what you will about the company now, but back in the 80s, you know, especially in the Atari age,

330
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,120
they were making games that many times were even better than what Atari was making themselves in-house.

331
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
It was really kind of the birth of the third-party game makers.

332
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,120
And so, you know, that's why Activision will usually do their own collections, basically.

333
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:20,120
But, you know, Atari did that Atari Vault recently on PC, which is on Steam, and it has the iPad, you know, and all that.

334
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,120
And there's a lot of great Atari games in there, but on the forums, it's just non-stop people bitching.

335
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Where's Pitfall? Where's Kaboom? Where's Keystone Capers or anything like that? Those are all Activision games.

336
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
They don't have the rights to them.

337
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I just don't understand why you wouldn't want to license this stuff out. It's like, why hold that stuff, like, get money?

338
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Well, because Activision did a shitty iPad thing of their own, I think, at some point.

339
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,120
But, you know, I don't know. It wasn't as good.

340
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Okay, I understand Activision, but, like, Data East. I mean, dude, Data East, what the hell are you doing with this stuff? Nothing.

341
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I want to say, on Xbox, they did something. Not like the ColecoVision, but some of their arcade titles.

342
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Like, I feel like Bad Dudes and all that sort of-

343
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Well, they had that on Wii. They had a collection on Wii.

344
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Was there? Okay.

345
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
There was a Data East collection, but-

346
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
That's right.

347
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I just don't understand why you wouldn't, like, you're sitting on those properties, like, shit, we're making nothing off of this.

348
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
You want to license it? Cool. Okay, money.

349
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Yeah.

350
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Alright, my gaming week. I played a lot of the same old standby stuff.

351
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,120
You know Final Fantasy XIV, can't get enough of that. Still playing Diablo III here and there as well.

352
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:38,120
But I did play a new game this week. On the PC, I think a lot of you were excited on Friday that Doom came out on the PC, as well as consoles.

353
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,120
I opted to get the PC version because I felt, alright, if I am going to play a first-person shooter, I think I'm going to do this with keyboard and mouse.

354
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Even though, I don't know, like, some days I feel like I'm better with controllers, some days I feel like I'm better with keyboard and mouse.

355
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,120
But I was like, okay, well the old-school Dooms I remember on PC, so somehow in my mind, it worked.

356
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,120
It justified and I said, alright, I'm going to get it on PC.

357
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,120
And if I wanted to do the controller thing, I can always play it on Steam Box.

358
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,120
And I think that's what really sold it for me, was that I would really be able to do both.

359
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,120
So I bought Doom, and although I haven't played a ton of it, so I can't tell you about, like, the entire game,

360
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I think I've played enough of it to get a pretty good sense of the game.

361
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I like the graphics, first off, are really good.

362
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Especially, you know, my computer, I had like a top-of-the-line computer two years ago, but it still runs Doom very, very well.

363
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
So I'm very happy for that. It looks great.

364
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,120
In fact, I don't even think I have the graphics turned all the way up.

365
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,120
I think it's just on whatever the defaults are, and some folks in chat are saying, you should turn it up to Ultra.

366
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,120
I'm like, alright, it's not on the GeForce Experience thing yet that tells you what's best for your cards.

367
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm kind of waiting for that. But I'll tinker with the settings later.

368
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
It looks good enough for me right now.

369
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I will say, I noticed the game is very fast-paced. That is one thing I noticed.

370
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:59,120
It's very fast, which is what I liked about the old PC games like Quake and Doom and stuff, was that they were always very fast.

371
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
And these games are definitely no different.

372
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,120
And I don't even play on a very difficult skill level.

373
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:15,120
I play on a pretty easy one because I'm not good at first-person shooters, even though I enjoy the occasional one, especially the old-school ones, which is what kind of possessed me to get Doom in the first place.

374
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,120
So they did change some things. You can upgrade the weapons now.

375
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,120
When you find things in the level, you might get weapon upgrades.

376
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
So for example, your shotgun, you could charge it with the right mouse button.

377
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
You can pick what type of charge you want it to do.

378
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Like the one I did, you charge it and it goes tick, tick, tick.

379
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,120
And then when you do your next blast, it does three rounds all at once, which is kind of awesome.

380
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Do all the old codes work?

381
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I doubt it. I haven't tried.

382
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Well, the ones to try, remember? IDDQD.

383
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Yeah, and then there was what? What's the one that lets you walk through walls?

384
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
IDQFA.

385
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
IDQFA. IDBFG.

386
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
IDBFG is to get the BFG.

387
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I hope that's in the game. It's gotta be. It's gotta be.

388
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,120
I mean, you still have blue key cards like you had in the old games. A lot of the weapons.

389
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,120
The suit that you wear, you see in the very beginning of the game is just like the old ones.

390
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,120
And you find these little, they look like little Funko toys.

391
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Little collectibles you find in the levels that are old Doom characters, basically.

392
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,120
So that's cool. I just can't believe I still remember all those codes.

393
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,120
The ones I don't remember are the level skip codes.

394
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Because I used to just skip right to the Castle Wolf and Steam levels.

395
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Bobby Black Wolf is reminding us of some of the good old codes.

396
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Black Wolf says IDCLP.

397
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
The wall one.

398
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Yeah, and IDSPISPOPD is the wall one.

399
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
So, nice.

400
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,120
So yeah, I'm enjoying Doom. I haven't really played the multiplayer yet.

401
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I played the beta a while ago, but I've just been trying to get through the single player campaign.

402
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,120
And I think if you like a really fast paced first person shooter, I think you're gonna enjoy Doom.

403
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
If you like the old games as well.

404
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,120
If you like something that was fast paced like Quake was back in the day and all that.

405
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
I think this is really right up the same alley.

406
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:06,120
And Alan Alchemy says there are also hidden doors that you can open that let you play in original Doom hallways but with new enemies.

407
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Yeah, I haven't found any of those yet.

408
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
But I haven't exactly really been looking for them either.

409
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
So, yeah.

410
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
So I think Doom, if that sounds like it's up your alley, might be worth it.

411
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
60 bucks is a lot of money though.

412
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
I think a lot of you guys are probably gonna wait for a Steam sale.

413
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Although, you know, the people who made the game do deserve to make a little money because they worked very hard on it.

414
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
So you'll have to decide how soon you need it, I suppose.

415
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
But that was otherwise it for my gaming week.

416
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Just a little bit of Doom over the weekend after it came out.

417
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,120
In addition to all the standby other stuff I've been playing all the time.

418
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Hopefully catching up on my backlog soon.

419
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

420
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
And then we'll get into the news this week.

421
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,120
I don't have a lot to say for housekeeping.

422
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,120
We're still gonna be here for the upcoming shows and so forth.

423
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,120
I believe next weekend, I still have to cross all the T's and dot all the I's so stay tuned to Twitter.

424
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
And you guys don't even know this, surprise!

425
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Next weekend is when we're gonna be joined by another podcast here in Sacramento.

426
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Oh yeah.

427
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,120
At the SAC Indie Arcade, the Video Game Bang guys are gonna be here in the studio next week.

428
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
We're gonna do a crossover episode so that'll be fun.

429
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,120
I don't know if we play the same types of games.

430
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,120
They're probably playing a lot more Doom than I have and we'll see.

431
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I think they're more like Call of Duty guys and I don't really play that a lot.

432
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,120
And I don't know if they know necessarily music games but we'll see.

433
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
So we're gonna have fun.

434
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,120
That should be next week but don't hold me to that.

435
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
You know what would be great?

436
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
What?

437
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Is if there was an anti-Doom game called Mood.

438
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,120
And it was just walking through flowers and little birds chirping.

439
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
But you still have to explore.

440
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,120
You want like a whimsy Shire level in Doom or something where it's rainbows and kittens and unicorns.

441
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Not really but I just think it would be funny.

442
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
So is that like Chick's Quest?

443
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Wasn't that something in like Hexen?

444
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Wasn't there like a secret level in one of those games that was like silly?

445
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
I don't know, I don't know why.

446
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Maybe it was probably a mod.

447
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,120
It's probably the whole game of Rise of the Triad.

448
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
And confusing mods for reality.

449
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,120
No, the best mod they ever did for one of those old school games was in Wolfenstein 3D.

450
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,120
When you could download the Mortal Kombat one.

451
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,120
And it would turn like the little mecha Hitler into like Sub-Zero.

452
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,120
And like all the end bosses and all this would become like Mortal Kombat characters.

453
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
That was the best.

454
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
So anyway.

455
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Alright, let's get into some news and talk about some things that are happening here and now.

456
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
And not mods from the 90s.

457
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Loki, starting us off.

458
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,120
So there's been some updates to backwards compatibility on Xbox One.

459
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Now they have figured out a way to enable support for multi-disc games.

460
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,120
So that's pretty awesome.

461
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,120
And that will open the doors for a lot of different games.

462
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Such as Mass Effect or L.A. Noire, Red Dead Redemption, Lost Odyssey hopefully.

463
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,120
They also announced that this week they're going to be having DSX Human Revolution Director's Cut.

464
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
As one of the free games.

465
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,120
And actually that will be the first game supported by the new updates to that.

466
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
And then yeah.

467
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
That should be it right now.

468
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
So that's pretty cool.

469
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I mean because there was a lot of multi-disc games on the 360 being that it was on DVDs.

470
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,120
And they couldn't really cram the content in there.

471
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
So I'm looking forward to it.

472
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,120
I feel like we should have a counter in studio.

473
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Like one of those tote boards that says number of days we've had backwards compatibility without Lost Odyssey.

474
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,120
And every week we're going to check in on the board until they finally give us Lost Odyssey.

475
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,120
But this is a really good, especially because I swear we were just talking about this on last week's show.

476
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,120
Or two weeks ago, but really recently.

477
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,120
But this is a really good sign that it's coming.

478
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,120
And not just Lost Odyssey, but Mass Effect 3 was on multiple discs right?

479
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,120
So I mean there's a lot of good games that are on multiple discs that I'm looking forward to.

480
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Red Dead wouldn't be such a problem because single player was on one disc and multiplayer was on the second disc.

481
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
So it wasn't such a big deal.

482
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,120
But yeah I mean I can understand where you'd want that for other games.

483
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Well the multiplayer servers are still up.

484
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,120
So hypothetically if the backwards compatibility you ought to be able to play multiplayer still.

485
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
So.

486
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Do you think maybe they're going to sit on a bunch of these big ones until E3?

487
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Because I kind of think that's what's going to happen.

488
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Probably.

489
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
I think especially like Red Dead Redemption.

490
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Yeah I can see that.

491
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,120
And then because you're telling us the sequel is coming at E3 right?

492
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Well Rockstar is supposed to be there.

493
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
It's been hinted at quite a bit.

494
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Rockstar hasn't had a booth in a long time.

495
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,120
Well they're not going to have a booth. They're going to be at E3 though.

496
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Oh then they've got something to show.

497
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Yeah something to show.

498
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
During one of the press conferences.

499
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
So it's either going to be like an expansion to Grand Theft Auto.

500
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Maybe both.

501
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,120
I think it's probably going to be another Red Dead game.

502
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Pre-order now and get the first game free on backwards compatibility.

503
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Bang.

504
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
That's what they'll do.

505
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,120
That's the big thing to do now.

506
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Well that's what they can do on Xbox One.

507
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Not so much PlayStation 4.

508
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
I really wish that would change.

509
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Who knows what Sony could have up their sleeve.

510
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
You're going to get it on PlayStation now.

511
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
For free.

512
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
You could.

513
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Hypothetically.

514
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,120
ST100Matt says yeah they will say Red Dead Redemption will be available right now kind of deal.

515
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I'm pretty sure with this backwards compatibility they're sitting on something big that they'll unveil at E3.

516
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,120
If it's not this then it's going to be Skyrim or something that people have really really been asking for a lot.

517
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Backwards compatibility for Final Fantasy XI.

518
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Oh damn.

519
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
Oh wait.

520
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Wait a minute.

521
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Maybe not.

522
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Alright.

523
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Kaijuto in chat says if they waste E3 talking about backwards games they're going to lose big time.

524
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Dude, it would take like 15 seconds.

525
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,120
It's like an update on backwards compatibility.

526
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,120
It now will do 50% of the games.

527
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
It doesn't even have to be about that.

528
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,120
It could just be like hey we just rock stars there to present a trailer for Red Dead.

529
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Exactly.

530
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,120
And then hey by the way as an added bonus we're going to have this all available now.

531
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Exactly.

532
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Or Mass Effect Andromeda you can now get 2 and 3 are available.

533
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
It would take literally 15 seconds.

534
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying.

535
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Alright.

536
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Moving on.

537
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Talking about the future of another series.

538
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
I was very excited this week.

539
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,120
You know I was very very excited when this series gets talked about.

540
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,120
And I want to say I speculated not that long ago that this was a likely thing for E3 this year.

541
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,120
And sure enough Civilization VI was announced this week.

542
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Yay!

543
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Civilization VI is coming out on October 21st.

544
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
They even dated it already.

545
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
It's ready to go.

546
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
60 bucks is what it's going to cost you.

547
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Civilization not games that really show up on consoles.

548
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I mean yes there was Civilization Revolution.

549
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Speaking of backwards compatibility I'd like to have that one.

550
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,120
But Civilization is more of a PC game.

551
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
You've just got to have a keyboard and mouse to play.

552
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
There's too much to do with it.

553
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,120
So Civ VI is going to be a game and you can pre-order it now on PC.

554
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,120
And it's going to be out on October 21st.

555
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,120
I was reading a little more about what they're actually changing with it.

556
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
And I think they're sitting on most of it until E3.

557
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I'm pretty sure they'll have a theater or something at E3 where you can watch some of the gameplay.

558
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,120
I remember that's what they did with Beyond Earth when I went to E3 at one point.

559
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:35,120
But with Civ VI they're keeping the hexagon format.

560
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
So they're keeping that from 5.

561
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,120
They are I guess changing a bit with city management.

562
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
So now instead of just staying in your city like,

563
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Oh I want to build a coliseum in my city.

564
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Now it's what grid or what square on the grid do you want to put the coliseum on.

565
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Because it's going to change possibly the characteristics of that square.

566
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Which in older Civilization games you use settlers to do different things to squares.

567
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Like build a railroad or irrigate them to make more food.

568
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:12,120
You could do a variety of things but it sounds like that's really going to expand with the city management.

569
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,120
So very very curious to see where that goes.

570
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
So I'm looking forward to E3.

571
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm not a big fan of what I'm hearing about this city stuff.

572
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
But I need to see it in motion before I can really be critical.

573
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Let's face it, it's a Civ game. Of course I'm going to buy it.

574
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Of course.

575
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,120
And then I'll stay up until 6 in the morning playing a game.

576
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Because that's what happens with Civilization is that,

577
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
Oh woah where did the time go?

578
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,120
It's actually 4 o'clock in the morning all of a sudden.

579
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

580
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Bobby Black Wolf says, Civilization Revolution was great.

581
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,120
I agree. A lot of hardcore Civ fans shit on that game.

582
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,120
But again I think it's because it's a game that's geared a little more towards dirty casuals and that's okay.

583
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:03,120
I think Civ Rev was the most like the original Civilization but on consoles.

584
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
I mean it wasn't exactly like the original Civ but it was close enough.

585
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,120
And I think they did a really good job making it available for consoles.

586
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:16,120
I didn't bother with the iPhone Android version they did of it. I didn't bother with that one.

587
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,120
And Rage Nator says, Wasn't the original Civilization on the Super Nintendo?

588
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,120
I believe it was but Civ was less complicated back then.

589
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,120
I even want to say on the Super Nintendo it was a little bit, they had to cut some corners.

590
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
It wasn't quite the same.

591
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Let's move on DarkSakura.

592
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Well it's finally happening. I kind of saw this happening.

593
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,120
And then I was actually kind of surprised and then sort of not.

594
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,120
It's kind of a weird mixed feeling about this.

595
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,120
But Disney is finally ending Disney Infinity.

596
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,120
They're shutting down Avalanche Software.

597
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
There will be no more Disney Infinity.

598
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I think they're going to do like two more sets and then that's it.

599
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:02,120
So yeah, according to Bob Iger, the Disney CEO.

600
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:14,120
They said that they thought that they had a really good opportunity to do something along the lines of what Skylanders and all that were doing.

601
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:20,120
And they thought it was doing pretty well but the business is changing and they don't want to keep up with it.

602
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
That's the official word.

603
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,120
It is what it is.

604
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,120
You now have plenty of cute little toys.

605
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,120
I've never played the game ever.

606
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,120
But I have a Rocket Raccoon and I have a Quora.

607
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,120
Thank you Loki.

608
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,120
So take it as you will.

609
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:49,120
I think that they might look into more like outsourcing or something.

610
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:56,120
But I think that the series is kind of a difficult market to play.

611
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Because how much do you produce?

612
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
What type of market are you going to go to?

613
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Are people going to keep playing it and stay interested in it?

614
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:13,120
What new can you do to keep it something that's going to draw people in or convince them that when you have a new iteration of it that it's worth it to buy?

615
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Well and I think Disney at some point is just more...

616
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,120
I wouldn't say so much outsourcing but just licensing.

617
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:27,120
They would just much rather, hey somebody wants to pay us a shit ton of money to make a Star Wars Battlefront game and it's actually really good.

618
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Or well, whether it's good or not it doesn't matter. It sells a lot.

619
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Sure, why not. Or hey, Square wants to throw us a lot of money to use Disney characters in Kingdom Hearts 3. Sure.

620
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,120
I also think it's absolutely hilarious and I'm going to call them on this.

621
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,120
It has nothing to do with the article.

622
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Polygon, you got a typo on your webpage.

623
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,120
Skylanders does not have a J in it.

624
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,120
Just saying. Just saying.

625
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,120
Jai-landers.

626
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,120
It's Skylanders. It's like S-J-Y-L-A-N-S-D-E-R-S.

627
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:07,120
I had to screenshot it and I'm going to email it to them because I'm just that person.

628
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Oh boy. So I think it's surprising a little bit that this went away because I thought Disney Infinity was doing relatively well.

629
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:28,120
But then when you read the thing about, oh well they have to put one million Hulk things back in a storage bin somewhere because they didn't sell enough of them.

630
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:34,120
You kind of go, well it sounds like their expectations kind of did them in. They couldn't find that happy balance.

631
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,120
There wasn't enough toys in the first go around and there's way too god damn many of them in the second go around.

632
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:47,120
Like they couldn't find that happy medium and it just kind of, I don't know, it just kind of sucks that the whole series gets done in by a series of bad decisions like that.

633
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:59,120
So hopefully whoever wants to get into the physical toys and games business next considers that. Although I doubt there will be many more players in that realm.

634
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Isn't there another, like even though, and this is the thing that gets me, and I haven't heard a lot about this.

635
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:14,120
When I go to Target and I see Disney Infinity on the shelf, I notice it's by Skylander, it's by Amiibo, but it's by this other one.

636
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:22,120
And I don't remember the name of it but somebody in chat probably does. It's like a direct to your TV thing and it's all Marvel characters.

637
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,120
So Disney is actually competing against itself in this space.

638
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:34,120
And that's kind of where I go, well what did you think was going to happen?

639
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:42,120
So I kind of, I really blame some higher ups at Disney for these types of planings.

640
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:49,120
Because when I saw the one that was the plug direct into the TV, and it's taking up a lot of shelf space at Target too.

641
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
I don't know if there's some type of arrangement.

642
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:59,120
That one is a little bit different if it's the same one I'm thinking of because they have some that have characters, but then you also have actual costume stuff that you wear.

643
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
It's Playmation, thank you Tigerclaw.

644
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Yeah, exactly. So you have like shields, like you can have Iron Man's gauntlet or something and you're actually shooting the characters and stuff.

645
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Okay, again, how is that not Disney competing against itself?

646
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,120
It's more of a toy than it is Disney Affinity. It's a little bit different. It's less complicated as a game.

647
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:26,120
It's more of like those, they've had them before where toys interact with infrared things and stuff like that.

648
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Yeah, I guess. Now did the plug get pulled on that series?

649
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
No.

650
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Isn't that interesting?

651
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Just saying.

652
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:46,120
I don't know, like when I was at the different stores today, I mean they still have a very big section of Disney Affinity, so their figures are marked down to $9 at Toys R Us. I almost got some.

653
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Were they? Because I need to get the core out of Complete My Tron collection.

654
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
All the figures are $9.

655
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,120
I might need to look for that. I'll send Shane help for me.

656
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:59,120
I almost got some today, but I was like, yeah, I'm gonna get yelled at by the way if I bring any more of those home.

657
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
You can keep them here.

658
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Yeah, I don't really want any more anyways. They don't really add anything.

659
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,120
I just want the core out of Complete My Tron collection, then I'm good.

660
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
You want the core?

661
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,120
Yeah.

662
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
Wait, don't give me yours.

663
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Too bad?

664
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
Don't give me yours. Just, you know.

665
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,120
Did you hear what I said?

666
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
What'd you say?

667
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Too bad.

668
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Too bad. Yeah, funny. No, I looked on Amazon the other day and they were still up there and I'm sure I can find one.

669
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
They're like everywhere.

670
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Need to do it sooner rather than later, that's all. Not put it off.

671
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
You know what?

672
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Huh?

673
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,120
I just forgot what I was going to say, so never mind.

674
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,120
You're right tonight.

675
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,120
No.

676
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,120
You're having a hard time functioning.

677
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
No.

678
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
You need more coffee.

679
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,120
Well, no, I don't need more coffee. It's just I got things I'm worried about.

680
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Well, I hope everything's all right.

681
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Sure, they can have a whole giant section of those toys and a whole giant section of those race car things that we were talking about last week that were there with all the iPads and everything.

682
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:05,120
But God forbid we could carry one fucking controller. Like one single controller for that stuff.

683
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,120
Oh, we'll carry a billion of these things that no one's buying, but one controller that is asking too much.

684
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Do you want a Hulk figure? Because we got plenty of those.

685
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Dear Loki.

686
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
Internet. Can you use it?

687
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,120
He already went into why he's not going to buy it online.

688
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,120
Too bad. Buy it online if you want it. If you don't want it bad enough, you're not going to go for it.

689
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Well, then they don't want to treat it as an actual platform then because, you know, all the other gaming platforms that I see out there in the marketplace have their fucking accessories in retail stores.

690
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,120
If you don't have your accessories in retail stores, then I'm sorry you're not a gaming fucking platform.

691
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Dungeon Buster in chat says, Captain Loki, controller war.

692
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I think we just need to pool the money together, buy one online and just have it sitting on the couch next week for him.

693
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Oh, and don't get me started about how-

694
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,120
With the card attached, it says shut up.

695
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Exactly.

696
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:08,120
And don't get me started on how expensive those controllers are too. It's like, you do realize I'm trying to give you $60 to play an $8 game.

697
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,120
Oh my god, nevermind. They're $60? Keep talking.

698
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,120
That's cool. That's $30 each.

699
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,120
There's so many few people making those things.

700
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,120
$30 could buy like dinner at Benihana.

701
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,120
You want to go to Benihana and stuff?

702
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,120
Fuck yeah.

703
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,120
Alright, let's do it. Let's go to the grill place, the church screen.

704
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Alright, alright.

705
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Alright, we're gonna go get-

706
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,120
We're gonna spend your controller money on beef.

707
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,120
Yeah, we're gonna go-

708
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
I support that.

709
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
Alright.

710
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,120
It's a plan.

711
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Let's see.

712
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,120
Ragenator in chat says, Loki went Amish and refuses to internet for controllers at a spike.

713
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:48,120
Or here's an idea if you don't want to sell me a controller, how about you just fucking make the Dual Shocks work with the stupid-

714
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Wait, Loki, this is right up your alley.

715
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Doesn't Steam have that thing where you can like download how to make your own damn controller?

716
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Like I thought that was a thing or is that only a Steam controller that won't work?

717
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,120
I think you're thinking of the Ouya and you can print your own shells for the Ouya, but no one's gonna buy an Ouya.

718
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:09,120
I swear to god we had a story on the show a couple weeks ago where you could like download the schematics to make your own Steam controller or something.

719
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,120
Can you? You still have your Ouya, right?

720
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,120
Fuck no, I don't.

721
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,120
Okay, well then nevermind.

722
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,120
I was wondering like if they could network.

723
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:24,120
Loki, my point is, if you can't find one, you're gonna have to build one. If you build it, they will come.

724
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,120
I'm not gonna build a control- I probably could build it cheaper anyways, but I'm just saying to you, I'm not gonna-

725
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,120
If you build it, they will come.

726
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:40,120
Just sell a fucking controller. There's so many controllers out there that are available. You can carry one fucking controller.

727
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,120
Stoppy in chat says you can even 3D print it.

728
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
I'll tell you what-

729
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,120
If you print it, they will come.

730
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:54,120
Hey, how about you buy one less iPhone case? You'll carry 199 iPhone cases and one controller.

731
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:05,120
And then here's the other thing. It's a Bluetooth controller for fucking- they have Bluetooth controllers for iPhone, but they're not compatible with Android.

732
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,120
It's Bluetooth! It's supposed to be compatible with everything. That doesn't make any sense to me.

733
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,120
Loki, Loki, before you get the engines revved up again, I think I'm gonna need you to do the next story.

734
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
Fine.

735
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:35,120
So, Warren Spector, who kind of worked on the whole Epic Mickey series, says that there's some sort of unreleased Disney property that was gonna become a game that he would like to get his hands on.

736
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Basically saying, hey, now that you're out of games, can I have the IP I created at Junction Point back? You're never gonna do anything with them.

737
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:53,120
And since Disney acquired Junction Point, they own my near future action modern day ninja and epic fantasy concepts. It'd be nice to get them back.

738
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,120
So he's basically like, can I get my dress back? Because you're not gonna wear it.

739
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,120
You're too fat for the dress anyway.

740
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,120
I loaned you those shoes last year.

741
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:13,120
So the games that he was working on, one of which was called Necessary Evil, and it's like a game that's supposed to be similar to Deus Ex.

742
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,120
And then, I'm not really sure what the other one was.

743
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:26,120
I'm kind of surprised what these are have been put out there, because now if he does get ahold of these IPs by some miracle, it's already out there what it is. It's kind of surprising.

744
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:38,120
I don't know. I mean, I'm fine with them licensing their properties. It'd be kind of cool, though, if they could license Marvel to Lego Dimensions.

745
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:46,120
I'm sure they're gonna license the shit out of their characters. They're not gonna stop doing that. Kingdom Hearts 3 isn't gonna suddenly not happen.

746
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
So, I mean, they're gonna continue to license out the Disney stuff.

747
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,120
Kingdom Hearts 3 with the Avengers would be fucking amazing.

748
00:49:52,120 --> 00:50:01,120
My assumption is they're still doing fine in the mobile marketplace. I didn't hear anything about what's happening in the mobile development area, which is still pretty big for Disney.

749
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,120
So I think this is just the console space.

750
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Yeah, it's just they decided to not make a game, because they really only have a game coming out each year, and they're just gonna make money by licensing their properties.

751
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:20,120
Kind of like how LucasArts was gonna be licensing their properties instead of actually making games themselves.

752
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Alright, well, even though there may be no more physical Disney toys, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Nintendo fills the space with physical versions of these toys.

753
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:39,120
Pokemon! Did you guys hear there's some big Pokemon news this week? And it actually has nothing to do with toys. I'm just forecasting the future.

754
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:48,120
But what we know for a fact is going to happen is that Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon will be launching for the Nintendo 3DS on November 18th.

755
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,120
Dude, that's awesome! But where are the Wii U games?

756
00:50:53,120 --> 00:51:01,120
I was like, no, no. Loki doesn't just say that's awesome with something like that. There's a hidden joke or a punchline.

757
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,120
They only have the new Paper Mario game, which looks pretty cool.

758
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,120
Haven't you heard? Zelda! And that's all we're gonna show at E3 this year.

759
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Zelda's coming out this year? Oh, wait, it's not fucking coming out this year. That's right.

760
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:21,120
No, it's not. Yeah, it's not. Maybe NES Remix 3 just to hold you up. Maybe there'll be NES Remix 3 to hold you up.

761
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,120
Maybe not that.

762
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,120
We should get the first one.

763
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,120
We'll get some new skins in Mario Maker.

764
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,120
Don't we always get that?

765
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Hey, the baby metal thing? That was pretty rad. Like, an unexpected. So, you know what? Baby metal is endorsed by Rob Zombie.

766
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,120
You know who's playing Mario Maker now? My son's playing Mario Maker now.

767
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Good for him!

768
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,120
He just builds levels and then, like, that's it.

769
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,120
He just draws bricks everywhere. I did it. Funny.

770
00:51:50,120 --> 00:52:00,120
By the way, also huge, huge, big news that started all types of Twitter wars that I may or may not have been involved in directly over the new starter Pokemon.

771
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:07,120
You have this, oh my god, this adorable fat little owl with a little leaf bow tie named Rowlet.

772
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:17,120
It, oh my god, does it look like, yes, you should sing show tunes like the old WB frog does in a top hat and a cane.

773
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:23,120
Well, this is like the old, um, uh, Mooney Tunes owl. The family.

774
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Okay, so I like Rowlet. Rowlet is really cute. And Litten, adorable.

775
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
The best!

776
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:37,120
Yes, little fire kitty. Looks very sassy, looks very mean, but also adorable at the same time.

777
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:43,120
Uh, that's Litten. And I think I'm gonna be Team Litten, because it seems like the rest of the internet is Team Rowlet.

778
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Um, and, uh, you know, fire type beats grass type, so that makes sense.

779
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,120
So those are, those are the two starter types you have to look forward to in Pokemon.

780
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,120
Oh, yeah, there's another one. It's, um, Pooplio.

781
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,120
Like, Shane is after the seal.

782
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,120
I think it's Pooplio that looks like a derpy clown dog seal.

783
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,120
It's probably gonna be like a crazy ass sea lion.

784
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:10,120
Oh, Pooplio! Yes, Pooplio. Sorry, I just, my eyes. Can't read.

785
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,120
It's just the derpy visuals.

786
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,120
I'm sure it dooshed.

787
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:23,120
So, uh, there you go. No, in all seriousness, Rowlet, I'm just, I'm just waiting for act after somebody starts screaming at me in chat.

788
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,120
Uh, Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio are the three starter Pokemon.

789
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,120
So what do those evolve into?

790
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:35,120
They haven't shown those yet. We only know what the starter types look like, so we can only kind of guess.

791
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:43,120
I would imagine Rowlet is gonna be a very, you know, kind of bird, like a full bird type of thing, like a hawk type of thing, probably.

792
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,120
How does an owl evolve into a hawk?

793
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:54,120
It never made sense. Uh, and Litten will probably be like a big lion, like a fire lion, and then Lord knows what the Popplio's gonna turn into.

794
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
That's an even dumber looking seal.

795
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,120
Stop. Maybe, maybe a whale or something, I don't know.

796
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,120
A beached whale.

797
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,120
Like a magic carp. It'll just lie there. It has splash.

798
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Uh, this is how I know Shane's not listening right now because my phone isn't blowing up with hate.

799
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,120
You know, is Ash still in these games?

800
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Uh, no. He was, Ash was technically never in the games.

801
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
No, it was red and blue the first time.

802
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
Yeah, fine, you know.

803
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
The character is you. You can name whatever it is.

804
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,120
Okay, well whatever. So I'm gonna use Sea World on Popplio, and it was very effective.

805
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Alright, let's move on, cause just, I already know I'm gonna get a three hour hate monologue from Shane later when he hears this. Hopefully he won't.

806
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
So let's move on. Dark Sakura, what do you have?

807
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Well, I seem to have this theme of stuff just closing or quitting or not doing things anymore.

808
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,120
So Microsoft has thrown in the towel for Project Spark.

809
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Project Spark was supposed to be a game making tool for Xbox One and for Windows PC.

810
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:11,120
It is no longer available to download as of two days ago, May 13th.

811
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Online services, including the ability to download and upload, will be unavailable after August 12th.

812
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,120
So finish your shit by then, get it up, cause you will be done after that.

813
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:37,120
It was supposed to be there to let different game designers create things that they want to and then play homemade games on a community level.

814
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:49,120
And there were people who used it for all kinds of things, including a Conker series. A little episodic adventure type thing.

815
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,120
Yeah, didn't they put Conker out as an asset you could get in Project Spark at one point?

816
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,120
But now it is no more.

817
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,120
It conked out.

818
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:05,120
What? Did nobody else see the easy pun that just writes itself? Come on.

819
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Out of all the places that they should have put Conker, Project Spark was probably the dumbest thing they could have done.

820
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,120
It's like, hey, we've got Conker. Everyone's like, new Conker game? It's going to be in Project Spark. Oh, fuck.

821
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,120
Look, I'm not going to hate on Project Spark, cause I know there are fans and stuff.

822
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,120
I feel like this is another one of those things that Microsoft kind of killed, maybe a little too soon.

823
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,120
Yeah, they were jumping on the little big planet bandwagon like five years late.

824
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,120
I feel like it was a little more than just a little big planet.

825
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,120
Well, we can't help you, Mario Maker.

826
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
But I guess it's done now.

827
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Stoppy says, Spark is such a dumb name. This is from our chat room.

828
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,120
If it's a versatile and easy to use tool set, they should have named it Spork.

829
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,120
Good night, everybody. Thanks for listening.

830
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
KFC presents Project Spork.

831
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:03,120
All right, I'm done. I'm done packing up my computer. I'm going the fuck home.

832
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Actually, fuck that. I'm going to go get cheesecake and drink until I get over this.

833
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,120
Extra crispy edition.

834
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,120
Let's travel around the world to check out some release dates.

835
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Seriously, balls.

836
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,120
Check out what games are coming out in a store near you, Loki, here in the US.

837
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,120
It's a store near me. Well, Homefront The Revolution.

838
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,120
That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

839
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Also on PlayStation 4, Shadow of the Beast and Valkyria Chronicles Remastered.

840
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,120
And then we also have Shadwin on PlayStation 4 and PC.

841
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,120
And then later in the week, Last Fight on PC.

842
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,120
If you're a fan of... what is it?

843
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Fuck me, I can't remember the name of the series now.

844
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,120
It'll come back to me.

845
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,120
Let's take a fighting game.

846
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:04,120
And then finally, Time Machine VR coming to PC for the Vive and the Rift.

847
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,120
And that's it.

848
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:14,120
Okay then, we'll travel over to Japan and check out what's going to come out over there.

849
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,120
Starting on the PlayStation 4.

850
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,120
You know, it's been kind of a slow couple weeks in Japan.

851
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,120
I think Golden Week was just recently.

852
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Power Stone, that was the game I was thinking of.

853
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
Last Fight is very similar to Power Stone.

854
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
But things are picking up again in Japan this week.

855
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,120
And we have Doom coming out in Japan this week, getting its release there on the PlayStation 4 on May 19th.

856
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,120
Battleborn also making its way to Japan this week.

857
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,120
And Homefront the Revolution arrives in Japan this week.

858
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Again, all of that on the PlayStation 4.

859
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Seeing if there's anything on the PlayStation 3, because we're still seeing some stuff from that generation.

860
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:53,120
No, we don't really have any releases until the 26th when Guilty Gear XRD comes out.

861
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:02,120
So I guess I can skip ahead to the PlayStation Vita and tell you that Period Cube, Torikago no Amadeus is out this week in a regular and limited edition set.

862
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,120
I can't help but think of Intelligent Cube, but I don't think those games have anything in common.

863
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:14,120
And then on the Nintendo DS this week, Boku no Hero Academia Battle for All comes out this week from Bandai Namco.

864
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,120
This is My Hero Academia comes out.

865
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,120
Which looks like, I think it's a fighting game.

866
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:28,120
Yeah, it's a little fighting game, little anime boom boom wham, kind of looks like Batman with the big explosions and stuff.

867
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,120
So that is what you have to look forward to on the 3DS.

868
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,120
How about Europe Dark Sakura?

869
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:42,120
There's some stuff. There is Shadwin on Mac coming out, Valkyria Chronicles remaster for PlayStation 4, those are all on the 17th.

870
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:52,120
On the 19th we have Time Machine VR for PC, and on the 20th Fire Emblem Fates for 3DS, Homefront the Revolution for everything else.

871
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:58,120
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

872
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,120
Alright, so this is kind of neat, there's new game consoles coming.

873
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:08,120
And these are both coming out of China, so there's a couple different things being announced.

874
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:16,120
One was the Tencent TGP Box, that's being announced at CES Asia.

875
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:24,120
And that is going to be running off of an Intel Core processor, and it runs Windows 10.

876
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:40,120
And also something called TGP Box Mode, and they're basically saying that the console can download and stream games, including League of Legends, FIFA Online 3, NBA 2K Online, Monster Hunter Online, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Tournament.

877
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:48,120
So a console that plays League of Legends, that's kind of a big deal. But that sounds like a Steam Machine, the way you describe it.

878
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,120
It's almost like a PC, but it's got some sort of special mode in it or something that runs those.

879
01:00:54,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Interesting. Let's steam big picture. I'm just saying, it kind of sounds similar, I mean, it sounds more like this is actually just a computer that hooks up to your TV than necessarily a dedicated gaming console.

880
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,120
Yeah, it sort of looks like that.

881
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,120
To be fair, gaming consoles and PCs, the line is getting more and more blurred, maybe this is just a further example of that, I don't know.

882
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:21,120
Yeah, they basically said it's basically a Windows 10-powered gaming console with smart features designed to transcend traditional gaming.

883
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:31,120
Okay, that sounds like a bunch of marketing PR buzz crap hype. But there's that. So, interesting, I guess. We'll have to see if that ever makes it out anywhere else.

884
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:44,120
Also, the Fuse Tomahawk F1. And this game system looks like it's sort of like, I guess they're saying it's like an Android console.

885
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,120
But here's the thing though, it's got quite a lineup of different titles that are supposed to be coming out for it.

886
01:01:50,120 --> 01:02:05,120
Including Assassin's Creed Chronicles, Dynasty Warriors X Extreme Legends, BlazBlue, Chrono Phantasma Extent, Mighty No. 9, and the, once Kickstarted but dropped from Kickstarter, Red Ash.

887
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,120
Red Ash is going to be coming out to it. That's one that's supposed to be like Mega Man Legends.

888
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:30,120
Also, other things that they're talking about, other titles, Saints Row IV and Saints Row Gata out of Hell, Salt Android Cactus, I mean, they got quite a lineup of titles on there. I mean, that's pretty interesting. And I guess that is the company that funded Red Ash.

889
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,120
Okay, when I first heard about this, I was like, okay, so it's basically the Ouya in a bigger box. But, I mean...

890
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,120
It sounds like they got quite a bit of titles on there.

891
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,120
Some of those games you would think, like Saints Row IV is at least going to take an Xbox...

892
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,120
I don't think that runs on Android yet.

893
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
No, no, it's going to take a little more punch to...

894
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,120
I mean, that's at least, you know, Xbox...

895
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,120
360 level stuff.

896
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,120
You know, level graphics, so...

897
01:02:52,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Well, this is going to be very interesting if China starts to get into the market like this. Like, you know, I don't think that Windows box, you know, because again, that first one you talked about sounds like it's just basically a PC that hooks up your TV.

898
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:08,120
Yeah, and the controller is basically a rip-off of an Xbox 360 controller. I mean, it looks almost identical.

899
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,120
And then the actual console itself looks like a rip-off of the PlayStation 4, so...

900
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,120
It's an interesting combination.

901
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,120
If there's a good idea, why change it? But that would be interesting if you get a console like this that, you know, becomes highly desirable.

902
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,120
You would have to wonder if maybe one day consoles may come from China.

903
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:42,120
I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow or this year even, but it could be very, very, very interesting if a company like Tencent or something starts to join Sony and Nintendo and some of these other companies in this console space that's already kind of crowded.

904
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:48,120
Yeah, I mean, definitely looks interesting. I'd be curious to see...

905
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,120
Oh, here's another one. Grid Autosport also runs on it as well.

906
01:03:52,120 --> 01:04:03,120
Dungeon Buster brings up a good point that I do believe is worth correcting, Loki. Red Ash was funded by a Chinese company, but they ended the Kickstarter early. Not that the Kickstarter was doing all that well to begin with.

907
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,120
Well, yes, that's what I'm saying. They ended the Kickstarter because it got funded by a company.

908
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:14,120
I thought they still ran it for stretch goals, I thought was the thing. I could be thinking of something else on Kickstarter these days.

909
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,120
There's several of those games that do that too.

910
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,120
And Bob Coffey in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, better launch lineup than the Wii U.

911
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,120
Well, I don't know if all those games are necessarily the day it launches, though.

912
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:35,120
Well, that's true, but I mean, you basically have an Android console, you know, theoretically. So they're saying, okay, here's some price points to kind of give you an idea of how much this is going to cost.

913
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:42,120
And it's pretty impressive, actually. So they're saying the Play Edition of the console will launch for 899 yen, which is just about $140.

914
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:49,120
And it's considerably cheaper than everything else that's on the market right now. They're saying that it even has VR support for it later on.

915
01:04:50,120 --> 01:05:04,120
The specs on it, Nvidia Tegra K1, 4-core processor. They've also got 4GB of RAM. It's got 32GB of on-board storage, or 500GB if you have an Elite console.

916
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:12,120
And then HDMI USB 3.0, and then it runs some Fuse OS, which is Android, and then OpenGL 4.4.

917
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,120
Which looks a lot like the Sony crossbar, if you've seen the pictures.

918
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:31,120
Exactly. But think about this, though. This is a $140 console that basically runs games that are graphically similar to an Xbox 360 or even a Wii U, which is pretty impressive.

919
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:42,120
It'll be interesting to see what happens, especially what this is going to do for gaming in China, because we look at this and go, okay, well, this is a bunch of kind of last-gen games for the most part.

920
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,120
I mean, there's some current stuff in there, especially Mighty No. 9 and stuff, but nothing that's really pushing the envelope and so forth.

921
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:53,120
But you have to remember, China is a very big place. There's a lot of people in China.

922
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:00,120
And, you know, they just lifted that whole ban on making consoles in the first place. Like, what? Not even two years ago.

923
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,120
What do you think? Most of these consoles are manufactured anyways. I mean, a lot of this stuff comes from China and Hong Kong.

924
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Yeah, but you couldn't sell them within the country for a long time. So now you can. So it's going to be very, very, very interesting to see, like, what this does.

925
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:22,120
I mean, this, I feel like a lot of people are just kind of writing this off as, oh, this console, you know, something we'll never see here, and it looks like it's shit anyway compared to what we have.

926
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,120
But hold up, because as gaming continues to grow in China, it could be very interesting.

927
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:36,120
Let's put it this way. The lineup of titles that they're talking about coming to it right now is already more impressive than what the Ouya had with several million dollars worth of funding.

928
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:44,120
I mean, it sounds like these guys are at least, you know, more on board with that. And I guess the leaked version of the console, which has the larger hard drive and everything, is like $230.

929
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,120
But that's still not bad. It's still cheaper than you can get a Wii U for.

930
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:58,120
I wonder if that's something people over here will try to get just to have. I mean, I don't know, because again, the games are all kind of things you can play other places anyway.

931
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:03,120
But I'd be very curious to see, like, what maybe kind of exclusives they get and if they're any good.

932
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,120
Well, Red Ash, I mean, that's...

933
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,120
Yeah, but we're going to see that here.

934
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,120
I don't think we... I don't know if we are.

935
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Nothing's been said so far.

936
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,120
When the Kickstarter ended, it got funded for the base consoles. We'll see it. We're going to see Red Ash here. Believe it.

937
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,120
I mean...

938
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,120
Am I going to believe it like I'm going to see Mighty No. 9 here?

939
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,120
It might be six years from now, but you'll see it eventually.

940
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:31,120
Alright, we got one more story for you guys here and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

941
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,120
This is about a modern classic, however, and I think Dark Sakura would agree.

942
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Mass Effect. Mass Effect Andromeda, in fact. More information, a little bit more, out this week about what to expect at E3.

943
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,120
And yes, you will get an update on Mass Effect Andromeda at EA's press conference this year.

944
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,120
In fact, many people kind of fully expecting this is the full fucking reveal this year.

945
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,120
You're going to see the gameplay footage. You're going to get everything this year.

946
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,120
Kind of similar to a couple years ago when they first showed Dragon Age Inquisition, right? And then it came out that holiday.

947
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Well, unfortunately, Mass Effect Andromeda also confirmed this week it's not going to be a holiday.

948
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
It's going to be 2017.

949
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,120
CFO Blake Jorgensen said to investors,

950
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,120
As we've been playing the game in the studio recently, it's showing us that we're taking the game in the right direction.

951
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,120
But we also know we need the right amount of time to make sure we deliver everything the game can be and should be.

952
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:30,120
That's our commitment from all of us to all of you. Because of that, Mass Effect Andromeda will now ship in early 2017.

953
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,120
Thank. God.

954
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
Yeah, don't rush it.

955
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
Seriously, I want a good game. I don't want a rushed piece of crap.

956
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,120
Even if that's now going to be, what, how many years since Mass Effect 3?

957
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,120
I still don't care if it's going to be worth it.

958
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,120
Mass Effect 3 came out in March, I think.

959
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,120
Yeah, and it came out in the March window as well. It'll be fine. I'm not really worried about the timeframe.

960
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,120
And if that's what they need to make it right, then I will shut up.

961
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,120
So, there you go. Excited to see more of that at E3, except that I'm not going.

962
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,120
But I wouldn't really have to go to E3 anyway. I just have to go to the EA Play event.

963
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Which, I'm assuming they're going to have some type of playable little thing there.

964
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,120
I mean, that's a huge assumption, but why wouldn't they?

965
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,120
Especially if multiplayer is going to be back.

966
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,120
I would think a great thing to show at E3, or this EA event, would be the multiplayer.

967
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,120
And just let people play that a little bit to get a little bit of the action.

968
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
We'll see.

969
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,120
Anyhow, let's travel back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.

970
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:39,120
Every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you little shits, you should be playing this instead.

971
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:47,120
This is a very interesting pick this week. Remember, the rule for what a classic game should be is it has to be at least ten years old or more.

972
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:54,120
And this is one that is ten years old or more. But it's one that is kind of still a thing for a lot of people, right?

973
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
I balanced on the technicality.

974
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,120
Fair enough. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

975
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,120
Classic game of the week is World of Warcraft.

976
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,120
How could you pick World of Warcraft?

977
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
Because it's all this shit.

978
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,120
It kind of is, though.

979
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,120
And I did find the first sign-in music.

980
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,120
Yeah.

981
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,120
So that was pretty cool.

982
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:22,120
It was a game that took me a long time to finally get into because I've played for every expansion, remember?

983
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,120
And then I quit.

984
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,120
And then I'd get the next expansion and then I'd quit.

985
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:34,120
And finally I really liked it around Cataclysm and have several 85s and then I quit after Pandas.

986
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,120
Fucking Pandas.

987
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,120
I still have a level 90.

988
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:47,120
But World of Warcraft is an MMORPG that was released in 2004 by Blizzard, now owned by Activision.

989
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:54,120
It was a pretty much direct sequel to Warcraft III, The Frozen Throne.

990
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,120
And it was set about four years after the events of that game.

991
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:07,120
It is pretty much still an entity.

992
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:15,120
We make fun of it for still existing and I may have called you an addict for years and years.

993
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,120
But the people who love it really love it.

994
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,120
And it took me a while and I really loved it.

995
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,120
In fact, I'm actually considering quitting Final Fantasy XIV to go back to it.

996
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Just because it's been so long.

997
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:34,120
And I have a bajillion friends that play, but every time I log into Final Fantasy XIV, no one's freaking on.

998
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:44,120
And pretty much you get the opportunity, I think in the vanilla version you had humans.

999
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:55,120
On the Alliance side you had humans, dwarves, elves, night elves, and gnomes.

1000
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,120
Just the four, right?

1001
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
I don't think so.

1002
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:06,120
And then on the Horde side you had orcs, you had trolls, you had...

1003
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,120
Taurens.

1004
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,120
Taurens, yeah. Remember I had cowgirl for a while?

1005
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,120
Yes.

1006
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,120
Undead, that's right.

1007
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,120
I kept thinking of the goblins as the counterpart to the gnomes.

1008
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,120
Yeah, some of that came later.

1009
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,120
Yeah, blood elves.

1010
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,120
The pretty ones.

1011
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,120
We had our twinsie blood elves.

1012
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,120
I do.

1013
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,120
That was great.

1014
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,120
Rob, you should rejoin with me if I do it.

1015
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,120
One MMO a few months.

1016
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,120
I tried World of Warcraft already.

1017
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
I wasn't really interested in going back.

1018
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,120
I mean, there's some cool people playing, but I'll see them on Twitter.

1019
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,120
Yeah, I'm still deciding.

1020
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,120
I haven't done anything yet.

1021
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,120
But you have all kinds of different play modes as well.

1022
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,120
You have normal questing and doing stuff.

1023
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,120
And you've got your roleplay server still.

1024
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,120
Some of them.

1025
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
You have PvP, player versus player.

1026
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,120
You have all kinds of different stuff you can do.

1027
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,120
You can travel around.

1028
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,120
There's plenty of hidden, really weird shit in the game.

1029
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,120
Like if you follow the children into the village where they stand in a pentagram

1030
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,120
and then they run off and weird things play.

1031
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,120
All kinds of neat little Easter eggs in there.

1032
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,120
And even for people who are clip masters, you can find content

1033
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,120
and complete dungeons and everything and explore them.

1034
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,120
A lot of that's up on YouTube.

1035
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,120
And then you have your holiday things like Children's Week and Halloween and all that.

1036
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,120
And there's an auction house.

1037
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,120
It's just World of Warcraft.

1038
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,120
I mean, if you don't know what it is by now, then...

1039
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,120
But it's been an ongoing story.

1040
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,120
I really like the lore for it.

1041
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,120
I couldn't get into the turn-based strategies, but this was pretty fun for me.

1042
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,120
And it's still pretty much going strong.

1043
01:13:52,120 --> 01:14:01,120
We've maybe lost some subscribers, but it is still, I think, have the Guinness World Record for it.

1044
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,120
It's still the biggest MMO out there, even to this day.

1045
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:09,120
I see some folks in the chat going, you know, WoW's not a classic.

1046
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,120
Hold up. Hold up.

1047
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,120
Because WoW kind of changed it all for MMOs.

1048
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,120
There's been nothing like World of Warcraft.

1049
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,120
I would even argue World of Warcraft was probably one of the most impactful games.

1050
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
I felt like we talked about this at the end of the last decade.

1051
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:32,120
I feel like between Xbox Live and World of Warcraft, those are two of the biggest things in gaming in the past decade.

1052
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,120
That's why I picked it as a classic, especially since we've got the movie coming out.

1053
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,120
Yeah, it's timely, the movie and the expansion.

1054
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:47,120
But I think that it's just, yeah, it's still being updated and kept new and everything.

1055
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:56,120
But if you look at when it came out, and the fact that it's a 12-fucking-year-old game, and a million people are still playing it.

1056
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
More than a million.

1057
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,120
I know what you mean. Lots.

1058
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,120
Millions are playing it. That has to count for something.

1059
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,120
I think it would be the same as if I had mentioned Lineage or EverQuest.

1060
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,120
But I think that World of Warcraft has actually surpassed them.

1061
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:19,120
It depends on what you're into, but I think on a commercial level, for sure.

1062
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,120
But also, something to consider is how did the game make it for 12 years?

1063
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,120
It's basically innovated itself every few years by adding new features and things of that sort.

1064
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,120
And you look at, you know, classic World of Warcraft is not the same game that it is today.

1065
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,120
So in some ways, when you look back at Vanilla Warcraft, yeah, it is a different game.

1066
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:44,120
In fact, and this is also timely because you have a lot of people talking about, we miss Vanilla WoW.

1067
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,120
Remember that pirate server that got shut down recently?

1068
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,120
Now there's all these people that are hammering the blizzard about, bring that back.

1069
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:57,120
We want vanilla servers. We want to play the game like it was in 2004 when it first came out.

1070
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:06,120
Because that game will never exist again otherwise, even though I kind of go, it wasn't as good as it is now.

1071
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,120
I mean, the game gets better, I think.

1072
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,120
People beg to differ though. It's all that we like.

1073
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:16,120
And it's that certain retro charm. I get it. Why do we go back and play Atari 2600 games?

1074
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,120
Well, it's the same reason why I go back and play Ragnarok Online.

1075
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:25,120
You know, I love freaking Ragnarok Online. I'd even say that that is my favorite MMO of all time.

1076
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,120
But I really do like World of Warcraft enough to consider going back to it.

1077
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:36,120
Even against my, you know, husband's desires because he just doesn't want me to play any of them.

1078
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,120
But still.

1079
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,120
AkumaJP with a good point in our chat room, can't play in Japan.

1080
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,120
Yeah, somehow World of Warcraft, for some reason, never crossed over to Japan.

1081
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,120
It went to China, but it never went to Japan.

1082
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:55,120
It went to, I mean, obviously it's been in Europe. I'm trying to think of other Asian countries it's been to.

1083
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,120
But yeah, somehow it always skipped Japan.

1084
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:06,120
I think it really did just innovate and bring something new.

1085
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:13,120
And really, I think, also introduced a wider market into the concept of an MMORPG.

1086
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,120
It really did break a lot of ground.

1087
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:25,120
And even if, you know, you've never touched a video game, most people, when you say World of Warcraft, they go, oh, that's that time sink game, right?

1088
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,120
So, just saying.

1089
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:33,120
Yeah. And even though, you know, you guys know I kind of prefer Final Fantasy XIV these days.

1090
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,120
You know, Final Fantasy XIV owes a lot to World of Warcraft.

1091
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,120
In fact, even the producer of Final Fantasy XIV has said that some of the influence came from World of Warcraft.

1092
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:49,120
And when they re, after the horrible fucking 1.0 Final Fantasy XIV, the idea to nuke the world, yeah, did come from cataclysm.

1093
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,120
And kind of showed that, you know, you can push the reset button on a living world like that.

1094
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,120
And for the better, thank God.

1095
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,120
So, anyhow.

1096
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,120
Even though I think Final Fantasy XIV now innovates in ways that World of Warcraft should.

1097
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,120
But that's the fun thing about competition now.

1098
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:13,120
Well, maybe later tonight, if someone is going to be awake after I've cheesecaked, we might have to play some XIV.

1099
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
We'll see. I should, I should.

1100
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,120
Vince me why I should stay.

1101
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,120
I should be around.

1102
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,120
Alright. Anyhow.

1103
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,120
I think I am right and I'm standing by my decision and y'all don't judge me because this is our show and not yours.

1104
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,120
I couldn't help that.

1105
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,120
Well, no, and I don't think you need to defend that World of Warcraft is not a classic game.

1106
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,120
It's ludicrous.

1107
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,120
It's ludicrous to say it's not.

1108
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,120
I honestly believe, in my opinion, it's ludicrous to say that World of Warcraft is not a classic game.

1109
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,120
It's more of a classic than fucking Halo.

1110
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,120
Well, now I don't know if I go that far.

1111
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,120
Fucking more of a classic than Halo.

1112
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,120
Halo is never.

1113
01:18:53,120 --> 01:19:03,120
If Halo is going to be on the Sam show, someone in this room who does not have a vagina is going to be the one putting it on the list.

1114
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,120
Hey, she said if.

1115
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:16,120
I said, if I, who is the queen of classic game of the week, I will not choose Halo.

1116
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,120
I would, I, you know, what's funny.

1117
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:29,120
I don't know if I would necessarily pick Halo before I would pick Halo 2 anyway, because I think Halo 2 was the real one that kind of innovative, especially for Xbox Live and everything.

1118
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,120
She's starting to give a little bit, you guys.

1119
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,120
That doesn't mean, no, no, no.

1120
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,120
I can say something.

1121
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,120
All right, girl.

1122
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,120
Where's the fan?

1123
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,120
All right, you ready for this?

1124
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,120
Yes.

1125
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,120
I never once said that Halo is not a good game.

1126
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:55,120
I never once said that it doesn't deserve recognition.

1127
01:19:56,120 --> 01:20:00,120
I just said that I'm a stubborn bitch and I'm never going to put it on the list.

1128
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:11,120
And Bobby says, for the record, I think World of Warcraft is a totally acceptable classic game.

1129
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,120
I also think that EverQuest would be a good candidate as well.

1130
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,120
I almost did EverQuest, but I figured I would do World of Warcraft given that the movie's going to be out whenever.

1131
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,120
A lot of people are talking about it right now.

1132
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:29,120
But I also am considering Lineage and I think I've done Ragnarok online though.

1133
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:39,120
But yeah, I've got my eyes on those other two, so probably you'll see them come up in a future classic game.

1134
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,120
All right, fair enough.

1135
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,120
But not Halo.

1136
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,120
All right. We are going to take a break though, you guys.

1137
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,120
We're going to take a rest and stuff and relax our voices, get some water and all that good stuff.

1138
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:58,120
But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come, including rapid fire news as well as we're going to get into the mailbag.

1139
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:04,120
Your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1140
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,120
We will get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1141
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:29,120
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on this May the 15th of 2016 with episode number 641 of our show in progress.

1142
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,120
Thank you very much, by the way, DarkSakura.

1143
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,120
She gave me her fortune cookie with her meal because I guess for whatever reason she doesn't want to eat the cookie.

1144
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:43,120
So I actually read the fortune here, DarkSakura. It says, happy events will take place in your home.

1145
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,120
Aw, like this show.

1146
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,120
Exactly.

1147
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:53,120
Of course, if you were to add embed to that, happy events will take place in your home in bed.

1148
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,120
Happy endings will take place in your home in bed.

1149
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,120
Let's hope.

1150
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:06,120
Anyway, by the way, also, I kind of failed tonight because I forgot to do a FUGO Question of the Week.

1151
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,120
I know, God, I'm sorry guys, I've been slacking.

1152
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,120
We will do some Ask Orange Lounge tonight instead.

1153
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,120
So if you want to send a question for Ask Orange Lounge, since I forgot to ask you, you can ask us.

1154
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,120
It's cool if it's gaming related, but if it's not, that's alright too.

1155
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,120
So you can ask Orange Lounge right now while we do these rapid fire questions.

1156
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,120
I put the instructions there in our live chat.

1157
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,120
You can also tweet them to us at OLR. I have the Twitters up.

1158
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:35,120
So if messaging us in chat is too damn hard, you can tweet us at OLR right now.

1159
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:43,120
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Africa.

1160
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,120
While we wait for those questions to come in, let's do some rapid fire news.

1161
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,120
Alright, so this is cool if you're still in the market for a 2DS or a 3DS.

1162
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:58,120
Instead of 2DS, they have dropped the price, or they will be next week, to $79.99.

1163
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,120
Actually, it's already been dropped in certain locations like today at Toys R Us.

1164
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,120
It was actually less than that. It was $60 something, $68.

1165
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,120
So, keeping an eye out for that.

1166
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,120
I almost purchased one, but then I didn't.

1167
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,120
Because, I don't know. I don't need it.

1168
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,120
There's a new Dead Island game coming out.

1169
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,120
And it's kind of a throwback, a retro game.

1170
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,120
It's a Dead Island Retro Revenge.

1171
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,120
It's a 16-bit style beat-em-up.

1172
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,120
And it will be a part of the Dead Island Definitive Collection.

1173
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:44,120
And you can purchase both games in the collection digitally for $19.99 or $39.99 for the retail price.

1174
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,120
And, yeah. That's pretty cool.

1175
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,120
So, I guess check it out when it comes out.

1176
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,120
May 31st.

1177
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,120
And then, Grand Theft Auto Online is getting some more updates.

1178
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,120
I think they've kind of taken note that a lot of people like to make really crazy racetracks in that game.

1179
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,120
Doing all sorts of stunt jumps and that type of thing.

1180
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:11,120
So, the newest set that they're including a lot of stunt driving options.

1181
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:15,120
Different vehicles, gear, and different props for creators.

1182
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:21,120
Including, like they have in this picture here, these giant metal tube cage things.

1183
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,120
That you could basically create this giant tube that you could drive through.

1184
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,120
Which looks all sorts of awesome.

1185
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:34,120
So, I really do need to go back and play some more Grand Theft Auto Online since it's been years since I've done that.

1186
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,120
And I haven't really done much in Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PlayStation 4.

1187
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,120
I need to go back.

1188
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,120
Is this a reason enough to go back for you?

1189
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,120
Yeah, actually I think it'd be pretty fun.

1190
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:51,120
The problem is a lot of the friends, a lot of the people I used to play with that were like,

1191
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,120
Oh yeah, we're totally gonna play all the time.

1192
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,120
They just don't.

1193
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:01,120
So, I just need to go back and try it.

1194
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,120
Alright. Well, moving on to something a little less violent.

1195
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,120
Minecraft is, believe it or not, celebrating its four year anniversary on consoles.

1196
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:15,120
Microsoft and Mojang did some birthday DLC to celebrate.

1197
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,120
There's a new skin pack out to celebrate the birthday.

1198
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,120
It looks very bright.

1199
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,120
So you can check that out.

1200
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:27,120
And all of the previous skin birthday pack bundles are also available now for a limited time.

1201
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,120
This is on Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

1202
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,120
You can download all four of them through tomorrow.

1203
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,120
But if you haven't gotten on that, you might want to hurry up and get on that.

1204
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,120
You have through May 16th or tomorrow.

1205
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,120
Which is probably today for many of you folks listening on the podcast.

1206
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,120
Also, Minecraft on the Wii U also getting a pretty big update.

1207
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,120
And yeah, the Super Mario Mashup Pack.

1208
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,120
It's happening. That's right.

1209
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:00,120
Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess, now gonna be characters in Minecraft.

1210
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,120
And get this, it's a free update.

1211
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,120
So they're really trying to make Minecraft Wii U something you want to check out.

1212
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,120
Even though it's been four years since Microsoft came out on other consoles.

1213
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,120
My son is totally stoked about that DLC.

1214
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,120
I told him about it, I'm like, you're gonna like this.

1215
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,120
He's like, oh, can I play it now? Can I play it now? No.

1216
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,120
Fifteen pieces of Super Mario music, item textures, forty skins,

1217
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,120
and a pre-made, I guess, Mushroom Kingdom world is gonna be there.

1218
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,120
They say the inspiration comes from Super Mario World, Super Mario 64,

1219
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,120
and yes, even Super Mario Sunshine.

1220
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:42,120
You can get a retail version June 17th for $29.99,

1221
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,120
and that includes the Super Mario Mashup content.

1222
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,120
The eShop game, by the way, will set you back $29.99,

1223
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,120
which I swear is more expensive than Minecraft on other consoles, am I right?

1224
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,120
I think so.

1225
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,120
That's the Nintendo premium.

1226
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,120
No, that's $29.99 is what it normally goes for.

1227
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,120
Alright, fair enough.

1228
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:08,120
Citizens of Earth is a game that has also now been delisted from the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

1229
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Oh, it's in that bundle too.

1230
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,120
It was, it was just in that Nintendo Humble Bundle,

1231
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,120
but now it is unavailable for purchase.

1232
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,120
Now, here's the thing, it's temporary, it's not permanent.

1233
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,120
This is similar to why VVVVV was removed recently,

1234
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:27,120
because there is an exploit in the game which will let hackers run unsigned code on the 3DS,

1235
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,120
God forbid we let them do that,

1236
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,120
which is pretty hilarious considering this game just was in that bundle.

1237
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,120
However, this was also the game where you got to pick,

1238
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,120
you could get it on the 3DS or the Wii U.

1239
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:46,120
You didn't get both, so hopefully you opted for the 3DS if you like to run unsigned code.

1240
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,120
The demo, also unavailable on the 3DS,

1241
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,120
so no word yet when they're going to be back up, but I would think soon.

1242
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,120
But if you did get these as part of the bundle, you're not affected.

1243
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,120
You just can't buy them yet.

1244
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:05,120
Music game fans, I'm sure, are excited to hear that DJ Max is going to get a new title coming out.

1245
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:09,120
It's coming out for the PlayStation 4 in January 2017,

1246
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,120
according to NeoWiz and developer Rocky Studios.

1247
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,120
It is DJ Max Respect.

1248
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,120
There will be a local two-player mode.

1249
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,120
You're going to be able to play online against other players, that's pretty cool.

1250
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,120
And I guess the track list is kind of like a greatest hits thing.

1251
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:28,120
DJ Max Portable 1 and 2 and 3 and Clasiquy and Black Square, Technica and Technica 3.

1252
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:35,120
So I'm assuming this is kind of a way to reintroduce DJ Max to people that may have missed it.

1253
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:43,120
I know that Technica was out on the Vita and stuff, but it kind of came and went.

1254
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:47,120
If you weren't really looking for music games, I don't know if you ever saw it.

1255
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,120
So hopefully they're going to give this one a little more exposure.

1256
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,120
I'm actually looking forward to this.

1257
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:57,120
As a music game fan, and especially I like BeatMania 2DX,

1258
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,120
and I feel like this is the closest thing we're ever going to get,

1259
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,120
even though it's not going to have a BeatMania controller.

1260
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,120
You use the controller to do it instead.

1261
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,120
I think it'll work okay. So I'm looking forward to it.

1262
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,120
So check that out. DJ Max Respect coming in January,

1263
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,120
which is not the greatest time to release a new game,

1264
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,120
but we'll see how that strategy plays out for him.

1265
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,120
Dark Sakura.

1266
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:23,120
Well Sega is doing a little bit of investigation.

1267
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:28,120
They are looking into seeing if they are going to do Shenmue remasters.

1268
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:35,120
They put out a fan inquiry from Sega Europe saying that it's something that the company would like to do,

1269
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,120
but it's not a simple process.

1270
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,120
So they're looking into it, and of course Shenmue 3 is currently in development by Eastnet,

1271
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,120
which is Yu Suzuki's studio.

1272
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,120
So hey, that'd be pretty cool.

1273
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,120
There's also found footage now.

1274
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,120
It's from a group that I really like, which is Unseen 64.

1275
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,120
I think it's the same people who have to do Beta64.

1276
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:07,120
A cancelled Akira game that was supposed to be on one of the 16-bit systems.

1277
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:12,120
It looks like both Genesis and SNES.

1278
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:19,120
So, I mean it would have been cool, but I'm looking at the intro of it right now,

1279
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,120
but there's like, yeah, the footage is basically from some kind of trade show.

1280
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,120
Although some of this I have to say, just with cutscenes and whatnot,

1281
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,120
kind of reminds me of TurboGrafx. You know, PC Engine stuff.

1282
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,120
Oh well. Looks like it was a neat little platformer.

1283
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:42,120
And then, last but not least, something I'm kind of excited about is the World of Warcraft cookbook.

1284
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,120
And it actually, I did find it on Amazon today.

1285
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,120
It says it's supposed to be released in October, but the Amazon pre-orders are up.

1286
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,120
And there are some pretty neat recipes in there.

1287
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:02,120
There's a variation of bear claws called Rylak claws,

1288
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:05,120
which are basically, you know, cinnamon buns in the shape of claws.

1289
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:14,120
There is a cherry grog, which basically, it's a sangria, but it looks pretty yummy.

1290
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,120
You know, all kinds of different stuff on there.

1291
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:23,120
Even a complete roast and several casseroles and a really good chili.

1292
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:29,120
So, I think I might actually end up buying that one because I could use some new ideas for cooking.

1293
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:37,120
Yes, and I will happily volunteer to eat all the food that you cook, provided that it's safe.

1294
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:49,120
Alright, well, let's get to it. We didn't get a ton of questions for this, but we got enough to do a little segment here for Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

1295
01:31:49,120 --> 01:32:01,120
Since I failed in doing a Fugu Question of the Week, instead we will provide answers to your questions.

1296
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,120
You also failed with playing the music too.

1297
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,120
In this segment, maybe I changed it.

1298
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:15,120
Alright, let's get to it. If you still want to send one, because I see Dark Tetsuya going, oh dang, I just had one, hurry up and get it in.

1299
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,120
We still got time because I only have a couple questions here.

1300
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:25,120
Let's get to it. Tonight from Stupi, Stoppi, not Stupi, Stoppi, two P's.

1301
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:32,120
Stoppi asked our first question tonight saying, what do you think about fans wanting a new Crash game?

1302
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:39,120
I think the fact that they want a return of Crash is a sign that reboots have gone too far and need to stop already.

1303
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:46,120
What's next? Hashtag bring back Bubsy? Well didn't the Bubsy thing already happen?

1304
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:52,120
And that turned out to be that it actually was in no way official and like a big scam sort of thing?

1305
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,120
I don't know.

1306
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,120
It was a mess. So be careful what you wish for, Stoppi.

1307
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:08,120
As far as Crash goes, see, I don't know. Early in the show, at the beginning of the show, I talked about Doom, which in some ways is a relaunch of an old franchise.

1308
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,120
It's kind of good. I'm enjoying it more than I enjoy Doom 3, to be quite honest.

1309
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:23,120
So I don't necessarily think that all reboots are bad. And I think Crash Bandicoot is one of those platformers, like if you were playing in the PlayStation era, you remember Crash Bandicoot.

1310
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:27,120
And so I think there's people that would really like to see what that would turn into now.

1311
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:34,120
I just, at the same time, I also understand that innovating new IPs is a great thing too.

1312
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,120
And that's how you get things like Splatoon. So it's a difficult little line to walk.

1313
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:50,120
But I really would mind, like if they came out and announced at E3 that we're going to do a new Crash Bandicoot game and all the rumors are true, he's back, here it is, I would check it out for sure.

1314
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,120
I'd be into that. Because I love the Crash Bandicoot games on the original PlayStation.

1315
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,120
What about you guys? Loki, Dark Soccer, would you be into a Crash reboot?

1316
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:59,120
I never played the first one.

1317
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,120
Really? Yeah, I wasn't really a fan of Crash Bandicoot.

1318
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,120
Wow. So I don't really care.

1319
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:08,120
Alright. I'm sure people want it. Good for them. I hope you get your reboot someday.

1320
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:15,120
Someone in chat says, bring back Jak and Dexter in Spyro the Dragon. Isn't Skylanders kind of a Spyro the Dragon spinoff?

1321
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,120
Yeah, Skylanders is the continuation of the Spyro story.

1322
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,120
I mean, it's kind of, you know, another universe. But I mean, it's what it is.

1323
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,120
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Crash remake is Frog Fractions 2.

1324
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,120
Whatever happened to Frog Fractions 2? Where is it?

1325
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,120
I think we've asked this last week.

1326
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,120
That frog now rides a unicycle.

1327
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,120
Maybe that's the joke all along. Who knows?

1328
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:53,120
William Murderface asks Orange Lounge Tonight, we have seen the RTS, the FPS, and no, the MOBA experience long periods of extreme success over the last 16 years.

1329
01:34:54,120 --> 01:35:00,120
What do you think the next genre is that will experience such a sudden and robust burst of popularity?

1330
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:05,120
Well, shit, if I knew that, I'm going to be a fucking millionaire because I'm going to make that game.

1331
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:12,120
This is the twerk controller. You have to control it with your ass and the faster that you twerk, the further your car goes along.

1332
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,120
Twerk Racer! There we go.

1333
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:21,120
I was going to make the easy joke, well, whatever brings us one step closer to the holodeck because that's what gaming is, right?

1334
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:33,120
But that leaves the easy answer to be VR. So my thought is maybe there's something in the VR space that can't be done in the regular space.

1335
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:42,120
And that's going to be the next big genre of gaming. I know that's a really vague answer, but again, if I knew the answer, I'm going to go make that game and make a ton of money.

1336
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,120
You can't really just create new genres. I don't know about that.

1337
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,120
Well, I mean, it's hard to come up with something completely different.

1338
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:59,120
It's hard, but you can do it. I mean, the MOBA came from somewhere, right? MOBAs came from the Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3.

1339
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:09,120
So they haven't been around since the dawn of time. There's no MOBAs on Atari 2600. So the genre got invented at some point. It's just, yeah, who knows where it's going to come from, right?

1340
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,120
Combat was the first MOBA.

1341
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:25,120
Combat. Do you want to be the blue tank or the red tank? Let's see. William Ritterface potentially suggesting you can have existing genres experience sudden popularity booms.

1342
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:34,120
So, okay. So like maybe there's an existing genre that will suddenly get lifted up. Well, you know, our hearts are going to say music games. They're going to make a comeback.

1343
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:43,120
They're going to make a comeback. They're going to, they're going to make that DJ Max will do it y'all. I don't know. I don't know. I wish. I hope. Maybe in VR.

1344
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:59,120
Um, I don't know. I just don't see anything really changing anytime soon. They've tried a lot of things and there are things that like last for a few years, like the whole Toys Life stuff, but like eventually it just kind of goes away.

1345
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:10,120
So, you know, I think we're going to get a lot of those different gimmicky types of gameplay, but I don't really know what exactly is going to be just there.

1346
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:21,120
I don't know. Um, okay. Let's see. How about like more kind of, uh, you know, interaction with your phone.

1347
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:37,120
So basically a lot of those games, like just dance, like all the Jackbox games are basically your phone is the controller. You know, you're able to just, you know, just load up the game on your TV and all your friends in the house can play because they have phones or something.

1348
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:47,120
I don't know exactly how you would, you know, narrow that down to a genre. Maybe that'll take off more party games, I guess. Yeah. All right. Fair enough. Phone enabled party games. How about that?

1349
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:59,120
All right. Jackbox is onto something a little early. All right. Uh, last question here from dark Tetsuya. So I was planning a best hits three, and I think that means a compilation of great OLR moments from the past.

1350
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:11,120
Um, I'm just missing episode 169 for one more clip and I seem to recall it aired on VOG sometime ago. Maybe you can hook a brother up, um, for you, of course, if I, if I have it in my archive somewhere.

1351
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:23,120
Uh, 169 sounds like around the time we would have been airing the repeats on DDR freak, which happened for a very short time. You guys might not remember, but OLR was on DDR freak radio.

1352
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:37,120
Like in repeats, I think it was like probably a year or two before the, the all games thing. And one didn't have anything to do with the other. It's just DDR freak kind of closed at one point or they closed DDR freak radio at some point.

1353
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:47,120
Probably. I think when we got off live 365, they got off like 365. I think is what happened. I think that's a, that was the whole deal. How is live 365 doing nowadays?

1354
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:56,120
Actually, you know what? It's fucking funny. You ain't, well, not funny, but it's interesting. You asked that because I was curious about that same question. They closed this year.

1355
01:38:56,120 --> 01:39:11,120
They are gone as of, I think January 31st was their last day running. So life is five ended. Uh, yeah. So it was kind of, I, I remember making a tweet about it going, wow, I just found out like three weeks after the fact that life is five is done.

1356
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:28,120
Um, in fact, I know, uh, there's a lot of websites out there that sell like radio streaming stuff, um, that are actually catering to former live 365 broadcasters saying, Hey, come host your stuff with us and all that. So life is five went away.

1357
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:40,120
Um, and I don't know all the reasons that went into it, but you know, it's just, I guess with all the laws and everything, it got too expensive to do things the way they wanted to do them. So there you go.

1358
01:39:41,120 --> 01:40:02,120
Uh, all right. Let's see, uh, dark Tetsuya in chat says that was the last episode before you guys switched to the podcast and discontinued the to go technically. Was it really? 169 was that episode. So that would have been the one cause it wasn't, wasn't that the last time mistress Tia was here on the show before she moved to New York.

1359
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:16,120
I almost positive. It was, I feel like she was on the very, very last show, uh, before we merged the live show and the podcast and all that. Ah, the history of orange lounge radio. At one point we were doing a three hour live show and a one hour podcast.

1360
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:28,120
So if you weren't here for the three hour live show, you didn't hear it, but anybody could hear the podcast. But then suddenly we all kind of sat here going, you know, four hours is a long time to be here.

1361
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:43,120
So we changed things a little bit and I think it worked out all right. Anyway, thank you for the questions tonight. Appreciate that. And I apologize for failing on the football question. Uh, but you know, ask orange lounge is fun to do once in a while too. Let's get back into some more news. Loki.

1362
01:40:44,120 --> 01:41:05,120
All right. So there's some, it's another week. So you know what that means? More NX rumors. Yay. So this week we have that the rumor that the NX is not going to be using x 86 architecture and that, um, if you're expecting the graphics to be blowing away the PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1363
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:23,120
Yeah, that's not going to be the case. So, you know, what they're saying is that it might be, you know, graphics wise, it might be a little bit closer to like the Xbox one instead of the PlayStation four. Um, but it's not going to be anything like, you know, two times as powerful as the PlayStation four or anything like that.

1364
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:35,120
There's basically the NX has a very, like a custom made chip. The overall design is very modern. Um, it's not going to be, you know, based off of like the Polaris chip or Polaris architecture.

1365
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:49,120
And you know, basically, you know, um, everything that, you know, this person's heard Emily Rogers is indicates that the NX isn't going to blow away any of the consoles on the market today, except for the Wii U.

1366
01:41:49,120 --> 01:42:18,120
Well, that's a little bit of a disappointment, but whatever. I'm so sick of NX rumors. Show me the fucking console already. I don't like, I don't know. I just, I hear NX rumors. No, no offense to you, Loki. It's just, just in general on the internet, on Twitter, I hear NX rumors and my eyes just kind of glaze over and I'm just like, the other thing, the other rumor I had, which wasn't necessarily a part of that story, but I was gonna bring it up later anyway. So I just figured this right about the same time. Um, this is coming from, let's see here.

1367
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:44,120
Uh, Kimishima and basically saying that, you know, the NX, it's not going to be a successor to the Wii U nor the 3DS. It's going to be something different. And basically saying that since it's neither a successor to the Wii or 3DS, it's a new way of playing games, which I think will have a larger impact than the Wii U, but I don't feel that it's a pure replacement for the Wii U.

1368
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:59,120
I don't know what that means. Once again, we still don't know what the hell this is. And I think they really should come out and say what it is because right now we are having all these like crazy expectations and then they're going to reveal it and it's gonna be like, oh.

1369
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:19,120
Well, gamers start now, set that bar really low. That way, when this is announced, it can exceed your expectations. So I'm just gonna tell y'all, set the bar low. So maybe I am okay with rumors that, well guys, the chipset in it isn't very good. That way the bar is set pretty low.

1370
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:36,120
And even still, I mean, you know, look at like the Wii U and how they, you know, first showed off. Hey, we've got this like tech demo that's gonna show you the equivalent, you know, of the graphics that you're gonna see on the Wii U with Zelda and is like, no, we never really saw that.

1371
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:47,120
I love this. Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, I remember when they said the DS was not a successor to the Game Boy. Yet it was fully backwards compatible with Game Boy games.

1372
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:56,120
You can play Game Boy games, yes. So just props to Nintendo for at least being backwards compatible for the previous generation. So I will give them that.

1373
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:05,120
Well, except for GameCube, of course, obviously I didn't play Nintendo 64 controllers or, you know, cartridges, but so far they've been not bad.

1374
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:14,120
Tigerclaw in chat says, what can Nintendo possibly do that hasn't been done already? Have sex with me.

1375
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:21,120
I don't know. They had, what can they possibly do that hasn't been done already? They did that with the Wii, so I think there's lots that they can do.

1376
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:28,120
Well, but even with the Wii, it wasn't necessarily that motion gaming had never been done. It just had never been done well or on that level.

1377
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:32,120
And to be honest, it did it okay. I mean, it wasn't great.

1378
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:39,120
Which is why I was afraid that the NX might have been virtual reality at first. I don't think it is at this point.

1379
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:47,120
But, you know, when these, you know, when the hype first started, that's why I was kind of like, I wonder if they're going to try and get into VR things since this is where everybody else is.

1380
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:52,120
And yeah, go ahead and make all the Virtual Boy jokes you want, but it's different now. It's different now.

1381
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,120
I think it could be pretty cool if they did that.

1382
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,120
Yeah.

1383
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,120
I mean, who wouldn't want to see Nintendo games in VR?

1384
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,120
Ooh, depend on the Nintendo game, but yeah.

1385
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:07,120
It would be, but like, imagine if like their controller wasn't like just a normal controller, but I'm not saying like a power glove.

1386
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:14,120
I can't wait for them to put F-Zero in VR so I can just throw up every projectile vomit everywhere because that's what would happen.

1387
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,120
Oh, you can play that in VR now.

1388
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:20,120
I know, and I have, and I've been like, okay, this might be a bit too fast.

1389
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,120
There's no such thing.

1390
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:31,120
TigerKlon chat says, maybe the NX is a system that you jack into like the Matrix and you're in the game.

1391
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:41,120
I mean, realistically, like if they could do something that would like, I want them to surprise me in a way that's like, holy crap, that is an amazing idea.

1392
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:48,120
I just, right now, my expectations are so low with them and it's, it's like they do the bare minimum to get by.

1393
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:55,120
It's not going to help, especially if they're going to make a system that's going to be on par with the Xbox One.

1394
01:45:56,120 --> 01:46:01,120
That may work for a while, but now all these other consoles are getting upgrades and now their games are going to be compatible.

1395
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,120
You're going to be in the same fucking position again.

1396
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,120
Yeah, I do worry about that for sure.

1397
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:10,120
Moving on to talk a little bit about EA and their comments on the Nintendo NX.

1398
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:14,120
They have actually told the BBC in an interview this following quote.

1399
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:20,120
I personally and the company are huge fans of Nintendo. They're the reason why I started making games.

1400
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:26,120
We're in constant communication with them and when they come to market something, and if it makes sense for us, we'll be there.

1401
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:35,120
So, kind of a, I don't know, very walking the line type of response where they're not committing to developing for the NX, but basically saying,

1402
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:43,120
if we see dollar signs, we're going to go chase those dollar signs, which, duh, that's how it works.

1403
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:50,120
And for whatever reason, they didn't see dollar signs on the Wii U, probably because of the not so great sales in the first year, so everybody ran away.

1404
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:55,120
And also the fact that most of their engines, everything was like in frostbite, so that didn't run on the Wii U.

1405
01:46:55,120 --> 01:47:07,120
True. Which is, although, again, as a reminder, which is why everybody ran away, or which is why, excuse me, why the NX got pushed back,

1406
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:15,120
was because I think they're trying to attract more of these third parties and have that stronger launch so that out the gate they sell a ton of them.

1407
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:22,120
Interesting though, since we're thinking EA, we just had that story earlier on about Mass Effect is coming out in the first part of 2017.

1408
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:31,120
We know that Mass Effect Andromeda is a new story, it's not going to tie to the original trilogy really,

1409
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:38,120
certainly the save games are not going to import, so could we see Andromeda on the NX?

1410
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,120
Or whatever Nintendo ends up calling it. I hate that we still call it the NX to this day.

1411
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:48,120
Well, because we don't know anything because Nintendo's not telling us anything, and I find that very frustrating.

1412
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:57,120
Alright, well, yeah, so EA just basically saying if it makes money then we're going to go get some of that money. Yep, makes sense.

1413
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,120
DarkSaga!

1414
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:09,120
Well this makes me super happy because Dan, first of all, super freaking loves the crap out of this game.

1415
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:14,120
And I super love the crap out of this game too, but not to the extent that Dan does.

1416
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:22,120
Natsume is rebooting an old SNES game called Wild Guns for Playstation 4.

1417
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:35,120
The original Wild Guns came out in 1994 and it had a shooting gallery style of gameplay with these,

1418
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:43,120
well I guess the only good word to describe it is anachronistic weapons, so just things that didn't belong at that time.

1419
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:52,120
But now Natsume is going to be working on Wild Guns Reloaded and they're bringing back the original characters, Clint and Annie.

1420
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:57,120
And who knows, we might have some more characters, but they're going to be revealing something at E3.

1421
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,120
I mean, how many of you guys remember this game?

1422
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,120
Wild Guns? I don't think I ever played it. Yeah, I never played it.

1423
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:09,120
I didn't. It was good. I mean, there were better games, but it was good.

1424
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:15,120
I knew you'd be into this when you heard about this though, because I figured this was a game that was more up your alley.

1425
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:18,120
Well, it's an actual classic as opposed to Halo.

1426
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:24,120
Stop. Stopeianchat says, I haven't played the first, but looking forward to the new Wild Guns.

1427
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,120
Yeah.

1428
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,120
Alright. Well, moving on. Loki.

1429
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,120
Alright.

1430
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:38,120
You know, I want to say I think I played Wild Guns at the arcade a long time ago.

1431
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:46,120
You know, something that actually is kind of interesting, and I hate reading this news because I so wanted them to fail with this,

1432
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:55,120
but apparently Konami has had profits go up since they decided to not make console games anymore.

1433
01:49:55,120 --> 01:50:05,120
And yeah, I mean, I guess that's cool. They're saying that the mobile and fitness revenue has gone down 2.8%,

1434
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:12,120
and I guess Pachinko fell 17.8%, but the gambling division climbed to 1.4%.

1435
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,120
I'm trying to see where they're making up all their money.

1436
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:23,120
Company-wide though, the revenue is up 14.6%, and with a major jump in operating income.

1437
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:32,120
So don't expect console stuff from Konami in the future. What about, how does Metal Gear Solid 5 play into that?

1438
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:38,120
Yeah, I kind of wondered that as well, and they're saying, you know, despite the successes in fiscal year 2016,

1439
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,120
Konami expects revenues to decline in the new year.

1440
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:48,120
So I want to see, is that like, could they be up because of like, you know, Metal Gear Solid 5?

1441
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:57,120
I mean, are they talking about that they're down as far as operating costs because they don't have to pay for the development of Metal Gear Solid 5?

1442
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,120
Well, yes. Yes, actually, I'm pretty sure is part of it.

1443
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:08,120
I don't know. I'm not a financial analyst, but we'll see. We'll see how they actually do in the long term,

1444
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,120
because right now, I mean, it's too early, I think, to see.

1445
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:17,120
And especially when they're talking about, you know, that their mobile and fitness and Pachinko has gone down,

1446
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,120
that doesn't sound good if that's all you're going to be relying on.

1447
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:27,120
So we'll see what happens from Konami in the next year, but it doesn't seem like they're going to really be developing a whole lot of games.

1448
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:32,120
Although, I mean, we talked about one last week. It was a small one, but it was like that Japanese, you know, board game.

1449
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,120
So there's little things here and there, but it's just, it's not going to be what it was. Those days are gone.

1450
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:42,120
Could you maybe license out Dance Dance Revolution to somebody else?

1451
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:45,120
Dream on. Dream on.

1452
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,120
All right, well, hey, I know a lot of you guys are looking forward to Overwatch.

1453
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:55,120
Overwatch is going to be coming out at the end of the month on May 24th, but don't cheat.

1454
01:51:56,120 --> 01:52:01,120
Don't be a dick and cheat at Overwatch. And there is no single player mode in Overwatch, which, you know, I have my issues with.

1455
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:05,120
So if you're cheating in the game, you're really only doing it to hurt other people.

1456
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:10,120
And so Blizzard is going to fuck you up if you try to cheat in Overwatch.

1457
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:15,120
A community manager for Blizzard actually posted on the Battle.net forum saying, quote,

1458
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:21,120
If a player is found to be cheating or using hacks, bots, or third-party software that provides any sort of unfair advantage,

1459
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:25,120
that player will be permanently banned from the game. Full stop.

1460
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:29,120
Not only does cheating undermine the spirit of fair play that all of our products are based on,

1461
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:32,120
but it works to diminish the fun and enjoyment of others.

1462
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:37,120
This goes on to say, basically, first-time offenders will be permanently banned.

1463
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:41,120
There's not going to be a cheater island or anything like that.

1464
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:44,120
Not even going to be a temporary ban. Just buy.

1465
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:50,120
Which is going to be very interesting considering if they ban you from Overwatch, you just spent $60 on a turd,

1466
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,120
because there is, again, no single player campaign.

1467
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:57,120
So you will have nothing left to play if you get banned from Overwatch.

1468
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,120
So I'm really waiting to see how this whole,

1469
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:06,120
Oh, that was my little brother that played on my account that did that and got me banned.

1470
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,120
Please unban me. Although, honestly, my response would be,

1471
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,120
Well, you shouldn't have let your little brother play on the fucking game then.

1472
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:17,120
But you know people are going to be, quote, unquote, falsely banned,

1473
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:20,120
and this could come back to bite Blizzard.

1474
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:23,120
So I wonder how strong they're really going to be.

1475
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:29,120
But we'll see. They're saying they're going to ban them the first time, but I don't know.

1476
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,120
We'll see.

1477
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,120
You wouldn't cheat at Overwatch online, would you, Loki?

1478
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,120
I know sometimes you use hacks and mods, but you wouldn't use it in Overwatch, would you?

1479
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,120
I wouldn't even play Overwatch again.

1480
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:41,120
I guess that works.

1481
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,120
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1482
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:49,120
Every week you guys send us emails over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

1483
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:56,120
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and she will pull out some emails to read here.

1484
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,120
Or one.

1485
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,120
Just one email to read live on here?

1486
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,120
Just one.

1487
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,120
Alright, well let's get to tonight's emails.

1488
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:12,120
First one and only one. Hi, OLR.

1489
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:19,120
I recently enjoyed your gaming stories about your mothers and grandparents in the Mother's Day episode and just wanted to share my own.

1490
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,120
This is about my grandmother.

1491
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:26,120
She was the big gamer and the one who got myself and my sister into gaming.

1492
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:32,120
I remember summer days when school was out and Grandma would just watch us while my parents were at work during the day.

1493
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,120
She had the NES, the SNES, and the Sega Genesis.

1494
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:40,120
When it was too hot and humid to play outside, she would let us sit on her bed and we would all take turns playing the game systems.

1495
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:42,120
She had basically every game you could dream of.

1496
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,120
She bought my sister and I the N64 when it came out.

1497
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:49,120
She had an ulterior motive. She wanted to play Yoshi's Story.

1498
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:55,120
And I will always cherish the memories of sitting in her room on rainy days watching her play Echo the Dolphin.

1499
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:01,120
When she passed away my freshman year of high school, I couldn't bring myself to game for two years.

1500
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:06,120
Final Fantasy X and some time to heal finally pulled me back into the gaming hobby.

1501
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:11,120
And I came to realize how much I could honor her memory just by doing this thing we both love so much.

1502
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:17,120
She left my sister and I, bad grammar, sister and me, the SNES and Genesis.

1503
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:23,120
All her save files were still there and all her manuals had level codes written in the back under the notes.

1504
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,120
And we could hear her in our minds saying, don't mess with my save.

1505
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,120
That's lovely.

1506
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:35,120
So much from my mom in gaming. She had a Game Boy and played so much Tetris. So. Much.

1507
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:40,120
Thanks so much for making my Monday mornings at work so much more bearable, Megan.

1508
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:43,120
Or I think I'm Megantron on your forums.

1509
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:46,120
Well, thank you, Megantron, for the email. I appreciate you sharing the story.

1510
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:49,120
And I give everyone crap for bad grammar, so don't worry about it.

1511
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:52,120
And Akuma JP in our chat says, wow, cool grandma.

1512
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,120
Seriously.

1513
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:55,120
Agreed.

1514
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:58,120
Mine would be like, Jamie, turn that down. I'm trying to read the Bible.

1515
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,120
Something like that anyway. I don't know.

1516
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:10,120
All right. Well, if you want to email us some cool stories, do it. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1517
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:14,120
In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.

1518
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:43,120
FU to a particular intersection and a particular camera that lies

1519
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,120
lies. I'm an L.A. lies. Video doesn't lie.

1520
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:50,120
What?

1521
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:52,120
Take video.

1522
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,120
There's no video attached to mine.

1523
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,120
They usually do. Lies.

1524
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:02,120
That's my story and I'm sticking to it. So I got to go stick it to the man tomorrow.

1525
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,120
Maybe he likes getting sick. I don't know.

1526
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:07,120
Loki.

1527
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,120
Yeah, because I see like I got one of those two making a right turn.

1528
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:13,120
I'm like, ah, you know, I stopped in time.

1529
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,120
Were they going to link to the vehicle?

1530
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:17,120
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1531
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:19,120
Enough of that.

1532
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:25,120
I guess just F.U. to do my headache right now and, you know, in general F.U.

1533
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:31,120
I really I don't understand why they can't carry Android gaming consoles or controllers.

1534
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:36,120
I mean, not like just even as a supply and demand thing.

1535
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:44,120
I mean, you'd think that if like you pass by, for example, that sells both the phones and tablets and the Samsung Gear VR,

1536
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:50,120
you think that they would want to carry a controller that because a lot of the games do use especially Minecraft,

1537
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:54,120
which my fucking God is like one of the biggest games out there that requires a controller.

1538
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,120
You're reiterating everything you said.

1539
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:02,120
I understand that. I'm just saying I don't I don't understand why they don't just this is something we don't care.

1540
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:04,120
You're still mad two hours later.

1541
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:09,120
You do want me to come into your store, right? Because that's the only reason I was coming in there.

1542
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:14,120
All right. My F.U. of the week goes to the fact that the weekend wasn't long enough.

1543
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:18,120
I went to San Francisco recently yesterday to see a friend that was missing from Hawaii.

1544
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:22,120
And it's like, oh, my God, the night just like flew by like we got into the city at like five.

1545
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:25,120
And then like I turn around and it's nine o'clock like already it's crazy.

1546
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:28,120
So, yeah, the weekend just flew by.

1547
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:33,120
But I'm actually thankful because I took Friday off.

1548
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:35,120
Why?

1549
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:38,120
Because I can go ride that new Mass Effect ride.

1550
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,120
And I'm hoping that it's so good.

1551
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:42,120
Jamie will go back.

1552
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:45,120
They won't let me get off on Friday.

1553
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:47,120
Don't. Well, we're going to we'll go another time.

1554
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:49,120
Saturday.

1555
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:51,120
All right. I'll go back the next day.

1556
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:54,120
Exactly. But I'm very excited.

1557
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:57,120
So on the next episode of the show, I'll be able to tell you all how that was.

1558
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,120
Oh, shoot. Next Saturday.

1559
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:01,120
What?

1560
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:03,120
I'm going shopping for makeup.

1561
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,120
Oh, gee.

1562
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:06,120
No, no, no. Not just any makeup.

1563
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,120
Not not just any makeup.

1564
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:14,120
I'm going to this place in an old Sacramento called Evangeline's Closet Man.

1565
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:16,120
Yeah, I know that costume and costume mansion.

1566
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,120
Yeah. Why does he closet?

1567
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:21,120
Tell everybody where you're going to be so the fans can find you.

1568
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:27,120
I'm going to be buying my makeup for my very first drag cosplay.

1569
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:29,120
Fun.

1570
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:31,120
And it's specifically drag cosplay.

1571
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,120
OK, because this is something you're doing for GamerX.

1572
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:35,120
It is. All right.

1573
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,120
Oh, I know what you're doing, too. It'll be fun.

1574
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,120
Yeah. Yeah. So but I've got to Jamie does elaborate cosplay.

1575
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:42,120
She doesn't like she doesn't do it.

1576
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,120
I don't fuck around.

1577
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:50,120
Fair enough. And from here forward, I've decided that all of my cosplays are not going to be conventional.

1578
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:54,120
And just for the record, I am not cosplaying when I go to Green America to ride the ride.

1579
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:57,120
But I will wear the hat and I'll have the red beard.

1580
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:59,120
So like, I'll be casual Joker.

1581
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:01,120
OK, you'll be Joker's day off, is it?

1582
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:03,120
You'll be shore leave Joker.

1583
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:07,120
And that's exactly what it is to shore leave Joker, shore leave Joker.

1584
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,120
So there you go.

1585
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:23,120
All right. I would I would love to do a nice little video like Bobby does, because, you know, Bobby takes a road trip and suddenly there's a Tesla road trip video on Vogue that people are finding and commenting on, which, by the way, he just recently did one, if you didn't know.

1586
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:30,120
And it's it's cool. Like, if you like to see parts of America that you might actually not drive on yourself someday, these videos are a lot of fun.

1587
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,120
And he talks about some of the little Easter eggs and stuff in the Tesla.

1588
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:35,120
So he he just put one of those videos on Vogue Network.

1589
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:41,120
If I had the kind of camera he had, I would just I don't think they'll let you film the ride because it is a movie.

1590
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,120
But you could see the show building.

1591
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:45,120
You could see the queue.

1592
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,120
You could see if they have any characters.

1593
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:56,120
Like, I would try to get you an immediate reaction. I try to show you everything but the actual movie itself, which is probably illegal to film, although it'll probably turn up on YouTube soon enough anyway.

1594
02:00:57,120 --> 02:01:02,120
But yeah, I don't have those same toys, sadly.

1595
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:09,120
Bobby Blackwolf, though, says if I use my phone camera and send him the files, maybe maybe we can work something out.

1596
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:11,120
We'll try to I'll see what I can do.

1597
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:13,120
All right.

1598
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:18,120
There we go. So that's it for the FUs of the Week. Let's go on to Loki.

1599
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:27,120
All right. So Capcom has promised that they're going to be giving their games a little bit more polished time.

1600
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:29,120
They're not in a hurry to release them.

1601
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:36,120
Apparently, you know, Street Fighter V was plagued with a number of issues and they promised that they're not going to do that again.

1602
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:37,120
They're going to give it more time.

1603
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:45,120
It's trying to release the game so that it can make it for fighting game tournaments and get some extra money out.

1604
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,120
I don't know.

1605
02:01:48,120 --> 02:02:00,120
They say this now, but then, you know, I want to say that both PlayStation and Xbox have talked about having those early access type games available.

1606
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:04,120
So it makes me wonder if they're not just going to release this shit anyways.

1607
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:08,120
And they also promise this now, but doesn't mean that that shit's not going to come out un-bolish anyways.

1608
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:13,120
Act. Or Ubisoft. Looking at you.

1609
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:25,120
You know, I don't know if this is true or not, but there was a story float around the interwebs this week that, um, Pokken Tournament has sold more than Street Fighter V has at this point.

1610
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:29,120
Now, that strikes me as one of those, like, Facebook memes that isn't really true.

1611
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:32,120
But I just thought I'd throw that out there because I see that float around everywhere.

1612
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:38,120
And it's one of those things where it's like, I kind of could see it. Like, it does make sense.

1613
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:43,120
But I don't know. I really need to see the cold hard facts first.

1614
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:45,120
Let's see here.

1615
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:48,120
This is apparently early April NPD numbers. Or something.

1616
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:51,120
Early April. Well, they don't have numbers anymore. They just have ranks.

1617
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:55,120
Because they don't give out the full breakdowns of those anymore.

1618
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:57,120
Interesting.

1619
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:00,120
They just do, like, here's the top ten selling games of whatever.

1620
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:09,120
Somebody tweeted it. But it would, for the month of April, it wouldn't matter anyway because Pokken came out a month before.

1621
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:14,120
So you're not going to be able to see, like, it's not going to be the same month.

1622
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:18,120
Well, you should see, like, we'll see right now. Let's take a look.

1623
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:20,120
Alright, alright.

1624
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:24,120
So, April. Okay, so the global top sellers. Let's see here.

1625
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:32,120
I don't even see Pokken on there. Was this in all regions or were they just talking about US?

1626
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,120
I don't know.

1627
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:41,120
Let's look at US. Okay, that's... I need more than just the top ten here.

1628
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,120
Let me dig and see what I can find.

1629
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,120
Alright, fair enough.

1630
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:52,120
Okay, so meanwhile, I'm surprised you didn't do this one Dark Sakura, but I guess we saved this one for the very, very end.

1631
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:54,120
We saved the best for last Dark Sakura.

1632
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:59,120
And that is that the Five Nights at Freddy's series is getting remade for consoles.

1633
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:05,120
That's right, you can poop your pants all over again playing Five Nights at Freddy's, but this time on consoles.

1634
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:10,120
Just wait for the avalanche of Let's Play videos on the PlayStation 4.

1635
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:15,120
Not that I'm one to make fun because that was probably the last Let's Play I did, was Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

1636
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:22,120
So, yeah, the original Five Nights at Freddy's games, Scott Cawthon has said on the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Steam forum,

1637
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:29,120
Yes, it will happen. I'm talking with a few companies who are interested in doing console remakes of the original games.

1638
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:35,120
Assuming that original games means no Five Nights at Freddy's World, but I don't think anyone's gonna miss that.

1639
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:37,120
So, there you go.

1640
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:45,120
Remember, Five Nights was made in Clickteam Fusion and it's not exactly something you can just, it's not like Unity where you can just pretty easily port it over to the consoles.

1641
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,120
So, they may have to rebuild these games.

1642
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:53,120
So, you may not get the exact same Five Nights games that we had before.

1643
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,120
So, these are looking to be maybe a full-on remake.

1644
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:00,120
I wonder if a company isn't just gonna make one giant game that's all four games kind of in one.

1645
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:03,120
I wouldn't doubt that that's gonna end up being the thing, but we'll see.

1646
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:11,120
We'll see. Possible E3 announcement? Wouldn't Sony or Microsoft love to say that they got that one? Coming out this Halloween?

1647
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:13,120
We'll see.

1648
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:18,120
We will see. Alright. That is it for Stories tonight.

1649
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:26,120
So, let's go to our Skypline 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1650
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:31,120
And while we wait for the Skypline ring, we can do some last minute stories.

1651
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:34,120
I don't know if you have any, Loki. I know I got one real quick.

1652
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,120
I am still looking at the chart.

1653
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:38,120
Oh, you're still trying to figure out that whole chart thing?

1654
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:46,120
Well, Alan had actually sent me this one that he talked to me about, and I forgot to mention this earlier in the show, but we were kind of laughing about this the other night.

1655
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:55,120
EA was on a phone call with investors this week and said that they are making an action game, that they have an action game in the works.

1656
02:05:55,120 --> 02:06:01,120
And I guess it's supposed to be an Assassin's Creed style game, which is interesting because that's an Ubisoft game.

1657
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:09,120
But EA is doing it, and it is slated for fiscal year 2020 or 2021.

1658
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:11,120
Who cares at this point?

1659
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:17,120
So, we're talking about games that are four to five years out already.

1660
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:26,120
Well, I mean, we kind of laugh and all that, but at the same time, dude, high definition games and all that, they take a long time to make sometimes.

1661
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:33,120
And, you know, it's an interesting follow up to your whole fact that Capcom is saying they need to spend more time on the development cycle and so forth.

1662
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:40,120
That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm spending more time on my development cycle, which is why I don't have any progress whatsoever on my game.

1663
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:49,120
Alan Acme in chat says, why talk about it? Who cares? I guess the investors, I guess investors want to know. We got plans to keep us fiscally...

1664
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:54,120
We got first person shooter game coming out in five years. Whoa, that's totally unique.

1665
02:06:55,120 --> 02:07:00,120
William Murderface says, that is the same year we will finally see Kingdom Hearts 3.

1666
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:06,120
Sadly true. Very, very, very true.

1667
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:11,120
Alright, so we'll have that to look forward to, I guess.

1668
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:18,120
They could show the trailer for this mysterious game and then release it in five years. I mean, shit, look at Final Fantasy XV.

1669
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:26,120
When was that first shown? Is Final Fantasy XIII vs. 2004? I don't remember. It was a while ago.

1670
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:33,120
Anyway, again, 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

1671
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:38,120
Meanwhile, Loki, are you alright over there? No, IRC keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. It's annoying.

1672
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:40,120
Well, that's not nice.

1673
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:52,120
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, hey, there's that movie with John Malkovich where they said they released the trailer and said it wasn't going to be shown until 2115.

1674
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:59,120
Yeah, but you expect that at an art film. That type of thing is going to happen.

1675
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:07,120
Although, hey, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't they have their releases calendared through at least, like what, 2019 at least, right?

1676
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:13,120
If not 2020. How far does the Marvel schedule go out? At least 2019.

1677
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:18,120
It's not that far. I mean, I guess, yeah, 2019 is not that far, all things considered.

1678
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:29,120
Yeah, the rumor is Street Fighter V sold 670,000 units and Pokken Tournament was 680,000.

1679
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:37,120
But they're saying, you know, that's what VG charts says. I looked at VG charts, they don't have numbers for those.

1680
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:41,120
So I, that's a whole load of shit.

1681
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:47,120
That's what, when I read that, I'm kind of like, I'm taking it with a grain of salt. Not that I think it's impossible and can't be true, but it just, it does seem kind of steep.

1682
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:53,120
And they're saying that's just on PlayStation 4, you know, so if you add the PC numbers, that puts it over your Pokken Tournament.

1683
02:08:54,120 --> 02:09:00,120
And I, that seems awfully high for Pokken Tournament too, to be honest. I just don't see it selling that well.

1684
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:09,120
Alan Alchemy pointing out to my Marvel example, yes, the Marvel and DC timelines go to 2020 and 2021, but we know their names and logos already.

1685
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:14,120
Even though, you know, that is a difference. This EA thing, we don't even know that.

1686
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:26,120
SHO 100 Matt is pointing out some random Bimani DDR news. Apparently a few classic licensed DDR songs are going to be removed from DDR A, according to Bimani style, and then links us to the story.

1687
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:37,120
Yeah, I heard about that. Dark Tetsuya had posted somewhere about that. And yeah, I read like some of the, some of the old DDR songs, like If You Were Here With Me and what, Bad Girls, all this stuff that's like licensed.

1688
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:47,120
Well, not all of it, but a big chunk of like licensed classic songs. I'm assuming the license just kind of ran out. So that's why those are going away, I suppose.

1689
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:55,120
All right. I'll put out one more call for calls 1-877-GMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1690
02:09:56,120 --> 02:10:03,120
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I just looked it up here at the individual tiles and that's where they're showing. I, it's still, I don't, I'm not buying it.

1691
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:09,120
And also I don't know if these are complete figures because that's not, I don't know if this is including digital sales as well.

1692
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:11,120
So there's a lot of stuff that we don't know.

1693
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:20,120
Well, good for you fact checking before you just reblog it or re Tumblr it or, or what do they call it on Facebook? Share it.

1694
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:29,120
Here you go. All right. Well, the phones, the phones are not lining up tonight. People are, people are being shy or I, I know Rama's not in chat.

1695
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:35,120
So some of our, I don't think I see ActDeaf either. So I think some of our frequent callers are away tonight. Are they Game of Thrones fans?

1696
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:37,120
Yeah, that's on tonight.

1697
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,120
Sharing of swords.

1698
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:45,120
I guess. All right. Well, that's going to do it. I guess, I guess we're a little early, but I'm not going to drag the show out. We're done with the news and everything.

1699
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:51,120
So that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show and sticking with us.

1700
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,120
Hope we were able to entertain you either on Sunday night or Monday or whenever throughout the week you listen to this.

1701
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:01,120
And thank you, by the way, for checking out OLR. Thank you for spending some of your week with us. We appreciate it.

1702
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:06,120
Hey, we don't ask for your money. All we ask, help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show.

1703
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:13,120
Spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio, because as you can see, if we don't get some of your friends here, nobody's going to call us.

1704
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:17,120
This was kind of cool. One thing, one last-minute story.

1705
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:22,120
We didn't mention it. There's a new Dreamcast game that's being developed.

1706
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:27,120
Xenocider is a game that they're developing right now for PC, 3DS, and Dreamcast.

1707
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:29,120
And Dreamcast?

1708
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:32,120
And it's a similar game to like Sin and Punishment. It's an on-rails shooter game.

1709
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:34,120
And Dreamcast?

1710
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:35,120
And Dreamcast.

1711
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:40,120
I love that they're still making Dreamcast games in 2016. That warms my cold, black little heart.

1712
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:45,120
Alright, I need to get out my Dreamcast, play some Space Channel 5 and then some NES emulators.

1713
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:47,120
Let's do some Power Stone.

1714
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:49,120
Good times.

1715
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:51,120
Powerful!

1716
02:11:52,120 --> 02:12:02,120
Alright, well, that is really going to wrap it up. I already gave you the spiel about telling a friend or five about the show, but I didn't say a nice five-star rating on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast goes a long way.

1717
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:05,120
We're going to go around and give everybody's final thought for the night.

1718
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,120
Dark Soccer, you get to go have cheesecake early.

1719
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:09,120
I'm going to get some cheesecake.

1720
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:11,120
Final thought for our listeners tonight?

1721
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:20,120
Um. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh.

1722
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,120
I think you broke. We broke Dark Soccer, everybody.

1723
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:30,120
My final thought for the night is I am looking forward to Mass Effect and roller coasters on Friday.

1724
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:35,120
And Bobby has worked out a plan where, yes, we can do video. Bobby Black Wolf saves the day.

1725
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:40,120
I don't like to say that a lot. I'm not going to say that phrase a lot on the show, but it's true in this case for sure.

1726
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:42,120
Uh, Loki, your final thought?

1727
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:44,120
Maybe I'll work on my game tonight.

1728
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:46,120
You say that every week.

1729
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:49,120
Maybe I'll go learn to skydive tonight.

1730
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:52,120
Don't do it, Lodi.

1731
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:57,120
Skydiving is really not that hard. You just kind of let gravity take you and not die.

1732
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,120
I hope you don't have holes in your parachute.

1733
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:03,120
Especially the indoor skydiving. They have a new thing in Roseville, like indoor skydiving.

1734
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:05,120
They do in Roseville?

1735
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:07,120
I would do that shit.

1736
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:10,120
Oh well, our team building day, you guys. Let's all go indoor skydiving.

1737
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:14,120
And then we'll film it. That could be another thing that I'll film and send to Bobby.

1738
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:18,120
Guess what? I'm going to fill up your inbox, Bobby.

1739
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:21,120
Indoor skydiving. That'll be fun.

1740
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:24,120
Alright. Look forward to it.

Have a great week and we will see you in seven days, hopefully with some more guests in the studio as well.

02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:35,120
Looking forward to another fun OLR next week.

Thanks for listening. See you next time.

You may not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

See you next week.
