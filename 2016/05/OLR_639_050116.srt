00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,960
This week, not to be outdone by the PS4 Neo, Microsoft 2 hits the rumor mill with reports

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,720
of an Xbox One slim body as well as another controller update.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not all rumors this week as we also have delays, updates, releases and so much more

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,320
and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,680
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,160
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,680
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, May the 1st of 2016, episode number 639 of our show.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,400
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in lovely Sacramento, California, Studio N7 to

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,960
talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with you every Sunday

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,120
night live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,120
after the Bobby Black Wolf show with my co-host.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,600
Joining me tonight, say hello everybody to Tech Master, Loki.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Hello.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,760
How are you, Loki?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm hungry.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Yes.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,440
Loki got in here just in the nick of time.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,800
I was really worried I was about to go on air by myself, all by myself.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,920
Nobody wanted that to happen so Loki got here just under the buzzer I guess because they

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
were taking a long time.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,680
They were stupid, yeah.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,040
Perfectly rational explanation.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Obviously we are usually joined by the lovely Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,400
I would not want to neglect her introduction but she's not here tonight.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,960
I mentioned last week she was going to be out this week.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,740
She was on a brief little two-week hiatus from the show just because she had been sick

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,520
last week and she's at Disneyland today with Dan.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,900
Actually no, they are not at Disneyland.

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,740
They are at California Adventure because I guess they had to do one or the other because

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,300
it's expensive to do both now.

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,460
Have you seen the cost of freaking Disney tickets lately?

33
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:07,140
So they decided to just do California Adventure today so they are there riding California

34
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,540
Screamin' over and over and on the Toy Story ride, I'm sure.

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,580
So that's where she is at.

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,300
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, usually on before us here at the Voice of the Geeks Network,

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
was also not on tonight.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,420
So it's a very lonely night here, Sunday night, at VOG Network, just myself and Loki.

39
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,380
And here's the other funny thing is that I'm not feeling so, well, I feel okay.

40
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,480
Like I don't like have a fever or anything but maybe you might be able to hear my voice

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
a little bit.

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,380
I'm starting to get like sinacy.

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,100
My throat's getting a little scratchy so it's like great.

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,700
I'm catching whatever's going around which I think Loki had a little bit of last week

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,100
and I know Alan has been fighting off.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,660
So it's like, oh my gosh, something out there like does not want OLR.

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,500
Like does something bad happen if OLR hits 14 years?

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,300
Because I feel like the forces out there are trying to prevent Orange Laundry.

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,020
No, you know what it is?

50
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,340
We're not allowed to hit episode number 666.

51
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
That's what's happening.

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,900
The forces out there are trying to stop us from getting to 666 with all these, what,

53
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,260
sicknesses and things that come up and so forth.

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,800
So yeah, I'm not feeling 100% my best today, but I'm going to like, I really don't want

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,220
to turn into a bi-monthly show.

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,820
So I'm going to push through tonight, but we'll probably be a little bit shorter of

57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
a show tonight.

58
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,620
We're going to try to just push through one solid segment here.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,100
No break tonight.

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,180
We cut a few story slots and a couple of our regular segments and thinking we'll be done

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,620
at about eight o'clock.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,640
But I'm thinking, how long is your podcast when you're thinking, it's going to be a short

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
show tonight.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
It's going to be about two hours.

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,840
Anyway, enough of that type of housekeeping stuff.

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,120
You guys are here to talk about video games.

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,160
Let's get into it this week.

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,320
Um, Loki, I wanted to start off with this.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Sorry, my friend.

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,040
I know you're trying to eat, but we have to talk about this because everybody's talking

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
about this.

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Uh, this was all over Twitter a couple of days ago, literally in the middle of the night,

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,920
Nintendo drops tweets on us announcing some like huge news, right?

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
What happened?

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,680
Tell us a little bit about this Nintendo stuff.

76
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,400
Um, they said that they were going to have announced new amiibos, is that what we're

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
talking about?

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,080
No, no, I don't, I don't think it's the new amiibos.

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,720
I think that was also a thing, but there was more fanfare for the damn amiibos than there

80
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
was this news.

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,360
That the NX is scheduled to be coming out around, I think March of next year.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,200
And that Zelda is being delayed to coincide with its launch, which is who's big shock.

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Although it's not because we kind of figured it was, yeah, you make it sound like the most

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,040
anticlimactic thing that ever happened, but my God, because we know nothing about the

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
system.

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
Did you read any news sites that day?

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,180
Because I swear to God, the tone all over the internet on these websites was Nintendo

88
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,900
is fucked.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,280
Like I don't think that's the headline they can actually run on the front page of yahoo,

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,020
but I swear to God, if they could, that's what they would have said.

91
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,860
Because every fricking like place is running this story about how fucked Nintendo is because

92
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:25,500
of this news that like I, one headline's like the Wii U is the biggest purchase I ever regret

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
or something like that.

94
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,060
Like I regret buying the Wii U more than anything else I've ever bought in my life.

95
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,820
And I'm just like, fucking sit down, you drama queen, take all the seats.

96
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,560
Like really clearly you never bought an Engage or, you know, or a Ouya.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
I shouldn't say that.

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,300
We actually have Ouya fans out there, but you know what I mean?

99
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,820
I think there are far worse things to have happened to gaming than the Wii U, but maybe

100
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,740
that's just my perspective.

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,340
I tend to defend Nintendo a little more on the show.

102
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,780
I'm sure the listeners are dying to know what you think of all this.

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,940
I thought that's when it was coming out anyways, was in the first part next year, I'm in that

104
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,360
that, Oh, Zelda was delayed to launch with the system.

105
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
No shit.

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,020
It was going to launch with the system.

107
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
I don't know.

108
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,380
Nothing was a surprise to me.

109
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,540
Big surprise, I guess is that, Hey, we're not making games for the Wii U.

110
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,140
So now that one will.

111
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,580
Well then there was the big E3 thing where, Hey, the only thing we're bringing to E3 are

112
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,500
at least that's, that's what it sounds like.

113
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,860
Like I still, I still kind of can't believe this, but the way the tweets were worded,

114
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,860
it really made it sound like we're going to just bring Zelda.

115
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
That's it.

116
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,940
We got this big old booth and we're just going to have the Zelda line take up the booth because

117
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,580
we know y'all want to play it.

118
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,380
So Zelda is the only thing we're basically bringing to E3 and I'm thinking in the back

119
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,340
of my mind, I'm like, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

120
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,380
Zelda is the only thing you're going to bring.

121
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:00,300
Maybe it's the only thing you're bringing on Wii U to E3, but what about Pokemon sun

122
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,340
and moon?

123
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,580
Those games are kind of a big deal.

124
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,460
They're really a big deal now that you've basically said, you're not going to have a

125
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,620
console game in 2016 that, that, that, and that's why everybody's running with these

126
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,700
headlines about how fucked Nintendo is, is because Nintendo has no 2016 holiday basically

127
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,700
and when it comes to the Wii U, but they're obviously still going to have a game when

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,260
it comes to the 3DS because Pokemon is not something to sneeze at.

129
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,540
I think Nintendo's mobile advances are nothing to be ignored.

130
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,060
That was the other surprise they dropped that, you know, everybody's talking, oh my God,

131
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,540
NX, NX, but they also kind of dropped, and this is a big deal, that Fire Emblem and Animal

132
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,660
Crossing are the franchises that are tapped to come to mobile and Animal Crossing I think

133
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,740
makes a lot of freaking sense.

134
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,220
Granted, I think it's going to end up pretty much being the same stinking game we've been

135
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,020
playing for 15 years now, ever since the GameCube version with minor revisions, and

136
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,860
I'm sure they'll do little things to it to make it the more free-to-play type stuff where,

137
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,380
you know, the furniture costs coins that trickle in as you do the mundane errands, but you

138
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,300
can get a lot of coins if you get out your wallet, like that whole type of thing.

139
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm sure it's going to tie into Animal Crossing, but it makes a lot of sense.

140
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,860
And Nintendo amping up their mobile game in 2016 I still think is worth some credit and

141
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,260
not worth running a headline about how hosed Nintendo is because, I mean, Zynga, freaking,

142
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,020
all their success was because of mostly one mobile game.

143
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,460
So if even one of those games is a success, I mean, Tomo continues to be a success, I

144
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,900
don't see where Nintendo is like, hosed.

145
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,580
Are they going to have a bad year?

146
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Probably.

147
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,900
But they're also sitting, don't they sit on like $5 billion in the bank or something like

148
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
that?

149
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,760
They're sitting on an ungodly amount of money in the bank.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,860
So I don't think Nintendo's screwed, but the NX can't miss.

151
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,180
Like if the NX is a miss, then maybe we're going to be talking about those types of articles,

152
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,620
but I, you know, I don't know.

153
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
We're a ways off.

154
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Anyway.

155
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,700
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

156
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,220
Again, we do tape live Sunday nights and you guys join us live in our chat room over

157
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,220
at live.vognetwork.com and you lend us your opinions and sometimes things that you're

158
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,700
digging up as well on some of the things that we're talking about right now.

159
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,120
MXC actually posted in our chat room a portion of the official press release comment on the

160
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,080
E3 thing.

161
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,340
This June, Nintendo will focus its attention on the upcoming game in the Zelda franchise.

162
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,180
The Wii U version of the game will be playable for the first time on the E3 show floor and

163
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:44,300
it will be the only playable game Nintendo presents at the show in order to provide attendees

164
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,860
a complete immersion.

165
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,920
Okay, well that's, that's a PR.

166
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,520
In order to provide attendees a complete immersion, Loki, you are going, it's going to be the

167
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,860
Zelda experience.

168
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,580
There's going to be like cosplayers and little statues and things at the booth and light

169
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:10,020
mood lighting, Loki, maybe rupees that you can actually take home as swag loot.

170
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,860
That's what it's sounding like to me.

171
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,140
So I, that is interesting.

172
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,980
So that is going to be the only playable thing they show at the show.

173
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
That is...

174
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
But Zelda's not a title that you really need to hype up.

175
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,820
I mean, it kind of hypes itself.

176
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Yeah.

177
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,960
Going to our chat for some more comments here, SSG100Matt says Nintendo doesn't need to show

178
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,600
their full handed E3.

179
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,280
Didn't help them to get in a pissing match there with other console makers.

180
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,860
Tiger Claw says Nintendo is big enough to do their own events.

181
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,000
They don't really need E3 anymore.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Actually no, I think that's a whole load of shit right there to be honest, because you're

183
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,200
trying to sell a new system that no one knows jack shit about, and Zelda's going to be coming

184
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
to it.

185
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,760
And you're hoping that all this goodwill that they have is going to sell that fucking system.

186
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,960
If people don't see a system at holiday and they're like, well, you know, the PlayStation

187
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,120
4 looks pretty nice or the Xbox One looks pretty nice, drop the money there.

188
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,000
They're not going to have a money for the new system.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,400
I mean, it's, you're only selling a one game right now.

190
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm like half with you on that.

191
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,000
I mean, I think that is a huge question right now is, okay, well, if the NX will not be

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,860
playable at E3, then when?

193
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,440
Are they going to show it before the holiday season or are they going to show it after

194
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,120
the holiday season and how?

195
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
Because there will be no E3.

196
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,280
So, I mean, the obvious answer that jumps to my mind first is Tokyo Game Show.

197
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,880
However, Nintendo hasn't participated in Tokyo Game Show for quite some time.

198
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,240
I don't know why they would suddenly start now.

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,960
Nintendo has in the past, not every year, but they have in the past run a concurrent

200
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,240
event around Tokyo Game Show.

201
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,040
So it seems likely that they could do something like that in Japan.

202
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,980
But that, you know, again, doesn't show how it's going to get here in America.

203
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,760
I wonder if they're not going to do a Nintendo Direct and every Best Buy in the nation is

204
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,740
going to have some of the Nintendo stuff to play.

205
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,080
I sort of just think that's the only path that's left because I don't really see Nintendo

206
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,920
doing an expo of their own, say like the PlayStation experience.

207
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,160
And so what else do they have where they can get directly to the players?

208
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,720
Penny Arcade Expo?

209
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,280
I don't know if that, I mean, I kind of think the NX will end up at PAX, I guess, East next

210
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
year.

211
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,440
But, I mean, there's, I don't know.

212
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
There really isn't a precedent now for how Nintendo gets that system out there.

213
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,840
I sort of think they're going to have to do the mall tour, the Best Buys, you know, they're

214
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,080
going to have to take their case to the consumers in that regard.

215
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,800
But Nintendo has kind of done it before.

216
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
We'll see.

217
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,120
Interesting thought from Akdeft in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

218
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,000
Universal Studios presents Nintendo Experience, calling it interesting.

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,720
We do know there is that Nintendo Universal Partnership, which many of us are thinking

220
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,880
thrill rides and, you know, obviously that'll be a part of it.

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,640
But could Nintendo have the NX playable at theme parks?

222
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
That would be weird.

223
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
That's the only thing about it.

224
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,600
That would be really weird because then it's like you're paying money to go play those

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
games.

226
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
You know what I mean?

227
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
It's weird.

228
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
It's a little weird.

229
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
But then again...

230
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
They've done it before with other things.

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah.

232
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,200
I've seen or remember at California Great America here, they had the Wii.

233
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
They had like a Wii Experience type thing there for a while.

234
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,080
I mean, it was after the system was out, but they, you know, it was still something.

235
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Oh, interesting.

236
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,320
Let's see.

237
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,880
We're trying to get a couple more comments here over at live.vognetwork.com.

238
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,680
Kaijuto in chat says, Nintendo knows that E3 isn't relevant anymore.

239
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,440
They have their own showcase shows.

240
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:07,040
A lot of people are reading into that angle of it where here's yet another company that's

241
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,760
really de-emphasizing E3.

242
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,160
I mean, they haven't pulled out of E3, but they pulled the thing that almost everybody

243
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,200
I know that was going to E3 this year had said, I'm excited to play the NX.

244
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
And Nintendo just pulled that from E3.

245
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,120
So yet another thing has just exited the show this year.

246
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,880
Well, it's just like, it's...

247
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,740
I understand that they don't have to reveal it at E3, but you gotta reveal it at some

248
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
point.

249
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,960
And it's...

250
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
What's the harm?

251
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,720
I mean, I guess unless you're unsure that, you know, people are going to be disappointed

252
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,440
about what they see, but that gives you more time to get feedback on it.

253
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm just like thinking right now, there's nothing, nothing has me hyped for the NX.

254
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,840
I don't know anything about it.

255
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,400
Well, I kind of think that's a loaded perspective though, because of course you don't.

256
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Nintendo has kept everything under their hat.

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,920
Well, let's, let's reevaluate after E3 this year, because maybe just because the NX will

258
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,360
be there doesn't mean they won't say anything about it.

259
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,440
They may still say some things about it, even though they may not necessarily have one there,

260
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,580
and maybe they will unveil another title to get us hyped for it.

261
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,660
Like I know if they came out and said, all right, we know you're all waiting to see what's

262
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,780
going to be on the NX, here's Pikmin 4, how about F-Zero?

263
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,940
Because if that's the one that they dropped, I'd be like, done.

264
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,060
And I came like, there it is.

265
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Like that's all it's going to take.

266
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,100
If they drop F-Zero and I'm spent like, you know, if they, if they announced like that

267
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
big game or maybe a new Metroid or something like even just one little thing to tide us

268
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,780
over, and then please look forward to October, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah in Japan and

269
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,540
November, blah, blah, blah in the States, when we're going to have more information

270
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,860
and a playable thing.

271
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,780
Like maybe that'll be all they give us at E3, I don't know.

272
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,140
But I'm fine with that.

273
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,340
Just like would like some information.

274
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,460
I also think, and one other thing, I don't want to drag this out too much, but again,

275
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,980
this is, this is the thing that a lot, a lot of people are talking about this week.

276
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,980
I have a feeling their strategy, because you, you kind of mentioned the whole, well, how

277
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,340
are they going to sell them in March if they're not around at the holiday and dah, dah, dah,

278
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,340
and all this stuff.

279
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,380
I wonder if Nintendo isn't kind of planning on that they're going to release this in March

280
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,900
or April, whenever the fiscal year ends, like right, like, like days before.

281
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,060
And they're going to get their hardcore audience to pick it up the first day.

282
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,220
And that's the audience that they're going to use to sell the system through Christmas,

283
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
essentially.

284
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,820
I think Nintendo is not actually targeting necessarily a huge spring, but a huge holiday

285
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,700
2017, because yes, they'll have some big launch titles, but I bet there's going to be, I mean,

286
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,900
we know Zelda is going to be like the big one, right?

287
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,140
But I bet there's going to be something really big that's holiday 2017, and that's going

288
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:07,540
to be your Mario or, you know, your hypothetical F-Zero or Metroid or some big fucking title

289
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,500
that, you know, a lot of people are going to want to play is actually going to be a

290
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,620
holiday 2017 game.

291
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,500
And that's when they really expect to move units.

292
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,500
And then that way the early adopters are also kind of their early sellers, if that makes

293
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
sense.

294
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,380
They're their early salesman, I guess, because I know that, you know, I really wanted a Super

295
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,460
Nintendo after I went to my friend's house and played one, you know what I mean?

296
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Anyhow, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SH2100Matt says, they're trying to go grassroots.

297
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
If they play it right, it could work.

298
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,620
And Tiger Claw says, I have this feeling the NX is just an upgraded Wii U with a better

299
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,460
CPU, GPU, and more memory.

300
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Well, it wouldn't exactly be out of character for Nintendo, but at the same time, if the

301
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,100
rumors are to be believed, which there's an awful lot of them, if the rumors are to be

302
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,220
believed, it's going to be more powerful than the current PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

303
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,500
which is about where the Wii U was when it came out.

304
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,140
I think it was just a slight more powerful than 360, but it wasn't, you know, like a

305
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,620
huge thing.

306
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,740
Will the Wii U, or excuse me, the NX, will the NX be capable of doing 4K and all that

307
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
stuff?

308
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Probably not.

309
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
It's probably not going to be doing that type of stuff.

310
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,460
But anyhow, lots of Nintendo stuff.

311
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,100
Let's see, SH2100Matt says, they'll have private events with the press and demo kiosks before

312
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,340
the end of the year, I'm sure.

313
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,860
And Rama says, the NX is going to have PC specs similar to the PlayStation 4, so we're

314
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
good.

315
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,220
Well, clearly they're going to want to do something that makes it really easy this time

316
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,980
for the other companies to port their games over, because that was a big part of Wii U,

317
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,580
is that if you wanted to do a Wii U game, you kind of had to put a lot of extra money

318
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,900
into the port to have the second screen and all that stuff.

319
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,580
So it'll be interesting to see what happens.

320
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,780
Anyway, that's the big news everybody's talking about.

321
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,180
Let's get into a little bit of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games

322
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,300
that we've been playing this week, and then we'll get into housekeeping and the rest of

323
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
our news and all that stuff.

324
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
Sorry, I almost knocked over a dish.

325
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Live radio.

326
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
Loki, how was your gaming week?

327
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,780
My gaming week was terrible, to be honest, because I was so sick this week.

328
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:33,060
I was just exhausted, literally falling asleep at 9 o'clock at night, so it was just not

329
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
very conducive.

330
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,060
And I tried to play games, I was like, oh hey, cool, I'll play some Enter the Gungeon

331
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,740
or something like that.

332
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Nope.

333
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,160
Not going to happen.

334
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,720
So I played nothing this week, aside from Ingress, which I actually did on Friday.

335
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:58,840
Take some time to go walk around the state capital and get some unique portals there.

336
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,640
Just mainly because I was sick and I knew I couldn't concentrate.

337
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,680
I wanted to concentrate in programming, but I was like, I needed some fresh air, and so

338
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,280
I went for a few hour walk, and it felt great.

339
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,680
But there was a lot of people there.

340
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,440
My god, there's so many tours that go on there.

341
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
It's ridiculous.

342
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,840
I was like, holy cow!

343
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,120
There's some sort of podium thing that they're setting up.

344
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,800
I don't know if that's for the Trump rally thing or if that's something else, but they're

345
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,720
setting up some sort of speaking podium thing, and then there's just school groups swarming

346
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
the building.

347
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
It was ridiculous.

348
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
But, yeah.

349
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
So I did that.

350
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Alright, wow.

351
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,280
Well, my gaming week, I haven't played a lot of new stuff, honestly.

352
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,000
I feel like I've been playing a lot of games, but it's a lot of the same stuff.

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,640
I don't have a lot of exciting new things to talk to you guys about.

354
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,700
Final Fantasy XIV, I've still been doing the grind and that, and my Dark Knight finally

355
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,120
hit 60, so every class in Heavensward, I have at 60, so that's my little accomplishment

356
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
there.

357
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,800
And you can do these grinds towards the end of the game to get the highest level equipment

358
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
and so forth.

359
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,800
It's called the Relic Weapon, basically, so I've been working on those quests on my Astrologian

360
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,560
to try to get the best possible weapon, so I've been working on that.

361
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,640
And then Diablo III had Season 6 start this weekend, and if you guys listen to the show

362
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,160
for any length of time, you guys know I get into Diablo, especially when the seasons come

363
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
around.

364
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,320
And the big thing this season is that, finally, Blizzard added a lot more cosmetics to Diablo.

365
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,760
They had introduced these pets, and then there's maybe three or four that you can actually

366
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
acquire.

367
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,560
Now, apparently, there's a whole ton of them, so that's a big part of what they're doing

368
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
with this season.

369
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,840
So, you know, it's, I mean, obviously, it's not just pets, but they're doing these other

370
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,800
changes that, you know, are interesting.

371
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,240
So I've been playing a little bit of that, because that season just started on Friday,

372
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,500
and I really didn't start playing until yesterday, and I'm already level, like, 45, and that's

373
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,080
without somebody power-leveling me.

374
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,560
I find that joining public games, you get around people your same level, but you get

375
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,800
a huge experience boost, and yeah, that's been helping me a lot.

376
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,480
So, been playing the Diablo season, otherwise, on the Xbox One, I randomly had that on the

377
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,480
other day, and I played Frogger.

378
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,920
That's right, the Konami classic Frogger, because it showed up in my whole backwards

379
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,320
compatibility thing.

380
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
It's like every week, you turn on your Xbox One, it's like, let's see what little gem

381
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,520
from ten years ago just popped into your collection from the backwards compatibility thing, and

382
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Frogger showed up this week.

383
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,760
But you'll be proud of me, Loki.

384
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,640
I also downloaded Saints Row IV, because that was the games with gold thing this week.

385
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,060
Which I have not played IV, I've played Saints Row III, and I laughed my ass off, but I never

386
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
played IV.

387
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,840
Well, you'll like IV, because IV is basically III, since they recycled the map again.

388
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,200
But it is fun.

389
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
You'll like it.

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,880
Alan said the first few minutes of the game are laugh-a-palooza, like the last game.

391
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
It's ridiculous.

392
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,680
It's just, yeah, it's a very unusual game.

393
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Can't wait.

394
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,240
Sounds like fun.

395
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,360
Otherwise, continuing on the 3DS, I've been playing Zelda P-Cross as my nice little game

396
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
before I go to bed.

397
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,480
And Miitomo, I don't know if I mentioned this in last week's show, so I'll mention it now.

398
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
I hit the cap in Miitomo.

399
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,520
The social cap and the style cap is level 20.

400
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,240
You can progress no further.

401
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,280
So you get a giant red sparkly hat for hitting level 20, and I hit both on style and social.

402
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,200
So that was my big accomplishment, Miitomo.

403
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,860
Yet, I'm still playing.

404
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
I don't know why.

405
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,040
I still load it every day, and I check answers, and I'll answer a question.

406
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,120
The leaked footage from Pokemon Go, the beta?

407
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,040
I did see a little bit of that, yeah.

408
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,920
It looks, I mean, here's the thing.

409
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,720
I think it looks interesting, but I've also been playing Ingress this whole time, so I

410
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,240
don't look at it from the Pokemon frame of reference.

411
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,360
I look at it from the Ingress frame of reference, and so, for me, there's a lot of cool stuff

412
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
in there, I think.

413
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,600
But I understand the Pokemon fans are like, where's the traditional battling?

414
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,800
Because it kind of doesn't seem to be there.

415
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm not really sure how it plays, though.

416
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,240
It's like, you go to spots, I'm not sure if you deploy your Pokemon there, and then they

417
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,940
fight other people, or...

418
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,940
It seems like what you do is you go out and you catch Pokemon, but you don't necessarily

419
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,380
catch them by fighting them, you flick your balls at them.

420
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,580
That's literally what you're doing in the game, right?

421
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,740
You kind of flick the little balls at them, and that's where you can actually use a camera

422
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,940
on your phone, so it makes it actually look like AR a little bit, and so you can capture

423
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,540
the Pokemon that way.

424
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,600
But then what happens is that at some point in the game, you have to choose if you're

425
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,580
going to join the red gym, the blue gym, or the yellow gym, just like the old games from

426
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,140
the Game Boy, red, blue, and yellow, which I guess they're going with the American colors,

427
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,960
not the Japanese colors.

428
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,420
And then once you choose a color for your gym, a lot of the places that we know as Ingress

429
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,340
nodes today, as Ingress players, some of the beta players are saying about 40% of those

430
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,260
nodes are Pokemon gyms.

431
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,020
So what happens is that once you choose a color for your team, when you go to the gym,

432
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,540
if it's a gym of the opposing color, you can battle the Pokemon that's there to take the

433
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:24,940
gym for your color, and if it's your color, you leave a Pokemon behind to defend it.

434
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,060
So imagine Ingress, but the resonators are Pokemon.

435
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,060
That's kind of the sense I'm getting out of the game, and there's three factions, and

436
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:39,260
none of this, at least as far as I know, none of this fielding, linking stuff that's big,

437
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,500
that's not really part of it.

438
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,920
That's all left in Ingress.

439
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,620
So it's interesting.

440
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
All right.

441
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Yeah.

442
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,380
Again, this is all early beta, a lot can still change, we'll see.

443
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,180
I wonder if that's not, maybe that'll be a thing Nintendo comes out at E3 and says,

444
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,860
and Pokemon Go is out today, and you can download it on phones.

445
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,140
I'm very much expecting Nintendo to have a mobile-focused year in a way.

446
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,220
I think that E3, Nintendo Direct, will absolutely have mobile in it.

447
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:16,020
I understand that Pokemon Go is not directly a Nintendo game, but it's close enough.

448
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,380
And then they'll probably show footage from the Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem and give

449
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,220
us a sense when to expect those.

450
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,940
I would imagine Fire Emblem's first, but that's totally just guessing.

451
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:32,940
So anyway, that is an SSG100Matt says, so Rob will be choosing Team Green.

452
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,340
No, there is no green in Pokemon Go, so I'm still unsure.

453
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,140
I have a feeling I'm going to get talked into doing blue, because that's what Shane will

454
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,860
want to do, which is going to be very weird for me, because that's not what I do in Ingress,

455
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
but we'll see.

456
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,780
A lot can still change between now and Pokemon Go whenever that comes out.

457
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,420
I have to kind of see, are there benefits for each team?

458
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,140
Do some Pokemon get stronger?

459
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,700
There's a lot that can still change my mind.

460
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
I forgot.

461
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I was going to mention something.

462
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
Yeah.

463
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Let me just bring this up here real fast.

464
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Okay.

465
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
I want to show you something.

466
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Sure.

467
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
He's getting out his phone to show me something.

468
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Okay.

469
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Let's see here.

470
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:16,940
Actually, I remember I was talking to you about how Ingress screen burned my phone.

471
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,060
Yeah.

472
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
You did say something about that.

473
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Yeah.

474
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,140
I'm going to try to see if I can get it so that you can actually see it here real quick.

475
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,760
Well, this makes for riveting radio.

476
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,860
It is make for riveting radio, but I just wanted to see if I can, here, let me try pulling

477
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
this up here real fast.

478
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Okay.

479
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,180
So he's dilling around on his phone, trying to, I guess, navigate to-

480
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,420
I'm trying to get something so that you can actually see what I'm talking about here.

481
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,940
Even like a new browser window, so it's like solid white.

482
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
That would be what I would do.

483
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,000
While he's working on that, let me try to get some more comments in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

484
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,700
Tiger Claw says, I got Star Fox Zero yesterday.

485
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,620
I had enough points from the GameStop Power Up rewards to get $25 off.

486
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,540
Orange Right talking about Miitomo says, that's 15 my Nintendo points a day.

487
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
You know what, Orange Right?

488
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,880
That is actually a big reason, I think, why I still do Miitomo, because if Nintendo's

489
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,680
going to give us free games for 1,000 points, then yeah, I'm going to try to keep earning

490
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
those.

491
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,880
I mean, even though the games aren't that big a deal, I have been playing quite a bit

492
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,640
of Zelda P-Cross, which was the game that you can get for 1,000 points.

493
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,240
Is it like in the bottom corner here?

494
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
You can see the com thing.

495
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Oh, wow.

496
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,160
Yeah, you do have like a screen burn on your phone.

497
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
That's crazy.

498
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah.

499
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,960
And then normally in the upper right hand corner, too, it's harder to see right here

500
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
right now.

501
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,280
In the upper, you can see the ops button and everything.

502
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,680
You should take that to wherever you bought the phone, because that strikes me as what

503
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,240
a cheap piece of shit.

504
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,040
It's a Samsung Galaxy S6, though.

505
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,280
Something went wrong in the factory.

506
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
I don't know.

507
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,680
Do any of you guys know?

508
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,920
Do cell phones really screen burn like that?

509
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,360
I guess they don't want you to play Ingress anymore.

510
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
I don't know.

511
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
All right.

512
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,720
Anyhow, I don't have a lot of housekeeping for you guys tonight.

513
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,440
We are still going to be here every Sunday, as far as I know.

514
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,760
We will be at Dragon Con, or at least I will be at Dragon Con over Labor Day, but that's

515
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,600
still a ways out.

516
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,000
So in the meantime, you can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook,

517
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,280
facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

518
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,880
Act deft in chat about the screen burn saying, I'm pretty sure they shouldn't.

519
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,320
Yeah, I don't, I'm pretty sure they shouldn't either.

520
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,640
So interesting.

521
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,800
Anyway, let's get into gaming news for the week.

522
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,240
Loki, why don't you start us off?

523
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,360
So this is pretty cool.

524
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,120
One of the things that kind of leaked out, they have a few different ways this has been

525
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
leaking out.

526
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,880
So in Black Ops 3 right now, in the Nuketown map that they have, they've been kind of doing

527
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,080
these little hidden trailers or teaser video things like that that are kind of teasing

528
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,560
into the next Call of Duty.

529
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,800
Also there were some retail pieces that were kind of leaked out as well about another Call

530
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,720
of Duty game called Call of Duty Infinity Warfare.

531
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,760
So kind of like a futuristic warfare thing.

532
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,400
But one of the big things about that though, on the actual artwork, it lists not only they

533
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,440
have Infinite Warfare, which will be coming out November 4th, 2016, but that there's also

534
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,700
going to be, if you buy like a certain legacy edition, it's going to come with Call of Duty

535
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,620
Modern Warfare, the original, number four, remastered.

536
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,540
So it's basically going to be the, I consider probably one of the best games in the Modern

537
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,000
Warfare series, remastered on the PlayStation 4.

538
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,660
Which is fucking amazing and I can't wait for that.

539
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,940
So that's the rumor right now.

540
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,180
Apparently they're seeing that it's going to be the campaign plus ten of the multiplayer

541
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,540
maps, which is kind of unusual because there were more than ten multiplayer maps in that

542
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
game.

543
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,780
So I'm not sure if they're just not redoing all of them, which it would be kind of disappointing.

544
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,780
But maybe that opens up for DLC or something.

545
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,100
So we'll just have to see if that's actually going to be a legit thing or not.

546
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,300
But I hope it is.

547
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,980
Is this, didn't I, I mean I might be talking crazy and that's fine.

548
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,200
Didn't I hear that they might not put out new games in these series every year?

549
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,020
So maybe this is like a holdover?

550
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,860
Well no, it's going to be a new game this year.

551
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,940
Oh, so it's just remastered but it's...

552
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,900
They're going to put out the new Call of Duty game, which is Call of Duty Infinite Warfare

553
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,180
and Call of Duty Modern Warfare remastered.

554
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,460
That's a lot of Call of Duty.

555
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,100
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, I would soon get the remastered version of Modern Warfare

556
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,900
over Infinite Warfare.

557
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Uh, yeah, I would say the same thing.

558
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
I'll play both.

559
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,540
But I love Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the original one.

560
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,580
It's had some of the best maps in the series.

561
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,100
Yeah, it's kind of like, I don't know, it's kind of like when they remastered Final Fantasy

562
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
X.

563
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,620
It's like, yeah, I'm going to go back and play this because this is a great game, even

564
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,260
though there might be newer Final Fantasies to experience, you know.

565
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,180
But why not?

566
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,680
If it was a great Call of Duty game, then yeah, they should remaster it and go back

567
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,680
to it.

568
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,620
Also by the way, on the screen burning issue in chat, S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, my Galaxy

569
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,500
S3 had a little keyboard screen burn.

570
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Justin and I replaced it recently, but that was with three to four years of use.

571
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,820
This is not three to four years of use.

572
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,020
It's like three to four months, right?

573
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,700
You haven't had that very long.

574
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Six months?

575
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
In September.

576
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Still.

577
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,860
All right, anyhow, more rumors about the Xbox One.

578
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,540
You know, huge talk about the PlayStation 4 Neo, which I guess their code name, we were

579
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,960
talking about in last week's show.

580
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,340
And we've heard rumors that Microsoft is looking at doing something similar, and those rumors

581
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,180
are gaining a lot of steam this week.

582
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,660
There are yet more inside reports and rumors.

583
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,620
There was a, I guess, leaked production notes that showed the Xbox One slim model, and those

584
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,260
production notes came from a Chinese manufacturer.

585
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,460
Well now another Microsoft insider has said that yes, new Xbox hardware is coming.

586
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,660
That there's new Xbox hardware that's going to be announced at E3, and there will be a

587
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,200
new controller.

588
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,560
The controller is going to be similar to the current pad, but with probably a default white

589
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
color.

590
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,480
The controller will be updated, but they don't really say how.

591
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,640
I'm assuming just to make it the D-pad.

592
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,360
I don't know, I like the Xbox One controller a lot more than the 360, but maybe they're

593
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,880
going to try to throw some of those enhancements that are in the Elite in it?

594
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
I don't know.

595
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,600
We'll see.

596
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,420
So yeah, and apparently the new Xbox is a much bigger deal than an updated standard

597
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
controller.

598
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,020
But what the fuck does that mean?

599
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,220
So are they putting new power in it or not?

600
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,460
If the Xbox thing is just a slim device, then okay, whatever, we see this happen all the

601
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
time.

602
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
This has been happening since the PlayStation One.

603
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
It's coming with Microsoft Office as well.

604
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,060
It's a big deal.

605
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:00,620
Well, okay, nobody's talking about the whole like, you know, well, I guess they're talking

606
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,700
about the upgrade thing, but maybe that is what it does.

607
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,940
Maybe this box is not just an Xbox One, but this is more of a bridge with your PC, somehow.

608
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,820
That it's going to stream more for your PC or let everything on your Xbox.

609
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,820
Why can't it be a PC?

610
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,900
Like seriously, like run- Just buy a PC and hook it up to your TV.

611
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:28,420
You know, like the Windows tablets that they have, the Surface Pro, or the Surface, not

612
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,580
the Pros, but like the RT ones, you know, have just like a limited app set on there

613
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,060
and, you know, run Office stuff.

614
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,940
That way you're buying the system and if you need to, you know, crunch an Excel file, you

615
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,420
could do that as well.

616
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,300
As long as they don't fragment the games, which, you know, we were talking about the

617
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,140
PlayStation 4 stuff last week, okay, you know, as long as the games don't get fragmented.

618
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,940
If it's doing 4K output for movies, then whatever.

619
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,740
But I just hope that Microsoft is going down a similar path where the games do not end

620
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,460
up all fragmented, if that makes sense.

621
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,820
Like I don't want to see that happen, because I'll be pissed that I have all that money

622
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,460
that I spent on the Xbox One, if now this year's holiday games are not going to run

623
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
on it.

624
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
You know what I mean?

625
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,980
I really don't think that'll happen.

626
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,100
I kind of just feel like this device is going to be, yeah, it's going to be a slimmer device

627
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:22,620
and maybe a little more oomph for movies and a little more of the PC connectivity and doing

628
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,940
more of that.

629
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,980
Maybe it'll be a little more power in it for HoloLens or whatever, but as long as, you

630
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,820
know, Crackdown will still run on the Xbox One that I have and Scalebound and all the

631
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,020
stuff that I'm looking forward to, we'll be fine.

632
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,740
So we'll see.

633
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,980
Anyway, I guess that's what we've got coming out of Microsoft.

634
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Look forward to E3.

635
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,220
It's going to be interesting.

636
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,140
Now you've got Sony and Microsoft announcing new consoles, but they're not really new consoles.

637
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,940
It's not a new console cycle.

638
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,140
And then Nintendo is like, here's our one game.

639
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,180
We'll see.

640
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,460
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com,

641
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,860

642
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,540
Loki, what do you have for us next?

643
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
All right.

644
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,540
So this is kind of cool.

645
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,220
You know, they're going to have, they put out these all the time on Steam, like this

646
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,340
Genesis collections where there's a bunch of the ROMs and everything you could play.

647
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,780
And a lot of times I'm like, why would I buy this?

648
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,700
Because I could just run this through an emulator or something like that.

649
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,660
I still buy them, yes.

650
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,860
But I still, I asked myself that question though, why am I purchasing this?

651
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,260
Probably because it's a large number of games that are on my Steam library and it pads the

652
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,800
numbers quite well.

653
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,020
That's usually the reason.

654
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,020
But I actually...

655
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,300
I want to look sicker to all my friends.

656
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,740
I don't look crazy enough.

657
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I need to go for broke.

658
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Exactly.

659
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,860
So, this is kind of cool though.

660
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,140
This is actually something that they're doing that's very different.

661
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:04,100
They're actually offering or adding Steam Workshop support for Sega Genesis and Mega

662
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,740
Drive Classics.

663
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,740
That's right.

664
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,620
ROM hacks are going to be officially supported by this now.

665
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,580
That's pretty exciting.

666
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,940
So that would definitely be something I would have to pick up this collection just to check

667
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
it out.

668
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:25,100
But, very cool to see that they're actually kind of supporting that.

669
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,620
Are you going to try playing around with this at all?

670
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,140
Do you have any games to support it?

671
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,060
I thought I bought a Humble Bundle that had all the old Sega stuff, but I guess not.

672
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,140
I have Space Channel 5 Part 2, I bought something that had the Dreamcast stuff, but this isn't

673
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
about...

674
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
No, this is Genesis games.

675
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,060
I have the Genesis one I bought off of Amazon a long time ago when I used to buy digital

676
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
games off of there.

677
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,500
So, I have the key for that.

678
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,860
I'm not sure if that's the same collection or if they re-released it or something, but

679
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,980
I'll take a look and see.

680
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,380
Stop drop in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can't wait for Scrotum the Hedgehog.

681
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
Because that's what happens.

682
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,300
I remember when ROM hacking first started a long time ago.

683
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,740
I remember there were two things.

684
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,900
Somebody did Mario with dicks.

685
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
It was just dicks everywhere.

686
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,620
It was like the coins were dicks.

687
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Everything was a dick.

688
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,460
It was Dick Mario, it was one of the first ROM hacks, one of the first I ever saw, Dick

689
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
Mario.

690
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,140
And then, okay, here's the greatest one, because this game wasn't even out in the US.

691
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,300
There was a Japanese only game, God, I'm embarrassing myself even about to talk about this.

692
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,180
There was a Japanese only game called Nuts and Milk.

693
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:42,700
And I'll just let you fill in the gaps to what ROM hackers did to that game in the first

694
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,580
month that people figured out how to get into the files and edit sprites and all that

695
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,700
stuff is that it just became nuts and nuts is basically what happened there.

696
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,940
So ROM hacking and making them dirty has been around since the turn of the century, basically.

697
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,940
We've been saying that in gaming for forever is that, what's the time to penis?

698
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,380
So that is a good question.

699
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,220
How long until, I mean, is Steam going to police for Scrotum the Hedgehog?

700
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,900
Or will that not, is that just, it's going to be a wild, wild west out there?

701
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
What's going to happen?

702
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Do we know if, do we know if Steam is policing any of that stuff?

703
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,900
I'm sure that they have like a review system.

704
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Right?

705
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
Yeah.

706
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,020
Dartetsuya in chat says, the ROM hacks are really interesting.

707
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,780
Some of them even swap in a totally different game.

708
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,980
Yeah, I'd seen some of that too.

709
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
Funny stuff.

710
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,460
And SSG100Matt says, like all the ROM hack cartridges that they were selling at Magfest.

711
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,020
Yeah, that's, that was a, I don't know if I talked about that phenomenon here on this

712
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,020
show.

713
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,380
I think Bobby got into it on his show, but they were actually selling like ROM hacks

714
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,460
dumped back to a cartridge that you could then take home and play on.

715
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,020
That sounds kind of illegal.

716
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,900
It's probably super illegal, but it's, it's this really weird gray area because I think

717
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,940
the patents, like that's why you can have these third party Nintendos and Super Nintendos.

718
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,340
Now is because I think the patents ran out, they ran out after like 20 or 30 years.

719
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,440
And so I kind of think the cartridges, the same thing happens.

720
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,580
So now it's just a question of the intellectual property.

721
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:20,060
I mean, if, if somebody really wanted to sue them, they would probably have a case, but

722
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,420
it's, it's a little vendor at a show.

723
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,900
How many of these are they really selling?

724
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,060
It's probably not worth it to pay the lawyer is probably the reality of that situation

725
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,340
is that, yeah, it's probably illegal, but it's not worth it to pay the lawyer.

726
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,900
I don't know.

727
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,620
MXC in chat, giving us some insight here saying some steam workshop stuff has been removed.

728
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,580
It appears if you download them once though, even after being officially removed, you can

729
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,700
still access them.

730
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,180
Oh, it's like iTunes.

731
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,500
It's like when I got the main emulator on my iPad, I was like, Oh, got to get that before

732
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
they take it down.

733
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,700
And sure enough, they got it down, but now it's on my account so I can redownload it

734
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
whenever.

735
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
So it's kind of nice.

736
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
All right.

737
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,220
Anyhow, so I've been playing a lot of final fantasy 14 lately.

738
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,740
So I, I don't mean to bring up a game that I play an awful lot on the show, but maybe

739
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:11,860
I do, but they had a big like conference this week and some announcements and there's a

740
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,940
very interesting crossover.

741
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,100
That's just too cool to ignore a square Enix and level five announced this week that they

742
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,220
will be teaming up.

743
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,660
Uh, and this was announced during the latest final fantasy 14 letter from the producer

744
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:31,980
live part 29, um, on final fantasy 14 is going to be getting Yo-kai watch in the game basically

745
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,860
not the actual game, but some of the characters, uh, so some of the, uh, Yo-kai will actually

746
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,780
become minions in the game.

747
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,100
So like Jibanyan is going to be a minion that you can get in the game.

748
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,100
That's pretty cool.

749
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,060
Whisper and you know, a lot of the, uh, Yo-kai watch.

750
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:51,380
And then there's going to be Yo-kai inspired weaponry, which is pretty cool.

751
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,420
So like, for example, um, you can get like a white mage staff that has a Yo-kai on the

752
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
end of it.

753
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:04,100
Uh, I like to play, um, a astrologian and the astrologian has the, um, snake Yo-kai,

754
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:11,020
I think it's Noko, uh, has that Yo-kai like embedded on the, um, uh, astroglobe.

755
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,420
So that's pretty cool.

756
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,540
Um, and then also your character can actually equip a Yo-kai watch as like a piece of equipment.

757
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,740
I don't know what it'll do, but you can do that.

758
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,560
And then they're actually going to be bringing a mount that is that ghost character.

759
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,240
Whisper and you see this on a lot of box art, you actually be able to ride that as

760
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
a mount.

761
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
So that's really cool.

762
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:38,600
But not only that, in Yo-kai watch three sushi and Yo-kai watch three tempura, they are going

763
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
to be adding.

764
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,880
So now this is going the other way in the Yo-kai games.

765
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,560
They're going to add choco bonyan, which is jibanyan riding a choco.

766
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,360
And then they're going to have moogle linyan, which is a moogle, but done in Yo-kai watch

767
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
style.

768
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
That's actually really rad.

769
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,440
So it's a really kind of a neat little crossover there.

770
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,740
Square Enix and level five doing that between the two.

771
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,360
So as a Final Fantasy 14 player and someone who enjoyed what I played of Yo-kai watch,

772
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,920
I will try to collect every one of those minions because I like to collect minions in the game

773
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
anyway.

774
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,880
So I'm looking forward to whatever event they do.

775
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,460
I'm sure they're going to do some event to promote the release of the game in Japan.

776
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,200
And hopefully we see it here in the States as well.

777
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,880
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and look at some

778
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,560
video games that are coming out soon, a lot sooner than Yo-kai three will be here in the

779
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,560
States.

780
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:41,160
All right, so we've got Battleborn coming out this week on PlayStation 4 PC and Xbox

781
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
one.

782
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,120
Man, so I'm not over that sickness yet.

783
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,800
I'm telling you, the forces do not want us to get too much further.

784
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,400
I still feel way better than I did with last week, whoa, that's for sure.

785
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:06,400
And then along with that, let's see, aside from Battleborn, no, a whole lot, actually

786
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,040
I want to say that's it.

787
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,640
Battleborn, that is your week.

788
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,840
Well that's supposed to be like a big title, right?

789
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,960
Yeah, it's a 2K kind of equivalent of, wasn't it supposed to be similar to Team Fortress

790
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
2 or something?

791
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,000
I tried playing the beta, I couldn't get into it, I really couldn't, I'm sorry, but I know

792
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,720
some other friends of mine have been playing it and loving it, so cool, hey, great, I couldn't

793
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
get into it.

794
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,600
Maybe I just need to give it another chance, I don't know.

795
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,320
So all right, but I know that was like a big thing that they showed at the PlayStation

796
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,000
experience anyway and a lot of people were looking forward to that, so maybe that's...

797
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,760
Well the trailer looked cool last year and I remember it's basically kind of like from

798
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:53,120
the team that did Borderlands, so it, I don't know, it seemed interesting, but it's not

799
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,440
my style of game.

800
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Gotcha.

801
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,820
Well, looking at the release calendar in Japan, it's a very slow week in Japan.

802
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,760
There is actually nothing on the PlayStation 4 this week.

803
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,720
Uncharted 4 is the next big release in Japan, because that's going to be a big release here

804
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,720
too as well.

805
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,240
Japan will not be seeing that until May 10th, however, that is actually not happening this

806
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
week.

807
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,700
And the Vita doesn't really have anything this week either.

808
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,280
And lastly on the 3DS, yeah, it's a very, very slow week in Japan, so really no game

809
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,120
releases to look forward to there.

810
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,160
However, if you go to Europe, the story is a little bit different, as Battleborn makes

811
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,580
its way to Europe this week on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

812
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,600
So that is what you have to look forward to in Europe this week.

813
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,680
In our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says, wasn't Golden Week this week

814
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,680
or was that last week?

815
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,480
I thought it was last week, but that probably is coming into play as to why we don't have

816
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,200
a ton of releases in Japan this week.

817
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:54,240
So there you go, not a whole lot to look forward to this week in Japan, and just one big game

818
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
in the UK.

819
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,360
Well, this is the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and visit

820
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,560
the classic game of the week.

821
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:09,200
And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

822
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,840
hey, you ungrateful little brat should be playing this game.

823
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,360
But this week she's not here, so we're taking over this segment for her.

824
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,440
Since last week, I got to do one of my picks.

825
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,560
This week we're going to let Loki do one of his picks, and I actually still do not know

826
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
what he's picking.

827
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,720
I don't even have a YouTube up for anything for audio, so Loki, what is the classic game

828
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,720
of the week?

829
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,000
See, I was undecided first.

830
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,340
I didn't know if I should, you know, Jamie has a very specific rule that she's never

831
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,340
going to pick Halo.

832
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,380
Right.

833
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,380
And so I thought, well, maybe I should pick Halo.

834
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,860
Just piss her off.

835
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,860
Just to spite her.

836
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:50,060
Well, I would disavow that completely, because I do not want, I want my Disneyland souvenir.

837
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,300
Yours will get tossed in the fire.

838
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,500
So, and unfortunately, you know, in order to best appreciate that, Bobby would really

839
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,220
need to be in the chat to do that.

840
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,220
That is true.

841
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,740
Bobby did run out, I think he went on a trip or something, I don't know.

842
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,740
I don't know.

843
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,300
So he is not in chat, so perhaps we shall table that to another week.

844
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Fair enough.

845
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,260
I'm going to have...

846
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,500
So you're blaming Bobby now for the Halo thing not happening.

847
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,260
I'm blaming Bobby for the Halo thing not happening.

848
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,260
The classic game of the week would have been Halo, but Bobby's not here.

849
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,260
It would have been Halo.

850
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,620
Instead, we're going to get a far better game.

851
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,620
Okay.

852
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,620
What is it?

853
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,620
Which is going to be Driver 3.

854
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:32,180
Driver 3 is the classic game of the week.

855
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,180
Of course.

856
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:39,100
Because Driver 3 is just, it's where basically Atari said, hey, you know what?

857
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,820
We could totally do that Grand Theft Auto thing.

858
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,540
I mean, the first two Driver games were pretty awesome.

859
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:49,620
I mean, it was basically all about, you know, car chases and about the driving.

860
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:56,700
And then, Drive 3-er was all about, let's just try to steal, you know, copy Grand Theft

861
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,900
Auto, and it just, it failed terribly.

862
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:07,140
It had some really buggy AI, like the cops when they were chasing after you, you could

863
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,500
hide behind a car and they would shoot at, they would try to shoot directly at you, and

864
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,980
if, you know, the cop car that they happened to be hiding behind was right in front of

865
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,980
them, they would blow up their own cop car and kill themselves because they were trying

866
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,980
to shoot at you.

867
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,580
It was awesome.

868
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:31,860
So, Driver 3, you know, it basically came out in 2004 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as

869
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:38,700
well as mobile platforms, even had a game version for Game Boy Advance.

870
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:46,780
And basically, you know, the game revolved around, I guess, FBI agents Tanner, John Tanner

871
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,620
and Tobias Jones.

872
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,460
Wait, there was a story?

873
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,460
Yes!

874
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,460
No, seriously!

875
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,460
Alright.

876
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,460
There was!

877
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:02,060
And they had actual, you know, they had Michael Madsen playing John Tanner and Ving Rhames

878
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,900
playing Tobias Jones, and then they were trying to intercept the criminal Charles Jericho

879
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,540
played by Mickey Rourke.

880
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,700
That's some, like, serious talent right there.

881
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,580
Too bad the game just did not reflect that talent.

882
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:23,100
But basically, you know, it revolved around you, you know, chasing after them over several

883
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:30,660
different locations, including Miami, Florida, Nice, France, and Istanbul, Turkey.

884
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,740
And really the way I played the game was I would just go into it, they had like a free

885
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,300
mode that you could drive around, and I would just get in cars and drive them until they

886
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,220
were literally, because it had like a pretty, I wouldn't call it a realistic damage system,

887
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,260
but there was a damage system where like stuff would fall off your car, like you could

888
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,940
lose the front two wheels of your car, and drive around just on the axles and everything.

889
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,860
And I would do that, and it was fun.

890
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,420
I remember one night your character was just like swimming underwater endlessly, and it

891
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:07,280
was so, like, you swam like through polygons that were underwater somehow, I don't even,

892
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,280
it was a mess.

893
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,540
It was a frickin' mess.

894
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,540
It was a mess.

895
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:17,460
You know, they had like some realistic physics in the game, I don't know if I'd call it realistic,

896
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,180
but yeah.

897
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,300
The reviews weren't that great, and this was one of the games that actually did kind of

898
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:31,460
cause a controversy, because before the release of Driver 3, Atari had offered magazines PSM2

899
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:37,080
and Xbox World early review copies of the game in exchange for positive review scores.

900
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,520
Some folks in chat are talking about this right now, Stop Drop is mentioning this right

901
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
now.

902
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,320
They gave the game to two magazines early for promises of nine to ten reviews, nine

903
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,360
out of ten reviews, excuse me, then everyone was expecting a great game, and real reviews

904
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,240
came in, so they tried to suppress those reviews and ban people from forums.

905
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
So much for that.

906
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,720
Yeah, as you can see right now, oh, and this was another game that was kind of fun, because

907
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:07,000
in, I don't know if it was Driver 3 that, my sister used to play Driver 3 quite a bit,

908
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,200
and it would allow you to create replays of your actual, so you're driving around and

909
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,120
causing mayhem and stuff, and you could do replays, but one of the best parts about the

910
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,240
game and the replay system is it wouldn't always sync up to what you were doing.

911
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,120
So you're recording all this stuff, you're stealing cars and things, and then you go

912
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,000
back and watch the replay, and your guy's just running around aimlessly and running

913
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,720
into the ocean, and all sorts of weird stuff happens, it was just a very glitchy, bad game.

914
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,880
But it's fun, it's so bad, it's good at that point.

915
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,240
And they were even so cocky that they had, like it was an Easter egg where they had the

916
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:51,000
character from Vice City wearing like floaties and stuff, and you'd have to go, you know,

917
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,880
kill him, and that was like an Easter egg in the game, it was like kind of going, haha,

918
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,640
look it, we're so much better than Grand Theft Auto, but their game was just not good.

919
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,640
It was not good.

920
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,640
But it was fun.

921
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,100
So no chance we'll ever have a Driver 4?

922
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,100
We did, actually.

923
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,100
Oh, we did?

924
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,740
Yeah, we had Driver San Francisco, so.

925
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,900
Oh, that's right, I thought that was before.

926
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,500
So yes, we did actually have a Driver 4, and it was a better game, because it was just

927
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,580
about driving and not about getting out and running around.

928
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,140
They cut out all the Grand Theft Auto parts.

929
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,140
Yes, they did.

930
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,140
All right.

931
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,140
That's it.

932
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,980
That's it, your classic game of the week.

933
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,980
Driver 3.

934
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,980
Not Halo, unfortunately.

935
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,980
Not Halo, unfortunately.

936
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,900
But Driver 3, I know it's on the PC and it was on Playstation 2?

937
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,900
And Xbox.

938
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,900
Original Xbox.

939
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,900
Awesome.

940
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,620
Just, if you like glitchy games, and trying to break games, which you guys have to understand,

941
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,580
Loki really, like, that's like one of Loki's favorite things in games, is breaking them

942
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,580
and watching them do ridiculous stuff.

943
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,980
Well, it was like one of those games, like, after I heard the review scores and how bad

944
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,820
this game was, I'm like, I gotta try this thing, because I liked, the original Driver

945
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,020
on Playstation 1 was a really good game.

946
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:03,060
It was a fun game, like running from the cops and everything was fun, and Driver 2 wasn't

947
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,100
so bad.

948
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,100
I was like, well, I mean, it sounds like it could be fun, and so I played it, I'm like,

949
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,740
wow, this is really terrible, but I had fun playing it, because it was really bad.

950
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,340
All right.

951
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,220
We are not going to be doing a break tonight, since I mentioned earlier in the show we're

952
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,540
going to just keep moving on with some news, but we will get to your calls in just a little

953
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:26,540
bit at 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

954
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,460
But first, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, starting with Loki.

955
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,740
All right.

956
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:37,780
So as, I'm not sure if this is a result of the whole, you know, Microsoft opening up

957
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,660
there online, but good news, DC Universe Online is now available on Xbox One.

958
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:49,420
So that's right, you can play it on PC, Playstation 4, Playstation 3, and Xbox One now.

959
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,180
So check it out.

960
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,000
And it is still free to play.

961
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,260
This is something that I wanted to get set up on my phone, I haven't quite gotten a chance

962
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,980
to do it, because I was trying to sync my Playstation 4 controller to my Android phone,

963
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,580
and it just does not want to work.

964
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:10,860
So Minecraft is now available for Samsung Gear VR, and I purchased this day one, as

965
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,660
soon as I saw that this was available.

966
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,900
It is something I'm probably going to check out, hopefully, maybe tonight.

967
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:22,740
And yeah, it's, you need a controller with it, so if you have a Bluetooth controller

968
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,920
that works with your Android phone, then definitely check this out.

969
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,640
But it's Minecraft in VR, what more can you want?

970
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:37,280
It's $7.99, I want to say, if you purchase it from the, or $6.99 from the Gear VR store.

971
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,960
And then finally we also have the free games you're going to be getting in May.

972
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,640
So starting off with Games with Gold on Xbox, the free games you're going to get starting

973
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,640
May 1st through May, or actually for the whole month of May, you're going to have Defense

974
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Grid 2, and then Costume Quest 2 will be available for the 2nd, from May 16th through June 15th.

975
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:05,960
And then on Xbox 360, Grid 2 will be available for free May 1st through May 15th, and then

976
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,640
Pagle will be available May 16th through May 31st, of course all those Xbox 360 games are

977
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:17,360
compatible with the Xbox One, so be sure to pick them up even if you don't have a 360.

978
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:23,860
And then finally, on PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting Tropico 5, Tabletop Racing

979
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:29,080
World Tour, and Switch Galaxy Ultra on PlayStation 4.

980
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:34,780
PlayStation 3, you're going to be getting Bionaut Commando Rearmed 2, and Loco, was

981
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:46,920
it Loco Roco Cocoa, Loco Roco Cocoa, Loco Roco Cocoa Recto.

982
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,560
That's hard to say.

983
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,080
A lot of people were not feeling the free games this month.

984
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:58,240
Yeah, I want to say there was a rumor that it was, which game was it, the rumor was they're

985
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:05,160
going to have, it was supposed to be Watch Dogs, was the free game.

986
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Oh wow.

987
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,240
That'd be kind of a video.

988
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,640
Maybe for June, maybe because if they were, obviously they're going to be announcing Watch

989
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,160
Dogs 2 or whatever.

990
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,760
Right, my thought was that maybe they're trying to keep some things and holding it for E3,

991
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,280
like because then they can announce at E3 that some big games are going to be playable.

992
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,600
That's why you have kind of an A month, is that it's going to lead into a really big

993
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,840
month because June's usually kind of a video.

994
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,600
And then Vita, God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Switch Galaxy Ultra as well.

995
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,120
So that's it.

996
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,120
Alright.

997
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,600
Well, you know what, hey, it's still free.

998
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,040
It might not be the stuff you wanted, but it's free.

999
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Hey, exactly.

1000
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,280
You know what, I've not played Tropico 5 or any of the Tropico games.

1001
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
I mean, worth checking out.

1002
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
And sometimes these games are freaking awesome.

1003
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,200
You may not have heard of them and you play them and they're actually rad.

1004
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,120
So go check it out.

1005
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,680
Nintendo really did announce New Amiibo.

1006
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Loki was not joking earlier.

1007
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,520
Splatoon is going to be getting some new amiibo.

1008
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,720
The Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, who do all the announcing in the game and they do

1009
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,000
that Stay Fresh, that little pose, the Stay Fresh pose, that is actually going to be the

1010
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
pose.

1011
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
I love the way these amiibo look.

1012
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,160
I love the little, the bottoms with the ink kind of coming out.

1013
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,160
These look great.

1014
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,120
These amiibo are really getting put together better and better.

1015
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,840
They're also going to be releasing new color variants of Inkling Girl, Inkling Boy, and

1016
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,680
Inkling Squid, which is kind of, eh, whatever.

1017
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,760
But they're going to be out on July 8th.

1018
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,840
Callie and Marie will cost $25 together.

1019
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,720
And then the new bundle with the recolors is going to be $35 if you want to check that

1020
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
out.

1021
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,080
You were worried that Nintendo wasn't going to release anything this year.

1022
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,760
Well it is, it is interesting that, you know, they are adding more, I don't think these

1023
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,200
things add new levels or anything into Splatoon, but I think it is like recoloring so the characters

1024
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,280
or, uh, what did the Callie and Marie thing do?

1025
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,120
I don't remember what they did off the top of my head, maybe somebody in chat remembers.

1026
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,400
But they're just going to do like tiny little tweaks, like it's nothing like major major

1027
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,640
to the game.

1028
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,800
But it's still something, if that makes sense.

1029
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,880
Act F says they have music in them.

1030
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,240
Well that's still something, a little something.

1031
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,280
I just, I would honestly get these for the figures.

1032
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,000
They just, they look great.

1033
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,120
So, anyway, moving on, Xenoblade Chronicles, not the one that was on Wii U, but was on

1034
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,480
the Wii, and was really hard to get on the Wii, because when they finally released it

1035
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,400
here in the States, after like years of waiting, they only released it at GameStop, which was

1036
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,040
a big pile of shit.

1037
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,200
Actually, I think they did do the online shop, to be fair, I think you could buy it direct

1038
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,880
through Nintendo as well, to be fair.

1039
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,800
But you couldn't buy it everywhere else, it was kind of a retailer exclusive.

1040
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,440
Well now, if you missed Xenoblade Chronicles, and you want to experience where Shulk comes

1041
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,480
from and so forth, you can actually download it on Wii U eShop, that is kind of a big release

1042
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,800
that just came out for the Wii U eShop.

1043
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,280
If you want it, it will cost you $20, or $19.99.

1044
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,880
So it is a good game.

1045
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:06,800
It is one of the greatest Japanese PlayStation 2 RPGs I played, yet it was on the Wii.

1046
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,960
So take that for what it's worth.

1047
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,400
And lastly, we talked a little bit about this last week, but now we have a date.

1048
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:19,920
The new Mass Effect ride, Mass Effect, does the ride have a name?

1049
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,200
I don't think it does, I think it's just the Mass Effect Experience.

1050
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,960
No, Mass Effect New Earth, thank you, I knew it had a name.

1051
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,880
Mass Effect New Earth is going to be opening May 18th at California's Great America.

1052
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,480
That is a Wednesday, and I'm trying to actually get over there, hopefully to do, hopefully

1053
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,360
if I can, I don't have the nice camera and all that set up that Bobby has, but I'm hoping

1054
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,280
somehow I can do some video day one to bring back for you.

1055
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,560
Obviously I can't film the ride, I think they'd probably frown on that, but if the rumors

1056
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,760
are true that there's going to be cosplayers, people dressed up, and some of the ambiance

1057
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,640
I'm sure around the ride and so forth, I'm very excited to see it.

1058
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,240
So yeah, I'm trying to make things happen so I can get over there that Wednesday to

1059
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,920
be one of the first to ride the ride.

1060
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
Very excited.

1061
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,920
So, May 18th.

1062
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,800
Are you going to check that out at some point, Loki?

1063
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,960
I know you're not as into Mass Effect as the rest of us, but it's still a video game ride,

1064
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,960
which is kind of cool.

1065
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,960
No.

1066
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,960
No?

1067
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,960
Hater.

1068
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,960
Alright.

1069
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,020
Tiger Claw in chat says, guys should dress up as Joker while at that ride.

1070
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:25,500
You know, people don't really dress up for places like Great America like they do for

1071
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Disneyland.

1072
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,380
And, well, the Disneyland thing is weird.

1073
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,540
Okay, I'm going to do a quick, quick side tangent, because this actually doesn't relate

1074
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,100
to where, like, Jamie is there at the park today, right?

1075
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:40,140
And today is a thing called Dapper Day, where people dress up like it was the days when

1076
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,660
Disneyland opened, when people would dress all fancy to go to the parks.

1077
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,740
So like, you know, some friends of mine, like Victoria, who was on Guys on a Show a couple

1078
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,300
weeks ago, she was wearing like this really nice dress that she made out of like a Disney

1079
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,640
sheet and so forth.

1080
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,020
But they do this thing where you can't go into Disneyland dressed up as characters,

1081
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,580
because they don't want people confusing you with the real characters, right?

1082
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:07,340
But they do this thing called Disneybounding, which is where you wear something that's inspired

1083
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,340
by a ride.

1084
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:13,420
So it's like you look kind of like it's, it's like a crossbreed type of thing.

1085
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:19,460
So she wore a dress that looked like the Haunted Mansion colors, but it wasn't a Haunted

1086
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,500
Mansion dress, if that makes sense.

1087
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,780
But she wore something that was very much like, oh, that looks like a Haunted Mansion

1088
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,960
adjacent thing.

1089
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,800
So anyway, I maybe can wear my SR2 hat.

1090
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,800
That's what I'll do.

1091
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:41,440
I will, I will Biowarebound when I go to California, Great America, that's what I will do.

1092
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,980
I will have my red beard and my SR2 hat.

1093
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:52,080
So like if someone came dressed up like, you know, Freddy Fazbear, you know, to Disneyland.

1094
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,660
It would be frowned on.

1095
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,400
But it doesn't look like any of the Disney characters.

1096
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,760
It just looks like one of their rides came alive and trying to eat children.

1097
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,880
They're going to get you on the fact that you're wearing a mask.

1098
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,440
You can't wear anything that conceals your face.

1099
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,720
It's not a mask, this is my face.

1100
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,040
Yeah, I think it's a safety issue because they're going to say that they can't videotape

1101
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,600
you because, you know, there's a camera pointing at every single thing at Disneyland.

1102
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,320
Do not have sex at a Disney park.

1103
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,580
You will be filmed.

1104
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,800
I'm just saying.

1105
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,660
I've heard stories of what the Haunted Mansion employees have seen.

1106
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,800
That's all I'm going to say.

1107
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,120
Do not have sex at a Disney park.

1108
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,720
Don't do it.

1109
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,080
Unless you're into that kind of thing where you like to be an exhibitionist.

1110
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,260
No sex in Disney park.

1111
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:39,360
No sex in the Disney park.

1112
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,400
Absolutely positively.

1113
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,760
No sex in the Disney park.

1114
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,800
You could probably have sex at Great America though.

1115
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,880
I don't think their budget's as high as security.

1116
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,800
I can't wear my ass like I wear it.

1117
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,880
You could probably get a Bijon Gold Striker and nobody would notice.

1118
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,600
Oh wait, no, no, all those rides, they fucking film you.

1119
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
That's the big thing now.

1120
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:10,720
We're going to film you on the ride screaming and hollering and all this shit so when you

1121
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,400
get off the ride you can see a video of how stupid you are and then we'll sell it to you

1122
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,160
for like 30 bucks.

1123
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,080
That's the big thing they do now.

1124
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,080
You want your porno?

1125
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:25,200
It's going to cost you $30.

1126
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,400
Which means I've got to take Extrofer to, I need to see what he's doing on May 18th.

1127
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,800
We're going to take Extrofer to the park and make him ride Top Gun or whatever they

1128
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
call it now.

1129
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,720
It's not called Top Gun anymore but it's going to always be Top Gun.

1130
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,000
Really fast jet ride.

1131
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Homo Erotic Volleyball.

1132
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,160
Alright, let's get to-

1133
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:57,240
Maverick and Goose's Wild Ride.

1134
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,660
Let's get to the emails.

1135
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:04,540
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some

1136
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,700
of our favorite emails to read here on the show.

1137
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:13,060
So again, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1138
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:16,580
Tiger Claw says, I wouldn't be surprised if people were caught having sex and it's a small

1139
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,580
world.

1140
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,780
Why would you do that?

1141
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:20,780
Don't.

1142
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,780
Don't do it.

1143
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,780
Alright, we have several emails tonight.

1144
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,180
I'm going to get through these though.

1145
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,580
Email number one from Flaco Jones.

1146
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:32,460
Remember last week on the show, we talked about Flaco Jones submitting to Summer Games

1147
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,460
Done Quick.

1148
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,460
Yes.

1149
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,460
This is a follow up to that.

1150
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,460
For his, yeah.

1151
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,460
For PT.

1152
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,460
PT.

1153
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,140
So Flaco writes us and says, just finished the latest episode and yes, I did submit one

1154
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:45,660
of my PT runs for the Summer Games Done Quick marathon but it was rejected.

1155
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:50,380
They always do a spooky Games Done Quick block during the summer marathon and I was hoping

1156
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,740
since PT is kind of short that they could have squeezed it in despite not having cool

1157
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,940
glitches or skips.

1158
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,260
Sadly, they are only running three spooky games this year.

1159
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,940
Silent Hill 3, one of the Amnesia games and one of the Resident Evil games.

1160
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,740
I'm too lazy to look it up.

1161
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,260
I'll keep trying every time a marathon comes around.

1162
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,740
Plus, my time keeps getting better so that should help.

1163
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,060
I'm currently top three in any percent and top two in the 100% category.

1164
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,420
I have a feeling that PT would have a better chance of making it through though if they

1165
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:19,460
didn't pick another Silent Hill game for the spooky block.

1166
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,460
Wish me luck.

1167
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,700
You get accepted.

1168
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,220
Yours will be the first podcast to know.

1169
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,500
Well, I appreciate that.

1170
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,980
Tiger Claw on chat says, maybe it got rejected because it's not a proper game.

1171
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,300
It's just a demo.

1172
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,340
You know what?

1173
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,180
It's more than just a demo.

1174
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,180
It's much more.

1175
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,180
How dare you?

1176
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,380
It's much more than a demo.

1177
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,140
Someday we can hope.

1178
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,980
Moving on to another email coming this week from YYR.

1179
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,540
Hello LR.

1180
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,140
One of the many, many NX discussion threads on NeoGAF this week again brought up the big

1181
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,580
issue of third-party support.

1182
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,740
As it stands, love it or hate it, I think most of us can agree that the only reason

1183
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:02,060
to own Wii U is for its exclusives, most of which are from Nintendo themselves.

1184
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,300
Some gamers say, who cares?

1185
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,300
I buy a Nintendo console to play Nintendo games.

1186
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,460
But we can easily see with the Wii U that this group isn't big enough to carry the system

1187
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,580
on its own.

1188
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,980
How do we approach this problem?

1189
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,020
Unfortunately, my belief is that the root of the problem is also the root of Nintendo's

1190
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,540
strategy to intentionally not do the same thing that everyone else is doing, but instead

1191
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,040
to build a console around a concept.

1192
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,900
Let's say I'm a developer, which I am.

1193
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,140
If I'm going to develop something for Wii U, I feel compelled to write a game that takes

1194
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,980
advantage of the gamepad because of how unique it is.

1195
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,540
But because of that, it takes more effort to design or release such a game, and then

1196
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:36,620
the end result can't be ported to other platforms as is.

1197
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,420
This makes developing for Wii U a riskier proposition right out the gate.

1198
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,980
Or I could develop something for Wii U that barely or doesn't take advantage of the gamepad

1199
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,980
at all.

1200
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,660
If this means I could release the same game on other platforms, owners of these platforms

1201
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:51,460
will then say, well, why would I buy it on Wii U then?

1202
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,460
Because the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, you could get the added value of trophies

1203
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:58,460
or achievements, the social features, and of course, the convenience of using the console

1204
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,120
that is already your primary gaming platform.

1205
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,580
If it's a big risk regardless of the approach, why would a developer put their game on Wii

1206
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,580
U at all?

1207
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:09,300
And if the NX turns out to be another Nintendo concept piece, how will it change a third

1208
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,540
party's mind about developing for a Nintendo console?

1209
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:17,420
That I believe is the greatest challenge Nintendo faces with NX, especially in year one, when

1210
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,900
the initial sales numbers can make or break a console.

1211
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,260
I hope they're ready for it.

1212
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:25,580
Crossing my fingers, toes, and eyes, Aaron, YYR.

1213
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:29,820
Great email, because this kind of piggybacks on something I was saying earlier in the show,

1214
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:35,420
but there is one little twist I want you to consider with NX that's a little different.

1215
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:41,820
At least, again, this is all hypothesizing, but some of the loudest rumors have been that

1216
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:46,980
there is going to be some type of handheld console synergy with the NX, which is, I

1217
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,900
think, why Loki said earlier in the show, whatever.

1218
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,580
I wasn't expecting it until 2017 anyway, because actually, I think a lot of people were expecting

1219
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:59,180
that the handheld was going to come this year, the console was going to come next year.

1220
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,300
Does this news affect that whole relationship?

1221
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:06,720
I don't know, because we don't know what NX is, but hold on a minute and let's assume there's

1222
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,880
a dual thing going on with the handheld slash console.

1223
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,640
There's really not a lot of competition in the handheld space right now.

1224
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,640
Mobile.

1225
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,040
I mean, that's the biggest competitor.

1226
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,520
I'm sorry, but the Vita at this point is really a fringe thing, and that's not really...

1227
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,840
Look, I know I'm pissing off Vita fans with that, but you got a dose of realism here.

1228
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,680
The Vita is kind of a fringe ultra fan thing.

1229
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,040
You think Nintendo's thing is narrow.

1230
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,320
The Vita is a very, very narrow audience right now as it is, which is too bad.

1231
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,880
I really like the Vita.

1232
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:46,760
But Nintendo kind of dominates the handheld outside of mobile, so if a company were to

1233
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:52,200
make a game for NX, it's going to be a lot easier to get in that handheld space.

1234
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:59,320
So I wonder if Nintendo isn't somehow leveraging their robust third-party network on 3DS, of

1235
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:04,680
which they have a lot of people still making games on 3DS, to maybe port the games that

1236
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,760
way, if that makes any sense at all.

1237
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,760
That's just...

1238
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,760
It's just a wild thought.

1239
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,240
Again, we don't really know shit until they really tell us more about what this console's

1240
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,920
all about, but if we want to put all the rumors together and hypothesize from there, I would

1241
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,560
say the handheld angle is what may make this a little bit different situation, because

1242
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:26,840
now you're not just putting out a game that you can't put out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox

1243
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:33,680
or whatever, but you will have a game that's on console and the dominant handheld.

1244
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,560
Dominant dedicated handheld anyway, because I can't really ignore that mobile is kind

1245
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,400
of a big deal.

1246
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,720
Anyway.

1247
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:46,580
Stop Drop in Chat says, maybe if they cater to indie games, neither Sony or Microsoft

1248
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:49,440
has really gone head first in the indie scene.

1249
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,240
Maybe Nintendo can compete as a highly polished Steam store.

1250
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,640
You know, I feel like Nintendo does try to do that a little bit.

1251
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,000
They just don't do the greatest job of really pushing the indie games front and center,

1252
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,020
but if you actually go on the eShop, there is quite a bit of stuff.

1253
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,000
By the way, there's a really killer Humble Bundle right now that's some indie Nintendo

1254
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,280
games that's definitely worth checking out, and I think there's even some commercial release.

1255
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,360
I think Rhythm Thief is one of the games in it, which was for you music game fans.

1256
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,800
You get a kick out of that.

1257
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:24,600
But to be fair, I want to say Sony, wasn't this just two E3s ago that they had a whole

1258
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,240
line of indie developers up on the stage.

1259
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,840
And they were like, here's this, and this, and this.

1260
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,840
So I don't know if I would say that Sony and Microsoft are like, not, I kind of think they

1261
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,840
actually, Sony and Microsoft do just as good of a job with the indies, at least right now.

1262
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,840
We'll see.

1263
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,840
We'll see.

1264
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,640
Again, the handheld thing I think could be a big deal.

1265
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,620
If that's even what it is, I don't know.

1266
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,520
Let's get to another email from AZHP.

1267
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,320
AZHP says, since I chimed in on earlier reports from this show about the Coleco Chameleon,

1268
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,240
I thought I'd share the final bit of information reported by Eurogamer about our pal Mike Kennedy.

1269
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,880
The article can be found here, and he links over to a Eurogamer article, and then there's

1270
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,120
an Atari Age post that it references as well.

1271
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,540
I'm going to summarize for the benefit of the show.

1272
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:11,160
Mike Kennedy came forward on the Atari Age forums announcing that he was tabling the

1273
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,800
console endeavor for good, and explained that yes, the two prototype consoles were fakes.

1274
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,920
However, he claims that he was in the dark just as much as the fans who were misled.

1275
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,160
He claims that he hired a hardware engineer who provided the original prototype with in

1276
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,400
instructions to not show the back of the unit no matter what.

1277
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,600
Mike didn't understand why, so he ended up releasing pictures of the back of the system

1278
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,920
anyway to prove that the console was actually plugged in.

1279
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,080
This is when the unit was identified as a Super Nintendo Jr. inside a Jaguar shell.

1280
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,640
When he took this information back to his engineer, he insisted that it was Super Nintendo

1281
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,280
parts for the output, but the rest was his.

1282
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:49,060
Kennedy believed him, and they released images of the clear Jaguar shell with the PCP visible.

1283
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,680
According to Kennedy, he even joked about how people online were trying to identify

1284
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,880
the board in our shell, laughing and telling me they won't find it because it's our

1285
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,880
original work.

1286
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,440
Again, I believed him.

1287
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,080
After the PCB was exposed to be a PCI capture card, Kennedy withdrew from the venture.

1288
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,160
He claims he was swindled out of nearly $10,000 of development costs and is just as much a

1289
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,520
victim as anyone else.

1290
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,640
Whether or not this is true will only be ever known by those involved, but this is likely

1291
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,080
the last we will hear regarding what actually happened with the chameleon.

1292
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,160
If it's true, I do feel sorry for Mike as he just wanted to revive retro games, which

1293
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,820
was clearly a passion of his as he spoke about on this very show.

1294
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:27,300
Now his name is tarnished, and he will likely never be able to launch a video game-related

1295
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,300
endeavor again.

1296
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:32,000
Hopefully, you all found this enlightening.

1297
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Yours truly, AZHP.

1298
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Thank you for the follow-up.

1299
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,600
I appreciate it.

1300
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,840
I hope that what he is saying is true.

1301
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,280
I have no reason to disbelieve it.

1302
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,360
It is just a real bummer.

1303
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,520
It just sounds like, and with all due respect, obviously, he's been on the show before, and

1304
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,520
I don't know if he listens, but I know some people who work with him do.

1305
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,240
I'm sure he's a brilliant guy, and I'm sure he does really enjoy the retro gaming and

1306
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,240
all that stuff.

1307
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,020
It just sounds like if I'm taking all this when I'm reading at face value, he was just

1308
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,200
in over his head.

1309
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:05,860
He got into a venture that he really needed to rely on other people to kind of help out,

1310
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:08,200
and that's what you do sometimes.

1311
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,960
You might be the producer, but you really rely on building that team.

1312
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,760
I can't believe I'm going to fucking use this analogy, but here I go.

1313
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,600
Donald Trump keeps saying if he becomes president, he's going to surround himself with a cabinet

1314
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:26,040
of people that know what they're doing, essentially, because obviously Donald Trump does not know

1315
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
what he's doing.

1316
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,040
Am I really making this comparison?

1317
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,240
My God.

1318
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,280
But that's what you do.

1319
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,840
If you're a good producer, you surround yourself with people that are going to lift you up,

1320
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,400
and it sounds like, unfortunately, he got done in by some of the people he surrounded

1321
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,520
himself with, and it's unfortunate too bad.

1322
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,520
So there it is.

1323
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,560
Now I need to take a shower after making that comparison.

1324
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,860
Here's the thing about that guy, dude.

1325
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:56,800
He claims that it was this other person that made this prototype console and said, hey,

1326
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,920
whatever you do, don't show the back of the console.

1327
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:04,880
Wouldn't that kind of like send out some red flags, or wouldn't you want to dig in there

1328
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,080
to see what exactly was in that console prototype that you paid this guy several thousand dollars

1329
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,080
to make?

1330
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:15,280
And then after it was come out that that, oh, yeah, it was a Super Nintendo in there,

1331
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,320
you went back to the same fucking idiot to put out another fucking prototype that ended

1332
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,000
up being another fake.

1333
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,920
It's like, come on.

1334
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,440
Hindsight is 20-20, what can I say?

1335
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:33,600
Stop Drop wants to offer another perspective here in chat from live.vognetwork.com saying

1336
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,000
he's so full of it, he's not the victim here, he already had drama in the Indiegogo campaign,

1337
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,520
he knows he had to have all his ducks in a row, he has no excuse for claiming ignorance,

1338
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,720
as if this is the first time he's ever gone down this road.

1339
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:52,160
All right, let's get to our last email tonight from Raginator, who says, hi, OLR.

1340
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,360
As per usual, it's Raginator, and I have a short email for you this week.

1341
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,360
You're welcome, DarkSakura.

1342
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,120
Haha, joke's on you, she's not here.

1343
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,520
As you may remember, every so often on OLR, I practically beg companies to re-release

1344
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,080
their classic games on Steam.

1345
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,840
Well, to a limited degree, it would seem that Namco has listened.

1346
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,480
A week to ten days ago, they released four titles for individual sale, two of which technically

1347
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:17,080
were available via Pac-Man Museum, Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug.

1348
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,240
Just a quick aside, Raginator, they also released these on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1349
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:25,320
It actually isn't unique to PC, but yes, it did hit PC as well.

1350
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,200
While I won't speak for others, I'll say this.

1351
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,840
While this is rather limited and not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.

1352
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,480
I hope the trend continues, not just with Namco, but with other companies as well.

1353
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,480
This email was brought to you by Rocket Weasel, home of the rocket-propelled, asploding weasels.

1354
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,480
Thank you, Raginator.

1355
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,880
Yes, lots of retroactivity on Steam between what Loki was talking about earlier and what

1356
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,840
you're bringing up with the classic arcade releases.

1357
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,440
And I suppose, as with most things in the industry, if those re-releases sell well,

1358
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,920
then they'll do more.

1359
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:04,080
Which is why I kind of wish Namco had done something else.

1360
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,600
Like you said, they released games they've already done in Pac-Man Museum.

1361
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:14,840
And I want to say Dig Dug was in a PlayStation 3 collection, Galaga is available on Xbox

1362
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,400
One and Xbox 360.

1363
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:24,480
I just feel like these choices are not exactly new, so I kind of wish Nintendo would look

1364
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,960
elsewhere in the catalog for some things to release because Namco has a very rich 80s

1365
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,960
arcade library.

1366
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:35,800
So I don't know, maybe Pac-Man is kind of a big deal, so I guess it's to test the waters,

1367
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,800
but we'll see.

1368
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
We'll see what comes of it.

1369
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,240
I did want to say, though, on kind of a tangent thing, because this is something Raginator

1370
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,560
brought up a couple weeks ago, and Loki, maybe you saw this as well.

1371
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,480
Do you remember when Raginator was talking about the whole movies on Steam thing and

1372
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,800
that there's not a lot of movies available on Steam?

1373
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:54,800
I swear to God, just within the last week, I see an ad on Steam, Lionsgate is now selling

1374
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:01,360
movies on Steam, and you can get like Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay and all

1375
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,360
this stuff.

1376
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,640
You can get these movies, probably Saw is on there, too, Lionsgate.

1377
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,160
You can get a lot of these movies through Steam.

1378
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:12,240
Here's the thing, though, because the first, the minute I saw that, I thought of, huh,

1379
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,240
that's interesting because we just had that discussion on the show this last week about

1380
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,080
what are they going to do when they have to hit the kill switch.

1381
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,720
These movies that they're selling are rentals.

1382
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,080
They're not actually to own the title.

1383
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,640
It's just to rent them, so I guess that's how they got around that.

1384
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,800
But anyway, I just, I thought of that, Raginator, because your email or call or something from

1385
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,720
last week, and then like literally in the past seven days, suddenly we have expanded

1386
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,080
movie presence on Steam, so I just thought that was very interesting.

1387
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,320
So, um, uh, SHO and Hunter Matt says, Raginator is Steam's biggest fanboy.

1388
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,280
Of course, they'd have tabs on his thoughts.

1389
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,840
All right, there it is.

1390
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,120
Thank you for all the emails this week.

1391
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,280
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for consideration

1392
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,080
for a future week.

1393
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,520
We're just a couple stories away from your calls, but first, we have to get some of the

1394
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,640
angst out in a little segment we call the FUs of the Week.

1395
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:23,920
Um, F you to being sick.

1396
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,600
Thankfully, it's a lot better now because I don't have a fever, but like from seriously

1397
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:38,000
Monday through practically Friday, I was running a fever all the time, even with, you know,

1398
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,720
ibuprofen and acetaminophen in my system.

1399
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:48,240
It was just not fun whatsoever because that made it very hard to learn a new job since

1400
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:53,560
I'm kind of working in a different position at the moment, but thankfully I'm better now,

1401
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:59,480
but it's still congested, so that still sucks and tired and goddammit, why won't this load

1402
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,480
up?

1403
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,040
Are you trying to dinker around with something there on the Gear VR?

1404
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,200
Yeah, I was trying to get the Gear VR Minecraft to work, but like I popped it in there.

1405
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,920
It's all installed the Gear VR software.

1406
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,680
I'm like, it's already fucking on there.

1407
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,680
I've used it before.

1408
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,680
Okay, fine.

1409
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,680
All right.

1410
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:22,280
My FU of the Week goes to getting sick because I've been sick like three times in the past

1411
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,280
six months.

1412
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,200
This is ridiculous.

1413
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,440
People in my job are going to be like, what's wrong with you?

1414
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,180
You're a big box of cooties.

1415
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,480
They're probably not wrong.

1416
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,480
That's how I feel.

1417
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:36,200
Anyway, I'm hoping, I'm hoping whatever this is will blow over really quick because I would

1418
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,360
like to, I would like to work next week.

1419
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,840
There's a lot of stuff going on.

1420
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,080
Anyhow, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we are going to get to the Skype

1421
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,080
line.

1422
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,200
But first, Logie's going to have to put down the Gear VR and get to our last story.

1423
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:55,720
So you know, last we heard of them, they were basically messing with Activision.

1424
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:02,040
Activision finally wiped their hands clean of them and now they've parted ways.

1425
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:09,800
Now they have turned towards Ubisoft and they're making purchases of their shares to,

1426
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,340
I don't know, maybe try to take over the company.

1427
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:20,960
But apparently after receiving the buyout package from Activision, they've been buying

1428
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,320
up shares of Ubisoft, hinting at a hostile takeover.

1429
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:31,140
Their control, let's see, their last purchase that they made brought their control percentage

1430
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:38,100
up to 17.73% and 15% of the voting shares.

1431
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,740
And of course Ubisoft made a comment regarding this as well.

1432
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:47,100
We are not at all surprised by this latest statement from Vivendi nor by the intent behind

1433
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,100
it.

1434
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:56,620
This is a confirmation of their habitual strategy of creeping control in which they say they

1435
01:20:56,620 --> 01:21:01,660
have no intention to take control of Ubisoft while steadily increasing their stake and

1436
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:05,700
preparing for an offensive at the next annual shareholders meeting.

1437
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:15,460
This strategy successfully, sorry, this strategy of successively announcing conflicting intentions

1438
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:22,100
is contrary to good corporate practices and is not in the best interest of Ubisoft's other

1439
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,100
shareholders.

1440
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,940
Moreover, despite our repeated written requests since they first entered into our capital,

1441
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:34,300
Vivendi has never presented any details or a convincing plan on how this supposed cooperation

1442
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,540
would take place.

1443
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:41,580
Ubisoft's management remains committed to preserving the independence of the company,

1444
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:48,980
which the condition for long-term value creation that will benefit for all of our shareholders.

1445
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:55,940
So I don't know, it didn't work out that great last time that they took over a company.

1446
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:56,940
So we'll see.

1447
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:03,460
It would be interesting to see what the long-term vision is there, especially going into what

1448
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:09,180
could be a new console cycle here or half console cycle.

1449
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:17,540
Well lastly, but not leastly, we have an esports related story and boy, this is embarrassing,

1450
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,940
but it's not loading for me.

1451
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:23,940
So unfortunately, all I know is I don't have the details, I just have the headline, but

1452
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:30,260
there's an esports league out there that has banned you porn from sponsoring an esports

1453
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,260
team.

1454
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,900
Poor you porn, can't catch a break.

1455
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,620
What do you mean they don't want to associate pornography with esports?

1456
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,380
What's up with that?

1457
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:44,020
I think you should take, you know, whoever, whatever sponsors you can.

1458
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:46,180
So yeah, basically it says the ESL.

1459
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,180
Oh, thank you.

1460
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,180
Yeah.

1461
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,180
And it finally, go ahead, go ahead though.

1462
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,180
It finally came up.

1463
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,180
No, go ahead.

1464
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,180
Go ahead.

1465
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,180
All right.

1466
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:59,220
The ESL, the directors of the esports league, eslgaming.com, they have ruled that you porn,

1467
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:03,820
that team is going to be banned because of the association with that sponsor.

1468
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:07,540
Advertising pornography is not legal in the markets we operate in and the vast majority

1469
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,520
of partners we're working with have a strict no drugs, no alcohol, no pornography rule,

1470
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,960
no fun, Jesus, rules that we've contractually taken on board.

1471
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,240
These aren't new rules, but ones that have been in our rule books for a long time.

1472
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,200
We spoke to the manager of team YP earlier this year.

1473
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,920
And in that conversation, we explained the situation and rules in detail and offered

1474
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,560
to look for potential alternatives in a bigger group.

1475
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:33,080
At the same time, we are consulting with our legal teams about this.

1476
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:37,460
We will inform the team and management as soon as we have any updates.

1477
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,680
So there you go.

1478
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,920
You porn team has been banned.

1479
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,920
Come on.

1480
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,720
If it's on the internet, there's porn.

1481
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,080
Like people don't know that.

1482
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,080
What's the big deal with porn anyway?

1483
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:56,920
I think what's more shocking is they're playing Evolve.

1484
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,680
Stop dropping chat asks, did the you porn team yell money shot instead of headshot?

1485
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,680
Maybe.

1486
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,720
I don't know.

1487
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,040
Is this the actual you porn team that they show in the picture here?

1488
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,040
I don't think so.

1489
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,040
Yeah.

1490
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,880
I think they're just, I think they're just, that's going to, that's going to be interesting

1491
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,880
though when your team just, the stock photo just ends up on the you porn story.

1492
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,880
Who gives a shit?

1493
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,160
I mean, I, it's just a company.

1494
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,800
I'm sorry that you don't like what they do now.

1495
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:26,640
I think you should have your, you know, that would make it more exciting.

1496
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:37,120
Sex drugs and you know, alcohol, that should all be a part of this e-sports thing.

1497
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,120
You know what I, here's the thing.

1498
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,920
If you porn, yeah, I guess this is the same group cause this is a, a tiger clause posted

1499
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,920
a picture in the chat.

1500
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,920
So it is the same group.

1501
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Hey, if you porn wants to sponsor this show, I'm all for it.

1502
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,640
Bring it on.

1503
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,560
We'll interview some of the actors and actresses.

1504
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,880
We'll go, we'll go the whole nine yards.

1505
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,880
What do you guys think?

1506
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,760
Should OLR sell out to you porn?

1507
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,760
Yes or no?

1508
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:07,440
Yes, I'm fully, I'm fully fine with selling out to you porn.

1509
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,240
All right.

1510
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,880
We put it out there.

1511
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:18,520
You porn, you participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to come on over.

1512
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,520
All right.

1513
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,680
Uh, that's it for the, uh, news that we had on deck tonight.

1514
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,680
So we're going to open up the Skype line.

1515
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,920
I know it's a little early, but I warned you guys it was going to be a shorter show tonight.

1516
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,920
One eight seven seven game OLR or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

1517
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,920
All one word.

1518
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,880
If you want to give us a call, um, while we wait to see if any calls come in.

1519
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,160
Uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

1520
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,920
Uh, no.

1521
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:50,360
Sadly, no, there wasn't a whole lot, um, last minute stuff.

1522
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:55,760
Yeah, it actually, all things considered, despite the, uh, big news about Nintendo that

1523
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,400
happened, um, it seemed to be a little bit, a little bit more relaxed this week.

1524
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,120
It was, it was a little bit quieter.

1525
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,860
I was scanning through Twitter to see if we got any tweets this week.

1526
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:09,180
This one's really random, but we were tweeted something by blue swim a few days ago that

1527
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:13,900
talks about, I don't know if you heard about this Loki, maybe you saw the, um, uh, tweet

1528
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,540
as well, but ABC is bringing back the match game.

1529
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,540
Oh yeah.

1530
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,540
Alec Baldwin is the host.

1531
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,660
It's kind of a weird choice for host for me.

1532
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:25,760
I mean, you know, Alec Baldwin was great on 30 rock, but there was something I was going

1533
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,760
to mention.

1534
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,740
It's like Clyde brought up to me earlier and I did watch it, um, this weekend, um, was

1535
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:37,380
that independent animation that was done for Star Fox called a Fox in space.

1536
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:38,380
Oh yeah.

1537
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:39,380
Have you watched that?

1538
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,380
Yeah.

1539
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:41,380
You were tweeting.

1540
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,380
I have not watched it, but I, it's actually pretty cool.

1541
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,340
It's, it's like, uh, it's, it's a very interesting style.

1542
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:50,380
Remind me like a, like early eighties, you know, like more of the, not, not necessarily

1543
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:58,080
adult, but like, you know, kind of like that adult style, um, cartoon or animation from

1544
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,580
like the early eighties, I guess, you know, where it's.

1545
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:06,180
Back when cartoons, you know, were just, it's a medium, you know, where they had some adult

1546
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:11,380
storylines like heavy metal, you know, for example, um, you know, something like that,

1547
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:14,660
but it was, you know, Star Fox related and I thought it was pretty cool.

1548
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,660
Hmm.

1549
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:16,660
No, I didn't see that.

1550
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,660
I'll have to check that out.

1551
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:20,380
I still need to watch the final fantasy 15 anime too.

1552
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:23,620
Cause that was the thing that came out a few weeks ago when they did the big fantasy 15

1553
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,960
event and I still haven't watched that.

1554
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,300
So yeah, tiger claw linked it in chat, so go check it out.

1555
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,300
Awesome.

1556
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,300
All right.

1557
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,300
I'll do one last call for calls.

1558
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,300
It's early tonight.

1559
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,140
It's probably throwing some people off, but we'll see, uh, one eight seven seven game

1560
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:39,100
O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.

1561
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,580
Um, but I think, I think we just have less, uh, of an audience and stuff tonight just

1562
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,460
because Bobby wasn't here.

1563
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:49,220
And then I think there isn't, isn't game of Thrones back tonight or something.

1564
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,220
Is it?

1565
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Yeah, I think it is.

1566
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:54,920
So there, there goes Sunday nights for some people and these are, these are the ones that

1567
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,340
now are in uncharted territory because they are past the books at this point because George

1568
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,780
R R Martin can't write fast enough.

1569
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:05,300
Although somehow he's killing everybody in 2016.

1570
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:09,180
Ah, I don't get it.

1571
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,180
All right.

1572
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:13,260
Oh, well our phone is lighting up, so let's get to it.

1573
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,260
Hello.

1574
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,260
You're on orange songs radio.

1575
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,260
Who's this?

1576
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,380
I guess it's the savior of the show, Rama.

1577
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,940
Hey Rama, how's it going?

1578
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,380
Ah, pretty good.

1579
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,380
Pretty good.

1580
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,260
I'm just kind of relaxing after a fun, interesting weekend.

1581
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,860
Did you do a con this weekend or what?

1582
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:29,860
What was your weekend?

1583
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:30,860
Uh, no.

1584
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:36,060
Uh, this weekend was Sakuna Matsuri, but I decided I didn't go because I forgot to get

1585
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,020
time off and so forth.

1586
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:44,140
And I triple booked my weekend and then I was like, you know what, maybe I will go cause

1587
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,420
someone had an extra pass.

1588
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:50,060
I get up this morning, it's raining and I'm like, I'm not taking my thousand dollars of

1589
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:53,060
equipment out into the, no, not doing it.

1590
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,060
Nope.

1591
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:55,060
Nope.

1592
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,060
Nope.

1593
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:59,660
I'm like, um, my end of June is looking crazy right now.

1594
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,900
I'm like triple booked crazy.

1595
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:06,060
So anyway, I just opened up outlook and I'm like, let me look at my calendar for next,

1596
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,060
for the summer.

1597
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:09,060
I'm just like, Oh shit.

1598
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,060
Yeah.

1599
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,060
Fuck.

1600
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,060
Well, what's on your mind?

1601
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:17,260
Uh, this whole thing about Nintendo, I mean, don't get me wrong.

1602
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:22,180
Nintendo has fail us in the past, but I can overlook those for what they were trying to

1603
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,180
do.

1604
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:27,300
I don't think the NX is going to quote unquote, make or break the company.

1605
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,380
I mean, they have one hell of a war chest.

1606
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:37,820
If you ask me, the console just has to have the tech to keep up with everybody else.

1607
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:44,380
And it, and I believe the rumor that it's going to be PC based, which means cheaper

1608
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,380
overhead costs.

1609
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:50,040
You just pull what you need off of, off the shelves and everything's going to just rock

1610
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,520
and roll.

1611
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,920
Um, but what about the whole backwards compatibility?

1612
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,760
Cause that's something Nintendo is famous for.

1613
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,460
I would be very surprised if they did not retain backwards compatibility with at least

1614
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:06,440
the Wii U games that would really surprise me if they jumped that whole ship.

1615
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,800
I just have three words about that.

1616
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,800
Fuck backwards compatibility.

1617
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,240
Oh, those are some strong words.

1618
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,240
Maybe it's me.

1619
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,400
I look at it this way.

1620
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,400
Yes.

1621
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,400
I have my PS3.

1622
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,760
I have the hardware fat model that's fully compatible with the PS2.

1623
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,280
Do you know what else I have sitting up hooked up to my TV?

1624
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,280
My PS2.

1625
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:32,740
Just cause I do have import games that do not play on my PS3.

1626
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:38,240
If I was go out and get an Xbox one, I would not trade in my Xbox 360 because maybe out

1627
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,320
of my collection, only one game would be compatible.

1628
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,880
Plus you're also looking at, you have two different types of hardware architecture to

1629
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,880
deal with.

1630
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,560
That would increase the overhead costs of the system.

1631
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:56,120
I had an interesting discussion with a friend of mine about this and she was trying to prove

1632
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,800
the point of the backwards compatibility on the PS4 and I'm just like, well that's all

1633
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,000
streaming between you and me.

1634
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:08,040
I'm not paying monthly for a streaming service for it to play older titles.

1635
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:14,280
I will not pay, like if I already paid 40 bucks on a game for the 360, if they recode

1636
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:18,520
the game for the Xbox one, I'm not going to spend another 40 bucks when I already have

1637
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,520
the game.

1638
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:25,040
I'd rather deal with the patience of the emulation or I'll just pop in my 360 and I'll play it.

1639
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:29,720
I really wish though that PlayStation 3 was backwards compatible on PlayStation 4 and

1640
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:35,160
it kind of irritates me that they even have that whole PlayStation Now thing and yet if

1641
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,200
I put a PS3 disc in the drive, it's still not going to let me do it.

1642
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,200
I'm going to have to buy it separately.

1643
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,760
It just kind of irritates me.

1644
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,080
I'm out of shelf space is what it is, Rama.

1645
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:48,520
I mean, I don't have space for all these fucking consoles in the living room and so

1646
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,520
I had to make a choice.

1647
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,320
I moved the PS3 out to the, I only use the PS3 now for TuneIn here in the studio so we

1648
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,960
can listen to Bobby's show while we wait for OLR.

1649
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,520
That's pretty much the use of the PS3 right now.

1650
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,000
I don't really game a lot on it anymore.

1651
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,240
I really wish, if nothing else, if I could just like stream from the PS3 to the PS4,

1652
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:10,320
even that would be something but I just kind of doubt that's going to be a thing.

1653
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:15,080
I mean, theoretically with the proper hardware software, you could do it, Sony could do it,

1654
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,800
but they probably don't want to.

1655
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:22,960
But again, it's two different types of architectures and it's going to be harder to emulate like

1656
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:28,520
on the Xbox One, emulate the power PC processor and for the PS3 is hard and like the cell

1657
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,520
processor to Sony, it's just cheaper to offer this service.

1658
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:39,560
Now if I had a PS4 and these games are streaming compatible, if I did not have the game, I

1659
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,960
would not mind paying monthly to play those backwards compatible games.

1660
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,920
But if that game is on my shelf, I want to run that service, pop the game in, and not

1661
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:49,920
pay for it.

1662
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,920
Yeah, I agree.

1663
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,640
I really wish that's the way they'd done it, but for whatever reason it's not.

1664
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,200
We can always hope that maybe they'll change it, come out E3, I just hope, here's what

1665
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:05,480
I really hope, because this would be such a fucking Nintendo thing to do.

1666
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,640
They come out and say the PlayStation 4 Neo will be backwards compatible with PlayStation

1667
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,640
4 or PlayStation 3.

1668
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,520
I'm going to be so fucking mad if that's the case.

1669
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,920
I've been reading specs on it and the upgrade for the PlayStation 4 has me kind of pissed

1670
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,920
off.

1671
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,120
I mean from this aspect of how much memory that's going to be in the system, I mean like

1672
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,120
memory is cheap.

1673
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,760
You mean to tell me you can't put an extra eight gigs in the system?

1674
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,920
Yes, I know the dev kits are designed around eight, but if you put another eight in there,

1675
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,440
the games will run a lot smoother and a lot faster.

1676
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,320
I mean, come on, fam.

1677
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,320
Come on.

1678
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,320
Yeah.

1679
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,400
Well, it seems like we've got a lot of questions going into E3, but the good news is we only

1680
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,880
have, what, not even six weeks to wait.

1681
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:46,880
Yeah.

1682
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,880
So we'll get there.

1683
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,880
Very much.

1684
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,840
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else comes through, but

1685
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,480
have a good week and we'll talk to you next time.

1686
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,480
Yeah, bro.

1687
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,480
You take care of yourself.

1688
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,480
All right.

1689
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,480
Take care.

1690
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,480
Bye.

1691
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,480
Bye.

1692
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,880
For the folks just joining us, if you joined late, yes, we are already in phone calls.

1693
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,640
It is going to be a shorter show tonight just because at the top of the show I mentioned

1694
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:08,800
I'm actually not feeling too well, but I really, really did not want to skip another week.

1695
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,960
My nose is getting bleh and my throat is scratchy, so I did not really want to talk for the full

1696
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,000
three hours.

1697
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,840
So I hope you guys all understand we are doing a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but

1698
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,400
we just, we had to do something because we've just been missing too many weeks lately and

1699
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,880
I don't want to be a bimonthly show.

1700
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:25,600
I want to be a weekly show with incidental weeks off.

1701
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,840
Anyway, we'll put one more shout out there for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or I usually name

1702
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,520
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1703
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:39,040
And then after we get this last call, looks like we've got one more call coming in.

1704
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1705
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:41,960
Who's this?

1706
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,960
Hey, this is Akdeft.

1707
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:43,960
Hi, Akdeft.

1708
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,240
What's up?

1709
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:51,740
Why can't we be so negative against Nintendo?

1710
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,520
Why can't we be negative against Nintendo or why are we negative?

1711
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:59,640
Well, why can't we and why are we negative against Nintendo?

1712
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:06,720
Well, I could show you a tweet that says, please look forward to the new Zelda game

1713
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,120
coming holiday of 2015.

1714
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:14,520
So maybe some people just feel that Nintendo is disappointing with the pushback and the

1715
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,520
pushback.

1716
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,920
And yes, I know the whole Miyamoto line about, you know, a good, a bad game is bad and the

1717
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,240
good game will be memorable and everybody will forget.

1718
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,120
But at the same time, you know, you sort of, I think you kind of invest yourself and you,

1719
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:31,240
you emotionally get ready for some of these games and even those folks that support Nintendo

1720
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:34,720
kind of champion and saying, you know, these games are coming, they're going to be awesome.

1721
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:38,480
And then to find out they're not, it's just, it's a little disheartening, you know, but

1722
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,240
again, I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.

1723
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,840
I tend to feel like, all right, once 2017 gets here, if the NX really delivers with

1724
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:52,760
the games I want, I'm telling you, if the NX has like Metroid, F-Zero, Mario, this conversation

1725
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,760
is done.

1726
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,640
I am on the NX day one.

1727
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,680
I probably will be no matter what anyway.

1728
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,260
But like, you know, with the right games, Nintendo will pull it out.

1729
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:06,320
But maybe the fact that those right games never seem to show up is also part of the

1730
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,320
reason we get very frustrated with Nintendo.

1731
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,320
I don't know.

1732
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,320
What are your thoughts?

1733
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:16,240
Well, I would think, uh, partially like that, yeah, we do have some games that don't deliver

1734
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,280
on their promises and all that.

1735
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:28,480
And with the Wii U, it was a really, really, uh, like a hard, uh, period, if we could say

1736
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,480
that.

1737
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:37,160
Uh, when only, uh, well, we can say a handful of games were really, really, really excellent.

1738
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:42,920
Though I do have a vast, uh, Wii U library and I could pretty much mention more than

1739
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,920
10.

1740
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:52,480
But yeah, most people probably want at least, uh, five games that they want with the system.

1741
01:36:52,480 --> 01:37:05,040
And I hope the NX fixes that problem and Nintendo does get the idea that we want some of the

1742
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:11,200
older games like F-Zero, like a new Metroid and all that stuff.

1743
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:16,720
But we also kind of underestimate Nintendo a lot.

1744
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,000
And I mean a lot.

1745
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:28,000
We uh, like Splatoon and even Pikmin 3, like many people, and I was reading a tweet earlier

1746
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,340
today that said, oh, the Nintendo Wii U doesn't have any strategy games.

1747
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:39,920
And I'm like, uh, what about Pikmin 3, which is one of, I don't, I'm not into strategy

1748
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,000
games, but Pikmin 3 was pretty, pretty good.

1749
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:53,720
So I don't know about that and, and the Nintendo Wii U has some really great games that pretty

1750
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,160
much were overlooked.

1751
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:03,840
That's my, my probably biggest problem with people, uh, saying that the Wii U failed when,

1752
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,440
uh, most of the time they didn't even give it, give them a chance, chance, sorry.

1753
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:16,440
Um, I, I, I would agree that there's a lot of people out there that probably hate on

1754
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:21,200
the Wii U that's probably never touched one, but that's just the nature of the internet,

1755
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,200
unfortunately.

1756
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:28,440
And, um, I, I think, you know, there's also a lot of Wii U champions out there too.

1757
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:32,280
So it's kind of a, it's kind of a mixed bag, I suppose, on, on Twitter and in any circle

1758
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,560
of gaming, you're always going to have the Nintendo fans and so forth.

1759
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:40,320
But I think too, part of Nintendo's kind of tone, I think changed with Wii U and I

1760
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,680
really blame third parties for that.

1761
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:46,480
You look, you go back and you look at that first E3, it looked like every third party

1762
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,720
in the world was gung ho about the Wii U.

1763
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:55,180
The problem was is that they made a key error and that was that all the games that they

1764
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:59,360
released right out the gate were rehashes of games that they had just put out a year

1765
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,400
ago.

1766
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:06,240
And I think if there had been more games like Zombie U out the gate and less, I hate to

1767
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:11,520
say it, Mass Effect 3 and less Batman, Arkham, whatever game it was that it was a silent,

1768
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:17,720
no, it was Arkham Knight, no, it was Arkham City, whatever, whatever Batman game came

1769
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,760
out on Wii U when it came out, you know, if it was less of that and more of the stuff

1770
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,800
like Zombie U and so forth coming from third parties, it would have helped tremendously.

1771
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:34,580
I think and I have a feeling Nintendo pushing back the MX may have something to do with

1772
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:36,440
third parties more than we think.

1773
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:41,120
The third parties might have said we need more time to make these games work and Nintendo

1774
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,680
is giving it to them because they do not want to make the same mistake twice.

1775
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:53,760
Not to mention that, yeah, the Wii U lacked a lot of first party support too at the beginning.

1776
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:59,500
What was the only game or I think two games that were Nintendo published that were Nintendo

1777
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:06,960
Land and I think, I can't remember exactly but I think it was also Gaming Wario.

1778
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,960
But yeah, also Nintendo didn't push like a big game.

1779
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,440
That's probably why we're also seeing the new Zelda on the NX.

1780
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,440
Yeah.

1781
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:21,480
I think Nintendo may have underestimated how fast EA and Ubisoft were going to get

1782
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,600
the fuck out of there.

1783
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,560
I think that really caught them off guard.

1784
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,280
Yeah, pretty much.

1785
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,280
Yeah.

1786
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,280
All right.

1787
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,080
Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your

1788
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,080
thoughts.

1789
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,080
I appreciate it.

1790
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,080
Hey, thanks for having me.

1791
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,080
All right.

1792
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,080
Take care, my friend.

1793
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,080
All right.

1794
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,920
That is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1795
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,880
I want to thank you guys for being here, whether it be on the live or the podcast feed, I really

1796
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,160
appreciate that.

1797
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:49,240
You know what we always say here at OLR, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two

1798
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:50,400
about the show.

1799
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,800
Help us spread the word.

1800
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,520
We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't share those voices unless you

1801
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,800
guys use them.

1802
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:02,000
Dark Sakura will be back next week and we'll catch up with how her week at Disneyland was

1803
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,240
and what all games she got to play, maybe she got to visit the arcade there or something.

1804
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:08,240
I don't know.

1805
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:11,960
I want to say that PinnaGogo, the pinball thing, is coming up really soon too.

1806
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:15,400
I don't know if that's next week or two weeks away but I'm sure Dark Sakura will give us

1807
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,040
some perspective on that as well.

1808
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,160
Loki, have fun with your Gear VR.

1809
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,880
Yeah, I didn't get my old ass controller to sync with it.

1810
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,360
Try to play some games this week, now that you're feeling a little better.

1811
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,480
Uh, yeah.

1812
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:33,440
And I'll try to play something that's not just Final Fantasy XIV or Diablo.

1813
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,720
You guys, I just love online games, I just do.

1814
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,720
Keep on giving.

1815
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:40,440
Anyway, that's what I play.

1816
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,440
Final thoughts tonight?

1817
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,840
Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

1818
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,560
I'm going to go buy a new Bluetooth controller because this one doesn't work.

1819
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,560
What?

1820
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:52,080
Well it works but it doesn't work with what I want it to work with.

1821
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,440
I got to buy something more generic.

1822
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,480
Well hey, at least you have a little time tonight.

1823
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,320
You might be able to get the best buy before they close, who knows.

1824
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,320
Uh, no.

1825
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:00,320
Don't.

1826
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,320
Close at 8.

1827
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,320
Oh, I thought it was 9.

1828
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,320
Alright.

1829
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:06,000
And then my final thought is I'm going to just rest up, I'm going to go have some tea

1830
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,320
and just try to rest my voice and feel better.

1831
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,840
Thank you guys for understanding and bearing with our ups and our downs.

1832
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,880
Your support means an awful lot and that's why we continue to do this as much as we can

1833

Really appreciate it.

1835
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,040
Have a great week.

1836
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,040
Go play some games.

1837
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:23,040
Have fun.

1838
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,280
We'll talk about games again in seven days.

1839
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,280
