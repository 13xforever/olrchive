0	27000	This week, the ebb and flow of game teases reaches new highs as release ads for No Man's Sky make their way to game stores only to have the release postponed and stainless modified. This, a special guest and plenty more news begins right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on May the 29th of 2016 with episode number 643 of our show.
46000	57000	We are that show, of course, about all things video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California. Hot Sacramento, California.
57000	65000	With myself, Rob Roberts, and the one laughing, cackling wickedly over there, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
65000	67000	We may be live, but I'm dead inside.
67000	71000	Does the heat make you dead inside? Did it evaporate your soul?
71000	73000	Soul?
74000	76000	Oh, I forgot. You don't have one of those.
76000	80000	No, my soul is fueled by coffee. And now I can't have coffee that much anymore.
80000	82000	This is a tragedy.
82000	86000	A tragedy and a travesty. It's a sin against me.
86000	88000	It's a tragivesty.
88000	93000	That sounds like... Nevermind, I was going somewhere.
94000	106000	We need to traverse the tragivesty that is you not being able to drink coffee. So doctor's orders, you have to quit coffee for like a couple weeks? Couple months?
106000	115000	I ease off the caffeine in the first week, so I'm drinking decaf coffee for the first week. The next week starts easing out my coffee, so I've already got this cocoa drink replacement.
116000	131000	Contrary to popular belief, chocolate does not have caffeine. I believe the chemical in it is theobromine, which produces a caffeine-like effect without the various other upsets that caffeine can cause.
131000	138000	Which is why you get a semi-euphoric effect from good chocolate. The stronger the chocolate, the stronger the effect.
138000	140000	I see.
140000	145000	Note to self, when playing Overwatch, have chocolate.
145000	155000	I also have raw cacao nibs to mix in my smoothies and stuff. I'm working through it right now, it's the headaches that are the worst.
155000	167000	Although I was at work on Friday and I was like, hi, what can I do for you? I'm sorry, you're having problems. I'm having problems too!
168000	174000	Alright, well, also having problems here in studio. Say hello to Techmaster Loki!
174000	175000	Hello.
175000	180000	Hello. You got 99 problems, but a lack of breadsticks ain't one I can see over there.
180000	184000	No, lack of breadsticks is not... Lack of air conditioning, however...
184000	187000	I'm trying! I have the air conditioning down in the fan oven.
187000	189000	No, I'm talking about my house. I don't have air conditioning right now.
189000	190000	What?!
190000	194000	Yeah, because our air conditioning is broken. We're getting it replaced, but we don't have it yet.
194000	198000	Oh, and I bet your kids are just... I bet they don't complain whatsoever.
198000	199000	Nope, of course not.
199000	207000	Oh my gosh. Yeah, just so you guys know, we're starting to get into that infamous Sacramento summer, and it's... Is it what, 90 degrees here today?
207000	213000	That's not even the worst of it. 90 degrees today, which isn't even that bad. I'm sure there's a lot of people sitting out there...
213000	215000	Oh, it'll be 107 I think tomorrow.
215000	223000	Yeah, people in Phoenix are probably sitting there going, God, you babies. But, I mean, this isn't the worst of it. This is just the beginning.
223000	224000	Yeah.
224000	231000	So, here we go. Anyway, you guys in our chat, of course, every week, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
231000	238000	www.vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
238000	241000	And if you are listening to us live, you should join us in our chat room.
241000	248000	Live.vognetwork.com, where SSG100Matt points out, it's been 90 most of the week in New York.
248000	250000	Oh, God, because it's all...
250000	251000	And it's humid there.
251000	256000	It's humid there. So, yeah, I guess we're not going to get any sympathy from our East Coast friends this week.
256000	265000	Well, actually, there's a good way to find out if we'll get sympathy or not because we have a guest here in studio who's come to visit our fair show all the way from New York.
265000	271000	And I'm very excited to have him here because he's been a long-time supporter of the show.
271000	275000	Those of you that have listened for a while are going to know who this is right off the bat.
275000	283000	And he's literally made our dreams come true in so many ways. And he's here to join us in studio tonight.
283000	288000	Say hello everybody to developer YYR is here.
288000	292000	Wait, what? I'm still stuck on vaginesty.
292000	299000	It's like a 40-year vaginesty reaches back to the Queen Elizabeth era or something.
299000	301000	That's what happens when the Amazons take over.
301000	303000	Oh, okay. I get it now.
303000	305000	Yes, I'm here from New York.
305000	309000	Yeah, so is it hot here compared to New York?
309000	315000	Well, you know what? It was pretty cool in New York actually up until about the time we left.
315000	317000	We've been here almost a week now.
317000	324000	And so we went from like 60 or so degree weather in New York to 60 or so degree weather in San Francisco.
324000	327000	So for me, there was like no change at all.
327000	333000	So to know that it's been like 90 in New York is it's like, what are we going home to?
333000	336000	You're kind of you're kind of glad that you're here right now, right?
336000	340000	Well, with the 90 degrees being the exception.
340000	343000	Yes. Yes. I am very happy to be here.
343000	348000	And you're you're actually here on the West Coast because you just got married and you're here.
348000	353000	Is this like your honeymoon or your you have to visit the other side of the family?
353000	360000	Well, actually, Amy's niece graduated middle school this past week and we needed to be there for that anyway.
360000	364000	So we decided, well, you know what, why not just make a week long trip out of it?
364000	366000	So we did. There you go.
366000	371000	We'll probably take our real honeymoon later in the year when we actually have some vacation time again.
371000	374000	Nice. Because this basically just bottomed us all out.
374000	378000	And I do I do want to acknowledge your lovely new wife. Amy is joining us here in studio.
378000	383000	But I know she's not as much of a gamer, although she what is she doing on her phone right now?
383000	388000	She's probably playing a game. So she sits there and goes, I'm not a gamer.
388000	390000	She's playing threes or something over there on her phone.
390000	397000	So, you know, like just just because you don't play like Doom or Overwatch or that doesn't mean you're not a gamer.
397000	401000	So I'm just this one is called Word Whistle. Her niece showed it to us.
401000	407000	And yeah, it's just this, you know, it gives you blanks and a number of words.
407000	410000	And you have to come up and it gives you a category and you have to come up with the words.
410000	414000	It's actually pretty clever of one of many free to play games on the phone.
414000	418000	So, yeah, check it out if you like word games and things.
418000	420000	All right. I will get right on that.
420000	425000	But we we got to check out the games you make because some folks in chat are like, wait a minute, I know this game.
425000	431000	Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal in chat, reminding one of our listeners that YYR made pixel shits.
431000	436000	That was that was you. So you you have actually developed your own video games.
436000	440000	What was the first one you ever published? You did Snake 360, right?
440000	450000	That's right. And back in 2008, someone you may know as SSJ 100 Matt said to me, you know, I know these guys.
450000	452000	They're pretty cool. They do a video game podcast.
452000	456000	They probably would interview you if you want. Just go ahead, give them a buzz.
456000	458000	And so, well, I did.
458000	461000	Who the hell is he to name drop us like that and not go through my agent?
462000	467000	I'm just kidding. Yeah. And so that that started this whole deal that we have.
467000	473000	And yeah. And I was grateful to you guys for interviewing me back in the day.
473000	479000	And well, thank you for helping spread the word about my silly little arcade style games.
479000	486000	Well, and it was it wasn't just the fact that, you know, you had the the friend tie in because SSJ 100 Matt's been a longtime supporter of the show, though that helps.
486000	493000	I mean, let's be real. But you are also a longtime fan of music games and music based video games.
493000	496000	Yes. You were a DDR freak poster back in the day, right?
496000	499000	I was. I think I had like 2000 posts before they shut down.
499000	505000	Oh, my God. That's probably more than I had. I don't even think I ever hit in the four digits. That's crazy.
505000	512000	So you and you actually had music from Kyle Ward, who was on this show probably about a year ago at this point,
512000	518000	who did who now does the rerave and has this other the ditto beat in those games.
518000	523000	So you actually had his songs in your game. Yeah. For all that happened.
523000	527000	Yeah. Yeah. And actually, it's going to happen again.
527000	532000	I'm getting close to releasing Snake Party, which is going to be my last.
532000	536000	I'm sorry. Snake Party sounds a little something. Something.
536000	540000	Something I'm something I might rent at the adult video store.
540000	545000	It's like making a video game called Sausage Fest. Like, you know what?
545000	548000	I can call it Snake Party, a.k.a. Sausage Fest on the Web site.
548000	553000	They have a movie coming out called Sausage Parties.
553000	558000	But yeah, it's basically the the evolution of Snake 360 multiplayer,
558000	562000	plus a whole bunch of single player missions thrown in for good measure and a couple other bonus modes,
562000	568000	including one secret unlockable mode, which I could mention here if people want.
568000	572000	But yeah, it's that's also going to have the Kyle Ward music in it.
572000	577000	And he's really cool because, you know, if you're an indie developer and you have zero budget or close,
577000	583000	you find somebody who says, oh, I'll let you put my music in the game if you give me a percentage of your money.
583000	587000	And then you don't have to lay out anything. Yeah. So he was really cool.
587000	589000	He said that would be OK with him. And there it is.
589000	596000	A lot of a lot of indie gamers have to remember there's a lot of indie artists that can probably team up with you.
596000	599000	And you guys can find an agreement that works with you guys. So that's the best way, really.
599000	603000	Now, you were showing Snake Party. I'm sorry. I love the name.
603000	607000	Yes, I was showing Snake Party with my pants up.
607000	612000	As much as we're laughing at it here in studio, like, you know, the game itself is like I thought, you know,
612000	615000	I remember the cell phone game Snake and thought it was a lot of fun.
615000	619000	And so when Snake 360 happened, I was like, oh, this is this is funny, like in a good way.
619000	624000	And then when I see the Snake Party, I was like, OK, this is one of those things where, like, when you tell people,
624000	628000	oh, it's a multiplayer of the cell phone game Snake, I'm sure there's a lot of people that kind of roll their eyes.
628000	631000	But if you actually play it, it's really fun.
631000	634000	Really, the hardest thing is to get people to try it. Yeah.
634000	638000	They walk past, they see it's Snake. A lot of people just keep walking.
638000	643000	But those people that do try the game seem to have a really good time with it. So I'm hoping they check it out.
643000	646000	I'm sure WarioWare looks ridiculous the first time you see it, too.
646000	647000	But like once you play it.
647000	648000	You don't even know what you're looking at.
648000	651000	Yeah, it's like, oh, my God, this game is so much fun.
651000	656000	But the other thing you were showing at MAGFest this year, which is super notable, we talked about the saga a little bit on the show.
656000	667000	So I don't want to rehash it completely, but we've got to talk about the success you've really had in in large part because of demoing at MAGFest with multitasking.
667000	669000	Tell us a little bit about multitasking.
669000	680000	So multitasking is, as you may remember, a game that challenges you to play up to four minigames at the same time, starting from one, but gradually building up.
680000	693000	The minigames each have you doing one single task, such as pong, hit the ball back, dodge the falling weights, you know, just avoid the other cars you're driving.
693000	695000	Just one task, one task at a time.
695000	701000	But when they start asking you to do two, three or four of them at a time and things start speeding up, it's not so easy anymore.
701000	709000	Yeah, it's it's kind of like like the best way I could describe it is it's like imagine you're playing WarioWare, but you're playing four copies of it all at once.
709000	715000	And that's I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but it is so fun and it's it's really addicting.
715000	718000	And I remember and this is probably about a good year and a half ago at this time.
718000	721000	Now on the show, you called us, you were telling us about this idea.
721000	726000	And I remember telling you, Aaron, this is a genius idea.
726000	729000	And if you don't make it, I will steal it.
729000	734000	And so and I remember Bobby saying in chat, yes, I am looking to do it.
734000	737000	I am reverse engineering this right now.
737000	740000	And sure enough, here we are. You're at Magfest.
740000	743000	You demo the game. You had a great response right at Magfest.
743000	744000	I did.
744000	749000	Everyone who tried it really those people that didn't just like stumble away and confusion.
749000	755000	Right. Really seem to like it. We had people coming back all weekend, you know, again and again to try it.
755000	764000	And you made it a point and I'm sure Amy, when she was helping, you made it a point to tell everybody as they were leaving, hey, you like this game, go vote for it on Steam Greenlight because we want to see it happen.
764000	767000	Right. And they did. And they did. That's the surprising part.
767000	769000	And what happened a month after you got home?
769000	771000	It passed.
771000	773000	It was not even 30 days.
773000	780000	And I was talking to other developers at Magfest and they were saying, oh, well, this game took a long time, but it finally got through Greenlight.
780000	782000	I was on Greenlight for 12 months, 18 months.
782000	786000	I don't know how the heck I managed to get multitasking through in 30 days.
786000	787000	I really don't.
787000	793000	Because it's a genius concept and here's the part of the show where I'm going to do the I told you so dance.
793000	795000	I told you so.
795000	797000	He's really dancing, by the way.
797000	799000	You can't see it if you're not here, but he is really dancing.
799000	804000	Aren't you glad you came out here for the radio show so you could see the dancing that happens that they can't see?
804000	807000	It was absolutely worth the trip.
807000	812000	Also, Amy Droven, not me.
812000	815000	Well, congratulations. And I can't wait.
815000	821000	Now, are we talking like a Mighty No. 9 release schedule here or when do we actually get to play multitasking?
821000	824000	First of all, I'm not setting a release date for the Steam version until I have one.
824000	825000	Smart.
825000	828000	A concrete, actual release date.
828000	829000	Soon.
829000	836000	And I can also tell you that we're not going to delay it due to online multiplayer features because there won't be any online multiplayer features.
836000	838000	So at least we don't have that.
838000	850000	What we will have in the Steam version is a version of the game that will allow you to play with a controller and also hopefully with not just an Xbox 360 controller but with some others as well.
850000	855000	It'll also be able to be played with a keyboard if you don't have a controller handy.
855000	860000	We worked on a control scheme that pretty much works and is intuitive.
860000	865000	So just because you don't have a controller doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy the game.
865000	870000	Please do test with a Steam Box, though, because I plan to put that on my TV through a Steam Box.
870000	872000	That made you think, didn't I?
872000	877000	You know what? I don't know if it'll work outside of Windows.
877000	879000	Steam Box is...
879000	884000	Oh, it's just broadcasting what's on your computer over to the TV. It should be fine.
884000	889000	I don't know how well this game will work broadcasting, but hey, you know what? I'll do my best.
889000	893000	You'd be surprised. A lot of the response times and everything like that.
893000	902000	I played Cavern of the Necrodancer. I've played that on the Steam Box and it's fine.
902000	906000	Oh, cool. Alright, yeah, as long as the response time is good, you should have a good experience in theory.
906000	913000	But yeah, I'm trying for extra controller support and also there'll be, I believe, five or six new minigames that weren't in the original.
913000	922000	It'll be kind of like point blank in the fact where you can choose the original set of like 13 games or the expanded set of 19 games if you want the extra challenge.
922000	927000	Nice. I'm so happy for you that that is happening.
927000	928000	Thank you.
928000	933000	Good luck and we will promote the shit out of it when it finally releases eventually.
933000	938000	And by the way, the Steam version will probably be called Super Multitasking.
938000	942000	Okay, so because multitasking was too generic.
942000	951000	Actually, somebody in the comments section on Greenlight pointed out, you know, you need something else besides the word multitasking because if you Google just the word multitasking, you're not going to find your game.
951000	955000	So super multitasking hopefully is a little bit more unique.
955000	960000	Maybe super multitasking 5000 because you're going to have 5000 minigames in this.
960000	961000	And this is someone I'm just kidding.
961000	963000	That's a lofty goal.
963000	966000	You do want to play this game sometime during my lifetime.
966000	967000	Yes.
967000	971000	I will say that with Steam Box, there are some latency issues for some people.
971000	972000	Really?
972000	973000	Which is why we returned ours, remember?
973000	978000	That's true. You know what, maybe I don't know. Ours is completely wired. Our box is wired.
978000	979000	We did wireless.
979000	981000	Interesting. Okay, that could be part of it.
981000	984000	But you should have seen the lag on DuckTales.
985000	988000	Okay, so yeah, your your mileage may vary.
988000	991000	But I think I think I will have good luck playing on the television.
991000	996000	I do want to say really quick, though, before we get into our gaming weeks and news and all that stuff.
996000	1003000	I want to quickly talk about because one reason we love you so much, Aaron, is that you have made our dreams come true.
1003000	1013000	We have a long running gag on this show about our dream games, things that we have said on air that were, you know, inside jokes or whatever that we said, no, this should this should really be a game.
1013000	1019000	And I guess one of these ideas actually inspired you years ago to make a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing.
1019000	1020000	Yep.
1020000	1024000	That is still available on Xbox 360 for another year and a half, right?
1024000	1028000	Yeah, about that. A year from September is when they take them all down.
1028000	1030000	Yeah, and that's Microsoft's decision, not yours.
1030000	1031000	That's correct.
1031000	1037000	But you were telling me a little bit on the ride over here from our lovely Chipotle dinner.
1037000	1042000	You were telling me about the kind of like what that's evolving to.
1042000	1051000	Can you can you kind of tell our listeners a little bit about what the because, you know, it sounded like at first that all you guys that were developing for XNA were just going to get the finger, basically.
1051000	1053000	But that really doesn't seem to be the case now, right?
1053000	1057000	There really is a future for XNA projects.
1057000	1058000	It's it's surprising.
1058000	1068000	But yeah, back in I believe it was either late February or early March, Microsoft announced at a build conference, which I believe is halfway across the world somewhere.
1068000	1077000	Basically, they announced that they were making the Xamarin tools free to all developers.
1077000	1080000	They had purchased the company and they made all their tools free.
1080000	1093000	And what that is is basically these are libraries that you can run on top of Visual Studio that allow you to create things for iOS and Android in C Sharp.
1093000	1104000	Now, this is notable for XNA developers because MonoGame, a free and open source replacement for XNA, runs on the same framework.
1104000	1121000	So I literally, not counting the like two or so hours it took to install all the crap, in about one hour I had a project that was an XNA game running on my phone, my Android phone.
1121000	1128000	And yeah, so I mean, basically, I don't need to reinvent the wheel if I want to take these games and put them on mobile platforms.
1128000	1131000	I can just go ahead and click a few buttons.
1131000	1137000	And then, of course, tailor things for either Google Play Games or Game Center or what have you.
1137000	1142000	And there I have a mobile version of whatever my game was.
1142000	1147000	That's awesome that they're leaving the door open to make it so easily portable.
1147000	1148000	So that's great.
1148000	1153000	So hopefully a mobile version or something, a bungee fair tossing in the future to live forever.
1153000	1157000	It would be difficult considering the control scheme to reproduce that on a phone.
1157000	1158000	I guess that's true.
1158000	1161000	But I can tell you on my website I posted something.
1161000	1165000	I have created an initiative called No Game Left Behind.
1165000	1167000	Clever.
1167000	1179000	Basically, by the time Microsoft brings the XBL-IG store offline a year from September, I intend to have all of my games available for sale in other places.
1179000	1189000	And what probably will happen with bungee fair tossing is it will be for sale on itch.io, which is a nice little site where indies can post their games for any price, DRM free.
1189000	1190000	They provide a storefront.
1190000	1194000	They provide, you know, pretty pages and the ability to accept payments.
1194000	1199000	We really don't give that site enough love here on the show considering how much they do for the indie community.
1199000	1200000	So definitely check that out.
1200000	1201000	Itch.
1201000	1203000	I always say itch.io, but it's itch.io.
1203000	1205000	It sounds like itch.io.
1205000	1206000	Itch.io, yeah.
1206000	1208000	Yeah, so look forward to that.
1208000	1212000	You may or may not need an Xbox 360 controller to play it.
1212000	1218000	I think I have a mouse and keyboard control scheme that I came up with at some point written down somewhere.
1218000	1221000	So I'm thinking mouse and keyboard controls if you don't have a controller.
1221000	1223000	And you will be able to play it on your PC.
1223000	1225000	Windows PC, I should say.
1225000	1226000	Sorry, Jamie.
1226000	1227000	For a dollar.
1227000	1231000	I'm getting the death stare right now.
1231000	1232000	You know what?
1232000	1234000	I have a PC still.
1234000	1235000	Oh, okay.
1235000	1238000	How else would I play Dragon Age?
1238000	1241000	I'm not boot camping this thing.
1241000	1244000	She'll find a way.
1244000	1245000	There's a will.
1245000	1246000	There's a way.
1246000	1247000	She'll find it.
1247000	1253000	Also, I found out Danganronpa is on Steam for Mac as well, and that makes me happy.
1253000	1254000	I did not know that.
1254000	1255000	That's a surprise.
1255000	1256000	Both of them are.
1256000	1257000	Cool.
1257000	1263000	Actually, a lot of the games that I play through Steam are available on Mac these days.
1263000	1266000	SSG100Matt wants to know about multitasking.
1266000	1270000	Will there be a Bobby Black Wolf Friends Forever mode?
1271000	1278000	The minigame and the multitasking difficulties are actually independently adjustable.
1278000	1282000	So you can go ahead and make the multitasking easier and the minigames harder or vice versa.
1282000	1287000	Actually, I think it's really entertaining to put the multitasking difficulty on maximum
1287000	1291000	and the minigame difficulty on minimum so that you have to do four things at once,
1291000	1293000	but they're really easy, at least at first.
1293000	1295000	Okay.
1295000	1296000	Very cool.
1296000	1300000	One other question from SSG100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1300000	1306000	SSG100 wants to know, could there be a YYR classic games collection on Steam with all your old games?
1306000	1309000	Snake, Snake 360, Card Arcade, so on.
1309000	1316000	There are no plans for that at this time, but honestly, I feel like if there was a demand for it,
1316000	1319000	I would be able to get a collection like that ready.
1319000	1323000	And if there's a demand, I mean, if I have a successful game and people are like,
1323000	1325000	YYR games, I actually know who that is.
1325000	1330000	Okay. So if multitasking sells shitloads, then we'll be in a good spot.
1330000	1331000	I think so.
1331000	1334000	Speaking of shit, what is the current status of Pixel Poops?
1334000	1339000	I know this was your Vita game that was free online, the Pixel shits,
1339000	1343000	and that was another like 2600 homage, but hilarious.
1343000	1345000	Hilarious in concept.
1345000	1349000	I mean, just, you know, again, if you don't know this game,
1349000	1352000	and then you actually released it for the Vita for a very short period of time,
1352000	1356000	because the Vita then pulled that stuff, like not even a month, right?
1356000	1361000	So for those who didn't know, basically the idea was you had these joggers that were running through the park,
1361000	1363000	and your goal was to poop on them.
1363000	1365000	Just don't ask. That was the game.
1365000	1367000	You have to poop in front of them.
1367000	1368000	Yeah, you have to poop. Anyway.
1368000	1376000	But the genius, the genius thing that made this into a game was that your poop is finite.
1376000	1381000	And to refill, you have to go to the, it's Taco Bell, but he called it something else.
1381000	1383000	I call it the taco restaurant.
1383000	1389000	The taco restaurant that's in the upper right hand corner, and that's how you refill the poop meter.
1389000	1393000	And when I heard that, I was like, God damn, this guy is brilliant.
1393000	1398000	Like, he'll think of that one thing that just makes the entire fucking game, and there it is.
1398000	1401000	And then you sold that on Vita, but unfortunately it's gone.
1401000	1403000	If you don't have it, too bad.
1403000	1406000	Is that part of no game left behind?
1406000	1411000	It is. Although, actually, if you go to yyrgames.com right now,
1411000	1417000	you will actually be able to play Pixel Poops on there right now if you are doing it from a macro Windows PC.
1417000	1418000	Nice.
1418000	1422000	There are leaderboards. They're not very populated, so please come play.
1422000	1424000	And as far as the mobile versions-
1424000	1425000	Please come poop.
1425000	1427000	Yes, please come poop.
1428000	1431000	I feel like there's a nincompoop joke here somewhere.
1432000	1436000	Yes, as far as the mobile version, right now multitasking is my priority,
1436000	1440000	but my plan is still hopefully to get this out sometime within a year's time.
1440000	1446000	A mobile version where you'll be able to go ahead and select different characters like a dog,
1446000	1449000	a monkey who flings his poop, you know, things like that.
1449000	1454000	And also you'll be able to eat different foods to change your color of your poop.
1454000	1455000	And also maybe the consistency-
1455000	1456000	You need to have asparagus mode.
1456000	1457000	Yes.
1457000	1459000	Because asparagus turns poop green.
1459000	1460000	Corn on the cob. Blueberries.
1460000	1462000	That would be like speckled poo.
1462000	1465000	All right, anyway. Oh my god, I'm dying. This is so disgusting.
1466000	1469000	Fifth Dream in chat says, I have it on Vita.
1469000	1472000	You and about 12 other OLR listeners have it on Vita.
1473000	1474000	And by the way-
1474000	1476000	You and about 12 other people have a Vita.
1476000	1477000	Oh, stop it.
1477000	1485000	And by the way, I do want to shout out to those of you who sent me happy wedding wishes last week over Twitter.
1485000	1489000	Thank you. There were several OLR listeners that did that.
1489000	1491000	Well, big congratulations to you.
1491000	1492000	Thank you.
1492000	1493000	It's kind of a big deal.
1493000	1495000	Some of us forget to check our Twitter.
1495000	1497000	That's okay. That's all right.
1497000	1503000	Anyway, YYR, I'm so happy to have you here and to talk about video games with us this week.
1503000	1506000	Anything else you want to plug real quick while you're here?
1506000	1513000	Make sure we get out all the stuff where people can follow you and the games you make and keep tabs on multitasking?
1513000	1524000	Yeah. I mean, I always post my up-to-the-minute news at my website, yyrgames.com, which sadly will not become yyr.game.
1524000	1525000	Or are we getting to that later?
1525000	1526000	We'll talk about that a little later in the show.
1526000	1527000	All right.
1527000	1528000	Yes.
1528000	1532000	The promo a few weeks ago was hilarious, though. And no, I did not pay for it.
1533000	1536000	We'll talk about why in just a little bit here in the show.
1536000	1541000	But before we get to the news, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1541000	1546000	It's a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week? And we're going to start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
1546000	1550000	It was actually busier than expected.
1550000	1561000	I quit Final Fantasy 14 because no one was ever on and played World of Warcraft just to find out that no one is ever on.
1561000	1562000	Thanks, Overwatch.
1563000	1573000	But I've actually had a pretty decent time playing it because there have actually been quests to do, you know, that didn't require me to have 50,000 other people in the dungeon with me.
1573000	1586000	I also played some Dragon Age Inquisition again to basically with that whole migration of my games to the new drive, I've had to test them all.
1586000	1589000	So I played a decent amount of Inquisition.
1589000	1591000	I love that game.
1591000	1593000	Pretty people in it.
1593000	1610000	Anyway, also, I actually have kind of ignored Danganronpa 2, except for Magical Girl Usami mode, which is pretty fun because you just basically go around drawing circles around your enemies and then gathering power ups and then you have to fight like this big mecha spider thing.
1610000	1620000	No, not like a mecha spider thing. It's actually you have to fight like one of these different beasts that are in the game blocking the different island exits to the other islands in Danganronpa 2.
1620000	1628000	And it's been pretty fun. It's kind of been like, except it's really freaking hard to do on a keyboard, so I have to go find my controller.
1628000	1637000	Um, so what else did I do? I'm still having Streetpassed YYR here and that sucks.
1637000	1644000	And, um, oh yeah. Here was Dragon Age. Ingress now that I'm level 8.
1644000	1646000	Grads. Attic.
1646000	1648000	Thanks, Rob.
1648000	1653000	Hi, Pot. This is Kettle. Guess what color you are? Here's a mirror.
1653000	1662000	I've also been playing the How Much Can I Get Away With Spending at Sephora game.
1662000	1665000	How much have you gotten away with so far?
1665000	1669000	I've made it out of Sephora with an $85 purchase.
1669000	1671000	That's impressive.
1672000	1678000	I bought, well, granted it wasn't all makeup. Okay, girly tangent for a moment.
1678000	1680000	Lord.
1680000	1681000	For my birthday.
1681000	1683000	Pay break, everybody.
1683000	1684000	Bitch.
1684000	1690000	For my birthday, they give out like a special gift if you're signed up for whatever their club thing is.
1690000	1695000	So I got this cleanser and it felt so good and it made my face feel like a 12 year old boy's butt.
1695000	1698000	Or like a baby's butt or something. I don't know. It was smooth.
1698000	1700000	How would you know what a 12 year old-
1700000	1703000	I have brothers.
1703000	1705000	I've punched them before.
1705000	1708000	Awkward conversation. Never mind. I'm sorry I asked.
1708000	1712000	I've punched them before and pushed them out of trees.
1712000	1713000	Fair enough.
1713000	1716000	And shot them with arrows. They were a nerf.
1716000	1725000	So anyway, I ended up buying like a big thing of it and some Anastasia Beverly Hills.
1725000	1728000	Which I would have never discovered if not for Drag Race. So thank you, queens.
1728000	1733000	I think we're about three months away from a full-on intervention with Dark Sakura and-
1733000	1736000	No, no, no, no. Wait until gamer X.
1736000	1738000	Alright. Oh, is it on at gamer X?
1738000	1740000	You already know what I'm doing at gamer X.
1740000	1741000	I do. I do.
1741000	1748000	I've got a toolbox full of makeup now and glue and prosthetic aid and spirit gum and you name it.
1748000	1750000	And I'm bringing it.
1750000	1752000	Plus I've made the shade fan now.
1752000	1757000	An 18 karat gold leaf. Bam.
1757000	1761000	Alright, clearly we've distanced ourselves from video games on that one.
1761000	1764000	So let's talk with Loki about how was your gaming week?
1764000	1773000	I didn't play a whole lot this week. Mainly just, well, I played Ingress because I have to keep that going.
1773000	1778000	And then I played a bit of Pokemon Go and that was it.
1778000	1781000	Are you really supposed to be saying that you've played that? I don't think you're supposed to tell me.
1781000	1783000	Who gives a shit? You know, whatever.
1783000	1786000	I really don't fucking care. I mean, so what?
1786000	1790000	Oh no. I'm not posting screenshots or anything, so it doesn't matter.
1790000	1795000	Not that it really matters if you've seen screenshots or not because there's not much to show right now.
1795000	1803000	Which, by the way, is I think the reason why not a ton of ton of people are in the beta is that they're really testing, I think, a lot of mechanics.
1803000	1807000	But there's no game, you know, from what I understand.
1807000	1810000	So there's not a lot of like...
1810000	1812000	There's not much to it right now.
1812000	1816000	It's not like Ingress where you link and field and get points and there's leaderboards.
1816000	1819000	Like, none of that is... You can catch Pokemon and that's it.
1819000	1822000	There's leveling, but I have no fucking clue what the leveling does.
1822000	1830000	You can catch Pokemon. They have it where you kind of have to flick the Pokemon ball up like you're actually throwing it.
1830000	1834000	And half the time it's just hard to gauge the depth on it and stuff.
1835000	1837000	It works okay.
1837000	1844000	If you like, you know, the Pokemon Rattatat or whatever, then you'll be really happy about this game because there's a shit ton of them.
1844000	1846000	And then...
1846000	1848000	What else? Oh...
1848000	1855000	I mean, it's just kind of... It's neat, I guess, and you can battle your Pokemon at the gyms and stuff and deploy them and that kind of thing.
1855000	1860000	But, again, from what I understand, it's not like the battles in the Pokemon Game Boy games.
1860000	1865000	It's like action-based. You tap on your Pokemon. You swipe left and right to dodge attacks.
1865000	1866000	I mean, it's different.
1866000	1867000	Well, I'd tap that.
1867000	1874000	So, if you're expecting the Pokemon games on the phone, that's not what Pokemon goes.
1874000	1876000	It's a lot harder to play it driving than Ingress.
1876000	1879000	Not to say that that has dissuaded me.
1879000	1886000	It's harder, though. Like, my GPS playing Pokemon, because like I said, this is in beta, it cooks your phone right now.
1886000	1894000	So, the state that it's in, it's just devouring that battery to the point where your phone is melting down.
1894000	1898000	Wait, I have a question. Is it worse for your battery than Miitomo?
1898000	1902000	I haven't played Miitomo, but I'm probably going to say yes.
1902000	1905000	From what I understand, yes.
1905000	1910000	From what you understand, what I've heard on the internet, yes.
1910000	1911000	Whatever.
1911000	1914000	And then, what was I going to say?
1914000	1919000	Yeah, I mean, other than that, my GPS doesn't seem to be as accurate.
1919000	1928000	So, it's hard for me to hit like the Poke Stops, which are like the portals while I'm driving, because my GPS would be lagged way behind where I'm at.
1928000	1932000	And like, I don't know how to, you know, get this. But whatever, it's fine.
1932000	1939000	They keep giving us free money to buy shit from their little store, which we'll be using real money at some point.
1939000	1942000	So, yeah, that'll be fun.
1942000	1949000	It's alright. I'm enjoying what I've played so far. Will I continue to play? We'll see.
1949000	1953000	I like Ratatta. I wish I could catch some Ratattas. Thank you, Niantic.
1953000	1962000	And then I installed this week in Final Fantasy XI, because I've been trying to play on a private server.
1962000	1963000	Because I don't want to pay...
1963000	1966000	You just don't give a shit about the rules this week, do you?
1966000	1971000	You just don't give a shit. When have you, actually?
1971000	1979000	Because, yeah, I just wanted to be able to play it at my leisure and without the grind.
1979000	1982000	So, there's a lot of servers that'll allow you to do that.
1982000	1986000	Not really having luck right now logging into those servers.
1986000	1993000	The one I did get on, I was able to create a character, but it's not connecting for some reason, so I had to figure out what's going wrong there.
1993000	1998000	But, yeah, I did my 10-hour update or whatever the other day. Thank you, Play Online and Final Fantasy.
1998000	2005000	But, hey, I did actually purchase it, and I played for a long time, several years, so they've gotten my money.
2005000	2011000	I don't know. We'll see how long I stick with it, too. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
2011000	2016000	Awesome. My gaming week. Okay, I've actually had a very busy gaming week.
2016000	2023000	So, for some unexplainable reason, I don't know why. There's no perfectly rational explanation for this.
2023000	2031000	But I've just become really suddenly interested in Pokemon again this week for some... I don't know why. I just suddenly got really interested in it again.
2031000	2032000	From what you understand.
2032000	2035000	From what I understand, it's a really popular franchise.
2035000	2036000	From what you've heard.
2036000	2037000	From what I've heard on the internet.
2037000	2049000	So, Shane, being Shane, was like, Rob, you should play a real Pokemon game. You should play Pokemon on the DS again, and you should play this.
2049000	2051000	It's so much fun, and if you like Pokemon, you'll love these games.
2051000	2054000	And he went so far because this is what Shane does.
2054000	2063000	Here, Rob, I actually got you a used copy at GameStop, and I'm just going to leave it here at the lunch table so you can just take that with you and do what you will.
2063000	2067000	So, I've been playing Pokemon Alpha Sapphire on the 3DS.
2067000	2090000	So, I have this notorious habit in Pokemon games where I will play up to the first gym, I'll get my badge, and then I'll become so overwhelmed with everything there is to do between the fucking beauty contests and the items and the fact that your Pokemon can only learn four moves, yet you have to, like, force teach them these moves to cut grass and smash rocks.
2091000	2096000	I'm going to fuck everything up by not min-maxing them the right way. I just fucking quit, right?
2096000	2099000	You'll smash those rocks correctly and I'm going to smash your fucking head against those rocks.
2099000	2101000	The rocks will get smashed one way or the other.
2101000	2110000	I get so overwhelmed that I am, like, making Pokemon that are not the very best, that no one ever was, that I just fucking quit.
2110000	2112000	I'm like, I can't fucking handle the pressure. I'm done.
2112000	2116000	You'll be the very best at fucking fighting, or you're going to be the very best on my plate.
2117000	2125000	So, here's the thing, though. With Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, everybody, I am pleased to announce I have two gym badges.
2127000	2132000	I made it, and I am currently battling my way through the third gym.
2132000	2139000	The electric gym's a little harder because I don't have any, what is it, rock Pokemon? I don't really have any rock Pokemon, so I'm having to make some of my other ones work.
2139000	2142000	So, I am currently battling my way through the third gym.
2142000	2153000	And I got to say, I think a big part of the reason why this is working for me in a way that the other games didn't do is that it gives you a lot of quality of life stuff right off the bat.
2153000	2158000	Final Swipe, which is the move that allows you to not kill Pokemon, so you capture them.
2158000	2161000	Oh, that sounds really helpful.
2161000	2170000	Yeah, Final Swipe is an attack that will, it will reduce them, it can, well, it's just like any normal attack, but it will not allow them to go below one hit point.
2170000	2171000	Wow.
2171000	2177000	So you can just keep Final Swiping them as long as your Pokemon's strong enough, and you can get it down to one hit point, making it a lot easier to capture.
2177000	2188000	They give you that really early on, and they give you something called EXP Share, so that way, when your lead Pokemon gets, or whatever Pokemon you're using gets experience in battle,
2188000	2195000	everything else in your party gets half the experience, which is so much better than, you know,
2195000	2200000	Lamymon, I choose you, but I got to level you, and then you just recall it instantly and then send back.
2200000	2202000	I didn't even realize you can kill them. That's kind of cool.
2202000	2206000	Well, they faint. They faint, Loki. They don't die. They don't die, they just faint.
2206000	2207000	They went on vacation.
2207000	2208000	That's right.
2208000	2213000	Yes, I get it. They went to the farm. They retired.
2213000	2219000	So, and I'm getting reminded in chat, Fifth Dream says, Sky, get all your free Pokemon this month.
2219000	2222000	Yes, I'm aware I need to get a Mew, I think, somehow, at some point.
2222000	2223000	I don't know.
2223000	2225000	Shane, don't worry, guys.
2225000	2229000	Shane is reminding me every day of everything I'm doing wrong in Pokemon.
2229000	2233000	So, I think we're covered. We'll be good.
2233000	2235000	Let's see.
2235000	2239000	Kaijuto in chat says, that's why you catch wild Pokemon to do the work.
2239000	2241000	Yeah, that's what I had to do.
2241000	2245000	Stoppy in chat says, I usually play until I have to go on a long distance journey to another city.
2245000	2247000	I've never finished. Blue.
2247000	2249000	Let's see.
2249000	2253000	Fifth Dream says, I'm good in the game. I'm just not good against other people.
2253000	2257000	Same as in MMOs. I play stuff and win. I just suck at multiplayer content.
2257000	2263000	So, but yeah, I've been all about the Pokemon this week for some strange reason.
2263000	2268000	So, I've been enjoying the Alpha Sapphire, playing that in between other stuff.
2269000	2273000	But I want to talk about this, too, because this is a huge event.
2273000	2283000	My birthday happens to be next month, and it actually is going to end up being the same day as our 14-year anniversary show.
2283000	2289000	June 26 is my birthday and the 14-year anniversary show, so that's something.
2289000	2294000	But Alan just said, you know what, I'm going to get you your present early.
2294000	2300000	I guess he got a big bonus because his job involves elections and what goes on there.
2300000	2305000	So, they're kind of busy right now. I don't know if you're aware, but there's a primary coming up here in California.
2305000	2309000	And for some reason, a lot of people are paying attention to it and all this stuff.
2309000	2313000	So, his work is kind of popular right now. So, he made a lot of bonus money this month.
2313000	2323000	So, he bought me my birthday present early, and he got me a new video card, which is a...
2323000	2330000	And I never remember these model names right, but it is the one that you can actually use to do Oculus Rift.
2330000	2334000	It's a 760 GTX, is what he got me, graphics card.
2334000	2335000	760?
2335000	2341000	Yeah. No, wait, is that what I had? I lied. No, 760 is what I had. Sorry, guys.
2341000	2344000	Now I have a 970 GTX, is what I have.
2344000	2345000	Those are not bad, yeah.
2345000	2348000	While I was running over to get the box, just to check.
2348000	2352000	Yeah, no, it's a 970 now. Sorry, 760 is what I had, so now I have a 970.
2352000	2357000	And then he also upped my chip. I had a 4 GHz chip in the computer, now I have 4.7.
2357000	2359000	So, yeah, right?
2359000	2364000	So, the first thing I did was I logged into Final Fantasy XIV to see how much prettier it was.
2364000	2371000	The second thing I did was I booted up Doom, because you know the new Doom is pretty gorgeous, right?
2371000	2376000	So, now I can play the new Doom on Ultra at 60 frames a second.
2376000	2377000	Nice.
2377000	2382000	And I was playing, it's so gross, oh my god, it's so gross.
2382000	2389000	Like, just the insta-kills and everything, like, I am becoming desensitized to violence, but it is a lot of fun.
2389000	2393000	I am terrible at it, I died on some mission last night because I'm an idiot,
2393000	2400000	but it is a lot of fun to just go in there guns-a-blazing and kill everything and die, die, die, even though I'm like, this is so disgusting.
2400000	2407000	But, Alan, he was playing Fallout 4 on his computer and he turned around and he's like, that is so gorgeous.
2407000	2410000	Oh my god, that's so pretty, that was so worth it.
2410000	2417000	And yeah, it's a gorgeous game, the new Doom is gorgeous, with a high-end video card on PC, yeah.
2417000	2426000	But now I am all ready for Oculus Rift that I didn't even think I wanted, but I guess I could get it.
2426000	2427000	You have the bare minimum now.
2427000	2430000	I have the bare minimum now, so who knows, I might.
2430000	2434000	Well, technically you don't have the bare minimum, because my fucking laptop runs that shit.
2434000	2440000	It doesn't run it good, or maybe up to spec, but it runs it, so technically you should be able to run it.
2440000	2444000	Yeah, and I might, I don't know, I don't know where I stand on the whole VR thing.
2444000	2448000	I still have the PlayStation VR headset ordered, I realize that's different from PC offerings.
2448000	2452000	The PC pool is really, like, there's so many options, right?
2453000	2456000	You know, so I'm just gonna wait for Bobby to tell me what to buy.
2456000	2459000	I just, I'm just gonna wait for Bobby to tell me what to buy.
2459000	2463000	Or, you know, the one that has the games that I want to play on it.
2463000	2468000	Although, some of those, you know, thanks to piracy, a lot of those walls are coming down, right?
2468000	2475000	You know, they're modding them so that things that were locked to Oculus, you know, there was big talk about that last week, so.
2475000	2478000	Was this about $1,000 video cards?
2479000	2484000	Well, that is, like, the highest end video cards are still like $1,000.
2484000	2490000	Not necessarily, I mean, like, if you wait for the 1080, that's gonna be about $700, $600.
2490000	2496000	And then the 1070, which is a step down a little bit from that, is gonna be about $400.
2496000	2498000	And those are gonna be coming out at the end of June.
2498000	2501000	The 1080, I thought it was supposed to be coming out about now.
2501000	2507000	Alan didn't tell me how much he spent on the card, but I could kind of guess that it was probably about maybe $250, $299, right?
2507000	2512000	And he said it was right at the borderline before, like, a big jump happens in price.
2512000	2514000	And he says, Rob, I love you, but not that much.
2514000	2517000	And I understand, that's fair, that's totally fair, I understand.
2517000	2524000	Still, it's really hard for me to internally justify spending more on a video card than, like, the newest greatest console costs.
2524000	2525000	Right.
2525000	2528000	And that's for a full system, including video capabilities, so.
2528000	2533000	Well, that's because you're gonna have to upgrade it again, so, you know, it's basically just the same now.
2534000	2536000	E3.
2536000	2542000	Thank you, console manufacturers. I was just going, geez, you know, it would be really nice if I spent more money on your stupid console.
2542000	2553000	So, one other thing that I want to point out quickly is that Alan got me those toys, but then I was like, okay, well, if you're gonna open up the computer to put in, because he does all the hardware stuff.
2553000	2555000	I don't know that stuff as well.
2555000	2560000	So, if you're gonna open up the computer to put in the new toys, there's something else I want to put in there.
2560000	2574000	So, I went to Best Buy and got myself a three terabyte hard drive so that I won't fucking run out of space anymore because I keep running out of, like, when I had to free up 60 gigs to install Doom, it was kind of, yeah, a mess.
2574000	2582000	So, now I can just install everything on Steam without, I won't have to worry about it for a very, very, very long time. So, I'm excited about that.
2582000	2589000	So, and plus, all that space for porn. Thank God. Thank God for space, thank God for porn.
2589000	2595000	Come on, no one saves porn to their hard drive anymore. You have the internet, you stream that shit.
2595000	2601000	When you have that very special cum shot that you don't want to forget. I'm sorry, I'm so nasty.
2601000	2604000	That's what bookmarks are for. That's why you have a favorites list.
2604000	2607000	Yeah, if you're into the animated stuff, though, you can only explore it.
2607000	2610000	I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.
2610000	2614000	You know, some people are into certain types of porn that involve, I'm sorry, hi.
2615000	2625000	Jason in chat says, has a fries, go to Best Buy, I'm crying. Here's the reason why. I have justification.
2625000	2630000	Because I am very much that person that when I want something, I want it now.
2630000	2636000	And we would get to Best Buy by closing, but we would not get to fries by closing. So, there it is.
2636000	2642000	I'm surprised they had video cards at Best Buy. I mean, their computer section nowadays is, like, the size of this table right here.
2642000	2650000	The video card came from somewhere else. We went to get the hard, because I was like, if you're going to do surgery on my computer tonight to put in this stuff, I want a hard drive to go in there, too.
2650000	2652000	So I was like, and it's 830.
2652000	2658000	You know what's hiding in Best Buy's video card section, right? Their one Bluetooth controller.
2658000	2662000	They have three. I got one of the three.
2662000	2666000	Incorrectly placed. Hiding behind an outdated video card.
2666000	2674000	Yeah, the Bluetooth controllers are in the PC controller department, so it's not even, like, Android or anything. Sorry, this is PC and Android.
2674000	2676000	And iOS. Oh, yeah, that's PC as well.
2676000	2678000	At least you know they're politically correct.
2678000	2684000	Alright. Let's do some quick housekeeping here now that I've completely fouled up the show.
2684000	2691000	Some quick housekeeping tonight. Of course, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2692000	2699000	I do want to remind everybody, especially if you're in the South area, specifically the Atlanta greater area where our pal Bobby Blackwolf is,
2699000	2706000	we're going to be sponsoring, we meaning VOG Network, are going to be sponsoring the Southern Fried Game Room Expo that's running June 10th through 12th.
2706000	2709000	So that's only, like, two weeks away. Not even.
2709000	2712000	So if you're in the South area, be sure to check that out.
2712000	2717000	Lots of classic video games and pinball and panels celebrating all that stuff.
2717000	2720000	And fun to be had, so be sure to check that out.
2720000	2724000	I will be going to the Atlanta area in a few more months.
2724000	2729000	I wanted to go to Southern Fried Game Room Expo. I really did, but trying to juggle the day job and all that.
2729000	2736000	I could only pick one or the other. Could I do Southern Fried Game Room Expo or Dragon Con?
2736000	2741000	And with all due respect to Southern Fried Game Room Expo, if I'm going to take a trip from California, I'm going to Dragon Con.
2741000	2747000	So I'm going to Dragon Con over Labor Day weekend, so I'm looking forward to seeing all of you there.
2747000	2752000	I do also quickly want to say, before we get into the gaming news tonight, because it is a three-day weekend.
2752000	2759000	Tomorrow is Memorial Day, so I do just want to take a minute to acknowledge, you know, there's a reason we celebrate Memorial Day.
2759000	2766000	So I just want to say, you know, a big thank you to everybody who serves in the armed forces or has served.
2766000	2772000	You know, or especially if you have a loved one that you've lost, since this is Memorial Day.
2772000	2780000	If you have a loved one that has paid the ultimate price to defend my right to say the word come shot on the radio,
2780000	2784000	and nobody's going to come to my house and police me, we're not going to get censored for that type of stuff.
2784000	2788000	You know, people pay a big sacrifice to protect those freedoms.
2788000	2792000	So a big thank you in remembering why we have a three-day weekend this week.
2792000	2797000	Okay, that all aside for housekeeping tonight. Let's talk about video game news.
2797000	2802000	Because with the long weekend, I think a lot of you spending some time playing some games, right?
2802000	2803000	Yep.
2803000	2805000	So let's get into the news this week.
2805000	2806000	A little bit.
2806000	2816000	Alright, so No Man's Sky was thought to have been delayed because there was some updated marketing materials that were going out to GameStops and stuff.
2816000	2820000	They were basically putting a sticker over, you know, the release date with a coming soon.
2820000	2826000	And that was confirmed as well by, you know, the developers and by the PlayStation blog.
2826000	2833000	Basically, the date has moved from June 21st to now August 9th, which is seven weeks.
2833000	2841000	And their reasoning for that, as we approach our final deadline, we realized that some key moments needed extra polish to bring them up to our standards.
2841000	2846000	I have had to make the tough choice to delay the game for a few weeks to allow us to deliver something special.
2847000	2852000	And that was coming from Hello Games, Sean Murray.
2852000	2859000	Like, I want to be upset, but I just, I can't. I can't get mad about this stuff anymore.
2859000	2865000	This is so much the norm in our industry that everything gets pushed back.
2865000	2871000	I have now just adopted the attitude of, you know what, when I see it on the shelf, I see it on the shelf.
2871000	2874000	Whenever Amazon drops it on my front door, there it is.
2874000	2881000	That's okay. I mean, that's fine. Now Mighty No. 9 can get your full attention, assuming that it actually comes out on its way first.
2881000	2886000	Low key. Don't make stuff up on this show. I'm just kidding.
2886000	2891000	No, but lots of other games can now, you know, free up and have that time.
2891000	2900000	And now No Man's Sky gets pushed even closer into the deadly holiday period, which will be coming, you know, now even shorter after that release.
2900000	2908000	But, you know what, if it's to make the game better, then great. People aren't going to remember the delay if the game is great.
2908000	2913000	Uncharted 4 got delayed an additional six weeks, didn't it? Are people complaining now?
2913000	2918000	No, people aren't complaining. And, you know, people seem to be taking it well.
2918000	2926000	I mean, people have only been leaving death threats for the developers, so that's typical, I guess.
2926000	2934000	You know what, once Mighty No. 9 comes out in two years, no one will remember that delay either.
2934000	2941000	Death threats over this. Is this Twitter egg accounts that are doing this?
2941000	2951000	Yeah, it's Twitter. I mean, come on, can we just get to the point now where we understand that, listen, Twitter is an anonymous platform.
2951000	2956000	People act like assholes over anonymous platforms. About anything, it could be about anything.
2956000	2963000	People could be sending death threats because they didn't like who won Survivor or something, or didn't like the outcome of Game of Thrones or something.
2963000	2965000	Jeff Probst, I'm gonna fucking kill you.
2965000	2969000	You survived my wrath, I mean, seriously.
2969000	2972000	I'm gonna vote you off the planet.
2973000	2982000	I feel like, God, we shouldn't even be laughing about it, because to be on the receiving end of that, could you imagine somebody sending OLR a death threat?
2982000	2985000	I didn't laugh once during your show this week. I'm gonna kill you.
2985000	2987000	Yeah, let me just see if I can read this tweet here real quick.
2987000	2994000	It says, your little article about No Man's Sky is being delayed has me hate you to my very core. It's the only thing I've lived for.
2994000	2997000	Okay, come on, just a little dramatic.
2997000	2998000	That means you have mental problems.
2998000	3007000	And you go and write that bullshit about the delay instead of visiting London later this month, I think I'll come by and say hi to you and fuck you up.
3007000	3010000	You think you can get away with making...
3010000	3011000	Okay.
3011000	3013000	Come on, people. Seriously.
3013000	3020000	Send that person over someone's knee and spank them. That is the only appropriate response, I feel like.
3020000	3030000	I don't know. Again, if it's mental health, maybe I shouldn't be making light of it or whatever, although I don't know. I do think we can spank some people.
3030000	3041000	The problem is you have these people that are so immature using the internet. These are the same type of assholes you run across back in the day, Xbox Live and stuff.
3041000	3044000	It's just now they're writing it down on board.
3045000	3060000	Unfortunately, there's just no repercussions for these people because of the fact that they're being anonymous, but I just think we at this point kind of expect this kind of behavior because unfortunately people are assholes and people take things really ridiculous.
3060000	3067000	I don't know. It's unfortunate, but this is kind of the world.
3067000	3071000	And I kind of think, well, I don't know if that was Twitter or something else.
3071000	3072000	It was Twitter.
3072000	3081000	Okay, I'm going to pick on Twitter for a minute here. Twitter really needs to step it the fuck up with as big of a site as they are and so forth.
3081000	3086000	They need to put more accountability into some of the stuff that people say on there.
3086000	3098000	And it's like if they're understaffed or whatever, then staff. So you can better respond to some of the vicious crap that goes on on Twitter because by doing nothing about it, you're enabling it, I feel.
3099000	3108000	There's a lot of great things that have come from Twitter. I have made awesome friendships because of Twitter. You and your wife met on Twitter?
3108000	3109000	We did.
3109000	3120000	Oh my God. See, that is a great story. I met a friend of mine who I've been talking to on Twitter for like three years. I met on Friday. He happened to be in Sacramento for a conference and so we met.
3120000	3127000	And another friend of mine was here from Hawaii a couple weeks ago when we met too. I have these real friendships from that.
3127000	3135000	But there is just this like the lower 10% of Twitter is the real bottom of the fucking barrel.
3135000	3137000	There's always a few bad apples spoiling the bunch, really.
3137000	3139000	But fucking clean the goddamn barrel, Twitter.
3139000	3140000	And then she'll-
3140000	3141000	Hold on, Jamie. What?
3141000	3142000	Sorry.
3142000	3149000	I will say, being someone who met my husband on AOL when it charged by the hour, good job.
3149000	3150000	Thank you.
3150000	3156000	And children, so here's how I met your mother. I loved her at the very first post I received from her.
3156000	3157000	Kids.
3157000	3162000	Where she called me a fucking shit posting, mansplaining, misogynist pig.
3163000	3164000	Kids.
3165000	3167000	Okay, I have to respond to this.
3167000	3168000	Shut your mouth.
3168000	3170000	I have to respond to this because this is important.
3170000	3175000	Cajudo in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, no, no, don't tell Twitter to censor.
3175000	3180000	You just spoke about how you're proud to have free speech and say cum shot on the air.
3180000	3181000	That's three times now, by the way.
3181000	3183000	We can't start policing the internet.
3183000	3187000	I agree. However, your rights-
3187000	3191000	Well, A, Twitter is a private site so they can do whatever the fuck they want.
3191000	3196000	But your rights end where mine began.
3196000	3205000	I don't give a shit what you say on your corner of the internet and all this stuff, but when you threaten my life, that's crossing the line.
3205000	3210000	There's a big difference there. Now you're infringing on my rights. Does that make sense?
3210000	3217000	I think the problem is that if you were to do this face to face with somebody, you could be brought up on charges.
3217000	3223000	Whereas over the internet, they think they're hiding behind something that, oh, no one's going to find me, so that's the thing.
3223000	3229000	If people were that afraid, then maybe people would be a lot more nicer, I would think.
3229000	3232000	Some laws need to be updated, I think, really.
3232000	3243000	But let's not take it to the extremes here. If I'm disagreeing with somebody over the internet, I better not be brought up on charges of harassment because they didn't like what I have to say.
3243000	3257000	But there is, though, a way that if you feel you're truly being harassed, you can make the phrase, please stop speaking with me, any further communication will be considered harassment, and I have saved a screenshot.
3257000	3266000	Usually stops things, and I've actually been able to call law enforcement on someone who continued to harass me.
3266000	3271000	Because you outlined it clearly.
3271000	3277000	It's just disgusting that things reach that point. Whatever happened to common human decency?
3277000	3289000	Because common decency, for the most part, for a lot of people out there, is a social construct. It's a rule that you play when your face is exposed.
3289000	3295000	The real heart of people comes out when you put the masks on.
3295000	3297000	Alright.
3297000	3299000	Maybe I'm a little bit of a cynic.
3299000	3316000	It's a complicated issue, and there's really no easy answer. I do put a lot of value in our listeners that I really do think people that suffer through this program have a particular intelligence, or low intelligence, no, I'm kidding.
3316000	3324000	When I say treat people with common decency, I really believe that most of our listeners do follow that.
3324000	3330000	Society treats people pretty decent. It's just the loud assholes that get the attention.
3330000	3336000	But if by nature you're one of these people that send death threats to people anonymously online, fucking stop it!
3336000	3346000	You gotta evaluate your life that your life is so surrounded by revolving around this one game. I don't believe that. I think it's a troll.
3346000	3356000	I would also say that the people who do have decency, there could be many, many more of them, but it's sort of like what I experience as a Southern woman in the South.
3356000	3361000	The only people that you see on the news are the morons. The people that give the entirety...
3361000	3362000	Florida man.
3362000	3374000	Florida man, exactly. Or his dumber cousin, Mississippi man. It was even worse. Trust me, the Alabama state motto is, we're not Mississippi.
3374000	3376000	I'm kidding. We had Mardi Gras first.
3376000	3380000	I'm kidding too, because I know we actually have listeners in Florida, but you're also not on the nightly news.
3380000	3392000	Alright, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, TigerClaw in chat says, it's those damn milleniums. Blame it on the milleniums! When in doubt, blame a generation.
3392000	3396000	Did you read that milleniums now outnumber baby boomers?
3396000	3402000	Well, I mean, it would make sense that as one generation gets older, they're dying.
3402000	3407000	But still, they're actually now the largest generation group out at present.
3407000	3409000	Heaven help us all. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
3409000	3412000	And you have us a fake because we fucked like crazy!
3412000	3415000	Amy's taking a shit over here.
3415000	3417000	Amy's like, I'm a millenium.
3417000	3425000	No, no. I'm just joking. You know what? There's a lot of things that I identify with milleniums as well, but I do love the scapegoating that happens out there.
3425000	3428000	Like, when in doubt, just fucking blame milleniums.
3428000	3433000	Gosh, freaking bitch! Get off my lawn!
3433000	3440000	Sometimes we just need to pull out the fan, put it in the way of the selfie camera, and just...
3440000	3444000	Goddamn internets, goddamn milleniums fucking...
3444000	3445000	Get off my virtual lawn!
3445000	3448000	...tweeting their food and...
3448000	3449000	Right.
3449000	3450000	You know what?
3450000	3454000	My wife does that shit, and it fucking annoys the crap out of me.
3454000	3460000	It's like, what are you doing? Oh, I'm trying to get the perfect picture of the kids and eating ice cream and stuff. Who fucking cares?
3460000	3462000	Loki, you married a millenium.
3462000	3464000	I didn't marry a millenium. I wanna be a millenium.
3464000	3466000	You know what? I do the shit out of that at Disneyland, though.
3466000	3468000	Because everything there is pretty.
3468000	3475000	And when they served me that food that we paid a hundred plus bucks for at Carthay, you're damn right I took several pictures of it.
3475000	3483000	Listen, I'm not gonna take a picture every time I cook something because you only need one giant plate of spaghetti picture to be on the internet.
3483000	3487000	And it basically represents all the giant plates of spaghetti that I eat.
3487000	3496000	Next Saturday, on Lifetime, Loki stars in, so I married a millenium.
3496000	3499000	Yes, my Russian bride.
3499000	3501000	Alright, I'm so Ukrainian bride.
3501000	3504000	Look, we gotta move on, we gotta move on.
3504000	3509000	Well, we talked a lot about face-to-face interaction, and would you say that to somebody's face?
3509000	3511000	Well, you'll have the opportunity to say it.
3511000	3512000	Sometimes I would.
3512000	3513000	All of her faces.
3513000	3515000	E3.
3515000	3524000	A lot of people are kinda just, you know, mentioning this and moving on, but this is a really big deal, I think.
3524000	3526000	I wanna talk about this for a minute.
3526000	3538000	The organizers behind E3, not somebody else, but the ESA, the folks that organize E3, have announced that there is going to be a free public event called E3 Live.
3538000	3543000	That's going to happen between June 14th and the 16th, which is the same days as E3.
3543000	3551000	It's not gonna be held at the convention center, but it will be in downtown Los Angeles, next door.
3551000	3553000	Literally, it's gonna be at the Staples Center.
3553000	3555000	E3 too, the quest for more money.
3555000	3557000	E3 too, Electric Boogaloo.
3557000	3566000	The event starts at 5pm on June 14th, and you do have to register for a free ticket, although my understanding is it's already gone.
3566000	3569000	Those free tickets give you a five hour time slot and it's gone.
3569000	3570000	Five hours?
3570000	3574000	Yeah, so I guess you get in through AM, PM, I don't know.
3574000	3576000	You don't go for the whole three days like it is E3.
3576000	3582000	However, this is still now E3 opening up a little more to the public.
3582000	3587000	And this comes off the heels of what they did last year, where they basically openly said,
3587000	3592000	if you can get sponsored by a gaming company, you can get into E3.
3592000	3598000	Remember the whole thing where it's like, we're gonna let gaming companies invite 500 of their biggest fans or whatever it is to E3.
3598000	3601000	You know, E3 is slowly and slowly getting more public.
3601000	3605000	Because we've got all this space now that all these different publishers aren't actually participating with E3.
3605000	3611000	Well, but here's the thing that's especially odd about this, in my opinion.
3611000	3614000	This was announced this week, right?
3614000	3617000	E3 is like three weeks away.
3617000	3622000	Wouldn't you have announced something like this like four months ago, five months ago?
3622000	3629000	So this is something that I don't want to say they necessarily thrown it together, but it does have a last minute sense about it.
3629000	3636000	Well, I mean, I'm sure all those people will be able to find, you know, accommodations and lodging about, you know, two counties away.
3636000	3642000	I wonder when they told the, you know, the publishers and people bringing booths with them about this.
3642000	3646000	Well, it's not every publisher I don't think is participating.
3646000	3648000	I think only some.
3648000	3650000	It's all Ouya.
3650000	3656000	No, it's like Twitch and what, Frito-Lay.
3656000	3664000	Can you imagine? You spend all this time, you're going down there, you're super excited, you walk in and it's fucking just like Twitch.
3664000	3665000	Mountain Dew and Doritos.
3665000	3668000	And Mountain Dew, Doritos, and Ouya.
3668000	3675000	Hey, maybe if you're lucky, you'll get to see Konami streaming the same like two minute Pro Evolution soccer video over and over again.
3676000	3679000	Ow, that hit a nerve.
3679000	3685000	But no, I mean, it's very, very interesting to me that this is the way that E3 is now going.
3685000	3689000	I mean, are we looking at potentially a public E3 in the next couple of years?
3689000	3695000	I really think we're getting closer and closer to that, especially as more and more people are starting to ask the question, is E3 relevant?
3695000	3706000	I mean, aren't we, aren't we basically, you know, seeing E3 go from all the stuff that you wanted to know about gaming to, oh, you need to be press and make an appointment to see that?
3706000	3713000	Yes, that is true to some extent. However, I would argue, here's my argument, E3 is already public.
3713000	3721000	What do we know? I mean, I guess we don't know what the participation is this year, but could it be because the participation, just people going to it is even down?
3721000	3726000	Because maybe that's the thing is they're trying to make sure that the businesses around E3 are staying.
3726000	3729000	You're not seeing a float, but getting that traffic.
3729000	3738000	And this is a way to drive more traffic to the businesses nearby because they're going to get, you know, extra people, the public coming in for these different events.
3738000	3746000	That could be part of it. But the years that they went to Santa Monica instead and kind of left the businesses with E4ALL instead at a completely different time.
3746000	3755000	I don't know if that shows that they necessarily feel that obligation to the businesses to do that, but I was going to say, I want to follow up to what I said to Aaron about E3 is already public.
3755000	3767000	I mean, the reason why I say that is because with all the streaming that goes on with half the time you make appointments to see stuff, you're seeing the exact same fucking thing that's on Spike TV or that's on Twitch or whatever.
3767000	3775000	It's a controlled demo done by the publishers so that there's no mistakes or what have you. It's the hands on at E3 is going away.
3775000	3783000	And so in some regards, maybe they want to open that up to the public because, well, we're just going to show you the same shit that's going to be on Twitch TV or whatever anyway.
3783000	3800000	So E3 in some regards is just becoming kind of like an announcements week and less of the hands on stuff that he used to be a long time ago when truly the people that got their hands on to play was the only way that the public could experience it through the articles they wrote.
3800000	3812000	It should be inviting more people to E3, to be honest. I mean, it's hard enough, especially like back in the Nintendo days where it's like, OK, everybody has to wait, you know, five hours to play the Wii or Wii U or whatever.
3812000	3822000	I mean, I think if there's less people going, that's a good thing, because then you're actually getting to view that stuff without having to wait five hours to waste your time doing that.
3823000	3833000	I don't see a problem with that. I mean, if they want to do the public event next door, I guess that's fine. But I think it's a bad idea having these publishers, you know, bring in like 500 other fans or something like that. They'll need that.
3833000	3845000	Oh my gosh, it's just it's going to be a shit show in downtown L.A. I just oh my God. I hope you all got your hotel rooms already and can stay right there because even transit is going to be a mess with all those extra people.
3845000	3851000	Or maybe they are thinking that less people will be at the main show itself, so it's going to balance each other out. I don't know.
3851000	3860000	Anyway, I do want to mention, though, speaking of the fact that, you know, E3 is practically already public, YouTube is going to continue doing their own E3 coverage.
3860000	3870000	YouTube did their own E3 thing last year, and they have announced that that will continue this year. So, you know, it's kind of an alternative to Twitch, I suppose, in a way, as they do have competing gaming sides to it.
3870000	3880000	But there's going to be a 12 hour stream hosted by Jeff Keighley. So if you're a Jeff fan, there you go. That will kick off at 9 a.m. Pacific on June 13th.
3880000	3891000	A reminder that they did break some news in 2015. They actually had the announcement of the Walking Dead spinoff game and so forth. So they may have some exclusives this year as well. Who knows?
3891000	3893000	Wait, 2014 they said?
3893000	3895000	In 2015 they said that.
3895000	3896000	Oh, was that the Telltale one?
3896000	3900000	The Walking Dead Michonne was last year.
3900000	3901000	What the fuck is that?
3901000	3906000	Like the spinoff series. There's another Walking Dead. Where have you been?
3906000	3907000	The game came out recently.
3907000	3908000	Yeah, the game came out already.
3908000	3909000	Oh, what the hell was it?
3909000	3917000	It was just another Walking Dead game, but it wasn't a whole season. Was it an entire season or just one episode?
3917000	3920000	We haven't cleared season two yet, so don't know.
3920000	3921000	Shows you how.
3921000	3924000	Alright, well that seems very impactful to my life.
3924000	3926000	Well, but still, it's something.
3926000	3929000	Hey, it's a victory from the evil corporate overboard people.
3929000	3935000	I'll tell you what I'm not doing this year is watching a stupid fucking PC conference. Yeah, my stupid brain.
3935000	3944000	I bet you they're gonna announce Half Life 3. Why would they have a PC conference? God, it was so stupid. Why did I watch that piece of shit?
3944000	3946000	I'm not doing it again.
3946000	3949000	You had hope. A lot of us watched.
3949000	3951000	I had hope. I just, you know.
3951000	3956000	I will develop Pixel Poops 3 before Half Life 3 is released. That is my pledge to you.
3956000	3961000	You better watch what you promise on this show.
3961000	3964000	I'll skip over two if I have to.
3964000	3967000	What happened to Pixel Poops 2? That was crap.
3967000	3971000	Uh, go see Frog Fractions 2. It's there. It's in the same place.
3971000	3973000	It's at the bar with Frog Fractions 2.
3973000	3974000	Yes.
3974000	3976000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3976000	3979000	Well, we made a mention of it. At least I did earlier.
3979000	3985000	Overwatch. It's popular. Now that it's popular, it has porn.
3985000	3989000	Porn made with assets from the game.
3989000	3990000	Assets.
3990000	3995000	Assets. Can I ask you a question?
3995000	3997000	Anyway.
3997000	4004000	Well, of course, since there's porn using assets from the game, there's been a cease and desist issued.
4004000	4006000	I'll stop him.
4006000	4008000	Oh yeah. They're out of those woods now.
4008000	4011000	They had to say the safe word.
4011000	4019000	So, anyway, Overwatch porn searches are up by 817%.
4019000	4028000	And so they're all, the people who are using Overwatch assets are being hit for copyright infringement.
4028000	4036000	Which, if you are using assets that you don't own, to try to make money off of property you don't own,
4036000	4040000	it can't be considered parody when you're taking the assets.
4040000	4050000	So they do have a case here. I mean, basically it was really just to the people who ripped the character models.
4050000	4056000	They might have added bits to them because I thought they were rendered with bits.
4056000	4058000	Or removed some.
4058000	4062000	They were actually rendered specifically with Steam Source Filmmaker.
4062000	4065000	So, interesting.
4065000	4073000	Which brought you such wonderful things as Bioshock Infinite porn and Borderlands 2 porn.
4073000	4075000	Really?
4075000	4084000	Well, you know what can really eliminate that is stop making giant breasted people in your games.
4084000	4085000	There you go.
4085000	4088000	But Overwatch has a pretty diverse lineup.
4088000	4093000	It's not just the female characters. They're adding cocks on the dude characters.
4093000	4096000	Batman Arkham City porn as well.
4096000	4099000	Well, I know a lot of people are jumping to the whole...
4099000	4101000	Why are women the only ones to be sexualized?
4101000	4107000	I'm just saying, they're normally the first. It's like, okay, women with giant breasts in the game, you're naked first.
4107000	4111000	They do tend to float to the top of the results, yes.
4111000	4112000	But...
4112000	4115000	Why can't I have like... nevermind.
4115000	4116000	Don't worry.
4116000	4119000	You can have whatever you want. This is the internet, Jamie.
4119000	4120000	I'm not saying that...
4120000	4121000	Believe in your dreams.
4121000	4125000	I'm not saying that everybody doesn't get, you know, representation eventually.
4125000	4127000	I'm just saying that those are chosen first.
4127000	4128000	Yeah.
4128000	4130000	Why's it gotta be boobs?
4132000	4134000	It doesn't have to be.
4134000	4136000	I'm just saying that it's what they choose first.
4136000	4138000	William Murderface in chat says,
4138000	4141000	Let there be all the porn, dude and chick.
4141000	4143000	Isn't that what God said on the eighth day?
4143000	4145000	It's rule 34.
4145000	4147000	I mean, seriously, just rule 34.
4147000	4150000	On the 34th day, God said, let there be all the porn.
4150000	4156000	No, on the 34th day, it's like, I just realized there's no other women in the world.
4158000	4160000	Where are all the babies coming from?
4163000	4164000	Look, let's see...
4164000	4166000	You can't have siblings going at it.
4166000	4168000	It messes up the gene pool.
4168000	4170000	Ray, have you ever read the Bible?
4170000	4171000	I'm just kidding.
4171000	4173000	Yeah, which is probably why I converted.
4173000	4174000	I don't want to go there.
4174000	4175000	I'm just... I shouldn't...
4175000	4176000	Nope, that was...
4176000	4178000	I'm just gonna put the couch covers back on that topic.
4178000	4180000	I should not have looked under there.
4180000	4181000	All right.
4181000	4184000	Are they plastic like an old lady's living room in the 50s?
4184000	4186000	Ray Genator in chat says,
4186000	4189000	I noticed that people had modded Skyrim to be pornographic.
4189000	4192000	And every other game in existence ever.
4192000	4195000	I accidentally stumbled upon someone streaming Skyrim porn on Steam.
4195000	4196000	Accidentally.
4198000	4204000	But the thing is, is that that content is not there for profit.
4205000	4209000	And typically porn sites are looking to make money.
4209000	4214000	So if they are stealing assets from an IP they don't own
4214000	4217000	and marketing it for their own profit
4217000	4221000	without, you know, giving any money or rights back to the owner,
4221000	4227000	which also can in some way diminish the overall reputation of the product,
4227000	4229000	you know, of their IP.
4231000	4233000	Yeah, they have every right to shut it down.
4233000	4237000	When you're making, you know, naked mods for, you know, Dragon Age,
4237000	4238000	okay, they're naked.
4238000	4240000	No one's making money on it.
4240000	4241000	I understand.
4241000	4243000	I don't think they're doing it for profit.
4243000	4246000	I think actually a lot of these people do it for funsies.
4246000	4248000	I mean, so I just...
4248000	4250000	It just gets put on these sites
4250000	4253000	because this is where you find your adult content videos and stuff.
4253000	4254000	So that's where it just gets hosted
4254000	4256000	because you're not gonna throw this shit on YouTube.
4256000	4258000	I mean, VMO, you know.
4258000	4261000	So that's why it ends up there.
4262000	4264000	But I don't think anyone's actually doing it like,
4264000	4266000	hey, we're gonna make so much money off of this.
4266000	4269000	Said no one ever on a video, you know.
4269000	4272000	You can't make that kind of money on videos.
4274000	4277000	You know, a lot of people are saying Blizzard is so out of touch
4277000	4280000	and Blizzard doesn't know rule 34 and all this stuff.
4280000	4284000	But if I'm not mistaken, a third party is doing this on Blizzard's behalf, right?
4284000	4287000	And, you know, sometimes third parties do really weird things
4287000	4290000	and you've kind of seen that with YouTube content ID matching.
4290000	4294000	You have to wonder if maybe Blizzard's third party might be overreaching a little bit.
4294000	4297000	Although, when Jamie puts it the way she does,
4297000	4301000	that, you know, essentially when this porn starts to make money off Blizzard stuff,
4301000	4306000	then that's, you know, if I put titties out there for free, that's one thing.
4306000	4309000	But if I make you pay to see the titty, that's another.
4309000	4311000	And there is a distinct difference between that.
4311000	4314000	But what's interesting is that if I were to have like a DeviantArt page
4314000	4317000	where I sell posters of my Tracer fan art,
4317000	4320000	completely G-rated and tasteful, there's not a problem with that.
4320000	4324000	Blizzard and most companies in general kind of just turn a blind eye to that sort of stuff.
4324000	4326000	But the minute there's a titty...
4327000	4329000	I'm just telling you one thing, I mean,
4329000	4331000	because I remember when Bioshock Infinite first came out,
4331000	4333000	they were like, please don't make Elizabeth porn.
4333000	4334000	Please don't do that.
4335000	4336000	Don't do that.
4336000	4338000	And then everyone's like, I'm doing that.
4338000	4341000	It's like, you told me not to do that. I'm totally doing that.
4341000	4346000	My favorite thing in the world is this Miyamoto parody account that's out there on Twitter,
4346000	4351000	and it will always post these things like where somebody did fan art of Mario and Luigi making out,
4351000	4354000	and he'll tweet the picture and he'll put, please don't do this.
4356000	4357000	Yes, rule 34.
4357000	4360000	Or like, please, please stop. This is not what was intended.
4360000	4363000	Yes, you know, a lot of the Mario characters already represented.
4363000	4367000	Samus, yep. Anything you can possibly imagine, it's there.
4367000	4371000	Super Smash Brothers and Sisters.
4372000	4373000	Emphasis on Smash.
4373000	4378000	Now, there's only one logical solution for this, honestly, I believe,
4378000	4382000	and that is to take these videos that have Overwatch porn characters
4383000	4388000	and to add to them Grand Theft Auto porn characters, Nintendo porn characters.
4388000	4389000	They'll never find them then.
4389000	4392000	I believe you should treat all the game companies equally.
4393000	4396000	What you gotta do is you gotta go the copyright block method,
4396000	4400000	like he suggested, you know, put all the characters in there.
4400000	4403000	Never find the men. Just put all of the naked characters in there.
4403000	4406000	On Elsa, I mean fucking Pac-Man, Sonic.
4406000	4409000	Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man porn? There you go.
4409000	4413000	Thank God someone in chat still brings up like a 15-year-old reference.
4413000	4418000	William Murderface in chat says Final Fuck X, which is a real thing.
4418000	4423000	It is a real thing because we watched it live on air on an early episode of OLR.
4423000	4425000	The DVD's still in my house.
4425000	4428000	Yeah, it was cosplay porn is basically what it was.
4428000	4429000	Yeah, it was these...
4429000	4431000	They didn't even dress the guys up. It was just...
4431000	4432000	Really good costumes, though.
4432000	4435000	Yeah, the girls had really great costumes for a minute.
4436000	4439000	And then there was Dance Dance Fuck, which just...
4439000	4444000	Dance Dance Fuck was ridiculous. Like, there was nothing there.
4444000	4448000	It was just like one of those days searching for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay.
4448000	4452000	There it is. It's like, I kind of have to buy that now.
4453000	4457000	I'll never forget. That's when I was living with Loki. I'll never forget the day.
4457000	4461000	Guess what I got today? He just drops Dance Dance Fuck down on the table.
4461000	4462000	Do they have bazookas?
4462000	4464000	I don't remember.
4464000	4466000	No, there was like no cosplay or anything.
4466000	4468000	No, it had nothing to do with it. It was just...
4468000	4471000	They were dancing in a club and then... fucking.
4471000	4472000	Oh.
4472000	4473000	I think it was just the name.
4473000	4474000	Oh, I don't know. Anyway.
4474000	4476000	Watch of a revolution if you ask me.
4477000	4480000	Well, tonight is a special episode of Orange Country.
4480000	4484000	Look how fucking dirty this show gets when you visit.
4484000	4485000	It's good she's in the room.
4485000	4487000	You should feel ashamed of yourself.
4487000	4488000	Shame.
4488000	4490000	Level of shame is near zero.
4490000	4491000	Shame.
4491000	4493000	Yeah, you're the Game of Thrones. You're the one that says,
4493000	4495000	Oh, I'll watch Game of Thrones before I listen to OLR.
4495000	4497000	Shame. Shame.
4500000	4501000	I kind of meant it.
4501000	4502000	You need to get the bell.
4502000	4505000	I mean, it's really... it's missing something without the bell.
4505000	4507000	It is missing something without the bell. I'll work on that.
4507000	4508000	The Taco Bell?
4508000	4512000	I'm usually not the kind of show to have the zany sound effects and all that stuff,
4512000	4514000	but for that, we'll make an exception.
4514000	4516000	We'll make an exception. All right, let's move on.
4516000	4517000	Logie.
4517000	4518000	All right.
4518000	4521000	Gosh, so distracted by all this stuff.
4521000	4523000	Oh, God. No, this is really important. I'm sorry.
4523000	4524000	Sorry.
4524000	4527000	Defective Candy in Chat says, Oh, God, I remember pterodactyl porn.
4527000	4529000	Wasn't that the first porn on the Wii?
4529000	4532000	That was New Year's Eve one year.
4532000	4533000	This is what nerds do.
4533000	4539000	We realized that you could bring up XTube or PornTube or one of those up on the Wii.
4539000	4541000	It was the year that the Wii got the internet browser.
4541000	4544000	So, of course, the first thing we did was we started to bring up pornography on the Wii.
4544000	4547000	And one of the first things that was there was pterodactyl porn.
4547000	4552000	And it was a guy in a dinosaur suit banging some girl.
4552000	4557000	But my favorite was, like, the way he would just kind of shake his wings.
4557000	4560000	Like, he's putting so little effort into it. Like, I'm sorry.
4560000	4561000	Please don't do this.
4561000	4564000	Please don't do this.
4564000	4567000	The makers of Jurassic Park, please stop.
4568000	4572000	S21 Hunter Matt says, I remember Rob was scream laughing during the episode.
4572000	4573000	Sounds accurate.
4573000	4575000	Oh, my God.
4576000	4583000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase PIG.
4583000	4589000	Anyway, could we please stop the pornography talk and move on?
4589000	4590000	Loki.
4590000	4591000	I guess.
4591000	4595000	So, there's some rumors now regarding the Xbox One.
4595000	4602000	You know, it's been kind of rumored that the Xbox One will also be getting some sort of new device that would be slightly upgraded and stuff.
4602000	4606000	One of the things now, there's actually two rumored devices.
4606000	4609000	One being a slimmer model that's going to be coming out in 2016.
4609000	4612000	It's supposed to be spec-wise pretty similar.
4612000	4617000	What's kind of neat about those, from what I remember hearing, I've listened to quite a few shows about it.
4617000	4623000	They're saying that the size of this console would be about a little smaller than a lunch box.
4624000	4626000	So, I mean, that's significant.
4626000	4627000	How big of a lunch box?
4627000	4628000	A small lunch box.
4628000	4639000	I mean, so, I mean, considering the size of the Xbox One now, which is like 80s VCR, this is significantly smaller since we're talking like 80s lunch box now.
4639000	4641000	Can I get like awesome 80s lunch?
4641000	4645000	Like, will they start putting patterns on the Xbox like they used to do on 80s lunch boxes?
4645000	4652000	Like, can I get a Dukes of Hazzard Xbox One or like a Transformers Xbox One or something like that?
4652000	4653000	No idea.
4653000	4654000	Maybe faceplates will come back.
4654000	4659000	And then, of course, the other rumor is that there's going to be a more powerful Xbox One coming out in 2017.
4659000	4661000	Codename Scorpio.
4661000	4666000	That's supposed to have a more powerful GPU and Oculus Rift support.
4666000	4673000	Which makes sense because they're kind of partnering with, you know, Oculus to provide the controllers and everything in the Rift.
4673000	4681000	So, maybe since, you know, I would think HoloLens isn't going to be available anytime soon for a reasonable price.
4681000	4687000	This sounds to me like the Xbox 1.5 or whatever it is.
4687000	4692000	It sounds like this has gotten delayed, but you can't delay something you never announced.
4692000	4701000	Well, I think for sure that the slim thing is going to happen because if you notice on all the retail sites right now for Xbox Ones, they're throwing out some insane deals to clear out inventory.
4701000	4708000	That's usually what happens when they're going to be announcing a new SKU like that is that they're trying to clear out the old shit that they figure is not going to sell.
4708000	4718000	Because maybe it's being offered for the same price or something and they're not going to do any sort of, you know, back-end price rebates or whatever to allow them to clear out inventory.
4718000	4721000	So, I could see something like that happening.
4721000	4728000	I really don't like this new console thing coming out where they're saying, oh yeah, sure, the old games will be supported by it.
4728000	4733000	To me, it's just like putting out a brand new console without numbering it.
4733000	4741000	Except it's backwards compatible with the last generation. It's kind of like the DS with Game Boy Advance or the 3DS with the DS games.
4741000	4749000	Yeah, you can't really just call that a new DS because there's games that are going to run on that that aren't going to run on the other system.
4749000	4760000	And if they're not going to be utilized, if you're not going to have any sort of games taking advantage of that increased hardware and it's supposed to run perfectly on both systems, then what's the point?
4760000	4769000	And just because it runs, you know, it's going to be like some of the older games that came out at the end of, or I should say the beginning of the new generation.
4769000	4776000	Where, oh yeah, it runs great on this platform, but it runs 30 FPS on this platform with the decreased resolution and blah, blah, blah.
4776000	4782000	I don't know. I think it's too early for new consoles. We just had new consoles.
4782000	4783000	Yeah.
4783000	4787000	It's like you should have waited some time and increased the specs on them.
4787000	4792000	Another year though will be a little like, it'll feel a little better in another year, I think.
4792000	4799000	But still like then what's going to make me want to buy a new like PlayStation 4k or whatever we're going to call it means.
4799000	4805000	Because what, what makes me want to buy an iPhone 6 when I had an iPhone 5 that worked just fine. You know what I mean?
4805000	4814000	They have more features in it, but seems like, but I think for the most part, you know, software is going to be, I don't want to say software is going to be,
4814000	4821000	it does run significantly better on the other system. And with an iPhone or something like that, it's something that you use every single day.
4821000	4830000	I just don't see, I don't think you can compare it like that. It's, you know, iPhones in most smart devices do a lot more than just play games.
4830000	4840000	And if you're asking me to spend $400 a year for something, fuck that. I'm going to buy a PC, spend the same amount of money and have something that's going to need to be upgraded every few years.
4840000	4850000	And that's still going to run your games better than these upgraded specs. Because there's no way that those consoles are going to run games better than PC or even on par with PC.
4850000	4861000	Alright, well I'm going to move on to something else that is planned for 2017 and that is the brand new Mega Man cartoon that's coming out.
4861000	4870000	I don't know if you've seen the picture that was floating around the internet this week, but it's part Mega Man, part Tron basically that's out there.
4870000	4882000	I don't hate it. I just, it is different, but I don't necessarily hate it because at least I'm sitting here going, well, it's Mega Man something and it's going to take that to get the games to come back.
4882000	4890000	So, I don't know. But anyway, here's the deal is that this series is going to be aimed at kids 6 to 9 and parents who grew up playing the games.
4890000	4891000	6 to 9.
4891000	4897000	So, this is going to be about Mega Man's alter ego Aki Light.
4897000	4904000	No, we don't need fucking alter egos. It's fucking Mega Man. You don't need the fucking alter egos. Nobody gives a shit.
4904000	4909000	Wait, wait, wait, but it wasn't Mega Man made by Dr. Light, so it still seems kind of scary.
4909000	4916000	Yes, I understand that, but who gives a shit about alter egos and their high school drama bullshit? He's a fucking robot that kills more fucking robots.
4916000	4918000	Well, that's what it should be.
4918000	4924000	Well, hold on, because if you're a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog's friends, wait till you hear this.
4924000	4928000	Other characters from the games and new characters.
4928000	4935000	Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them with all the fuckable things and the non-fuckable things.
4936000	4940000	New characters including Mega Mini will also be featured.
4940000	4948000	What is this? Fucking Austin Powers? Mini fucking Mega Man? Yes, that will be fucking irritating and stupid.
4949000	4960000	By the way, for anyone wondering, Loki sounded loud on the show. He was even louder in person.
4960000	4967000	Not everybody gets to experience the Loki rants. You know, you've been listening to the show for a long time. You get to actually see it play out live.
4967000	4974000	It's amazing in person. Everyone should try this. You need to do this once in your life.
4978000	4990000	By the way, Capcom offered their own perspective on the Mega Man series, saying it's a young school-aged robot living in Silicon City.
4991000	5007000	He soon learns that deep within his programming are secret protocols that allow him to transform, giving him nanocore armor, a Mega Buster, and the iconic helmet to turn him into a superhero, Mega Man.
5008000	5012000	Yes, he's a magical girl. How do you feel about that, Loki?
5013000	5022000	I just fucked with them, seriously. I mean, they're not... It's like, what the fuck is it? Yeah, this worked out so well for Pac-Man, for fucking Sonic.
5022000	5025000	Actually, the 80s Pac-Man anime series was pretty good.
5025000	5040000	I'm not talking about the 80s Pac-Man. I'm talking about the fucking Pac-Man and Ghostly Adventures or whatever, where everybody, for some goddamn reason, they feel it's necessary to add more fucking sidekick friends.
5040000	5045000	Because you know what that means? They can merchandise more shit. All it means is it's fucking irritating.
5045000	5052000	I introduced my son to the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures. I didn't think it was that bad. It was not as irritating as I expected it to be.
5052000	5056000	But he doesn't give a shit about that show anymore. Like, it literally meant nothing to him.
5056000	5058000	Did you try Pee-Wee's Playhouse?
5058000	5060000	He liked Pee-Wee's Playhouse, actually.
5060000	5062000	Parenting done right, thank you.
5062000	5068000	So, I mean, so that was fine. It's just, this is stupid. This is like...
5070000	5075000	What's your audience? I mean, you're trying to get kids interested in Mega Man? I don't think that that's the problem.
5075000	5080000	Because, you know why they aren't interested in Mega Man now? Because you haven't put out a fucking game in years!
5080000	5081000	Exactly!
5081000	5083000	Yep. I was gonna say the same thing.
5083000	5085000	What if this could lead to a new game?
5085000	5087000	No! No, fuck that, because it's gonna be...
5087000	5089000	Based on the hit cartoon!
5089000	5091000	Are you gonna let me finish?
5091000	5095000	I don't fucking need Sonic Boom, the fucking Mega Man game, okay? I don't need that shit.
5095000	5099000	I want my fucking either 2D Mega Man game, or fucking Mega Man Legends 3.
5099000	5104000	I don't need you to fucking reinvent Mega Man, because you're doing a shitty job at it.
5104000	5107000	Okay, let's see. Dark Tetsuya in chat says,
5107000	5110000	I did enjoy Sonic Boom, though. Weird redesign aside.
5110000	5113000	And Dungeon Buster says, the Sonic Boom cartoon is actually really good.
5113000	5115000	So...
5115000	5116000	How about that?
5116000	5121000	That's really interesting! Too bad I'm never gonna watch the show, and the games suck ass, so that's fine.
5121000	5124000	I'm glad that they did a portion of it right.
5124000	5128000	But you know what they do, and you know how you know this is gonna be a terrible show?
5128000	5132000	Because if it was a good show, they'd fucking cancel it, like fucking Tron.
5132000	5137000	Orange right in chat says, too bad they couldn't adapt the Archie comics.
5137000	5141000	Actually, isn't the CW getting a show called, like, Riverdale?
5141000	5144000	And they turned it into, like, a scary sci-fi thing?
5144000	5148000	Except, I think what they mean are the ones published by Archie comics.
5148000	5150000	Oh.
5150000	5155000	Because Archie's had a Sonic series running since, like, 1990.
5155000	5161000	So, when you say Archie comics, I actually think of Archie the comic, which is probably dating myself a little bit, but I don't give a fuck.
5161000	5163000	Let's still read Betty and Veronica.
5163000	5165000	And Josie and the Pussycats, thank you very much.
5165000	5171000	You know what they need to do? I'm seriously, like, stop trying to, you know, dumb down these fucking franchises for kids.
5171000	5180000	Because if you make a franchise that's just badass, that's just fucking, okay, it's a badass Mega Man fighting robots and shit, little kids are gonna fucking want to watch that.
5180000	5183000	Just like fucking Transformers, they didn't dumb that shit down.
5183000	5188000	Okay, they did in the movies, thank you Michael Bay, but I'm talking about, like, the actual 80s cartoons, they didn't dumb that shit down.
5188000	5191000	Kids are like, fuck, that looks awesome, and they want to watch it.
5191000	5195000	Not because, ooh, this is my demographic, fuck yes!
5195000	5199000	I mean, nobody watches something because it's in their demographic.
5199000	5201000	This is, like, such backward-ass thinking.
5201000	5209000	I will say, though, that the toy series existed under a different brand.
5209000	5213000	Then they had the cartoon out for the purpose of marketing the toys.
5213000	5218000	Same thing happened with G.I. Joe, the toys were out, and they wanted to market it to the 80s audience.
5218000	5221000	Therefore, we had an animated series to push that out.
5221000	5226000	Same with Thundercats, same with Silverhawks, even though Silverhawks was awesome!
5227000	5230000	Um, what was it? He-Man.
5230000	5236000	Yeah, but Dark Tetsuya, though, Rescue Bots, though, was for, like, preschoolers.
5236000	5237000	Go-Bots was shit.
5237000	5239000	Okay, Go-Bots, we're not talking about Go-Bots.
5239000	5244000	Um, this fucking Rama one-half robot bullshit is stupid.
5244000	5253000	Um, so, yes, I understand that sometimes they will take, like, different superheroes or series and dumb them down for, like, preschoolers.
5253000	5259000	You know, kind of get them into, like, Superhero Squad or, I guess, the Transformers Rescue Bots or something like that.
5259000	5260000	Yes, they have those versions.
5260000	5264000	And, let me tell you, Superhero Squad is fucking irritating as shit.
5264000	5267000	And my kids, they kind of liked it at first, but they don't like it now.
5267000	5270000	I mean, it's fucking irritating.
5270000	5272000	It's like you watch...
5272000	5274000	The characters are just fucking cliches, it's ridiculous.
5274000	5276000	I mean, come on.
5276000	5282000	What happened to the good shit, like fucking Batman the Animated Series and fucking Gargoyles and Darkwing Duck and all that shit?
5282000	5285000	Like, why can't we just take these properties a little bit more seriously?
5285000	5288000	Because if you're showing me this shit, this doesn't seem serious to me at all.
5288000	5290000	And I don't think you're going to handle it seriously.
5290000	5292000	And who do you think is going to buy this game?
5292000	5297000	I hope that those six to nine-year-olds are really going to fucking pick up your game because I sure as fuck can't.
5297000	5300000	God damn millennials, get off my lawn.
5300000	5304000	It's not millennials, it's fucking people in marketing departments making terrible decisions.
5304000	5307000	It's even worse. It's the generation after the millennials.
5307000	5310000	There has to be a moment of correction toward the chat room.
5310000	5314000	First of all, Voltron was not created as a marketing ploy.
5314000	5318000	It was two different series combined into one to market to the US audiences.
5318000	5325000	But they were their own standalone series and Robotech was fucking Macross and you do not sass Macross.
5325000	5330000	Yes, there were many awesome toys that came as a result of that.
5330000	5333000	You even had figures for RPGs.
5333000	5338000	RPGs based off of the Valkyrie design that, yes, I might have played.
5338000	5341000	I think they were wrapped up in the Playdium universe, I want to say.
5341000	5346000	But still, that wasn't the intent was to have a marketing empire.
5346000	5349000	The first intent was to have a series.
5349000	5352000	I feel like we should have a whiteboard with Dark Sakura's rules.
5352000	5358000	And for those that want a webcam during the show, it's just pointed at the rule board the entire time.
5358000	5361000	And it can start with one, do not sass Macross.
5362000	5371000	I hope Kaijuto is being facetious in here because that is the most stupid question I've ever seen asked in the entirety of stupid fucking questions.
5371000	5376000	It's almost more stupid than Drumpf saying there is no drought in California.
5376000	5378000	Jamie, calm down.
5378000	5381000	Your rants are getting as bad as his.
5381000	5383000	What are we going to do with both of you?
5383000	5385000	I haven't had caffeine, Rob.
5385000	5389000	But seriously though, how am I supposed to take this shit seriously?
5389000	5391000	Capcom, you know, fucking...
5391000	5394000	What have they done in the last few years for us with Mega Man?
5394000	5396000	It's just like, oh hey, guess what?
5396000	5399000	Mega Man, he's going to be a fucking Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5399000	5402000	Oh fuck you, it's Bad Box Mega Man.
5402000	5404000	Hahaha, suckers.
5404000	5407000	Hey, Mega Man Legends 3, that's going to be so awesome, we're going to totally bring that back.
5407000	5409000	Haha, it's fucking cancelled, you assholes.
5409000	5411000	I mean, how am I supposed to take him fucking seriously?
5411000	5413000	I'm not.
5413000	5416000	It's like, hey, we're going to come out with a new Mega Man cartoon.
5416000	5418000	Haha, it's fucking shit.
5418000	5420000	I mean...
5420000	5423000	Whatever, you know what, come out with the cartoon, we'll see, it sucks.
5423000	5424000	The end.
5424000	5428000	For the record, yes, they killed the shit out of Roy Foker in Macross.
5430000	5432000	Let's move on to the next story.
5432000	5434000	They killed the shit out of him.
5434000	5439000	And we were like, holy shit, by the way, that Sven guy in, um, uh, Voltron?
5439000	5441000	Yeah, he died too.
5443000	5445000	I see their parachutes.
5445000	5447000	Moving on, Dar Sakura.
5447000	5449000	Do you have another gaming related story for us?
5449000	5451000	Yeah, I do, and it's sad and it pisses me off too.
5451000	5459000	So Vivendi is going to be making a hostile takeover of, um, Gameloft.
5459000	5461000	They're moving through with it.
5461000	5466000	Like, you know, you don't really hear about hostile takeovers so much.
5466000	5470000	Not since like the 80s when it was like, everything was making me corporate world.
5470000	5472000	Yeah, they're trying to do it with Ubisoft too.
5472000	5478000	Actually, Ubisoft is definitely on their, uh, uh, they have their sights on Ubisoft next.
5478000	5485000	Um, both companies have been opposed to, uh, the acquisition for a while now.
5485000	5488000	And have been working to, uh, fight the hostile takeover.
5488000	5493000	But Gameloft has, uh, succumbed and Ubisoft is going to have to get their asses in order.
5493000	5498000	We need to protect our poor, poor French Ubisoft.
5498000	5501000	Like a precious, precious little gem.
5501000	5506000	We need to shelter them and say, you know what?
5506000	5511000	Give us more lady characters and we'll protect you from the big bad Vivendi.
5511000	5517000	Oh, Ubisoft. You precious, special little slip lake.
5517000	5520000	Boy, Vivendi's been desperate to get something gaming back, isn't it?
5520000	5523000	Well, that's what you get for fucking it away.
5523000	5529000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates from an evil gaming company near you. Loki.
5529000	5532000	Alright, so this week we have a few things coming out.
5532000	5538000	Um, looks like Dead Island the Definitive Edition is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5538000	5539000	Yay.
5539000	5544000	Uh, One Piece Burning Blood on PS4, Vita, and Xbox One.
5544000	5547000	Also, Smite is coming out on PlayStation 4.
5547000	5557000	Um, this is kind of interesting speaking of, you know, you want to talk about fucking, you know, pornographic and fan art shit.
5557000	5561000	Uh, Senran Kagura, uh, Shinobi Versus.
5561000	5568000	This is the fighting game where you fight as big-breasted anime chicks and their clothes come off as you fight them.
5568000	5570000	And that's coming out on PC.
5570000	5571000	Well, isn't that nice.
5571000	5576000	Um, a game called Turn On on WinMac and Xbox One.
5576000	5578000	No, it's not pornographic.
5578000	5579000	It also sounds pornographic.
5579000	5581000	It's not. I checked.
5581000	5586000	Uh, Dangerous Golf, which actually looks kind of interesting.
5586000	5587000	It's, uh, pretty cool.
5587000	5594000	It's this game where you, uh, basically fire a ball out of a gun at, like, different things in a house.
5594000	5598000	And you're breaking shit and then you're also trying to get it into a hole within a certain amount of strokes.
5598000	5600000	So that's pretty cool.
5600000	5604000	And that'll be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
5604000	5610000	Uh, Hard Reset Redux coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5610000	5614000	Uh, Seto Corsa on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5614000	5616000	And...
5616000	5619000	Daydreamer Weekend Edition on Xbox One.
5619000	5621000	That is it.
5621000	5623000	Alright, well, it's a pretty slow week in Japan this week.
5623000	5627000	There's really only one release I can find and it's on, believe it or not, the PlayStation Vita.
5627000	5629000	It's a Taisho Alice All-In-One.
5629000	5631000	It's coming out this week on the 2nd of June.
5631000	5634000	And that's really it for Japanese release dates this week.
5634000	5637000	Loki, er, excuse me, Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
5637000	5641000	Sorry, when you guys get so angry, I confuse the two of you so easily.
5641000	5643000	Girl.
5643000	5645000	One thing.
5645000	5649000	On, uh, the 31st, Oxenfree Director's Cut.
5649000	5651000	Didn't they already release that?
5651000	5654000	Uh, Oxenfree they did, but I'm assuming this is some type of-
5654000	5657000	Is it worth having a Director's Cut? It sounds so weird.
5657000	5660000	Um, the game has a neat kind of story to it.
5660000	5662000	Um, I played it a little bit on Xbox One.
5662000	5664000	It's, it's, it's neat.
5664000	5667000	I, it, I don't know what that means.
5667000	5670000	If that means there's extra screens, if there's commentary.
5670000	5673000	I don't know, it depends how much they're asking for it and, you know.
5673000	5675000	Please give us money.
5675000	5677000	Please. Please give us money.
5677000	5679000	I say it depends on who the director is.
5679000	5681000	I mean, if it's Michael Bay or Uwe Boll, I'm in.
5681000	5683000	I think the good news is it's neither of them.
5683000	5684000	Oh, okay.
5684000	5685000	For what it's worth.
5685000	5687000	Alright, then, then maybe I'm in.
5687000	5690000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
5690000	5692000	But first, Loki.
5692000	5698000	So, Sony has sold 40 million copies, or over 40 million units, I should say, of the PlayStation 4.
5698000	5702000	It is the fastest selling console in PlayStation history.
5702000	5706000	And they are also saying their software sales have hit over 270 million units.
5706000	5709000	And that's counting retail and digital.
5709000	5712000	And that's, um, as of May 22nd.
5712000	5717000	Uh, also kind of neat, uh, Uncharted 4 has sold 2.7 million copies in the first week.
5717000	5720000	So, it's doing pretty good. I guess people like the game.
5721000	5724000	And, of course, it's not the greatest first-party game that they've had.
5724000	5729000	Um, of course, Last of Us sold 3.4 million copies in its first three weeks.
5729000	5731000	So, actually, maybe it is the top one that they've had.
5731000	5733000	Because that's three weeks, not one.
5733000	5735000	Hmm. Interesting.
5735000	5736000	People like it.
5738000	5740000	See, that deserves, like, a mov-
5740000	5742000	Well, actually, I think they are making a movie of that.
5742000	5743000	Uncharted?
5743000	5744000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are.
5744000	5748000	Uh, it's like one of those movies in development hell or what have you.
5748000	5754000	Why? Okay, well, maybe I would be fine if it's in development hell as long as it doesn't come out like Assassin's Creed.
5755000	5757000	Which does not look good.
5758000	5759000	Is there even a teaser for that yet?
5759000	5760000	Oh, yes there is.
5760000	5762000	Oh, I've seen the poster. I didn't see the teaser.
5762000	5765000	Assassin's Creed where they thought, hey, you know what's cool?
5765000	5768000	People really like the modern-day portion of Assassin's Creed.
5768000	5774000	You know, um, games, not necessarily the part where there's actually all the action and story where they go back in the past.
5774000	5776000	Let's cover more of the modern portion of that.
5776000	5778000	That's gonna be the majority of the movie.
5778000	5781000	Alright, well, one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.
5781000	5785000	And, uh, I know Loki is really excited about the upcoming release Mighty No. 9.
5785000	5788000	Um, perhaps, Loki, you saw the new trailer this week.
5788000	5789000	Oh, yes.
5789000	5791000	The Master Class trailer. What'd you think of the trailer?
5791000	5793000	I thought it looked crap.
5793000	5794000	Yeah, and-
5794000	5797000	And it didn't help the snarky commentary over it.
5797000	5803000	Apparently, a lot of people felt it was crap, including the CEO of the co-developer of the game.
5803000	5817000	Takuya Aizu actually wrote a tweet that said, what the hell was censored censored, but it's very clear it says Deep Silver, thinking making a crappy PV, promotional video, like this.
5817000	5818000	Unforgivable.
5818000	5826000	Yes, I think, I think the quality quote that everybody can take away from this is that it'll have you crying like an anime fan on prom night.
5826000	5827000	Yeah, yeah.
5827000	5830000	Like, thank you, you fucking asshole.
5830000	5838000	I mean, I don't take that personally offensive because I'm not a huge anime fan, but jeez, way to piss on, way to piss on all your fans.
5838000	5846000	I mean, that's just like, hey, hey, people that backed us, fuck you. Fuck you all, because fuck you, that's why.
5846000	5851000	Yeah, I'm not sure, um, who allowed that to go through, but unfortunately-
5851000	5858000	What the fuck were they thinking? I mean, seriously, how is that, like, shouldn't that be like one of like the first rules?
5858000	5861000	Hmm, maybe we should insult our fucking audience.
5863000	5870000	So can I, can I admit to something? I never watched the trailer for this. Do you, do you think I should watch it now?
5870000	5871000	Yeah, you should, let's do it.
5871000	5873000	Dark Sakura, have you seen this trailer?
5873000	5874000	No.
5874000	5875000	Would you like to watch it now?
5875000	5877000	I can't really see it from here, so I'll listen to it.
5879000	5882000	This is rated E for everyone, just as cartoon violence.
5882000	5888000	This is all pretty typical.
5888000	5894000	Hey, you, look at the screen. Let me ask you a question. Do you like awesome things that are awesome?
5894000	5900000	Then you gotta play this game, dude. It's friggin' cool and crazy addictive, like popping bubble wrap addictive. Check this out.
5902000	5906000	Okay, well, to be fair, pa- popping bubble wrap is really addictive.
5906000	5912000	Also, this is clearly not the guy from the, uh, the, the video trailer thing that they were saying.
5912000	5926000	But, when you're try- okay, here's the first issue I'm gonna take with this trailer, is that when you're reminding me that popping bubble wrap may be more fun and cheaper than playing your game, that's not quite the best angle to take.
5926000	5929000	Is this like a new type of millennial marketing that they're doing now?
5931000	5934000	Also, I can't remember the last time bubble wrap was delayed.
5937000	5941000	Well, they gotta- they gotta take time to fill it all up with air. Artisan bubble wrap.
5941000	5942000	That is true.
5942000	5943000	Each bubble hand-filled.
5945000	5946000	By millennials.
5946000	5947000	With the breath of angels.
5947000	5948000	Wait, hold on, here, moving on.
5948000	5956000	See, that's your dash move. There's a short dash, long dash, jump dash, spiral, slide. There's probably a dash that makes you breakfast, I don't know.
5956000	5958000	Great idea- wait, what?
5958000	5962000	Point is, you're dashing around like a friggin' moon man and I love it.
5962000	5969000	Oh, and look at this. There's all these combo moves you can do, then you can do combos on combos to rack up your score.
5969000	5972000	And I know you like that combo on combo action.
5973000	5974000	What?
5975000	5978000	But I saved the best for last. Absorption boost.
5979000	5980000	That sounds more like it.
5980000	5989000	You kill an enemy and you can absorb their power ups. Stuff that'll make you faster and stronger and make the bad guys cry like an anime fan on prom night.
5990000	5992000	So what do you think? You ready to play?
5993000	5994000	I'm ready.
5994000	5996000	No one's talking to you, Vernon.
6002000	6003000	Mighty number nine.
6005000	6009000	Um, that sucked.
6009000	6016000	It's just stupid. I'm not mad about it. It's just stupid.
6016000	6017000	Yeah, I agree.
6017000	6021000	Although I like what Stoppy says, cry like an anime fan without his body pillow waifu.
6026000	6027000	It's silly.
6027000	6035000	By the way, big shout out to everybody at Fanime this weekend. I don't know why but I'm just reminded. Big shout out to everybody at Fanime this weekend.
6036000	6038000	That was just... no.
6039000	6041000	Why is it like, who gives a shit?
6041000	6042000	I need distractions from that thing.
6042000	6051000	Why do they need to fucking commentate over that? Why is it like, who gives a shit? You got dash attacks and an absorption move and you get combos.
6051000	6054000	Absorption moves? Sign me the fuck up.
6054000	6062000	Dashing combos and something that can gain power ups with? Wow, way to list the features of every fucking game that's in that genre.
6063000	6067000	I don't know if they had combo on combo action in those other ones though.
6068000	6071000	I ate combos the other day, does that count?
6071000	6078000	Why didn't he fucking just like, seriously they skirted around these fucking memes like shit. Why didn't he just say, yo dawg I hear you like combos.
6078000	6084000	I mean seriously just step it up a bit instead of...
6086000	6091000	You're writing stuff. You're deep silver writing stuff folks.
6091000	6092000	Somebody thought it was funny.
6093000	6099000	Dungeon Buster in chat says, Mighty No. 9 already has a lot of shit thrown at it. It really didn't need it from their own camp.
6099000	6101000	Yeah, I think that's kind of what it boils down to.
6101000	6106000	It's like, now it's like, it's starting to feel like the showgirls of video games.
6106000	6109000	Like there's just a point where they started marketing it as camp, you know?
6109000	6114000	And like, how did it happen? I mean seriously it's like, fuck yes it's a Mega Man game.
6114000	6117000	We've been fucking rooting for a Mega Man game, but now you know what?
6117000	6122000	The guy that's making Mega Man, he left Capcom because they wouldn't fucking make a Mega Man game.
6122000	6125000	He's going to make a Mega Man game, but it's not going to be called Mega Man.
6126000	6133000	What happened between that time and now? Because what the fuck is that game?
6133000	6135000	I mean it just doesn't look that interesting anymore.
6135000	6137000	Drugs. Allegedly.
6138000	6141000	You know what that trailer says? You don't know shit.
6142000	6144000	You know what I feel like they need to do?
6144000	6148000	I feel like it doesn't matter what the trailer was, there were going to be people that gave it crap.
6148000	6151000	They just need to release the freaking game already.
6152000	6153000	June 21st.
6153000	6158000	I wanted him to drag out his explanation of what happened with the enemies and how it made him cry.
6158000	6163000	Just in case if anybody didn't get the reference, he should have been like, you know, makes them cry like anime fans on prom night.
6163000	6169000	Get it? Because they're single. Because they don't leave the house. Because they're nerdy and nobody likes them.
6169000	6174000	I mean, just in case you're catching the reference here, I mean, they're basically sexless virgins.
6175000	6178000	I'm just trying to make sure that you understand that.
6179000	6180000	Mighty number nine.
6184000	6186000	I think low keys should just market video games for a living.
6186000	6189000	How bad do you hate yourself? You'll love this game.
6192000	6197000	And I'm glad that... Oh, no. I'm not even going to give it any attention. I'm just... I'm done.
6197000	6200000	All right. Let's get to the classic game of the week.
6202000	6203000	It's not Halo.
6203000	6207000	We're going to go to a time when you didn't have these YouTube commercials promoting games.
6207000	6211000	You had a magazine ad that didn't make any fucking sense at all.
6211000	6215000	Or the ad had like paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs of shit.
6217000	6218000	Actual shit.
6218000	6219000	Actual shit.
6219000	6220000	It's the classic game...
6220000	6221000	Built into the ink.
6221000	6223000	Classic game of the week.
6223000	6229000	And Dark Sakura is... She's got, I think, a little deep into the archive this week to find one.
6229000	6232000	It's another one I've always wanted to play and never got around to.
6232000	6237000	All right. So Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
6237000	6241000	I love what a spiteful bitch the designer is, or the producer was.
6241000	6248000	The game is D, or as it was called in Japan, D no Shokutak, the table of D.
6249000	6253000	It is a psychological horror puzzle adventure game.
6253000	6256000	It was developed by Warp and produced by Kenji Eno.
6256000	6261000	It was first released for 3DO in 1995.
6261000	6268000	And then it came out later on Sega Saturn on the Sony Playstation and MS-DOS.
6268000	6271000	And it was the first in its series.
6271000	6281000	So D is basically a story of a lady who goes in to look at a hospital after finding that her dad's a serial killer, pretty much.
6281000	6284000	Well, not a serial killer, but more like a homicidal mass murderer.
6284000	6286000	And then he barricaded himself inside.
6286000	6292000	But once she gets in, it turns into a castle and she has to explore through it to find her father.
6292000	6298000	It is very violent and very creepy.
6298000	6307000	I mean, I would even say that some of the psychological shit in this game borders on Silent Hill levels.
6307000	6309000	I mean, if not worse.
6309000	6313000	And the thing about how this game got released is what makes me love it.
6314000	6331000	Basically, the whole storyline and everything, and it was so explicit for what it was, that Eno decided to bypass the censorship committee by submitting a clean version.
6331000	6337000	So that he could get the publisher to give approval on it late in the development cycle.
6337000	6343000	And that he had to, of course, hand deliver the master to the manufacturer.
6343000	6345000	So he switched the disk.
6345000	6347000	Yep.
6347000	6351000	And the master had, of course, the more disturbing content.
6351000	6356000	It sold over a million copies in Japan.
6356000	6357000	It was pretty successful.
6357000	6360000	Not so successful in the US.
6360000	6365000	But part of that had to do with how Sony handled it.
6365000	6375000	Basically, Sony told them that there would be a certain number of copies produced.
6375000	6386000	And what happened instead is that they ended up getting half the amount produced because Sony gave manufacturing priority to other titles.
6386000	6388000	And so basically...
6388000	6389000	I just want to call out real quick.
6389000	6391000	The audio in this is very ambient.
6391000	6393000	So you'll just get these random noises.
6393000	6396000	We are looking at a video of the game in action, though, here in studio.
6396000	6397000	Just for the listeners.
6397000	6408000	So basically, he got pretty much revenge on Sony by saying that the subsequent games were Sega exclusives.
6408000	6419000	So the games that followed were Enemy Zero and D2, which Enemy Zero was also on Saturn and D2 was on Dreamcast.
6419000	6423000	And they had the same digital actress as they phrased it.
6423000	6427000	Although it's a different character in each game.
6427000	6435000	So as you go through the game, you have different puzzles to solve.
6435000	6438000	And actually, even a time limit.
6438000	6445000	So basically, you have to get everything solved within two hours of the game.
6445000	6455000	Plus, you have a particular time that you have to confront the main bad being her dad.
6455000	6460000	So you get different endings.
6460000	6468000	You have the time-lapse ending, which if you go after the two hours, the other world closes off and you have to go back to the real world.
6468000	6470000	And then it says, out of time, please try again.
6470000	6475000	You have the bad ending, which I'm not going to go into, which is really gross.
6475000	6481000	You have the good ending and then you have the best ending, which if you look at scarabs all over the place, you get the best ending.
6481000	6486000	And the game has two characters completely, Lara and her dad.
6486000	6501000	So the development of the game is, they actually were developing this in 1994 through the 3DO and had three Amiga computers to work with.
6501000	6509000	And managed to get full CGI cutscenes and full visuals into this game.
6509000	6516000	Which, for its time, this really, really was no mean feat.
6516000	6523000	So it was pretty, pretty awesome in Japan, like I said.
6523000	6529000	All three editions that were released in Japan were localized for US and Europe.
6529000	6535000	And see, I'd like to read this because this is actually the phrasing from Enno about what happened.
6535000	6544000	So when I released D on PlayStation, the people gathered orders for 100,000 units, but Sony had given other titles manufacturing priority.
6544000	6552000	So Sony told me that they only manufactured 40,000 units, but then in the end, they had only manufactured 28,000 units, which is very bad.
6552000	6558000	So the sales people had gotten 100,000 preorders from retailers, but Sony wasn't able to manufacture all of them.
6558000	6564000	I was very pissed about that because one title like that for a small company is very important.
6564000	6567000	If that game doesn't sell well, that's very bad for the company.
6567000	6570000	And so, revenge!
6570000	6576000	They actually did, there was another game, which is actually the game I've been trying and trying and trying to think of the name of.
6576000	6579000	It's the game that fucking came with seeds.
6579000	6587000	Real Sound Cause No Regret, which is an all sound audio adventure for Dreamcast.
6587000	6600000	It came with seeds and it was actually a game manufactured with the blind in mind or, you know, people who had some kind of vision impairment because you would play it all with audio cues.
6600000	6603000	So that was the other game I was thinking of.
6603000	6608000	There's also another rare addition called Dee's Diner Director's Cut.
6608000	6622000	It has other sequences in it and other trailers, a sound novel that talks about Lara's family, and then a mini disc that had different tracks from the Dee soundtrack on it.
6622000	6635000	And then in the good ending, you actually get a longer trailer for the original version of Dee 2, which started off as a 3DO game and then was completely scrapped and reworked for the Dreamcast.
6636000	6643000	So, the game scored pretty well.
6643000	6653000	Sega Saturn Magazine gave it an 83 saying that it was extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed.
6653000	6666000	It was pretty well received all over the place and they said that it was even better than some of the other puzzler adventure games because it had a really enticing story.
6666000	6671000	And the full motion video graphics were pretty hardcore for the game.
6671000	6678000	Game Informer even said that it was magnificent in storytelling, but the gameplay was a little tedious.
6678000	6682000	So the story would make a great movie or book, but not a game.
6683000	6686000	And like I said, it sold a million copies in Japan, so that's it.
6686000	6687000	Dee.
6687000	6690000	Which I know I got a copy of this somewhere in my house.
6690000	6692000	This looks pretty intense and gross.
6692000	6693000	Yeah.
6693000	6695000	But there it is, your classic game of the week.
6695000	6696000	Dee.
6696000	6698000	Simply the letter.
6698000	6700000	There it is on the Sega Saturn.
6700000	6711000	We are going to take a quick break and come back with the second half of our show, but before we go to break, I know it's about 8 o'clock here on the west coast and you guys actually have to drive back to San Francisco tonight.
6711000	6714000	So you're going to go ahead and say goodbye to us now.
6714000	6716000	YBoyArt, it was so great to have you here.
6716000	6717000	It was great to be here.
6717000	6719000	Amy as well, I apologize for all the millennial jokes.
6719000	6721000	You don't.
6721000	6723000	You're right, I don't.
6723000	6730000	But a very happy wedding and honeymoon to you both and congratulations Mazel Tov, all that good stuff.
6730000	6732000	You need to play happy wedding during the break.
6732000	6734000	Maybe I will.
6734000	6738000	But good luck with making the games.
6738000	6740000	I look forward to multitasking whenever that happens.
6740000	6741000	Awesome.
6741000	6744000	You know, don't hurt yourself though trying to get it done. I know you're a one man operation.
6744000	6755000	Other than looking for a new place to live and other things, yeah, we have nothing going on so I'll be working on it.
6755000	6756000	Excellent.
6756000	6762000	And other things and I'll always post to yyrgames.com where the stuff that nobody reads is.
6762000	6765000	I will be posting regular updates.
6765000	6771000	And I'm very happy that you could actually be here in studio to actually sit in on an episode of OLR.
6771000	6773000	I'm really happy that you guys had me.
6773000	6778000	I actually was writing a review for OLR because I realized I never post a review on iTunes.
6778000	6779000	What?
6779000	6781000	We say every week.
6781000	6783000	Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
6783000	6784000	It's fine. I'm just kidding.
6784000	6792000	But I was actually writing a review on the way here on the plane and I said when you listen to a podcast regularly, it feels like you're getting to know the hosts.
6792000	6803000	But with Orange Lounge Radio, you can actually get to know the hosts because of all the different forms of audience participation that you guys trumpet, not just offer.
6803000	6809000	And well, I guess this is just the ultimate form of audience participation right here.
6809000	6812000	Here I am sitting in the studio part of the show.
6812000	6816000	So it was really, really awesome to be here.
6816000	6824000	Which is almost everyone says when they do cross the line and get to see the studio for the first time, almost everybody says it is not what I thought it would look like.
6824000	6826000	You said the same thing.
6826000	6831000	Yeah, I mean, I guess I imagine something slightly different, but not too different.
6831000	6832000	It works.
6832000	6833000	Yeah, no, it works.
6833000	6834000	It works very well.
6834000	6837000	Compared to the last space we had, which is the little apartment, this is a dream.
6837000	6842000	And the fact that Alan lets me get away with this and have this and do this is amazing.
6842000	6844000	There's no longer a show me that sits on your feet, though.
6844000	6853000	No, I do miss that, but I do have a Sanrio that hides in the closet and will come out and scream for treats once the show's done and everybody leaves.
6853000	6856000	I can vouch for this. We've seen no sign of Sanrio.
6856000	6860000	She's in the closet in the very back bedroom, like the complete opposite corner of the house.
6860000	6862000	Or under the bed.
6862000	6866000	No, I looked when I took a potty break. She's in the closet.
6866000	6868000	No offense taken, I would hide from me too.
6869000	6881000	All right, well, again, a big thank you to you, because I know you were coming to San Francisco from some other stuff, but you still took the two-hour drive from Frisco on a busy weekend to be here with us here at OLR, and I really, really deeply appreciate it.
6881000	6883000	I would do it again. I would do it again.
6883000	6885000	And you are more than welcome to anytime.
6885000	6889000	You know what, we'll see if the calendar is kind, because a lot of times we fly back on Sundays.
6889000	6890000	Sure.
6890000	6896000	But if the calendar is kind as it was this time, you know, Memorial Day and all, then maybe we'll do it again.
6896000	6909000	Well, in the meantime, I look forward to seeing you at MAGFest 2017, which I am fully planning on attending, and that is in part to the constant pressure that folks like you and SSJ100Matt and all the East Coasters put on me, saying, you really need to fucking go to this con already.
6909000	6911000	I did, and I love it, so I'll see you next year.
6911000	6917000	That's fantastic. Fantastic, absolutely, and it'll be great to have you again.
6917000	6921000	All right, look forward to it. YYR, everybody, thank you for being here.
6921000	6922000	Thanks for having me.
6922000	6929000	All right, check them out, yyrgames.com, not yyr, yyr.game, but I'll explain that later in the show.
6929000	6940000	All right, we're going to take a quick break. We will be back with more rapid-fire news, the Fuqua Question of the Week, and more when we come back, here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6940000	6954000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 643 of our show, already in progress.
6954000	6960000	YYR has left the building with his new wife, Amy. They're on their way back to San Francisco.
6960000	6969000	But if you're just joining us, be sure at some point to check out the podcast feed for a fun first half of the show, and very explicit, thanks to YYR's filthy mouth, honestly. No, I'm just kidding.
6969000	6973000	I am loving this thing that I put in my mouth.
6973000	6976000	Oh, yes, you went and had another one of those donut muffins, didn't you?
6976000	6982000	Yes, I did, and I really shouldn't because I have a corset to fit in, but I don't care.
6982000	6983000	It's a long weekend.
6983000	6984000	It tastes like a fucking churro.
6984000	6991000	I realized during the break, I never did crack open the bottle of wine I was going to have tonight, even though we had the company and everything.
6992000	6999000	But then I thought, maybe I'll want to go out and play Ingress later, I don't know, so I should probably save the liquor for another week.
6999000	7005000	I'll wait. Maybe when Shane comes back and I have the sweet wine that he will drink the entire bottle.
7005000	7007000	We'll have a fun show that week or something.
7007000	7009000	But we're having a fun show tonight, aren't we?
7009000	7018000	One thing I do want to make sure I plug before we get into rapid fire news tonight is that last week on the show, I briefly talked about during my gaming week
7018000	7027000	that I had ridden the new Mass Effect ride at Great America, Mass Effect New Earth, but I didn't really talk a lot about it because I knew a video was coming.
7027000	7033000	That video is now up, so if you are not subscribed to our YouTube channel for VOG Network, I would point you in that direction right now.
7033000	7043000	Head on over to YouTube and look at the VOG Network channel on YouTube, and you can actually see there the most recent video we've posted is myself and, speaking of Shane,
7043000	7050000	Shane is there in the video with me doing a review of the Mass Effect New Earth ride at Great America.
7050000	7054000	So I'm hoping you guys will all check that out and see what we thought about that ride.
7054000	7066000	I'll just kind of tell you in a nutshell that I think as a Mass Effect fan, we were kind of hoping for a little more that it did just feel like kind of a generic ride layout sort of thing.
7066000	7071000	It was very kind of Star Tours, but with a lot of the Mass Effect stuff just kind of like shoved into it.
7071000	7079000	But I thought it was very interesting. One thing that doesn't come up in the video, but Alan was telling me that one of his friends went and rode it at Great America,
7079000	7087000	and basically this friend of his doesn't really play video games or understand any of that stuff, and he basically told Alan that I didn't get it at all.
7087000	7092000	I didn't understand what was happening. I didn't know what was going on. It all went over my head. So kind of interesting.
7092000	7102000	But I don't think the ride was bad by any means. As a Mass Effect fan, you were hoping for a little more, but I guess it's something while we wait for the new game to come out.
7102000	7115000	But if you want to find my full thoughts and Shane's full thoughts, go check out the review on our YouTube channel at VOG Network and some other random stuff from around Great America as well we threw in just for fun.
7115000	7123000	And Bobby's reminding us you want to stay to the very end of the video just because. That's right. We're like a Marvel film at this point.
7123000	7130000	Stoppy says, just subscribe. Shit, you guys need more subs. Yeah, we do. Thank you for subscribing. I appreciate that.
7130000	7140000	Granted, we haven't done a whole ton of YouTube content, but it is something you'll notice this year we've probably done way more than we've done any other year,
7140000	7149000	and that's probably going to be a trend that keeps continuing. Bobby and I are always throwing ideas out there. Just you wait for Dragon Con. That's going to be one big one for sure.
7149000	7161000	So anyhow, let's move on. We've got to get to some rapid fire news, Fugu Quest of the Week, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype in just a little while. But first, rapid fire news. Loki.
7161000	7169000	So there was a trailer that was, or I should say an announcement, that Dragon Quest Builders will be coming to North America this fall.
7169000	7180000	And if you're not familiar with Dragon Quest Builders, it's kind of like a voxel survival game, much like Minecraft, but with a lot of RPG elements because it is Dragon Quest.
7180000	7194000	It looks interesting. I'm not sure if it's like tower defense as well, but it looks like you do end up building some different towns and stuff and exploring right at my wheelhouse, so you may have to check it out.
7194000	7204000	So that should be coming around this fall to console, I'm assuming. And then they've announced the games with gold for June.
7204000	7216000	So if you have an Xbox One or Xbox 360 with Xbox Live Gold, then you're able to get these games. Goat Simulator for Xbox One, and that's going to be the full month of June 1st through June 30th.
7216000	7227000	And then the crew will be available from the later half of the month to the second or the half of July. So that's from June 16th to July 15th.
7227000	7239000	And then on Xbox 360, Super Meat Boy, as well as XCOM Enemy Unknown, and that's going to be available. Super Meat Boy the first half of the month, XCOM the second half.
7239000	7245000	No word on PlayStation yet, so it'll be interesting what's coming out for them.
7245000	7257000	And then finally, there's going to be a new expansion coming to Grand Theft Auto Online for Grand Theft Auto 5. It's the Crime Boss, I guess, was it Future Adventures in Finance and Felony.
7257000	7268000	So you can actually be like a crime boss in this. You're able to basically have underlings that can go do different missions for you.
7268000	7277000	So whether that be to like, you know, ship drugs or to, I don't know, kill people, you can do that.
7277000	7284000	You also get a special high rise office or special warehouse that you can base your central command out of.
7284000	7295000	And that'll be coming, I guess, 2016, June 7th. So, I don't know, maybe I'll have to check it out.
7295000	7298000	Alright, going to get sucked back into Grand Theft Auto all over again.
7298000	7301000	I mean, I kind of wish I would, but I haven't yet.
7301000	7312000	Alright, let's talk about DJ Max Encore. Yeah, another DJ Max game, which I believe, didn't we just talk about a PlayStation 4 release of DJ Max last week? I think we did.
7312000	7318000	Now we also have a DJ Max Encore apparently on the way for the Nintendo 3DS.
7318000	7326000	And this is something that's being shown from Rising Star Games at London's MCM Comic Con. They actually have it all set up.
7326000	7334000	What's interesting about it though is it's on a new 3DS. Oh god, I hope this doesn't end up being a new 3DS exclusive or I'll be really upset.
7334000	7340000	But yeah, that's something that's being shown at the London Comic Con that's going on right now.
7340000	7351000	Apparently the top screen is used for the background animation and video playing, but the notes and details are on the lower screen, which you use left, up, and right, and Y, X, and A to hit the notes in the different lanes.
7351000	7354000	So, DJ Max fans, I'm sure will be happy about that.
7354000	7363000	For those of you that are Wii U owners and are big fans of Virtual Console, you'll probably be excited to know that Star Tropics is now available on the Virtual Console.
7363000	7368000	Star Tropics is available for $4.99 on the Wii U. It just came out this past week.
7368000	7378000	I believe they also said that Star Tropics 2, which was a little more rare because it came out so late in the life of the NES. Most people had moved on to Super Nintendo at that point.
7378000	7390000	Star Tropics 2 is forthcoming, but for now you have the original Star Tropics, which is one of the few NES cartridges that I own. I actually picked that up at a flea market not even, what, six months ago.
7390000	7396000	So I love Star Tropics, so I'm very excited to see that that has made its way to the Wii U.
7396000	7400000	Sadly, without the letter that you dip into the water.
7400000	7408000	But, from what I remember of the game's release on the Wii Virtual Console, the code you need is in the online manual, so don't forget to check there.
7408000	7413000	Or, it's pretty much all over the internet. Or, it's 747.
7413000	7421000	Alright, moving on. Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens has announced its season pass.
7421000	7431000	And usually when you hear about season passes, you go, oh god, how much more money am I going to have to dump on this game, paying $100 when the game releases.
7431000	7440000	Well, guess what? There's some good news. Even though, yes, Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens does have a season pass, it's only going to be a $10 season pass.
7440000	7451000	Which is much more realistic and, you know, exciting, I guess, to talk about, because with the $10 season pass will be three level packs and five character packs.
7451000	7462000	If you want to wait and buy it individually, the level packs will be $3 each. So, you know what? Compared to the $50 season passes, the $40 season passes, I'll take it.
7462000	7465000	So there you go. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7465000	7473000	Well, we have some Hello Kitty stuff. Yes, Hello Kitty is coming to Mario Maker.
7473000	7480000	Yeah. I'm going to leave that there.
7480000	7488000	Um, Zelda for Wii U will be playable at the Nintendo New York store during E3 for about 500 people.
7488000	7494000	So, Ronchon, get on it. Play it, take video, let me know how it is. Or send me a plane ticket.
7494000	7508000	And then, um, Mirror's Edge. It's going to be getting a TV series. So, it could be good, it could not be good, but there'll be lots of parkour.
7508000	7517000	And it will, uh, uh, let's see if we've got a date on it. Not a date on it, but hey, we'll see what happens.
7517000	7523000	You know what's good, though, is the, uh, Church's song from the new Mirror's Edge game. It's really, really good.
7523000	7524000	Totally good.
7524000	7526000	So, check that out, if nothing else.
7526000	7536000	Okay, let's get to the foogle question of the week. Um, if I could play the right song for the foogle question of the week.
7536000	7546000	Ah, you gotta love live radio. Mistakes and all, right?
7546000	7558000	Alright, anyway, for our foogle question of the week this week. You know, you've probably heard about the explicit creations of the internet involving Overwatch that Blizzard is trying to shut down.
7558000	7561000	We talked about it here earlier on the show. It was a lot of fun.
7561000	7568000	Ah, this had us thinking about internet creations, but of the G-rated variety, okay, because there's a lot of good stuff that comes from video games.
7568000	7577000	So, what do you think is a great fan creation that has come from a video game? Like a remix, or a fanfic, a parody Twitter.
7577000	7580000	You know, there's tons of fan things that come up from video games. What do you like?
7580000	7585000	So, ah, we're gonna go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities to, ah, get some answers.
7585000	7599000	And Rettertainment starts us off saying, a video game fan video that stands out in my mind is the Dead Fantasy series, as well as Haloid put out by the recently departed Monty Oum.
7599000	7601000	May he rest in peace.
7601000	7610000	Fat Cylon replied over on Twitter saying, there's a video of a male Miranda from Mass Effect boning Edie. Now that's art.
7611000	7616000	Have you seen that one Dark Sakura? Yeah, neither have I. I think I skipped that.
7616000	7621000	Our old pal DMN is out there and said, Orange Lounge Revolution.
7621000	7628000	That was, do you remember that? When they did like a step mania pack that actually had all these inside joke songs from the show.
7628000	7634000	Including, um, God that remix of you just saying rah rah rah rah rah rah over and over like Max 300.
7634000	7635000	Yes, I remember.
7635000	7637000	Somebody actually made DDR steps to that.
7637000	7638000	Yes.
7638000	7639000	Yes.
7639000	7640000	I remember.
7640000	7641000	I remember as well.
7641000	7653000	Ray Jeneater says, I don't know if it qualifies as G-rated since there's the occasional swearing, but my personal favorite fan creation is Red vs. Blue, created by Roosterteeth, used in the Halo games.
7653000	7660000	Each video is short, but each is funny as hell and when watched in order, they tell a fairly decent overarching storyline.
7660000	7664000	That's gone from fan creation to like Media Empire, right?
7664000	7668000	They've had a very long running podcast, if I'm not mistaken, and they're doing all sorts of videos.
7668000	7670000	They have Ruby.
7670000	7673000	Yeah, so they're, they're busy bees over there.
7673000	7679000	So yeah, but interesting to note how like a fan thing can go so big.
7679000	7681000	Very, very good point.
7681000	7688000	William Murderface says, there are a lot of Pokemon ROM hacks that are very well done and completely change the game.
7688000	7694000	If I had to just choose one thing though, it would be the Sonic Twitter, which is hilarious.
7694000	7697000	Is that really a fan thing though? Don't they, isn't that like a verified account?
7697000	7698000	I think it's verified.
7698000	7702000	Yeah, so it's not, I mean, but still it's hilarious. Don't get me wrong.
7702000	7704000	It's so good, it could be a fan one.
7704000	7706000	I guess that's true.
7706000	7708000	So, all right, there it is.
7708000	7713000	We didn't really get any questions or answers on Google Plus this week, but I know it was a, it was a trickier question.
7713000	7717000	But remember, if you want to answer the Fugu question of the week, you should friend us on Facebook.
7717000	7721000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always circle us on Google Plus.
7722000	7724000	Yes, there are still some people on Google Plus.
7724000	7727000	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7727000	7732000	What about you guys? Any fan creations that you guys are fans of from video games?
7734000	7737000	I'll take the easy way out. I'm going to say podcasts.
7737000	7747000	Come on, podcasts. This is a great, you know, not just us, but there's podcasts that really focus on like one particular game series and really dive into like all the specifics about it.
7747000	7753000	So I guess I'm, I'm taking the cheesy answer, but it's true. I'm inspired by the other podcasts I listen to.
7753000	7756000	Darsakra? Loki?
7756000	7764000	I would say for series that maybe are not fully developed are, I'd say directed toward one series.
7764000	7766000	Because, I mean, I really liked VG Cats.
7766000	7773000	The web comic would touch on different video game series and dedicate, you know, panels to it.
7773000	7777000	I mean, you can even look at Homestuck itself as an homage to the entire genre.
7780000	7784000	Yeah, Homestuck is, or not Homestuck, you know what I was thinking, not Homestuck.
7784000	7787000	Homestar Runner.
7787000	7788000	Homestar Runner.
7788000	7789000	Is I'm thinking is kind of like,
7789000	7791000	Homestar Wanna.
7791000	7799000	It was kind of like a parody of like a lot of like internet culture, but then became a game meta.
7799000	7802000	But Homestuck also is sort of the same way too.
7802000	7803000	That's true.
7803000	7806000	Even going back into the old school like DOS games and text adventures.
7806000	7807000	Isn't it trying to become a game too?
7807000	7810000	Yeah, Hive Bents already in production.
7810000	7815000	I was going to say maybe, I don't know, I can't really, there's so many things, a lot of the mods and stuff,
7815000	7820000	but the only thing that came to my mind was dorkly.com.
7820000	7823000	I love their videos with different games.
7823000	7824000	Yeah, yeah.
7824000	7825000	It's a little Mario videos.
7825000	7828000	And Tiger Claw brings up VG Cats.com. We didn't even talk about comics.
7828000	7829000	That's what I just said.
7829000	7831000	Oh, herp derp. Sorry.
7831000	7834000	You can tell I'm multitasking behind the scenes here.
7834000	7838000	So, all right, well, let's move on.
7838000	7843000	Let's get into some more news stories, starting with Loki.
7843000	7844000	All right, let's.
7844000	7846000	So this is kind of neat.
7846000	7848000	They're adding a new mode to Minecraft.
7848000	7855000	And this is kind of, I guess, taking some hints from different mods that people have made on the PC versions.
7855000	7866000	So a lot of the things that are popular on YouTube right now with Minecraft mods are a lot of these Sky Wars or Hunger Games type mods.
7866000	7869000	So this one now is going to be this Minecraft battle.
7869000	7872000	And it's kind of like a Hunger Games type experience.
7872000	7881000	There's going to be maps that, set maps that they have that you can play on that, of course, you can buy more map packs later on for $3.
7882000	7887000	Unfortunately, you can't make your own maps, which is kind of stupid because it is Minecraft.
7887000	7890000	And fuck, I mean, that's kind of what you do.
7890000	7893000	But that's how they're treating it on console.
7893000	7897000	And I guess it makes sense if you want to actually, like, be able to sync up with people to play.
7897000	7900000	You kind of need to be all on the same type of maps.
7900000	7902000	So, whatever.
7902000	7906000	But it is going to be something that's coming to all the console versions in June.
7906000	7911000	And they're going to have a few different maps that are going to be available when it launches.
7911000	7916000	But, yeah, it sounds just like the Hunger Games type maps I've seen.
7916000	7920000	And so, I'm down. I mean, that sounds kind of fun.
7920000	7923000	That'd be kind of fun vault game night type thing.
7923000	7925000	Yeah, I'm curious about this.
7925000	7931000	And I like that they're still breathing life into this game that is, you know, pretty freaking old at this point, to be quite honest.
7932000	7936000	Yeah, kind of funny that you see them selling map packs for Minecraft.
7936000	7939000	Hey, let's get in on that DLC.
7941000	7945000	Alright, well, let's move on to a story about Street Fighter 2.
7945000	7948000	That's right, the old school Street Fighter 2.
7948000	7952000	Well, have you ever, like, watched, really watched the opening of Street Fighter 2?
7952000	7959000	And you might remember that in the very beginning of Street Fighter 2, on the title screen, there's, like, these two people that are fighting each other.
7959000	7963000	One kind of punches the other in the face, then it pans up, you know, Street Fighter 2.
7963000	7966000	We always thought they were two guys from the first Street Fighter.
7966000	7969000	Right, and that's actually a common urban legend.
7969000	7974000	And the fact is, those guys don't actually exist in Street Fighter 2.
7974000	7976000	Like, they didn't use characters that were actually in the game.
7976000	7984000	But, yeah, there's a popular fan fic, or whatever you want to say, is that they were actually characters from the original Street Fighter game.
7984000	7986000	Especially since they look just like them.
7986000	7995000	Well, here's what's interesting. Capcom has confirmed that these two fighters that are in the crowd at the beginning are Max and Scott.
7995000	8001000	And they've actually given them bios with Street Fighter 5 logos.
8001000	8006000	Could these characters be DLC in Street Fighter 5?
8006000	8014000	Kind of going back and revisiting these two characters that have been a part of Street Fighter lore without necessarily being in the game.
8014000	8017000	Here's the barrel. Here's the bottom. We're scraping it.
8017000	8024000	Oh, I thought you were going to actually say, here's the barrel, because there was that one bonus level in Street Fighter 2 where you actually broke barrels.
8024000	8032000	It should be the car. We'll go the whole fighter's megamix round, or, fighter megamix way and just have the actual car and the barrels be.
8032000	8036000	I'm sorry, then again, then we'd be playing Tekken, I guess, at that point.
8036000	8039000	Well, the car and the barrels did come back in Street Fighter 4. I don't know if you remember that.
8039000	8043000	But the whole bonus round in Street Fighter 4 is that. So, there is that, for what it's worth.
8043000	8049000	Kaijuto in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, these guys look too dorky to be real Street Fighters.
8049000	8058000	Well, they can be a little dorky and still be muscley and someone you don't want to punch you in the face.
8058000	8060000	They're more Fight Club than Street Fighter, to be honest.
8060000	8063000	Ah, I like that comparison. That's kind of dorky.
8063000	8066000	Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
8067000	8072000	Well, there's a game that, well, it was an April Fool's joke, really.
8072000	8075000	It was called Catgirl Without Salad.
8075000	8082000	And it was supposed to be, as they said, a game that combines elements from several gaming genres,
8082000	8087000	including puzzler, platformer, shmup, action shooter, adventure strategy, fighting rhythm, arcade horror,
8087000	8090000	tactical RPG, TPS, RTS, and visual novel.
8090000	8092000	Of course, it was an April Fool's joke.
8092000	8102000	But, thanks to the Humble Monthly Bundle, it's going to be a real game and included with it for those who are subscribing.
8102000	8113000	So, yeah, the joke with its massive, well, it's a decent sized fandom, is going to be true, thanks to WayForward and Humble Bundle.
8113000	8119000	So, if you beg for something enough on the internet, sometimes you'll get what you want.
8119000	8122000	Not that that should encourage everybody, but there you go.
8122000	8126000	You know what even gets you what you want quicker? Start a petition.
8126000	8129000	Yeah, go to change.org immediately.
8129000	8131000	Change.org, real change is happening there.
8131000	8132000	That's right, real change.
8132000	8139000	Out of curiosity, do they have statistics on how many changes they've actually made?
8139000	8142000	Has anything actually changed from change.org?
8144000	8146000	Sometimes it's hard to say.
8146000	8153000	Well, I always get change.org confused with the White House petition website, which is technically different.
8153000	8159000	But the White House does respond, I guess they have to or whatever, to anything that gets above.
8159000	8167000	I think they had to change the number. I think it was 25,000 signatures at one point, but they bumped that up because something really stupid got through.
8167000	8168000	Death Star.
8168000	8170000	Was that it? Like, build a Death Star?
8170000	8171000	That was one of them.
8171000	8177000	So something really stupid got through is they bumped it up to 100,000 on the White House site.
8177000	8178000	Alright, that'll stop them.
8178000	8179000	Yeah, that'll teach them.
8179000	8182000	The internet, there's not 100,000 people on here.
8182000	8183000	Yeah.
8183000	8187000	Alright, let's move on, Loki.
8187000	8196000	So, kind of going back to how we were talking about rumors about new Microsoft consoles, here's something that maybe has been leaked out by the ESA.
8197000	8204000	According to E3 2016's official website, there is a category for Xbox One virtual reality.
8204000	8209000	But what? They haven't talked about Xbox One virtual reality. That's not a thing.
8209000	8218000	Could it be now? Could it be that this is an announcement? Or could it be just someone boned it so bad that they think that the Sony system is an Xbox One?
8218000	8219000	Who knows?
8220000	8224000	To be fair, a lot of people have called HoloLens VR.
8224000	8229000	People have called it that, even though it's augmented reality and there's a difference.
8229000	8239000	But let's be real, most people that aren't necessarily tech-oriented, although you would expect E3 would be tech-oriented, but considering they use Alexa rankings to...
8239000	8241000	You know what? I'm not going to go down that road.
8241000	8250000	But, yeah, I mean, I think it's more that mistake, that somebody is just simply thinking HoloLens is VR when it's really not.
8250000	8256000	I don't think so, but included on the list of companies, there's actually some third-party companies that are listed under that category.
8256000	8264000	Maximum Games, Rebellion, Readily Information Company, which that's a stupid name, and 3D Rudder.
8264000	8268000	So, of course, Maximum Games, they have the farming simulator and WRC series.
8268000	8275000	Rebellion is the team behind Battlezone 98 Redux and the Sniper Elite series.
8275000	8280000	And then 3D Rudder, who the fuck knows that? It's a controller for your feet.
8280000	8286000	I would expect that maybe Microsoft is going to step it up with the HoloLens, that maybe that's something...
8286000	8289000	No. I think they're going to just add Oculus support.
8289000	8293000	It's ready to go. HoloLens is not ready to go.
8293000	8298000	HoloLens, also on top of that, is fucking expensive. Well, the dev kit's fucking expensive.
8298000	8303000	So, I don't think that HoloLens is going to be it. I think that it's going to be Oculus support.
8303000	8309000	That would certainly be another feather in Oculus' cap that it would work on Xbox and PC.
8309000	8319000	Right. And, I mean, yeah, definitely that does, for me, that's like, oh, hey, I could use this on a console that I don't own, or PC I don't own that runs the spec.
8320000	8327000	So, I mean, it's still, though, if I do end up having one of those, then that's kind of a nice thing. I don't know.
8327000	8337000	A HoloLens would be nice at some point, once it gets down to the price point that I want it to be, and it's actually operating how they show the videos show it.
8337000	8340000	Not that little, like, tiny little window inside it.
8341000	8347000	All right. Well, there are more websites out there with more names than you might be used to.
8347000	8352000	I think everybody's kind of used to the fact that, like, almost everything out there is dot com, dot com.
8352000	8360000	Dot com is, like, synonymous with the web, even though surely there are sites that are dot net, dot gov, dot org.
8360000	8365000	You know, we're used to a little bit some of these other ones, but there is even more out there now.
8365000	8372000	The people that run these different top-level domains and so forth, this got opened up some time ago, right?
8372000	8376000	And now you have more stuff. Like, I think a controversial one was dot xxx, right?
8376000	8378000	Well, that was a long time ago.
8378000	8385000	It was a little while ago, but they just recently opened up to the public dot game.
8385000	8391000	It joined some other custom domains that have just, that have been opening up the past couple of years.
8391000	8396000	Dot beer, dot NYC, and so forth. So, dot game is now available.
8396000	8401000	Now, we were joking a little bit about this with YYR while he was here because he was actually looking up,
8401000	8404000	oh, how much would it cost me to register YYR dot game?
8404000	8409000	Because usually, you can get a domain, like a dot com, you can get a dot com up and running for, like,
8409000	8410000	Ten bucks.
8410000	8414000	Yeah, ten bucks, fifty bucks tops, right? Depending on what site you go through.
8414000	8420000	Okay, for Aaron to get YYR dot game was, like, sixteen hundred dollars.
8420000	8426000	Because I guess dot game, well, A, that's a three letter domain name, so it's considered premium.
8426000	8429000	And dot game is considered some type of premium domain.
8429000	8436000	So, even for him to get YYR games dot game was, like, four hundred bucks.
8436000	8441000	Even to get a site like you just lost the dot game, which we have joked about getting,
8441000	8445000	which now some asshole who hears this is going to get it, who has more money than we do.
8445000	8450000	But that site's going to set you back three hundred fifty, four hundred bucks, depending on what service you go through.
8450000	8453000	So, I mean, these are premium prices for this.
8453000	8459000	Apparently, early access opened up last week, and almost every major studio,
8459000	8467000	Nintendo, EA, Microsoft, Blizzard, Starcraft, Diablo for those Blizzard properties and so forth,
8467000	8470000	have all been snatched up as part of this.
8470000	8478000	And I have to admit, I'm kind of confused why, because I don't think a website dot game,
8478000	8485000	like, you know, go to Blizzard dot game, I don't think it really has that same effect that dot com has in our culture.
8485000	8490000	We're not at that level where we just hear dot and we think, oh, it's the web.
8490000	8492000	You know what I mean? Does that make sense?
8492000	8493000	Yeah.
8493000	8498000	I kind of think, like, if we were to go out, oh, our website is Nintendo dot game, like, people are...
8498000	8501000	Thank god they don't have emojis in URLs yet.
8503000	8504000	Dot poop emoji.
8504000	8506000	Yeah, it's not poop emoji.
8506000	8509000	Hey, Bobby, can we register vog dot poop emoji?
8514000	8518000	But enough people out there have a hard time remembering that if you want the White House's website,
8518000	8524000	you got to go to whitehouse dot gov, because if you go to whitehouse dot com, I think it's porn, or it's something else now.
8524000	8525000	It used to be, I think.
8525000	8527000	It used to be porn, but I think it's something else now.
8527000	8532000	So, I mean, you know, people have a hard time remembering that type of stuff.
8532000	8533000	Let's find out.
8535000	8542000	Brad from Pod Culture says, pod culture started as a dot net until I was finally able to snatch it when a squatter let it lapse.
8542000	8543000	Yeah.
8543000	8547000	Brad from Pod Culture also suggests buying just tooka dot poop.
8547000	8548000	Why not?
8549000	8552000	Yeah, whitehouse dot com, it goes to nothing.
8553000	8554000	Just a squatter website now, right?
8554000	8559000	Just basically a page with the White House on it, but yeah, it doesn't go anywhere.
8559000	8562000	It's not the actual White House website, so.
8563000	8566000	Redertainment in Chat says, why are they selling it? Because people will buy it.
8566000	8568000	Yeah, and these websites aren't cheap.
8568000	8575000	I almost feel like Nintendo and all these companies kind of got fleeced out of 300 bucks a pop for these domains.
8575000	8576000	Did they actually register that?
8576000	8577000	Yeah.
8577000	8579000	I'm never using that URL. I'm just saying.
8579000	8582000	I know, because everybody's so used to dot com.
8582000	8587000	Nintendo has Nintendo dot com. It's just, I don't know, it just seems a little weird.
8588000	8590000	I have darksakura.com and I'm happy with that.
8590000	8598000	Yeah, I mean, you know, unfortunately, I don't think we were able to get vog.com or even, I don't know if we have vog.net.
8598000	8604000	I don't think we do, because obviously a three letter domain is going to be very, very, very hard to get.
8604000	8610000	So, but I believe there is now a dot network, so I don't know.
8610000	8611000	But you know, you know.
8611000	8612000	Vog.net is for sale.
8612000	8614000	Yeah, gee, how convenient.
8614000	8621000	But I think, you know, we've just marketed it as vognetwork.com and people kind of get that if you say it enough times.
8621000	8628000	You know, we don't have to necessarily have all these other website names except for, because of Travis Donovan,
8628000	8633000	when Understadation Live, rest in peace, was on the air, he always used to say the vognetwork.com.
8633000	8638000	And so Bobby actually went and registered the vognetwork.com.
8638000	8640000	But I think he finally let that lapse.
8640000	8643000	So, alright.
8643000	8646000	Anyway, we're going to move on.
8646000	8650000	I don't think we'll be registering any game domains anytime soon.
8650000	8652000	Not at that price.
8652000	8655000	Maybe the price will come down once the new car smell wears off, I don't know.
8655000	8658000	But certainly not now, that's for damn sure.
8658000	8661000	We are going to get to the mailbag.
8661000	8664000	Or we would get to the mailbag.
8665000	8668000	But, unfortunately...
8668000	8670000	I think it's dead.
8670000	8673000	Yeah, DarkSakura went into the mailbag and found that it's...
8673000	8674000	I'm checking it again.
8674000	8676000	Empty.
8676000	8678000	Unless YYR made good on his threat to email us.
8678000	8679000	Yeah, there's one.
8679000	8681000	Oh, is it from YYR?
8681000	8682000	Yeah.
8682000	8683000	Of course it is.
8683000	8685000	Hello, LR, this is me, talking to myself.
8685000	8686000	Sort of.
8686000	8688000	Hugs and kisses, Aaron YYR.
8688000	8690000	Thank you.
8690000	8691000	Thank you.
8691000	8694000	Yeah, he overheard me saying earlier in the show the mailbox was empty.
8694000	8695000	So I think he is.
8695000	8696000	Now it's empty.
8696000	8697000	There it is.

8715000	8716000	No.
8716000	8718000	They do that anyway.
8718000	8721000	I thought you were going to say like starring your favorite hosts and I'm like...
8721000	8722000	No!
8722000	8723000	No, that's awkward.
8723000	8724000	Do you know?
8724000	8725000	Do not.
8725000	8726000	Do you know?
8726000	8727000	Do you remember Evan?
8727000	8729000	Of course I do.
8729000	8730000	He wrote one.
8730000	8731000	What?
8731000	8740000	I asked very, very, very well worded and to the point, don't put me in it.
8740000	8745000	Here's what you do to those people that are making those pornographic game fan videos
8745000	8747000	or whatever.
8747000	8752000	You just take the people that are making them and you put them in a pornographic fan video
8752000	8753000	that CG created.
8753000	8755000	There you go.
8755000	8757000	How very meta.
8757000	8758000	Alright, so...
8758000	8759000	Eye for an eye.
8759000	8760000	Send us your...
8760000	8761000	Send us your mails.
8761000	8764000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8764000	8766000	Well, since we didn't get any emails this week, what a...
8766000	8769000	Well, I mean, we got one, but come on, he was here.
8769000	8773000	We have a real good excuse to do the FUs of the Week.
8777000	8796000	FU to those delicious, delicious monstrosities in that bag over there.
8796000	8798000	Oh my God.
8798000	8800000	Yell me out.
8800000	8802000	Also FU to having to work tomorrow.
8802000	8810000	Because an FU to getting E6000 stitchless all over my fingers and having to unglue my
8810000	8811000	fingers.
8811000	8814000	But it's all worth it for the purse.
8814000	8816000	No one can see that.
8816000	8821000	Well, but you will be planning on walking into a club purse first eventually at some
8821000	8822000	point.
8822000	8823000	Yes, I know.
8823000	8824000	Alright, moving on.
8824000	8825000	Loki.
8825000	8827000	FU not having air conditioning for a week.
8827000	8831000	Especially now it's getting hot, so we are starting to notice it.
8831000	8835000	There's no real way to cool off the house, so that kind of sucks.
8835000	8839000	But, hopefully, we've got it narrowed down to two people that are going to do the work,
8839000	8843000	and they'll do it on Wednesday, so it won't be much longer.
8843000	8849000	And then FU to these Final Fantasy XI private servers, which are a pain in the ass to get
8849000	8850000	the fucking work.
8850000	8851000	It's just...
8852000	8854000	I think partially it's Windows 10's problem.
8854000	8859000	Where it's firewalls like, I know you told me to let them go through, but I'm making
8859000	8860000	my own decisions.
8860000	8861000	I'm the grown up here.
8861000	8866000	By the way, just as punishment, I'm going to upgrade your computer again.
8866000	8871000	I don't, you know, to be honest, I have no problems with Windows 10 aside from the updates
8871000	8873000	where they're just like, eh, we're doing it.
8873000	8878000	You know, hey, we forced our way onto your system, although I did allow them to.
8878000	8883000	Because I had Windows 8, and I consider anything other than Windows 8 much better.
8883000	8886000	But, yeah, their updates, it's like, hey, we're just going to do it.
8886000	8887000	Oh, hey, you're in the middle of something?
8887000	8889000	We're fucking updating.
8892000	8894000	Alright, my FU of the week.
8894000	8896000	I don't really have anything.
8896000	8898000	I mean, I got birthday presents last night.
8898000	8899000	How can I be upset?
8899000	8902000	And I've had a pretty kickass weekend, so I can't really be sad.
8902000	8908000	I guess my FU of the week would go to the fact that I really need to buckle down and dye it.
8908000	8911000	Like Dark Sakura, I want to fit into a core set by Dragon Con.
8911000	8916000	But, okay, well, maybe it's not really like an actual core set.
8916000	8920000	But there might be cosplay I want to do, and I really need to get rid of a little bit of this dad bod.
8920000	8926000	And it is really hard when somebody puts a creme brulee cheesecake slice right down in front of you.
8926000	8928000	I mean, just, it's hard.
8928000	8929000	The struggle is real.
8930000	8932000	And then now we have donut muffins.
8935000	8936000	Oh well.
8938000	8944000	Let's get to a couple more stories, and then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8944000	8947000	Or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
8947000	8949000	But first, Loki!
8949000	8951000	Alright, so this is kind of cool.
8951000	8956000	Something I was hoping that it would actually finally come out at some point.
8956000	8957000	And it is!
8957000	8960000	Well, at 4, the console mods are coming very soon.
8960000	8964000	In fact, Xbox Ones are going to be available on May 31st.
8964000	8969000	And they've already got a cool list of mods that are going to be supported by it, including...
8971000	8976000	Well, there's one that you can actually craft cats, and then there's one, apparently, that you can also eat cats.
8976000	8979000	So, it's both.
8979000	8982000	But yeah, lots of cool mods that you can actually add to the game.
8982000	8985000	Apparently, though, there's a size limit for the mods you can download.
8985000	8987000	It's restricted to 2GB.
8987000	8991000	And that extends to all mods, even if they're not currently enabled.
8994000	8996000	So, lots of cool mods.
8996000	9000000	I think a lot of them aren't going to be that big in size, but it's nice to see that this is going to be available.
9000000	9005000	And I'm very excited once PlayStation 4s are going to be available, which is going to be at the end of June.
9005000	9009000	So, that'll probably get me to go back to Fallout, for sure.
9009000	9012000	I know Alan loves his mods, and he's been playing Fallout 4.
9012000	9018000	But console mods! I mean, come on, this hasn't been done since Unreal 3?
9018000	9026000	Or, yeah, Unreal 3, I think, on PlayStation 3, where they enabled console mods on the PlayStation.
9026000	9032000	I will say that I have managed to mod an Xbox 360 version of Mass Effect.
9032000	9039000	Not add content, at least, but be able to use content hidden in-game using my save file converter.
9039000	9041000	Save file modding, right?
9041000	9049000	Yeah. But it's all stuff that was just code hidden, but nothing to add to it.
9049000	9052000	Still poking around where you're not supposed to be.
9052000	9055000	Well, some people like when you poke them.
9055000	9058000	You can turn dog meat into a feline companion. That's one of the mods.
9058000	9060000	You can turn it into a cat.
9060000	9062000	This would be called cat gut.
9064000	9066000	Alright, well, one more story for you guys.
9066000	9070000	Who's excited about the Warcraft movie coming out on June 10th, I believe, here?
9070000	9071000	A tenth of me is.
9071000	9077000	So, here's the deal. Like a lot of big movies, the movie has already come out overseas.
9077000	9081000	It's already playing in Europe and some other parts of the world.
9081000	9085000	And with that means some of the critic scores are coming in, and guess what?
9085000	9090000	It's getting dragged. It's not doing very well with the critics.
9090000	9094000	Apparently, yeah, the critics are not.
9094000	9096000	Do the critics just not understand it?
9096000	9098000	I'm thinking it's something like that. Let's see.
9098000	9103000	I do want to point out these are not necessarily critics in the UK.
9103000	9108000	Technically, it's May 30th when it opens, but with the time difference, I think it actually is May 30th over there now.
9108000	9110000	So, some of these are from the US.
9110000	9114000	But The Wrap gave it one star saying,
9114000	9118000	Imagine Battlefield Earth, right there, that's a slam,
9118000	9122000	without the verve and you get this sludgy, tedious fantasy adventure,
9122000	9127000	a fun-starved dud that's not even unintentionally hilarious.
9129000	9132000	Let's see, Variety, you guys know that publication, right?
9132000	9136000	Let's see, talking about all the extensive CGI and visual.
9137000	9141000	It's dispiriting to think about the time, energy, planning, and precision that went into Warcraft
9141000	9146000	when the final product brings to mind those animated advertisements for iPhone games.
9148000	9152000	Ouch! And the movie doesn't even have Mariah Carey.
9153000	9154000	I added that part in.
9154000	9157000	Now, The Guardian gave it two stars saying,
9157000	9160000	There's a lot going on and yet we're never quite engaged with it.
9160000	9164000	In Lord of the Rings, we have the Shire, The Hobbit's idyllic pastoral realm
9164000	9166000	as an image of what everyone was fighting for.
9166000	9172000	Here, we barely see Azeroth outside the Royal Castles and the Wizard's Towers in epic battlegrounds.
9172000	9175000	So, apparently it's not doing so well.
9175000	9177000	But, critics!
9179000	9182000	Do they really know what they're talking about? Not necessarily.
9182000	9193000	But, I think we're all setting the bar pretty low right now if we're gonna spend the money to go see the movie.
9194000	9195000	We'll see.
9195000	9198000	Alright, what do you guys think? Should we open up the Skype line? I think we should.
9198000	9202000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
9202000	9204000	Tigerclaw actually mentions here,
9204000	9207000	Obviously, these critics have never played the games.
9207000	9213000	To be fair, if the movie is to be successful, they will need to lure in an audience that has never played the games.
9213000	9216000	There's only so many people that have played the games.
9217000	9223000	Which is what? Okay, granted, it's 13 million worldwide, but, you know, at 15 bucks a movie ticket.
9223000	9224000	Okay, well, I mean...
9224000	9225000	It's still only gonna be less than 200 million.
9225000	9230000	That's cool, and 13 million people worldwide, then I hope that those people actually go see the movie then.
9230000	9233000	If that's what they're banking on it to be successful.
9233000	9235000	Which they may or may not. We'll see.
9235000	9239000	Again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
9239000	9242000	And, we're getting a call right now, so let's get to it.
9242000	9244000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9244000	9246000	Hi, this is Ragenator.
9246000	9250000	Hi, Ragenator. How's it going? Nice mod you're using to call us, by the way.
9250000	9254000	Where Ragenator is appearing as a dragon, which I've seen that thing on...
9254000	9257000	Tiger Claw uses that, too. I've seen that on Steam.
9257000	9262000	Yeah, it's Facebook, actually. It's one of the few apps I've bought through there.
9262000	9265000	Yeah, it's cute. What's on your mind tonight?
9265000	9268000	Just a totally random question.
9268000	9276000	Now, I can't speak for the rest of the audience, but I know at least the three of you tend to hit...
9277000	9286000	...play and buy games through multiple storefronts on PC, be it Steam, obviously, Origin, or what have you.
9286000	9296000	And, now that being said, I think the two most popular ones out there right now happen to be Steam, obviously, and God.
9296000	9307000	And one thing I've noticed is that there's a certain amount of overlapping what games are being sold on both platforms.
9307000	9317000	And I was wondering, do the three of you have a hard time picking which platform to buy the games on for one reason or another?
9317000	9327000	To give an example, Steam is notorious for the sales, and they also make it easy to download and install mods.
9327000	9336000	Whereas, GOG tends to have digital access and the Steam versions of a given game may not necessarily have.
9336000	9339000	Like, for example, soundtracks and whatnot.
9339000	9344000	Yeah, I gotta admit, it really depends on what's being sold in the package.
9344000	9347000	That's a big part of it and, of course, the price is big as well.
9347000	9354000	But sometimes, I don't always necessarily see Steam as a store as I necessarily see it as a method of delivery.
9354000	9360000	And what I mean by that is that Steam, in some ways, is trying to be a console experience on your PC.
9360000	9363000	If you boot up big picture mode, that's literally what it is.
9363000	9366000	It's a console on your PC. That's what Steam is in a lot of ways.
9366000	9374000	And the reason why I say that is that I also find one store that I use an awful lot that you didn't name is the Humble Store and the Humble Bundle, right?
9374000	9377000	And all that. But what does Humble really give you?
9377000	9382000	Steam keys! And what do other places give you, like Amazon and stuff, where I've also bought games?
9382000	9389000	Steam keys! So it's interesting that Steam is not always the store as it necessarily is a method of delivery.
9389000	9400000	So I think because Steam has penetrated, like, you know, you don't buy GOG codes on Steam, on Humble Bundle or any of that stuff.
9400000	9411000	I think because Steam has managed to become not just a store but a delivery mechanism, I think that's what's kind of put it out in the lead above some of these other options.
9411000	9417000	But, I mean, I've used others in the past as well. I had used Desura at one point before, well, we all know what happened there.
9417000	9424000	But I suppose itch.io, or as I call it, itch.io, is starting to fill some of that void a little bit.
9424000	9431000	And then Origin as well, which, you know, I know that website got a lot of shit in the early years, and rightfully so.
9431000	9435000	But Steam got a lot of shit in the early years, and rightfully so.
9435000	9444000	And Origin's come a long way. I know I'm going to have to suck it up and deal with it if I want to get Mass Effect Andromeda on the PC.
9444000	9456000	Which seems like, I kind of don't know where I'm at with the Mass Effect thing because, like, I kind of want to get it on PlayStation 4 because all of my, well, PlayStation 4 is kind of my quote-unquote main console now.
9456000	9462000	But I also have an Xbox One, and I did play Mass Effect, the original trilogy, on Xbox 360.
9462000	9469000	I know it's not going to import my saves, so I don't know. I really don't know. I have a lot of questions to answer.
9469000	9476000	But I know that if I do want to get it on PC for the multiplayer, I think that's what's going to come down to. Where are all my friends from multiplayer?
9476000	9479000	I'll probably end up having to use Origin.
9480000	9487000	Now, as a follow-up to what you were saying before, this is kind of a half-question, half-point.
9487000	9500000	But could you make the argument that Cup of Bowls is not really a store per se, because saying that it's a store kind of implies that they're selling you something.
9500000	9514000	They're not so much selling you something as they are taking donations for charity and in turn giving you a thank-you gift in the form of digital books or digital game codes or what have you.
9514000	9519000	Rage, if we were only considering the side of it that did the bundles, then I would agree.
9519000	9525000	But don't forget that Humble also has a storefront, and you can pick and choose the individual games that you want.
9525000	9530000	And they run their own sales, and I'm giving Humble Bundle my credit card information when I process that.
9530000	9537000	So I think in that regard, and I do think they still give like 10% to charity or something like that.
9537000	9544000	So I mean, yes, there's that going on, but they do have that more traditional storefront in addition to the bundles. Don't forget about that.
9544000	9556000	Yeah, true. By getting back to my initial question, the best overwhelming majority of my games happen to be through games.
9556000	9573000	God knows my library is kind of all ridiculous, but at the same time, I never noticed that game X, Y, or Z happens to be on good old games.
9573000	9588000	Even though I already have it on Steam, if I see such and such a game, like let's say just a pixel thing off the top of my head, let's say Out of World Games Odyssey,
9588000	9596000	I notice that, hey, you know what, this version comes with wallpapers and the soundtrack.
9596000	9606000	I love video game soundtracks, even though I already got this on Steam, might as well get the God version just for shits and giggles.
9606000	9610000	Especially if it's only a couple bucks. It makes it very easy to justify that sort of thing.
9610000	9629000	Exactly. Not only that, but since it's VR on a free, God forbid, my computer takes a nose dye for whatever reason, and I have all my God games backed up onto external hydride, not so much of a problem, you know?
9629000	9639000	Yeah. Hey, one other thing I want to throw out there before we let you go, speaking of storefronts, one that I didn't mention yet, but I think is definitely worth mentioning is the Windows 10 store.
9639000	9650000	You know, and as much as we might kind of snicker a little bit at that, you know, because a lot of the games that are being sold on the storefront right now are very similar to what you'd get on your iPhone and all this stuff.
9650000	9658000	I think it's worth mentioning, why does Microsoft so badly want to upgrade you to Windows 10 for Windows 7 and 8 and all this stuff?
9658000	9664000	Because that store is injected so easily right into, as part of the seamless desktop experience.
9664000	9672000	And if you are a Microsoft gamer on Xbox to begin with, a lot of those games that are in the storefront do offer those achievements and some of those other perks.
9672000	9684000	And let's not forget, Microsoft does own Minecraft, so there's that whole thing as well, and that's going to be a big game, and that is something that you can get on the Windows 10 store or what have you.
9684000	9697000	Not to be a party pooper on Microsoft, but you would think that after their failed attempt with games for Windows Live, they were willing to lessen.
9697000	9708000	I mean, you know, granted, like you said, people kind of poo-pooed on Steam when they first came out, but people were kind of going to love Steam.
9708000	9715000	I mean, that's pretty much the 800-pound grill in the room, you know?
9715000	9723000	I mean, it's going to be kind of hard for most stores to compete with Valve and their Steam sales.
9723000	9736000	I'd kind of liken it to competitors of Nintendo, like Sega, when it comes to handhelds, way back in the day.
9736000	9751000	The original Game Boy was the 800-pound grill in terms of handhelds, and most other handhelds kind of flopped, whether you're talking about the Game Gear or the Neo Geo Pocket, so on and so forth.
9751000	9757000	Well, some people have a lot of love for that, but I understand. It's very hard to compete with Nintendo in that handheld space.
9757000	9761000	But anyway, Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in about one more call before we wrap up tonight, okay?
9761000	9762000	But thanks for calling.
9762000	9763000	Sure, have a good night.
9763000	9764000	Take care of you too.
9764000	9771000	1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Checking in with Loki real quick to see if there's any last-minute stories.
9772000	9783000	Yeah, I guess there was a story about Sonic the Hedgehog, so they had that whole Sonic the Hedgehog mobile game, the Sonic Runner or whatever, and it's being shut down.
9783000	9785000	I guess it just didn't do so well for them.
9785000	9786000	Really?
9786000	9797000	Yeah, Sonic Runners is going to be discontinuing the premium currency or sales, and then the game will close down on July 27th.
9798000	9806000	Wow, okay. I remember checking that out when it first came out. I didn't think it was bad. It does kind of surprise me that they'll just shut these things down.
9806000	9813000	I mean, even if there's like only a hundred people playing it, there might still be money to be made there, but I guess if they're having to operate a server, maybe...
9813000	9818000	Was it Sega that actually put the game out, or was it like somebody... I guess it was from Sonic Team.
9818000	9819000	Yeah, it was.
9819000	9823000	I was going to say, if it's licensed, maybe they were shutting it down because they didn't want to, you know, pay the licensing again.
9823000	9824000	Yeah.
9824000	9825000	Maybe they weren't making enough money, but...
9825000	9826000	That would make sense.
9826000	9831000	If they made it, then I don't know. What's the point in shutting something down if you can possibly make some money from it?
9831000	9839000	That would make sense. One last call for calls. Orange Lounge Radio. I'll loan a word on Skype. I know our listenership is a little lower tonight because of the Memorial Day weekend. Some people are out.
9839000	9851000	Some people are watching Game of Thrones, but I do want to remind those that are listening on the podcast feed, you know, we love to hear from new people and people we didn't even know were out there listening to the show.
9851000	9861000	Please don't be afraid to lend your voice to the show. It can be as simple as a tweet. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. I know we don't always read every single tweet here on the show, but we do read them all for sure.
9861000	9868000	So you can always just let us know you're out there. We appreciate it for sure. Anything else you want to mention in the last minute stories here before we start to wrap up?
9868000	9869000	No.
9869000	9879000	No? Alright. Check it in just one more time to see if we get any calls. 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9879000	9884000	I do want to thank Y-Y-R for being here tonight. That was really awesome to have him out here from the East Coast.
9884000	9892000	And at some point, he wanted to play this game with me on the iPhone. We didn't get around to being able to do it tonight, but I thought I'd give it a shout out anyway because it's called Space Team.
9892000	9901000	And I've never played this, but I guess this is one of those games where you have to all kind of yell at each other to coordinate. You have to play it with at least two people, and I think up to four people.
9901000	9910000	And you have to coordinate all in one room what the others are doing. And that whole thing, it's like Bomb Corp or Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. One of those types of games.
9910000	9917000	Or there's that other one, the Starship game that people play at cons in real life in a big room or something like that.
9917000	9920000	I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head. Maybe somebody in chat will save me there.
9920000	9926000	But yeah, I guess this game's like that. And he had me download it, but sadly, just with time, we didn't really get around to playing it.
9926000	9928000	And Space Team it is.
9928000	9933000	Alright. Well, Artemis. Is that the name of a tiger claw? That sounds right.
9933000	9938000	Anyway, it looks like nobody else is trying to call, so there it is. I guess we will close up the Skype line.
9938000	9944000	But if you want to email us for a future episode, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9944000	9947000	Meanwhile, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
9947000	9951000	I just want to say real quick though, as always, thank you for listening to OrangeLoungeRadio.
9951000	9955000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the program, just tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.
9955000	9960000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't let the voices out there if you're not going to use them.
9960000	9965000	Meanwhile, final thoughts. Dark Sakura, I know you got to go. You got to work early in the morning.
9965000	9968000	And not just that. The caffeine headache is kicked in.
9968000	9970000	Oh, yuck, yuck, yuck. Well, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
9970000	9978000	I retract what I said to Kaijudo because I thought you were trolling and I thought it was a very awful troll.
9978000	9982000	And you really just haven't looked into the things that you love.
9982000	9988000	If you love something, research it. That's my advice to you. Second, ow.
9988000	9992000	If you love something, fall down a wiki-hole for it.
9992000	9995000	All right. Loki, your final thought tonight?
9996000	10001000	I got to probably pick up some fans on the way home. Apparently it's like 85 in my house right now.
10001000	10003000	Oh, God. Oh, you poor thing.
10003000	10005000	Do you know the ice bucket trick?
10005000	10008000	Yeah, I tried the ice bucket trick. It does not work.
10008000	10011000	I know it's like next to nothing, but do you want to take that fan?
10011000	10014000	No, it's cool. I'm just going to pick up my own house fan.
10014000	10015000	All right, I tried.
10015000	10017000	Box fan in a window. Got us through a summer.
10017000	10024000	Box fan in a window. My final thought for the night is I have this really bad feeling I'm finally going to get suckered into getting Overwatch.
10024000	10029000	Now that I have a computer. Now that I have a computer that can run it really, really well.
10029000	10033000	And just like all my friends on Twitter are playing it.
10033000	10035000	I'll give you this contention then.
10035000	10036000	What?
10036000	10039000	Wait for the Steam sale. Because there is a Steam sale coming at the end of June.
10039000	10042000	They don't sell Overwatch on Steam. It's a Blizzard game.
10044000	10047000	Oh, that makes me think of another answer to Rage Nator's question.
10047000	10049000	The battle net is another place I get games.
10049000	10050000	Well, you're fucked.
10050000	10052000	Yep, I'm fucked.
10053000	10056000	All right. That's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
10056000	10059000	We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.
10059000	10061000	Have a great Memorial Day weekend.
10061000	10064000	Those of you in the States that have one more day off of work.
10064000	10069000	Thank you again to the Armed Forces and remember the reason why we have this holiday.
10069000	10074000	And a big thank you to everybody out there listening and helping the show and supporting it.
