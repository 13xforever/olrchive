7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, the list of generic top-level domains will soon include .game and .games.
18000	22000	You may soon be able to get Bungie Ferretossings from yyr.games slash bungieferretossing.
22000	27000	There's more tangible news to come, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	34000	Did he pay for that spot? He paid for that spot, right?
34000	38000	Oh hey, hi everybody, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 640 of our show for May the 8th of 2016.
46000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.
50000	55000	And joining me in studio, welcome back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55000	59000	Sup? Hey, how you doing? Welcome back. How you feeling?
59000	63000	I feel a lot better, now that I no longer have viral laryngitis.
63000	68000	Like, you can't go be around people, because you're contagious.
68000	73000	Like, you realize I've already been out shopping on my birthday. You have a disease.
73000	80000	So, I just, I said, okay sure, I was like out two days of work, and I missed money.
80000	88000	My paycheck was dismal. But hey, I went to Karthy Circle and got the World of Color three course meal deal.
88000	91000	And you made Dan pay for it, because it's your birthday.
91000	93000	Comes out the same place.
93000	99000	And then we also, though, I got to try wine from the Lassiter Vineyard. It's pretty damn good.
99000	105000	I was going to ask, how was Disneyland? Although, you were technically at Disneyland, but it's all still Disneyland to me.
105000	108000	I was at California Avenger. It was really fun.
108000	111000	If you went to Hollywood Studios, I would still say you were at Disney World.
111000	113000	We didn't really ride much, though. We just sort of hung out.
113000	114000	Really?
114000	120000	Because it was Bats Day and Dapper Day, so I was all bat-stout. It looked like I was dressed like high school.
120000	126000	You know, the only thing I was missing was like a huge flannel shirt to wear over my all black ensemble.
126000	129000	You know, I had raccoon eyes going on, because it was all black makeup.
129000	130000	Ah, fun.
130000	131000	But yeah, it was pretty cool.
131000	135000	Now, I'm surprised you didn't wait and go this weekend when you could have done DragCon as well.
135000	137000	Although, I don't know if Dan would have had a great time at DragCon.
137000	141000	Dan probably wouldn't have had a great time at DragCon. He barely.
141000	149000	The only thing that I think Dan knows from all of my Drag Race watching and YouTubing is, really, Queen?
149000	153000	Because he thinks Bianca Del Rio is funny.
153000	154000	Bianca Del Rio is funny.
154000	155000	I know.
155000	157000	You don't have to be any-
157000	160000	She has inspired my speed dial of spite.
161000	168000	Alright, well hopefully we'll keep the gaming companies away from your speed dial of spite later on.
168000	174000	I must point this out. Victoria just posted a picture of Dax Exclamation Point, who is not dressed as Storm.
174000	175000	She's dressed as Emma Frost.
175000	176000	Oh.
176000	177000	Pretty nice.
177000	184000	And for those that don't know, because I imagine there might be a lot of video game people that find this podcast that really don't know a lot about Drag Queens.
184000	185000	The people in the comics.
185000	188000	Well that's true, but Dax Exclamation Point is a drag queen who is a big nerd.
188000	191000	And specializes in Storm cosplay.
191000	192000	Yes.
192000	193000	Like every iteration of Storm.
193000	194000	Mm-hmm.
194000	195000	That bitch is done.
195000	199000	And now she's busting out Emma Frost. It's like, we didn't expect that.
199000	200000	Alright.
200000	201000	It's okay.
201000	205000	So, did you get to play any games on your trip when you were-
205000	207000	I left my DS in the hotel room.
207000	210000	Okay, I was gonna say Disneyland has arcade games and-
210000	211000	Not anymore.
211000	212000	Toy Story is-
213000	215000	We did Toy Story. I beat Dan.
215000	216000	Oh, that's important.
216000	219000	Because I had like a 47% accuracy and he had a 12.
219000	220000	Mm-hmm.
222000	230000	Didn't they have a phone game at one point where like if your GPS showed that you were at Disney California Adventure in front of the ride or something, you got like a bonus unlock?
230000	231000	I seem to remember that was a thing.
231000	232000	That-
232000	233000	I don't know.
233000	235000	It was something. I played Ingress at Disneyland.
235000	236000	Of course.
236000	237000	And-
237000	238000	Because everything's a portal at Disneyland.
238000	241000	There are a fuckload of portals. Oh my god.
241000	242000	And then, um-
242000	245000	Just think of all the Pokemon you'll be able to get there soon when Pokemon GO comes out.
245000	246000	I know.
246000	258000	Um, and then, um, I did play some Animal Crossing and then I actually have beat Danganronpa and I'm on Danganronpa 2 or as it was in Japan, Super Danganronpa 2.
258000	259000	Well, don't give away your gaming week just yet.
259000	260000	Oh.
260000	261000	We gotta, we gotta still introduce-
261000	262000	Oh, I forgot.
262000	263000	Over here.
263000	264000	She's just-
264000	268000	After a couple weeks off, you kind of forgot how this show works. That's okay.
268000	272000	Alright. No one can see my favorite accessory now.
272000	273000	Your new fan that you have.
273000	277000	Uh, you, uh, you do remember we take calls and everything at the end of the show, right?
277000	279000	You do emails? Do you remember that you read emails?
279000	281000	Who does email anymore?
281000	285000	So, 2002.
285000	289000	Alright, say hello everybody over there to Tech Master Loki.
289000	290000	Hello.
290000	291000	How are you doing?
291000	292000	Fine.
292000	293000	Hello.
293000	297000	Um, I don't know. Angry?
297000	300000	Angry? What's wrong? Did I, did I, did I anger you?
300000	301000	No, you didn't anger me.
301000	302000	Oh, good.
302000	303000	The world angered me.
303000	304000	The world?
304000	305000	I was in a perfectly good mood leaving my house.
305000	308000	Are you mad about the Mighty No. 9 thing? I mean, people should be used to this by now, right?
308000	315000	Oh, I'm talking about, like, I decided, because, you know, I have a Gear VR.
315000	316000	Uh-huh.
316000	319000	And Minecraft came out for, you know, the Gear VR.
319000	320000	Uh-huh.
320000	321000	Minecraft requires a Bluetooth controller.
321000	322000	Okay.
322000	327000	That should be pretty simple to get, considering that, you know, they're pushing those Gear VRs.
327000	328000	There's a ton of them out there now.
328000	329000	Yeah.
329000	334000	I mean, they were including them with all the pre-orders for the Galaxy S7, the S, you know, S6.
334000	336000	It's been available for a while and all that stuff.
336000	340000	And you would think, you know, a major game like Minecraft that requires a controller.
340000	342000	Those are pretty plentiful out there.
342000	345000	Nobody fucking has a goddamn fucking controller!
345000	355000	Even goddamn Best Buy, which, I swear to God, they have, like, a section for, like, they have a million fucking cases and headphones.
355000	359000	But they have one fucking controller for iOS.
359000	361000	That does me no fucking good.
361000	362000	Same with fucking Target.
362000	364000	One fucking controller.
364000	370000	I go to fucking Game Software damn controller, because they carry iPads and bullshit like that all the time.
371000	372000	But no!
372000	375000	We don't carry fucking controllers to our goddamn store.
375000	377000	But you could go online and order one from our website.
377000	381000	I'm like, if I'm going fucking online to order one, I'm not ordering from your fucking website.
383000	386000	Try to warn me before you do that next time.
386000	390000	I literally just had to move your volume meter down, like, halfway.
390000	392000	I'm feeling the heat.
392000	394000	I'll have to fix that in post-production.
394000	399000	So yes, I haven't found a controller yet, because no one fucking carries goddamn Bluetooth controllers for fucking Android.
399000	403000	It's a Bluetooth fucking universal goddamn format.
403000	409000	But oh, fuck me, you can't possibly make a goddamn controller for an Android system.
409000	412000	You know, because there's no fucking Android devices out there ever.
412000	415000	What about, like, Amazon?
415000	418000	I want to go to a fucking store and pick it up.
418000	421000	If I wanted to order it online, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
421000	424000	But these are electronic stores that should fucking have electronics.
424000	426000	This is what happens when you close every Radio Shack.
426000	429000	They have, like, Gear V. They sell fucking Gear VRs there.
429000	432000	It's like, I mean, I don't understand what the point is.
432000	434000	Let's have them do the order for you.
434000	437000	Over at our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com.
437000	441000	Because as you tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vog.network.com.
441000	445000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
445000	449000	And in our chatroom, people just saying, you're not looking hard enough.
449000	451000	Target is a big answer.
451000	453000	Bullshit. I went to all the Targets in the area.
453000	456000	They each had the same fucking controller for iOS.
456000	458000	Not compatible with the fucking Android.
458000	460000	Huh. Interesting.
460000	462000	I went to Walmarts. They did not have them there either.
462000	465000	The only place I have not been is Fry's yet.
466000	468000	Alright. So, Loki clapbacking.
468000	471000	Yeah. Yes, he did check at Target.
471000	473000	Interesting.
473000	474000	Wow.
474000	477000	So, you've gone to every, you can't find a stinking controller.
477000	480000	That is a little weird. I would have gone online at this point.
480000	483000	Although, I understand the frustration that sometimes you want it now.
483000	485000	So, huh.
485000	490000	And then, you know, older Bluetooth controllers do not pair my phone.
490000	492000	Because I'm a Galaxy S6.
492000	493000	They're different now.
493000	497000	Like, I have an old Moga controller that used to pair my old Galaxy S2.
497000	499000	It does not work on this controller anymore.
499000	501000	Or at least, take that back.
501000	505000	It doesn't work for anything that's not using their app.
505000	509000	I want something generic that just, okay, it's a Bluetooth controller.
509000	512000	It pairs with the phone. Done. That's it.
513000	515000	Some folks in chat suggesting an Ouya controller?
517000	520000	Okay. The controller's a fucking shit.
520000	522000	So, I'm not gonna buy one.
523000	526000	It's still gotta be a somewhat decent controller, right?
526000	529000	They have, like, a SteelSeries controller that just came out.
529000	532000	The one that they had at Best Buy was the SteelSeries XL.
533000	534000	But it's for iOS.
534000	540000	I'm like, why is a Bluetooth controller fucking operating system dependent?
540000	542000	It's Bluetooth. It's a fucking format.
542000	546000	Bluetooth devices sync to all things except Bluetooth.
547000	550000	But for some reason, they locked it down. Thank you very much, Apple.
550000	553000	Alright, well, check the chat.
553000	555000	Because some of the chatters have some ideas for you there.
555000	558000	But I don't know if they're gonna help with the local stuff.
558000	561000	Which, apparently, there is a drought in California, not just water.
561000	563000	Yeah, see, the Moga controllers have a switch.
563000	565000	Yeah, the new Moga controllers do. I have the old one.
565000	567000	The old one does not have a switch.
567000	570000	If it was the old one or the new one, yeah, I'd be...
570000	573000	I can fucking flip a switch and we're good to go.
573000	577000	But that's the thing. It's like, those controllers have been out forever.
577000	580000	Nobody carries them. Nobody.
580000	584000	It's like, come on. I mean, you would think you would have, like, a controller.
584000	589000	You're selling these devices that, you know, are for gaming and stuff.
589000	592000	I mean, what the hell do you think you're gonna control the Gear VR with?
592000	596000	It seems like it's a big thing. It's like you think, hmm.
596000	599000	People are probably gonna be a little bit excited about Minecraft on the Gear VR.
599000	601000	That's a pretty major game.
601000	604000	But fuck if you can actually play it because there's no controllers.
604000	606000	We don't sell them in our stores.
606000	610000	I'm kind of surprised you can't use, like, an Xbox One controller.
610000	614000	You can't sync a PlayStation... I wanted to sync a PlayStation 4 DualShock.
614000	615000	Yeah.
615000	616000	You can't do it unless I root my phone.
616000	619000	Huh. Well.
619000	623000	Sadly, online may end up being faster than hunting in person.
623000	625000	Especially if you've torn up most of the shows.
625000	626000	That's stupid.
626000	629000	No, I know, I know. It's weird. A little weird.
629000	631000	Alright, well anyway, whew. You're very upset over there.
631000	634000	Alright, well hopefully you're able to calm down a little bit.
634000	637000	Can we get into the news and our gaming weeks and all that stuff.
637000	640000	Oh, and then stupid, you know.
640000	643000	What is it? Gym Boys over here has to be closed.
643000	644000	That was Craig and Taco.
644000	645000	So we're all...
645000	646000	We're way out of the way for Gym Boys.
646000	648000	I'm like, ah, you fucking kidding me.
648000	651000	All Loki wanted to feel better was the Taco.
651000	655000	And then, turns out, by the way, it didn't just close.
655000	657000	It closed like six months ago.
657000	660000	Well, I don't drive that way, so, you know, how am I supposed to know?
660000	664000	Stoppy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
664000	668000	The World vs. Loki.
668000	670000	That's how it feels this week, right, Loki?
670000	672000	The World vs. Loki.
672000	674000	Alright, anyhow, our kickoff topic tonight.
674000	677000	I want to say a very happy Mother's Day.
677000	681000	To all the gaming moms out there who might be listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
681000	686000	And, of course, mom type figures as well and pet mommies and kid mommies
686000	689000	and anybody who might be a mother in any sort of way.
689000	691000	A big happy Mother's Day to ya.
691000	696000	And I thought maybe we could talk briefly a little bit here at the top of the show before we get into the gaming weeks.
696000	702000	Maybe a memory about maybe how our mom might have influenced our gaming ways
702000	706000	or maybe a particular gaming memory that we might have, including our mom.
706000	710000	DarkSakura, I know you've got to have some stories about your mom.
710000	716000	Oh, lord. So, I get a Nintendo from my dad.
716000	723000	NES. Gray gun, mind you, because the gray one was the better one.
723000	731000	Get it home. I go to school, I come home, and my mom is trying to beat Super Mario Brothers.
731000	734000	I'm like, Mama, that's mine. It's in my house.
734000	740000	Technically, it's in Grandmom's house. Shut up. How do you do this one?
740000	744000	I love that even as a child, you're pulling technicalities on your mother.
744000	747000	That is so you. That is so you.
747000	752000	My favorite was the one where you threatened to call somebody on her and report her or something like that.
752000	757000	No. When my mom tried to ground me and she took my TV, so I went and got it back.
757000	762000	And she's like, I took that away from you for a reason. I was like, yeah, but you didn't buy it. It belongs to me.
763000	765000	It was theft.
765000	773000	That's right. No, one time I got paddled, and I told the teacher who was paddling me that I was going to call Child Protective Services.
773000	776000	She didn't paddle me again.
776000	778000	All right, so back to the gaming.
778000	786000	So, my mom was really, really good at Super Mario Brothers, and I had Dr. Mario, and she got really good at that.
786000	792000	So just be like, I'd come home from school, and if Mom wasn't working, she'd be like in my bedroom playing my Nintendo.
792000	798000	I was like, Mama? So one year she comes like, I'm going to get your brothers a present.
798000	801000	Now, you think they'd want a Genesis or a Super Nintendo?
801000	803000	They want a Super Nintendo.
803000	806000	And you ain't just saying that because you won't play it, right?
806000	808000	No.
808000	811000	So she got the Super Nintendo, and guess who played it? Me.
811000	814000	Guess whose bedroom it was set up in? Mine.
815000	818000	So, yep.
818000	820000	That was my Super Nintendo.
820000	821000	Awesome.
821000	825000	And then when they moved to Arizona, they took it with them, and I was like, fuck.
825000	832000	So, I go to Arizona to visit my mom, and my grandmom, poor grandmom, she pulled out her back.
832000	841000	She was lying in bed, and here I am with the volume way down trying to beat Link to the Past again.
841000	844000	So, Mom's like, you're going to wake up Grandmom.
844000	846000	I was like, no, I'm not. She's asleep.
846000	849000	Grandmom's like, I like the music.
849000	851000	That was before Grandmom died.
851000	857000	So, Grandmom would just be like, I have no idea what you're doing, but I like the music in it. That's pretty.
857000	858000	And that was it.
858000	860000	That's good, though, a fondness for the video game music.
860000	864000	There are some great composings that are in 8-bit games.
864000	868000	I mean, everybody knows the Mario Brothers theme, the Zelda theme, the Metroid theme.
868000	870000	I mean, a lot of that stuff is legendary.
870000	872000	Yeah.
872000	874000	Awesome. Well, thank you for sharing.
874000	876000	My pleasure.
876000	880000	Okay, so I've called my mom here on OLR before. I'm not going to do it today, sorry.
880000	885000	I already called her earlier today, but some folks have been listening to OLR for a long time.
885000	890000	I know my mom is pretty hilarious when it comes to video games, especially the stuff that's very violent and over the top.
890000	895000	She just thinks it's disgusting, but she's laughing while she's saying it.
895000	898000	That's so gross, you know, type of thing.
898000	905000	But, yeah, I remember my mom was not a big fan of me playing video games all the time,
905000	911000	but I think she kind of got it that video games were what I did to kind of stay out of trouble sort of thing.
911000	914000	So she always kind of had a love-hate relationship, I think, with it.
914000	920000	But I know sometimes I would have to actually play video games in her bedroom because we had two TVs in the house.
920000	923000	We had the one in the living room, and she got one in her bedroom.
923000	929000	So I didn't get a TV in my room, and at the time we had like a Commodore 64 setup,
929000	935000	and that was before I was probably still too young to realize that I could have probably hooked up the Nintendo to the Commodore 64 monitor,
935000	939000	because I did that years later when I figured that out, but at that time I didn't realize that.
939000	943000	So if I wanted to play Nintendo, I had to do it in my mom's bedroom.
943000	949000	Or actually, the memory I really have is with the Atari 2600, and I remember my dad was like,
949000	953000	you can't play on the TV because I want to watch, he's trying to watch PBS or something, I don't know.
953000	957000	And so I ended up, my mom let me play in her room, and she's just kind of watching,
957000	961000	and she's like, she just kind of has like that look of confusion on her face, like I don't get it.
961000	965000	What do you do? What is that? What are you doing? Why is this fun? Isn't this boring?
965000	970000	Like she's just kind of like, kind of judging it, but yet she's still just kind of sitting in her chair watching,
970000	974000	like she doesn't get up or go do anything else, she's just kind of watching like,
974000	979000	I don't get it yet, I can't stop watching you controlling, I think I was probably playing Pac-Man or Spider-Man,
979000	984000	or one of those old Atari 2600 games, and I remember that.
984000	990000	But the other one that I definitely remember playing with my mom, because she would get into this,
990000	996000	is that on the Commodore 64, I used to have a ton of game show influenced games,
996000	1002000	like Wheel of Fortune, Family Feud, Jeopardy, God what else,
1002000	1007000	Classic Concentration, like pretty much any game show, because I loved game shows as a kid, and I really still do,
1007000	1011000	and so when they made game shows into video games, I was like, hey, two worlds colliding.
1011000	1016000	So I remember she used to play Family Feud with me, and that was fun,
1016000	1021000	is that she would play and give me the answers, and then she would,
1021000	1025000	when something wasn't up on the board and she got a strike or something, she's like,
1025000	1031000	oh come on, what are you talking, oh come on, Rob, the computer's cheating, Rob,
1031000	1034000	how does it know all, it just knows all the answers, how do you know it's not just,
1034000	1039000	how do you know it's not stacked against you, Rob, how do you know it's not just telling you the right answer,
1039000	1044000	so it beats you every time, Rob. So, you know, she got a little upset that she would lose all the time.
1044000	1049000	And there was some trivia game that we used to play a lot on the Commodore 64,
1049000	1053000	I don't remember the name of it unfortunately, because trivia games I'm sure were a dime a dozen,
1053000	1058000	but it was a very, you know, you remember in the 80s, Trivial Pursuit was all the rage,
1058000	1062000	so of course they tried to make knockoffs on Commodore 64, so we had one of them,
1062000	1065000	and we used to play that game too, and she would also get mad when she got the wrong answers in that.
1065000	1074000	There was one I used to play on the Apple IIe, that it would like tell you congratulations on the most outdated,
1074000	1081000	outdated methods, like 21 Skidoo, or Wowie Zowie, and all this other stuff,
1081000	1083000	I don't remember what the game was called though, but you made me think of it.
1083000	1092000	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I see Ziba quoting an earlier phone call from my mom,
1092000	1096000	Rob, that's gross, or no, that was when I was filming her watching me play Mortal Kombat.
1096000	1100000	Moms react to Mortal Kombat, and she was not enjoying that very much.
1100000	1105000	Let's see, SSJ100Matt says, my mom also had a love-hate relationship with it when I was a kid.
1105000	1110000	Sometimes she'll be watching me play, other times she's throwing out my games for doing poorly in school.
1110000	1115000	Oh yeah, definitely, I always, well the Nintendo was a reward for me getting straight A's to begin with,
1115000	1119000	so, and then my grades all went downhill from there, just kidding, maybe.
1119000	1126000	Stopy in chat says, the same confusion I have when my nephew plays Minecraft is probably the same my parents had
1126000	1128000	when they saw me play on NES.
1128000	1135000	Perhaps, I mean, I kind of get Minecraft now, but I am very surprised that kids enjoy Minecraft.
1136000	1140000	I'm always, I always kind of feel like Minecraft might have a lot more depth,
1140000	1145000	but I'm always amazed that kids, like, are super into Minecraft, it's like, no joke.
1145000	1148000	A lot of kids that play games are playing the crap out of Minecraft.
1148000	1154000	You know, a couple months ago on the show at this point now, we had Julian, who knew more about Minecraft than I did.
1154000	1155000	That kid.
1155000	1156000	I'm telling you, he's taking over.
1156000	1157000	And Pirate101.
1157000	1159000	He's taking over the show when I finally retire.
1159000	1162000	Alright, Loki, do you have a memory?
1162000	1163000	No.
1163000	1164000	No?
1164000	1165000	I do not.
1165000	1168000	Does your mom never support your video game habit, or what?
1168000	1170000	She's kind of neutral, so.
1170000	1172000	Neutral?
1172000	1173000	Yep.
1173000	1174000	She never got involved, never played anything?
1174000	1175000	Never played anything.
1175000	1176000	Really?
1176000	1177000	Alright.
1177000	1180000	She just kind of, kind of kept a watchful eye from a distance, I suppose.
1180000	1182000	Does your dad, your dad got into it though, right?
1182000	1183000	I still remember you.
1183000	1190000	He says he wasn't into video games, but he's the one that bought all the fucking video games, so I don't believe that for a second.
1190000	1194000	I don't know, we went to the video game world championship.
1194000	1195000	Oh yeah.
1195000	1200000	No, not video game world championship, it was Nintendo World or something like that?
1200000	1201000	In 1990?
1201000	1202000	Nintendo World?
1202000	1203000	Yeah.
1203000	1204000	Yeah, in Oakland.
1204000	1205000	So they took me to that.
1205000	1206000	That's cool.
1206000	1210000	But, I don't know, not really playing any games or anything.
1210000	1212000	I don't remember anything in particular.
1212000	1215000	My dad would take me to see those video game movies.
1215000	1217000	Like, he took me to see The Wizard.
1217000	1221000	He took me to see, well I guess it's not really a video game, but he took me to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
1221000	1225000	By the time Mortal Kombat was out, I was old enough to go by myself.
1225000	1229000	I didn't really have my dad, but I'm trying to think of other video game movies from when I was younger.
1229000	1231000	Because Super Mario Brothers I never did see.
1231000	1232000	And I guess I made the right call.
1232000	1238000	I never saw that movie, and it sounds by every practical purpose that was the right call to not bother with that.
1238000	1239000	So, hmm.
1239000	1240000	Anyway.
1241000	1246000	S2 and Hunter Matt says, Loki's mom kept her distance to avoid his young Loki rants.
1247000	1250000	Were you the type that would throw the controller across the room, Loki?
1250000	1251000	No.
1251000	1252000	No?
1252000	1253000	Dan did that once.
1253000	1254000	Did he?
1254000	1256000	He crushed a Playstation controller with his bare hands.
1256000	1257000	Oh my god.
1257000	1259000	Put it back in the box and returned it.
1259000	1260000	That's not nice.
1260000	1261000	No, he was like 19.
1261000	1263000	Oh, well, still, not nice.
1263000	1264000	Yeah.
1264000	1265000	Alright.
1266000	1267000	Let's see.
1267000	1269000	One more comment here from the chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.
1269000	1277000	Sky, did you do the thing where you waited till your parents were sleeping, then you'd turn on the TV and console and continue playing your video games?
1277000	1281000	Probably more often when I had that in my room.
1281000	1284000	But by that point, the Game Boy was out.
1284000	1290000	And that was the one that, you know, they really couldn't stop me from playing, was the Game Boy.
1290000	1296000	Although, you might remember with the original Game Boy, there was no backlight or anything.
1296000	1308000	So you had to have the lights on to be able to play Game Boy, or they sold those crappy little clips that would like go on top of the Game Boy and it was a screen magnifier slash light.
1308000	1309000	Yeah.
1309000	1310000	Remember those crappy little things?
1310000	1311000	I had that.
1311000	1312000	Yeah.
1312000	1315000	So I had one of those, but it was still really hard to play in the pitch dark.
1315000	1322000	For him not being into video games, he sure bought me a lot of stuff, including obscure systems like the Atari Lynx.
1322000	1323000	Yeah.
1323000	1332000	Well, my dad was super into tech, so I think sometimes he liked to buy that stuff just because I think, in a way, he was enabling me.
1332000	1334000	And I think that's what he wanted to do.
1334000	1335000	Maybe.
1335000	1341000	Like, the Commodore 64 was always intended as a family thing, but I used that thing way more than anybody else.
1341000	1346000	He got it granted when it came down to, you know, he wanted to do a spreadsheet or something.
1346000	1349000	He had his programs that he used.
1349000	1351000	He was into genealogy for a long time.
1351000	1357000	He got more into that after he retired, but he was into it a while ago and he had those programs on Commodore 64 as well.
1357000	1365000	But then, like, I remember there were some of them that he would, like, I knew how to use them better than him, so he would just tell me what to do.
1365000	1367000	So, anyway.
1367000	1369000	Alright, hope you guys enjoyed some of those memories.
1369000	1373000	Let's see, some comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1373000	1379000	SSG100Matt says, my mom would sneak into my room in the middle of the night to play Mario Brothers and Tetris.
1379000	1389000	TigerKlaw says, I remember times I played a video game till it was very late at night, which caused you to lose a few hours of sleep, and then you feeling all drowsy in school.
1389000	1395000	Oh, I'm sure video games have caused me to have problems in school from staying up too late.
1395000	1408000	Even though my mom was usually pretty good at keeping a watchful eye on it, sometimes she would slack off and, yeah, I would end up playing the video game for a very, very, very long time.
1408000	1411000	Excuse me.
1411000	1423000	Sorry guys, you might remember on last week's show I was a little bit sick, and the good news is I'm mostly over it, but Radio Guy's worst fear is having a coughing fit, so sorry about that.
1423000	1432000	Anyway, we're going to now get into how is your gaming week and talk a little bit about the video games we've been playing this week, the new stuff, and then we'll get into the news as well for the week.
1432000	1438000	So Dark Sakura, I know you started to get into it a little bit a minute ago, but how else was your gaming week?
1439000	1456000	It was really just mostly Danganronpa 2 and some Animal Crossing and Ingress, and R-Type, I played some R-Type, and we're still going through Shovel Knight, Dan and I are.
1457000	1472000	Finished Twilight Princess HD, which was pretty cool. The ending, of course, always makes me cry, and, um, did I say Ingress? Because I'm going to say Ingress again, because I just feel like I've been doing nothing to play that, and Heroes of Dragon Age.
1472000	1485000	Oh, and of course, Miitomo, because I'm still checking every day, because I have a few people who are just absolutely fascinating to chat with for their questions, so I've just been using these as, like, chat rooms. It's pretty funny.
1485000	1492000	Well, but you can't really do, like, live chat or anything, you know, you can't provide the questions that are going to be asked or anything.
1492000	1495000	You just ignore the topic. Go off on your own subject.
1495000	1497000	Oh, you mean in the little responses?
1497000	1498000	Yeah.
1498000	1499000	Oh, okay, I got you.
1499000	1501000	You don't have to stay on topic.
1501000	1506000	Yeah, no, you're right, because, like, there was even one where we were going back and forth on it a little bit.
1506000	1507000	Yeah.
1508000	1516000	Oh, you said, the best day of my life was when you moved to California, and I replied and put, and the second best day was when you met me.
1516000	1518000	I said, girl, you know it.
1518000	1524000	And then we were going back and forth with Drag Queen references from Trixie and Katya, our mothers.
1527000	1532000	That's it. I wonder if we could just write them and say, hey, we're not exactly doing drag, but be our moms anyway.
1533000	1537000	Actually, I hear that they're a little sick of being called that, but anyway.
1537000	1538000	Really?
1538000	1541000	That's for another day. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so anything else with your game a week?
1541000	1543000	Um, no.
1543000	1545000	Nope. All right.
1545000	1549000	I wish that there was a game that would reward me with pie.
1549000	1552000	A game that would reward you with pie?
1552000	1553000	Real pie.
1553000	1554000	Real pie.
1554000	1557000	Like, oh, you've beaten the game, and then, ding dong, here's your pie.
1557000	1563000	Here's a coupon for a pie, or maybe an MMO where you can type slash pie to order pie.
1563000	1567000	But dude, they don't have a pie delivery service, and pizza pie doesn't count.
1567000	1574000	But there's a takeout taxi or whatever they call it out here where you can get Cheesecake Factory to deliver.
1574000	1575000	Oh, hey.
1575000	1576000	I know, right?
1576000	1578000	None of that stuff delivers all the way out here where I live, though.
1578000	1581000	You know, well, I live in, well, you know where I live.
1581000	1582000	Yeah, further away.
1582000	1583000	In the boons.
1583000	1585000	They're not quite boons.
1585000	1587000	There's chain restaurants out there, though. I'm sure you don't have a problem.
1587000	1589000	Yeah, but we don't have the Cheesecake Factory.
1589000	1592000	But we do have a Sally's.
1592000	1599000	And then I can just, like, wear so much makeup that I can't move my face, and so I can't eat the pie.
1599000	1601000	So it won't matter as much.
1601000	1603000	All right.
1603000	1605000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1605000	1610000	I didn't play a whole ton. I just mainly played Enter the Gungeon, and...
1610000	1613000	You keep meaning to buy that, and I keep forgetting.
1613000	1619000	I did purchase, even though I'm not really sure if I really wanted all the games, but...
1619000	1625000	I did purchase that Nintendo Humble Bundle, so I have more things on the Wii U at least.
1625000	1629000	It looked okay. I mean, we'll have to try some of those.
1629000	1631000	But it was inexpensive.
1631000	1638000	And I've been trying to hold off on buying other games, because they do have Deadpool on sale right now, and...
1638000	1640000	I may want to pick that up.
1640000	1642000	Trying to behave.
1642000	1646000	It's just like, I don't want to buy it, because I'm not going to play it.
1646000	1649000	Maybe I'll just wait for more stuff to come out.
1649000	1653000	The first level of it? Like, after you leave his house?
1653000	1657000	It's funny, but the camera's really screwed up in it.
1657000	1659000	I watched all the cutscenes already, so, you know.
1659000	1660000	Well, there you go.
1660000	1662000	It looks like a funny game, but yeah.
1662000	1665000	I do like the air guitar in the elevator.
1665000	1667000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1667000	1668000	That was it.
1668000	1672000	For my gaming week, I guess piggybacking off what Loki was talking about,
1672000	1676000	I also bought that Humble Nintendo Bundle, which, reminder to our live audience at least,
1676000	1678000	I think it's over tomorrow morning.
1678000	1682000	So by the time most of you hear the podcast, unfortunately, that Nintendo Bundle's probably done.
1682000	1684000	I don't know if one of you can check the timer on that.
1684000	1689000	But for those of you listening live, if you haven't got it yet, that Nintendo Humble Bundle is still going.
1689000	1691000	It is a pretty good deal.
1691000	1698000	You know, again, it's not Nintendo titles, but it's some indie stuff that's really worth checking out.
1698000	1702000	And I actually did spend a bit of time playing one of the games in the bundle this week
1702000	1705000	because I didn't really realize it was there until I bought it.
1705000	1707000	And I was like, oh, this game! Oh my God!
1707000	1709000	Like, I wanted to get this game and I never did.
1709000	1713000	And that is Rhythm Thief on 3DS because that is, you know, it's a music game
1713000	1716000	and, you know, I always am going to have a soft spot for those.
1716000	1721000	So yeah, if you didn't realize, Rhythm Thief, the full version for 3DS by Sega,
1721000	1723000	which kind of unfortunately came and went.
1723000	1727000	You know, I remember when it came out and then I don't know how well it sold.
1727000	1731000	So here's a great second chance to go back and check it out because, you know,
1731000	1735000	they have a lot of like 3D movies and animations
1735000	1739000	and there's a whole story that goes behind it between the little dancing scenes.
1739000	1743000	And it's kind of like silly, cheesy, but fun.
1743000	1747000	So, you know, especially for the price with this whole bundle thing,
1747000	1750000	I mean, check it out just for Rhythm Thief if nothing else.
1750000	1752000	So yeah, I was playing a bit of that.
1752000	1755000	Which, how would I describe how it plays?
1755000	1761000	It uses the touch pad so like when you want to go like down or do a twirl or left or right.
1761000	1763000	You kind of just trace the motions.
1763000	1765000	But I wouldn't say it's like Elite Beat Agents either.
1765000	1771000	It's kind of a little more like a combination of maybe like Space Channel 5,
1771000	1774000	but instead of just 2 or whatever, you're drawing the directions.
1774000	1777000	I would say maybe that's the closest thing I can think of.
1777000	1779000	Which makes sense because they're both Sega.
1779000	1780000	So there you go.
1780000	1782000	So yeah, check out Rhythm Thief if nothing else.
1782000	1785000	But there's other stuff in the bundle too that I'm looking forward to getting to play.
1785000	1787000	So yeah, again, if you haven't picked up the bundle yet,
1787000	1788000	I would really urge you to.
1788000	1791000	But unfortunately, by the time you hear the podcast, it may be too late.
1791000	1796000	So sorry, hope you didn't make an angry face because you just realized you missed it.
1796000	1799000	But maybe there'll be another bundle worth your time or something. Who knows?
1799000	1801000	I wish they would do more of those for console games.
1801000	1803000	Yeah.
1803000	1805000	Like Sony would be nice.
1805000	1807000	Yeah, well, you know, I don't...
1807000	1809000	I mean, they do really good deals on there.
1809000	1813000	Here's the thing, though, is that you do have to realize the game makers have to make money as well.
1813000	1816000	And I don't know how much they make off these bundles,
1816000	1820000	especially if you have a lot of people that donate a lot of the money to charity.
1820000	1822000	Which is great. I mean, not that charity is a bad thing,
1822000	1827000	but the game makers do have to profit off their games or they're not going to be able to pay their employees.
1827000	1829000	I think a lot of these games have been out for a while.
1829000	1833000	And it doesn't matter any profit you're making off of it at this point because it's digital.
1833000	1837000	Yeah, and that's where I'm like, okay, well, usually by the time these games end up in a bundle,
1837000	1841000	it's like round two or round three even, especially with a game like Rhythm Thief.
1841000	1843000	Like Rhythm Thief had come and gone.
1843000	1845000	And they had Super Street Fighter IV, which was like a launch title.
1845000	1849000	Yeah, that's true. Oh, I forgot. I actually didn't pay enough to get that.
1849000	1855000	No, I didn't either because I was like, I don't have a 3DS and it was Darksiders II.
1855000	1858000	And I was like, eh, I've already got this on a few different platforms.
1858000	1862000	Yeah, I think I have it on Steam already and I was like, eh, I don't really need it on Wii U.
1862000	1868000	And I already have Super Street Fighter II because that was actually one of the launch titles I bought.
1868000	1873000	So there you go. Or Street Fighter II. Street Fighter IV, hello.
1873000	1876000	Okay, so other games that I played this week besides Rhythm Thief.
1876000	1880000	I've been continuing on with Diablo III because season six started.
1880000	1886000	I'm already like Paragon 60 or something because once you start getting your set pieces rolling in, man,
1886000	1890000	I'm playing a Demon Hunter and I can just tear through things now on like Torment V and the XP just starts rolling in.
1890000	1894000	I can probably actually do Torment VI at this point. I might try to do some of that a little bit tonight.
1894000	1899000	Still continuing with Final Fantasy XIV as well. I play Ingress like these other nerds here too.
1899000	1903000	I went on a little trip yesterday to go visit a friend and get some portals in a new area.
1904000	1910000	And then also I was playing the Overwatch Beta. It was kind of a big deal this weekend.
1910000	1914000	If you haven't checked out the Overwatch Beta, time is just about out.
1914000	1921000	Again, podcast feed, you're not going to be able to get to it. Live listeners, you can download it tonight and play for a few hours,
1921000	1925000	but it's done at 10 a.m. tomorrow. And at that point you're going to have to buy the game.
1925000	1930000	So, okay, so the Overwatch Beta. I have kind of mixed feelings on it.
1930000	1935000	I really don't think it's a bad game at all. In fact, I think for what it is, it's extremely well polished.
1935000	1939000	It's like you're playing a game like Team Fortress 2, obviously.
1939000	1945000	When I'm playing a character like Mercy, it's like you are playing the medic from Team Fortress 2 pretty much without the invincibility thing.
1945000	1951000	I mean, that's really all it is. But there's such a coat of polish on it.
1951000	1958000	It's like you're watching a movie. I mean, the characters are phenomenal and so well-rounded.
1958000	1965000	Blizzard really excels at character design, I think. And that's how they're able to have a game like Heroes of the Storm that does a lot of this too.
1965000	1969000	And the characters are so memorable, they put them in more than one game.
1969000	1973000	So do they have any of the Overwatch characters come in the Heroes of the Storm?
1973000	1979000	Tracer is either arriving or has just arrived. I think Tracer was out in the past couple weeks or so.
1979000	1985000	And I'm sure she will not be the last. I'm sure many of these Overwatch characters will cross over in Heroes of the Storm.
1985000	1991000	Like Winston, the ape with the glasses. Oh, come on. It's only a matter of time. He'll be the next one for sure.
1991000	2000000	I mean, some of these characters are already iconic. I have a lot of friends who love D.Va, the girl with the tank.
2000000	2007000	The mech. Excuse me, she has the mech. Mei is great as well. Does the giant ice walls.
2007000	2014000	I love Mercy and I love Symmetra. That's why I like to play. In fact, in one of the matches I was playing with my friends, we did double Symmetra.
2014000	2022000	So Symmetra just puts turrets everywhere. That's all she does. So we were defending and so myself and it was Extrovert's partner Matt were both playing Symmetra.
2022000	2029000	And we just both loaded up each side with turrets. And as people would try to run in, they'd just get fried by the turrets. It was hilarious.
2029000	2034000	And so when I was playing with friends, I was actually having a really good time.
2034000	2043000	Here's where I see the problem is. Overwatch, I feel like, is going to be one of those games that for the first couple weeks when everybody's playing it will be a lot of fun.
2043000	2049000	And then dead because my friends will have moved on to something else because we all have gamer ADD.
2049000	2060000	And then it's like, oh, well, I could play with strangers, which I'm not really into doing. I could do the AI thing, which is okay, but there's no single player mode.
2060000	2072000	And I really think a game like Overwatch that is so focused on the character design and has developed these movies and things that they're just putting out on YouTube and putting out in other places.
2072000	2077000	And doing these movie things for like a Coke sponsored thing that's going to be in theaters and all this stuff.
2077000	2085000	Like, I'm really surprised they didn't take time to flesh some of that out into a single player mode because it could have been epic.
2085000	2094000	I mean, even if it was just kind of like generic arena matches against the CPU that would reward you with really great cut scenes and things like I wish they had at least done that.
2094000	2104000	If nothing else, I really think the potentialness of what I'm looking for in a game like Overwatch really suffers because there is no single player mode.
2104000	2109000	And it makes me not really want to drop $60 on it for two weeks of thrill.
2110000	2117000	And I kind of got into this on Twitter and some people are saying like, you know, games don't have to have the single player mode.
2117000	2119000	And I'm like, you're right, they don't.
2119000	2127000	I always worry about multiplayer games like that too that are multiplayer only because you're reliant on a server to be there.
2127000	2133000	And who's to say that, oh, we're just going to pull the servers for this eventually?
2133000	2140000	That's a good point although Blizzard I would say is a little more reliable than say EA in that capacity.
2140000	2143000	I mean, Blizzard is still supporting Diablo 2 for fuck's sake with a patch.
2143000	2148000	So I trust Blizzard more than I would trust other companies to keep that going for a long time.
2148000	2149000	I'll give them that.
2149000	2151000	So I'm not going to penalize them on that point.
2151000	2159000	But I just, you know, I don't get that same thrill out of playing online against strangers that some people do.
2159000	2160000	And I recognize that.
2160000	2163000	And so again, I can't look at Overwatch and go, it's a bad game. It's not.
2163000	2168000	I think it's going to have huge esports followings and people are going to get a real kick out of it.
2168000	2170000	But I can also look at it and go, eh, it's probably not for me.
2170000	2176000	Heroes of the Storm, I'm really, really, really surprised they did not go for the Heroes of the Storm model with it.
2176000	2182000	Where the game would be free and you would have rotating characters but have to pay for some characters and some of this.
2182000	2188000	I'm really, really shocked because I think it would have made it last more with some of my friends if it was like a free thing.
2188000	2191000	That it's like, you know, oh, well it's free. Just come on and sign up and play.
2191000	2197000	Oh, I know the other thing that hurts it too in the whole trying to line up and play with my friends.
2197000	2202000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC are not cross platform.
2202000	2204000	And that's a problem.
2204000	2207000	I'm going to have some friends that get it on PS4.
2207000	2210000	I'm going to have some that get it on PC and some that get it on Xbox One.
2210000	2216000	And if, you know, either I have to buy all three to play with everybody, which I'm sorry is not going to happen.
2216000	2220000	Or, you know, I kind of have to make a choice and then some of my friends I just don't get to play with.
2220000	2223000	So I really wish they had considered cross platform with it.
2223000	2226000	I do understand, just before somebody, you know, corrects me on it in chat.
2226000	2236000	I understand there was some talk and some feedback that it was felt that PC players because of keyboard and mouse had an advantage over PlayStation.
2236000	2239000	And so I suppose, you know, I can understand that.
2239000	2245000	I still wish there had been a choice that maybe, like, you can cross platform with friends if you want to.
2245000	2247000	Well, then support keyboard and mouse.
2247000	2249000	Yeah, on PlayStation 4, yeah.
2249000	2251000	I mean, how hard is that?
2251000	2254000	It's not. You can do it on Final Fantasy XIV on PS4.
2254000	2258000	Oh, it's unfair. Well, then support keyboard and mouse.
2258000	2265000	I don't really understand why you can't support keyboard and mouse anyways for pretty much anything. I think that would be great.
2265000	2271000	Alright, I'm finally looking over in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2271000	2279000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, I played with someone that used D.Va and unlocked the Is This Easy mode taunt and used it in every single round.
2279000	2289000	Let's see, also we have Dungeon Buster who says, it's a nice slice of the game and I enjoyed what I played but I'm not really into multiplayer only games.
2289000	2293000	Tiger Claw says, Overwatch will be one of those games you will hear a lot in esports.
2294000	2299000	ActDef says, you're asking too much for something like a game like Overwatch.
2299000	2305000	But that's the difference between Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch. Team Fortress 2 offered the same for cheaper years ago.
2305000	2309000	I could say the same for Splatoon kinda and Splatoon offered a single player campaign.
2309000	2311000	Yeah, and that's kind of been my answer.
2311000	2315000	Can you imagine if they did an orange box or whatever of Blizzard stuff?
2315000	2323000	Hey, we're gonna throw in some Starcraft 2, we're gonna have Diablo 3, Overwatch, and hell, we'll throw in some World of Warcraft.
2323000	2333000	Here's the thing though, and don't hear me wrong, Team Fortress 2 is awesome and has its own things that make it great.
2333000	2342000	But it is an aging game. Overwatch does take the Team Fortress thing and really pushes it to the next level with, I would say, better characters than Team Fortress 2.
2342000	2348000	And yet I acknowledge Team Fortress 2 had great character design. Overwatch is actually better.
2348000	2358000	It's a great game. Too bad that Valve's unable to make third games in series, so we're not gonna get any more Team Fortress games.
2358000	2363000	And the lack of single player thing in Team Fortress 2 didn't bother me. Why? Because it was free.
2363000	2367000	And it was very easy to just, you know, oh it's free, I'll download this on a Friday night.
2367000	2371000	And even when it wasn't, it was in the orange box, which was an incredible deal anyways.
2371000	2376000	That's very true. Very, very true. Let's see, other comments from chat.
2376000	2385000	Stoppy in chat says, I'm not interested in Overwatch as a MOBA, but as a story driven campaign, I'd be all over that like spray tan on Trump.
2385000	2393000	Yeah, that's pretty good. I feel very similar. I think I would have preordered that today if it had had a single player campaign.
2394000	2401000	Interesting, also Dungeon Busters says, Quake 3 was fun back in the day, but the mods made it worth playing in the long term for me.
2401000	2404000	Oh, and that's something you won't have in Overwatch, is mods.
2404000	2414000	You're not really gonna be able to do that on console, and I'm sure through the whole Battle.net front end and all that, you're not gonna be able to do that on PC either, because it's always online basically.
2415000	2425000	Interesting. Let's see, also Kaijuto says, I've been playing the Overwatch beta. I'm 50-50 with it. It looks cool and it has some fun characters, but the modes are gonna get old fast.
2425000	2429000	They don't have enough content for a $60 game. It should be $40.
2431000	2434000	Alright, there you go. That was my thoughts on Overwatch.
2434000	2441000	Again, it's hard because I look at it and I go, this game is like fucking awesome, but it's just not what I'm looking for.
2442000	2448000	It's tough, it's tough. Anyway, some housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.
2448000	2454000	Follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio. We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2454000	2462000	And that's really all I got for right now. I don't know of any special events or anything coming up that we're doing.
2462000	2468000	Dragon Con is months and months away. I should mention this, because this is fast approaching.
2469000	2476000	Bobby Blackwolf is going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo that's going to be in Atlanta.
2476000	2479000	And VOG Networks is actually going to be a sponsor of this.
2479000	2484000	And it's going to be from June 10th through 12th this year in the Atlanta area.
2484000	2488000	I'm trying to remember exactly where it's at. It's not one of the downtown places that I'm used to.
2488000	2491000	It's the Renaissance Atlanta Waverly is where it's going to be at.
2491000	2496000	And you can check that. That's a lot like, it sounds like the more and more I read about the Southern Fried Game Room Expo,
2496000	2499000	it sounds a lot like kind of what we have with California Extreme out here.
2499000	2505000	There's a lot of similarities between that, where they have all the old school arcade games and a ballroom or a place.
2505000	2512000	And they do some panels. They have some, you know, celebs from classic gaming history and so forth.
2512000	2514000	That'll be fun. So check that out.
2514000	2518000	Bobby points out it's the same weekend as Anime Weekend Atlanta.
2518000	2521000	Or, I'm sorry, same location, not same weekend. Sorry.
2521000	2523000	Apparently I'm still sick in some ways.
2523000	2529000	All right. Let's get into some gaming news for the week. We're going to start it off with Loki.
2529000	2537000	So there's a rumor or at least another bit of a rumor that was going towards the Nintendo NX not having an optical drive.
2537000	2543000	This is coming from, I guess, a report from a Japanese website called Moneylink.
2543000	2557000	And they're talking about this company, Macronix, who manufactures ROM chips that are used in some of the different 3DS cartridges and that type of thing.
2557000	2566000	And they're having a comment from the company saying that they're expecting that the ROM sales are going to increase in the latter half of the year.
2566000	2571000	And we'll have a large growth potential because of this new console that's coming out in March.
2571000	2585000	So it's kind of odd that if this is a console that's going to be using optical media that this company would be saying that they're expecting to have an increase in sales on these chips that are basically used for cartridges.
2585000	2588000	If it's not going to be using these cartridges.
2588000	2596000	To which I say, I don't care which format these things are on as long as I don't have to buy a proprietary memory card format.
2596000	2609000	And maybe there are some advantages to them. Maybe they're faster than optical media. Maybe something like using solid state drives instead of actual platter drives or something like that.
2609000	2613000	Maybe the fact they'll be harder to copy. Please.
2613000	2620000	I'm not saying they won't. I didn't say they won't be copyable. I just said they'll be harder to copy.
2620000	2630000	It's not even an issue. That's the thing. Don't even bother with doing a proprietary format like that. It's not going to matter.
2630000	2634000	Seriously, it's not going to matter. People will find a way to copy it.
2634000	2638000	I don't think that should be necessarily the issue.
2638000	2644000	My thing is that I don't know if these are going to be more expensive to manufacture because optical media is pretty damn cheap.
2644000	2649000	I don't know why you wouldn't use it, but I'm sure they have a reason for it.
2649000	2655000	Maybe because this system is smaller and so fitting a disk drive onto like...
2655000	2667000	Let's assume for a minute here that we're talking about a system that's basically going to look like the Wii U gamepad, but it's its own thing and has its own processor in it and you can take it with you.
2667000	2677000	Having an optical drive in that would probably not make much sense because it would eat up the fuck of the battery and also, you know, it's going to be huge.
2677000	2684000	So it makes sense to have like a little cartridge thing, kind of like the Vita does, you know, for their games.
2684000	2693000	But obviously it's going to need to be some sort of high capacity format because the games that are going to be on this are probably going to be much larger than a couple gigabytes.
2693000	2699000	They're going to be, you know, tens of gigabytes. So we'll see.
2699000	2711000	I thought maybe part of the reason they're going to get rid of the optical drive is so that they just have download only and make the move completely to digital.
2711000	2719000	Which I realize is highly controversial, but would not be the first time this rumor has come up either.
2720000	2723000	I don't know. I don't think that's a good idea.
2723000	2726000	I don't think it's a good idea either. I still think it's a little soon.
2726000	2735000	Because here's the thing with download only, you're basically, you have to figure, okay, who's selling these consoles?
2735000	2743000	Retailers are selling these consoles. If you don't have anything for them to sell, they're going to say, fuck you, we aren't selling your console because they're not making any money off that console.
2743000	2748000	They're making money off the software and what, are you going to sell them download codes?
2748000	2754000	Fuck that. I'm not going to go to the store to buy a download code. I'll just download it off the website or off of their storefront.
2754000	2764000	I'm not going to give Nintendo a pass or I wouldn't give Microsoft one when the Xbox one was first announced and that goes back to the whole equity in the game you buy and all that.
2764000	2770000	You know what's funny? We were talking about moms and all that. I did call my mom for Mother's Day today and she said,
2770000	2777000	Oh, your old video games ought to be worth a ton of money, huh? All those old video games. I'm like, actually, mom, you sold a lot of my old video games in a garage sale for $3 a piece.
2777000	2785000	She's like, Oh, well, too bad. Cause I guess she saw somewhere the old video games were selling now for a lot of money.
2785000	2791000	Yeah, it depends on what they are, but she, she seemed to know enough where like certain ones were selling for a lot of money.
2791000	2797000	I don't think she, I think, I think she hears that like one is going for a lot of money. So clearly I must have owned that one.
2797000	2803000	Yeah, because she, she just remembers she had to buy me every fucking game when I was a kid. So clearly I had that one game, right?
2803000	2809000	But anyway, my point is, is that, you know, I, you know, should be able to hold, even with CD based media.
2809000	2817000	Heck, if you were lucky enough to have a copy of sweet code and two or what, what the Castlevania on the symphony of the night on the Saturn or whatever the one for a ton of money.
2817000	2821000	I mean, there's still what, uh, there's Saturn games that go for tons of money.
2821000	2831000	You know, obviously with something like this is that you better make sure that the format that you're coming up with is going to be able to have the capacity to where that's not going to hinder the games that you're putting on it.
2831000	2839000	You know, don't make it like the Xbox 360 where you have, you know, basically DVD format that you can only fit so much on there.
2839000	2848000	You know, I'm assuming that these games are going to be bigger and stuff. Now we were talking like, you know, PlayStation four games and stuff for like 50 gigs, 60 gigs.
2848000	2859000	I mean, so that's a lot to fit on a little cartridge. So, I mean, I'm, I'm expecting this to be, you know, to work out.
2859000	2867000	I don't want this like, Oh yeah, fuck. We should have, you know, we really should have made it bigger, but we were fucking stupid.
2867000	2875000	You know, I let's, let's hope not, but I, you know, you, you could fit a lot on a, on a cartridge these days, so we'll, we'll see.
2875000	2879000	I mean, but of course, memory is, you know, going to have a price to it, but we'll see.
2879000	2885000	I mean, again, this is all just fucking rumors until we have something official from Nintendo at some point.
2885000	2893000	Um, but Akuma JP in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says no optical drive equals save energy, thinner console, less DOA.
2894000	2902000	And yeah, I, I definitely see the advantage. I mean, some people bitch that the PlayStation four is too slow with some of the loading times and having this type of light.
2902000	2913000	But, but, but with the optical, you know, thing not being there, it also doesn't, it kind of removes it from being like this universal device, you know, like for Blu-ray and that type of stuff.
2913000	2927000	Well, I, how many, well, I don't know if I should say this, but I'm going to, how many people are still going to be using Blu-ray in five years as Netflix and all the digital stuff is more and more of our lives?
2927000	2938000	I think a lot of people, because the, the bandwidth is still not such to where you can stream, you know, reliably like 4k or ultra HD content.
2938000	2939000	That's fair.
2939000	2947000	And, you know, especially with these devices, you know, going, you know, the Neo or whatever, pushing for this ultra HD, you know, content.
2947000	2950000	I would think that you would want the media to support that as well.
2950000	2955000	And I mean, maybe Nintendo realizes that, you know what, they're not going to be the only device in the living room.
2955000	2960000	And if not having to license the Blu-ray stuff is going to save money on the console, then take a risk.
2960000	2961000	That's not a good stance.
2961000	2962000	I don't think that's a great stance at all.
2962000	2972000	Because if you're, if you're, if you're booked, you know, basically guaranteeing that your console is going to be a secondary console, why are you gunning for second place?
2972000	2974000	I mean, seriously gunning for second place.
2974000	2977000	That's where you got fucked on your fucking third party support.
2977000	2978000	Because fuck it.
2978000	2979000	You know what?
2979000	2982000	If you want third party support, you'll have a PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.
2982000	2984000	They can play the games that they can't run on the Wii U.
2984000	2987000	How well did that work out for you, Nintendo?
2987000	2989000	Not very fucking well.
2989000	2999000	I'm like half with you, but I still feel like, again, if Nintendo has this whole thing where the stuff that's on the drive can move to this portable unit.
2999000	3016000	And if that whole rumor turns out to be true, there's this synergy between a portable unit and the thing that maybe there's something where a movie that you get on Netflix, or maybe Nintendo plans to do their own thing, would be not only good in the TV realm, but something you can take with you on the go.
3016000	3018000	And maybe they're trying to do something that kind of competes with Blu-ray in that regard.
3018000	3020000	Well, here's what I want to see, okay?
3020000	3022000	You know, right now...
3022000	3024000	Ooh, wait, quickly, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3024000	3027000	Don't you remember when the 3DS was going to do movies?
3027000	3028000	It didn't end up doing it.
3028000	3035000	But remember, at one time, Nintendo wanted, they were showing off at E3 one year, it was like Tangled or something was on the 3DS cartridges.
3035000	3036000	No, it did do it a little bit.
3036000	3041000	So, maybe Nintendo's going to compete with Blu-ray with this cartridge format.
3041000	3042000	Yeah, but the...
3042000	3044000	Tinfoil haddish, but I'm throwing it out there.
3044000	3047000	The reason that was cool is because it was 3D movies.
3047000	3054000	And that was pretty awesome, because it was like, ooh, cool, I can watch my 3D movies without having to wear the glasses and everything.
3054000	3057000	So that's not a thing now, but...
3057000	3062000	I just think right now, we need to know more about the NX.
3062000	3067000	And the fact that they're not talking about it, and they're not going to show it off at E3...
3067000	3073000	Like, right now, my expectation is, you know, something like the Wii U, but it's basically a separate device.
3073000	3077000	I need to know what the hook is going to be on this, because right now, I'm not that excited about it.
3077000	3083000	Alright. Let's see, going to the chat for some more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
3083000	3087000	Kaijuto says, Nintendo is going to have a video streaming app that runs Captain N 24x7.
3087000	3090000	I'd be totally okay with that, actually.
3090000	3091000	No, thank you.
3091000	3093000	I'd be totally okay with that.
3093000	3096000	Hopefully it would also run old episodes of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.
3096000	3098000	I would totally be into that.
3098000	3102000	Newloser in our chatroom says, why would a manufacturer do this?
3102000	3107000	Optical storage is dirt cheap, and moving away from it would eat into their profit.
3107000	3110000	Depends on the form factor of the device.
3110000	3115000	Has Nintendo shown that they're willing to cut the price of the console by even 20 bucks by taking something out?
3115000	3119000	Like the whole, you know, when they took DVD playback out of that second Wii.
3119000	3121000	But it's not about that at all.
3121000	3124000	It's about, we don't know what the form factor of this device is going to be.
3124000	3130000	If it's a handheld type of device, then you can't really put an optical drive in that.
3130000	3132000	I mean, I guess you could.
3132000	3135000	I mean, you could put a laptop, you know, type drive.
3135000	3145000	But to be honest, I mean, it's going to be better to have some sort of cartridge-based, or some sort of, you know, flash ROM-based storage medium.
3145000	3150000	AkumaJP in chat says, cartridge used to be expensive, less storage, but not in these days.
3150000	3153000	That's right, that's a big part of the reason why everybody switched in the first place.
3153000	3155000	But yeah, times have changed quite a bit.
3155000	3161000	And then Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, fuck it, the NX should use zip disks.
3161000	3167000	Rest in peace to all those old zip disks.
3167000	3169000	Those things were beasts.
3169000	3172000	Imagine what you could fit on something that size these days, though.
3172000	3176000	Something like, you know, depending on how much...
3176000	3177000	A hundred megabytes?
3177000	3181000	No, I mean like, take the same size and shape of a zip disk.
3181000	3184000	How much could you put on something that size these days?
3184000	3185000	I bet you could fit a ton.
3185000	3189000	And those things were not extraordinarily big. That could be the new cartridge.
3189000	3199000	But I still think if they're going cartridge, I have this funky feeling it's a cartridge that works on the NX for the TV, and it works on your portable NX.
3199000	3201000	That it's that small where it does both.
3201000	3202000	But we'll see.
3202000	3209000	This is all just fucking speculating until Nintendo shuts us down, which I wish they'd do sooner rather than later.
3209000	3210000	I really do.
3210000	3212000	Alright, let's move on, though. We got more stories to cover.
3212000	3214000	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?
3214000	3219000	Well, I still like Miitomo. There are still people who like Miitomo.
3219000	3222000	I play it every day. I still play it every day, Dark Soccer.
3222000	3224000	I hate the fucking pinball thing.
3224000	3227000	No, I'm not even going to call it pinball, because that's disrespecting pinball.
3227000	3228000	It's more like Pachinko.
3228000	3229000	Yeah.
3229000	3230000	It's more like Pachinko.
3230000	3231000	It's more...
3231000	3232000	Miitomo drop.
3232000	3233000	It's more bullshit, is what it is.
3233000	3237000	There's always something I want and I never get it, like the corndog hat, and it's bullshit.
3238000	3241000	I've managed to get most of the stuff I've wanted out of it.
3241000	3243000	I've spent a little, but I've gotten it.
3243000	3250000	In the gothic thing, the only thing I got in the gothic drop, besides candy, was a dress for my male...
3250000	3252000	See, you know what? I just wore the fucking dress.
3252000	3256000	I don't give a fuck, because it's the only thing that I could win in the gothic drop.
3256000	3260000	So I wore the gothic dress and some sunglasses, and I was like, this is my style.
3260000	3264000	I won the poofy sailor dress schoolgirl uniform twice.
3264000	3266000	That one was a bitch.
3266000	3272000	I tried to get the pants so I could go all boy style, and I couldn't get the slouchy pants, but so whatever.
3272000	3285000	Anyway, so Miitomo is actually going to be getting an update soon, and in that update you will be able to add friends via email and quote other memes.
3285000	3288000	The all answers thing is getting an improvement.
3288000	3293000	They are doing adjustments for Mi photos, which Mi photo is like the most fun ever.
3293000	3297000	I've just been having a field day with that, like taking real life pictures.
3297000	3300000	You know the little area when you get off the Toy Story Mania?
3300000	3304000	I took a picture of that in a pano, and I've been using it for Mi photo.
3304000	3305000	So it's been pretty cool.
3305000	3307000	Oh yeah, no, your Mi photos crack me up.
3307000	3313000	I have some other friends, like Jonko, my buddy that was on Koopa Club when they were still around, rest in peace.
3313000	3317000	He has some funny ones. He's used his comments and so forth.
3318000	3324000	I'm not very good with the Mi photo stuff, but Alan does some really funny ones.
3324000	3327000	He likes to do the really good captions. There's one of his characters that says,
3327000	3329000	I'm a disaster, and it's really funny.
3329000	3336000	There's also, I've found that our buddy Rob K. in the UK does some really great ones.
3336000	3339000	Oh yes, he posted one on Facebook that was hilarious.
3339000	3342000	This is the Sakura Vicarian that was me serving tea.
3342000	3345000	Yeah, I should go, I should go, I should go. That was funny.
3345000	3346000	Anyway, sorry.
3346000	3353000	So anyway, there are going to be the updates coming out.
3353000	3356000	I'm trying to get a little bit more detail on it if this stupid thing will ever load.
3356000	3359000	It was on a Nintendo blog.
3359000	3361000	They pushed some of it to the game too.
3361000	3365000	There's a little news item within the game, but I think you hit on the biggest stuff, really.
3365000	3373000	Yeah, I just want to see the ability to, instead of having to have the extra Mi's saved,
3373000	3378000	I would like to be able to just pick whatever friend and add them to a Mi photo, things like that.
3378000	3382000	But it would be neat. The Mi photo thing is really the most fun to me.
3382000	3388000	Yeah, I am shocked, shocking myself with how frequently I use Mi Tomo.
3388000	3392000	I still check it every day. Again, I treat it kind of like a social network, you know?
3392000	3397000	I think it's what it's intended to be, really. Like a combination of a game plus.
3397000	3401000	I think it's a neat concept and I'm glad that it's sticking around.
3401000	3409000	Congrats to Nintendo. I consider it successful, but I guess we'll see when their next earnings report comes in.
3409000	3412000	Because I haven't spent a dime on it, I'll tell you that.
3412000	3415000	I play it every day and I haven't spent a goddamn dime and I'm not going,
3415000	3417000	Oh, did you spend money?
3417000	3420000	I did, because I like the outfits.
3420000	3426000	Seriously, right now, every day I've been signing in, it gives me a thousand coins.
3426000	3430000	Or it gives me some huge prize because it's like, we're celebrating 10 million users worldwide.
3430000	3435000	And I thought I would get that once. I swear to God, I've gotten that pop-up like every day in May.
3435000	3438000	And it's like, here's 2,000 coins, here's 5 gameplay tickets.
3438000	3440000	It's been a big reward every day.
3440000	3445000	I haven't spent a lot on it, but I've done just enough when I wanted the 7-layer kimono when that came out.
3445000	3448000	Hey, you have 250 unused invites for Ingress.
3448000	3451000	Oh, please.
3451000	3454000	It's like, no, sorry.
3454000	3459000	Alright, let's move on. Loki, what do you have for us?
3459000	3465000	Alright, so there's a few more games that have been inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.
3465000	3473000	And originally, the first six were Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.
3473000	3482000	The newest six would be Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, The Organ Trail, The Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Space Invaders.
3484000	3486000	Not a bad selection.
3486000	3492000	Yeah, it's really not a bad selection at all. I know the first year I was like, well, where's this game and where's this game?
3492000	3497000	And now this year I'm like, okay, well, there's Space Invaders, which really should have been there the first year.
3497000	3501000	A little harder for me to complain now as things are rounding out a little more here.
3501000	3512000	But, I mean, okay, I understand this place is in Rochester, New York or whatever, but what makes this the Video Game Hall of Fame other than the fact that's what they're calling it?
3512000	3517000	They just self-proclaimed, just like, was it the video game capital of the world or something like that?
3517000	3520000	Which you can't even get to by an airport or whatever.
3520000	3522000	In the middle of fucking nowhere or something like that?
3522000	3523000	Yeah.
3523000	3524000	I don't know.
3524000	3526000	This is in Iowa somewhere, I think.
3526000	3529000	Yeah, you can just self-proclaim all that shit, I guess.
3529000	3540000	Well, and to be fair, even the Metreon in San Francisco at one point had the Video Game Walk of Fame that lasted maybe one or two years before finally they just turned the Metreon into a target.
3540000	3548000	So, I know I've been in that target going, I wonder if this is where the Hall of Fame used to be. I wonder if this was it.
3548000	3558000	I wonder if this was the Oops I Killed Your Friend. What was that store with the little thing that was like, Oops I Killed You or something like that. Remember the clothing store?
3558000	3562000	Dark Soccer, you're killing me here. Do you remember in the Metreon there was that Oops?
3562000	3565000	Uh, kinda?
3565000	3570000	God, that was the funniest fucking stuff. And that store is maybe open for three months.
3570000	3571000	Sucks.
3571000	3572000	Oh well.
3572000	3586000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Kossin in chat says, Metreon is a target now? Oh Jesus, that's tragic. To be fair, the movie theater part didn't change. That is still there and I think Sony runs the movie theater.
3586000	3587000	The IMAX.
3587000	3600000	And it has an IMAX and the XD or whatever they call it is there as well. But yeah, the rest of it, most of it is a target. The food court part didn't change either, except I think the vendors in there did.
3600000	3609000	And then there's just a lot of other food vendors in there now and that's it. But as far as the arcade, gone. All that other stuff, gone, gone, gone.
3609000	3611000	So much sadness.
3611000	3613000	Yeah, it's not what it used to be.
3613000	3615000	Alright, anyhow.
3617000	3623000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bone.
3623000	3629000	Let's move on. We're going to come back to the Video Game Hall of Fame a little later in the show during our FUGL question of the week.
3629000	3642000	But for now, let's talk about Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon. Pokemon Sun and Moon. Pokemon Sun and Moon, more information is going to be coming on these games on May 10th.
3642000	3649000	That's right. Pokemon Sun and Moon for the Nintendo 3DS. There's going to be an event in Japan that happens on May 10th.
3649000	3660000	So I look forward to that because with E3 apparently being nothing but Legend of Zelda this year, you can, you know, do the Pokemon stuff at a different time.
3660000	3662000	An earlier time in this case. May 10th.
3662000	3667000	So hopefully the type of information you'll be expecting to hear at E3, like maybe release date.
3667000	3671000	But don't set the expectation bar too high. Just saying.
3671000	3681000	Also that may be of interest to you is the Japanese Nintendo Direct for Cultcept Revolt on the Nintendo 3DS.
3681000	3689000	That Nintendo Direct will be on May 11th. Sadly there is no US version of this Direct, probably because we're not getting it.
3689000	3694000	But Cultcept is kind of awesome. It's like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
3695000	3699000	They have a version of it. I think Cultcept Saga is what it's called on Xbox 360.
3699000	3703000	And then I think there was one on regular DS.
3703000	3709000	But sadly I don't think that series did too well. Oh, and there was one on Playstation 2. That's where it all started.
3709000	3712000	But sadly I don't think the series did too well here in the States.
3712000	3715000	Or we'd probably be hearing more about Cultcept Revolt over here.
3715000	3719000	But we can always cross our fingers on our toes and hope we can.
3719000	3722000	Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3722000	3727000	Well another game I've been excitedly looking forward to is Bloodstained.
3727000	3738000	And thankfully they're going to go in a different direction than Mighty No. 9 was going with its Kickstarter.
3738000	3745000	They're going to make sure that the game isn't delayed by delivering a core package as soon as it's finished.
3745000	3748000	And then updates are going to come afterwards.
3748000	3751000	The same thing happened with Shovel Knight, as you'll recall.
3751000	3759000	So they're basically making sure that people are getting the product that they have put out the money for.
3759000	3764000	And that their money is going to be applied towards something better down the line.
3764000	3767000	I think that that is a great way to handle it.
3767000	3777000	I mean it's definitely going to save them the PR nightmare that Inafune is going through with Mighty No. 9.
3777000	3780000	So I don't know. I think it's a good idea.
3780000	3784000	This is probably the best way to do it to ensure the game gets out faster.
3784000	3788000	But as long as that core game is solid, that's so important I think.
3788000	3791000	All the extra stuff is just extra stuff.
3791000	3795000	And sometimes that can even make the game more fun because it makes you want to go back and revisit it.
3795000	3799000	Like Shovel Knight. Like when they added the amiibo it was like, oh I have a reason to go back and play Shovel Knight again.
3799000	3805000	So I definitely think that's the way to do it as opposed to what Mighty No. 9 is doing.
3805000	3810000	But I do also understand the need to feel like you're delivering on promises.
3810000	3812000	Which is also of course super important.
3812000	3814000	So I don't want to discount that.
3814000	3818000	But yeah, I think this is probably a better approach.
3818000	3823000	Alright, before we get to some release dates when we travel around the world.
3823000	3828000	I did want to mention, because a minute ago I talked about Nintendo and the Zelda E3 thing.
3828000	3832000	And sure enough, we already kind of talked about this a little bit last week.
3832000	3839000	But a little bit more details came out about the whole Nintendo and what they're going to do with E3 and Zelda and all that.
3839000	3844000	And yes, it really is going to be nothing but Zelda for Nintendo E3.
3844000	3851000	From this quote here, at E3 this year we're treating people to an immersive Zelda experience.
3851000	3856000	And that's from Scott Moffett, who is Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.
3856000	3861000	Continuing on, by giving attendees extended hands-on time with this remarkable game.
3861000	3865000	They'll be able to get a much deeper understanding of something new for the franchise.
3865000	3869000	The E3 thing will start at 9am on Tuesday.
3869000	3874000	And that will be when Reggie Fils-Aime introduces the Nintendo Treehouse Live.
3874000	3878000	Which will be dedicated to a day of livestream gameplay of The Legend of Zelda.
3879000	3883000	What's interesting about all that is that 9am is usually when they do their direct.
3883000	3886000	So it seems like there is no Nintendo...
3886000	3892000	Well, I don't know if you can say there's no Nintendo Direct, but they really are doing nothing but Zelda.
3892000	3895000	It's going to be Zelda all day. That's it.
3895000	3898000	So that is becoming more and more clear.
3898000	3902000	And especially now with this whole Pokémon thing I just talked about that they were doing at a different time.
3902000	3906000	Because I said, how the fuck are you going to go to E3 and not show your Pokémon game?
3906000	3908000	Well, it seems like they're just going to get that out of the way earlier.
3908000	3910000	So very, very, very interesting development.
3910000	3912000	And a big gamble as well.
3912000	3916000	We'll have to see what pays off for Nintendo this year at E3.
3916000	3918000	You know what's going to be interesting?
3918000	3922000	There's always those people that every year feel the need.
3922000	3924000	And god, we've probably done this in the past too.
3924000	3927000	So I'm including ourselves in this little bit of a read I'm doing here.
3927000	3933000	Every single year we feel the need to grade the big three, right?
3933000	3935000	What grade did Sony get?
3935000	3937000	Did they get an A or did they get a C minus?
3937000	3939000	Or what did Microsoft get?
3939000	3943000	Well Nintendo this year, that's going to be a hard one to grade.
3943000	3947000	Because Nintendo is even kind of saying we're only there with one game.
3947000	3950000	So do you just give them an F on principle?
3950000	3953000	Or are you going to give them an A because you're a big Zelda fan?
3953000	3956000	Or are you just going to toss your grading system?
3956000	3958000	That might be the best.
3958000	3961000	I'm just going to, I don't know, depends what they show.
3961000	3963000	That's true.
3964000	3971000	It's like, hey, we came up with this really cool tilt system that you have to use with Kill Zelda.
3971000	3975000	You'll tilt it forward and Link will run forward.
3975000	3977000	Or tilt it backwards and Link will roll backwards.
3977000	3981000	Loki will just hit that big red buzzer just like he's a judge on America's Got Talent.
3981000	3983000	No.
3983000	3985000	Done.
3985000	3987000	It's going to take a lot to screw up Zelda.
3987000	3989000	The minute they start talking about tilt controls.
3989000	3991000	It's going to take a lot.
3991000	3996000	But if there's anybody I think that could possibly pull it out, it could be Zelda.
3996000	3998000	Or it could be Nintendo with Zelda.
3998000	4001000	Dungeon Buster says, bring back the Game Pro faces.
4001000	4003000	That was always a good way to rate things.
4003000	4006000	SSJ100Matt says, my bank account will be my grading system.
4006000	4008000	If it's empty, then you'll know why.
4008000	4009000	Very true.
4009000	4012000	Kossen, giving us maybe a different way to grade E3 this year, saying,
4012000	4016000	which press conference will have the drunkest host this time?
4016000	4018000	I think that's worth looking into.
4018000	4022000	Well, a little more detail on Microsoft's plans for E3 as well,
4022000	4025000	although not really unexpected either.
4025000	4030000	The E3 2016 media event will be Monday, June 13th at 9.30,
4030000	4033000	which is the time slot that they usually do.
4033000	4035000	It will be on Spike TV.
4035000	4040000	You can also watch it on your console as well and on Xbox.com.
4040000	4045000	I wonder if it will be like last year when I could actually watch the Microsoft press event on my PlayStation
4045000	4047000	because I love those types of Inception sort of things.
4047000	4051000	I'm going to try to do that, see if I can watch the Microsoft event on my PlayStation,
4051000	4054000	and then I'll watch the Sony event on my Xbox.
4054000	4055000	Why?
4055000	4056000	Oh, my God, you're such a rebel.
4056000	4057000	Because I can.
4057000	4059000	Because I can.
4059000	4064000	Anyway, there's also going to be an official Xbox Twitch stream,
4064000	4068000	which now that's two out of three that are embracing Twitch,
4068000	4071000	and I've got to be sure Sony's going to do something as well.
4071000	4075000	They always do an extended thing every year anyway.
4075000	4079000	But, yeah, the Xbox Twitch stream is going to be Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
4079000	4082000	for about four to six hours each of those days,
4082000	4085000	on Tuesday from noon to four, Wednesday from 10 a.m. to four,
4085000	4088000	and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
4088000	4093000	Apparently, the rumor and the buzz, of course, is new Xbox One bundles
4093000	4098000	and possibly this whole redesign thing, the slimmer Xbox One.
4098000	4100000	That's what a lot of the buzz is about right now.
4100000	4102000	We'll see.
4102000	4106000	Only about a month away at this point, believe it or not.
4106000	4109000	So, actdeftnchat, also a rebel, says,
4109000	4114000	I have watched the last two Microsoft conferences for my Wii U lol.
4114000	4116000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
4116000	4119000	and look at some games that are coming out soon in your region.
4119000	4120000	Loki.
4120000	4125000	All right, well, this week we've got Uncharted 4 coming out on PlayStation 4.
4125000	4132000	Also, we have Mega Tagmenson Blanc plus Neptune vs. Zombies
4132000	4135000	for PlayStation Vita.
4135000	4138000	And then, because they have to be fucking different,
4138000	4144000	Bethesda's releasing Doom on Friday on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC,
4144000	4147000	as well as the collector's edition and all that jazz.
4147000	4151000	Why can't you just fucking release shit on a...
4151000	4153000	Wait, you think you're fucking Nintendo now?
4153000	4157000	I mean, seriously, speaking of Nintendo, also releasing shit on fucking Fridays.
4157000	4160000	Disney Art Academy coming out for 3DS.
4160000	4163000	You can practice your drawing Mickey and other Disney characters.
4163000	4165000	That's it.
4165000	4170000	All right, traveling over to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there.
4170000	4175000	On this week, actually not a lot.
4175000	4181000	You could look in other regions to get Uncharted 4 this week,
4181000	4183000	but I don't believe that's getting a Japanese...
4183000	4185000	Oh, no, it is getting a Japanese release, excuse me, on May 10th.
4185000	4187000	It was just at the very bottom of my list.
4187000	4191000	There is a deluxe edition there of Uncharted 4 coming out on May 10th,
4191000	4194000	so that is getting, I guess, a worldwide type of release,
4194000	4197000	because that is coming out everywhere, it sure seems.
4197000	4203000	Looking at other consoles, the Wii U, nothing until June, sorry to say.
4203000	4208000	The Vita, really nothing until next week.
4208000	4212000	On May 19th is when we start seeing releases again on the Vita.
4212000	4215000	And then lastly, on the 3DS, nothing really this week as well,
4215000	4220000	so it's another very quiet week in Japan outside of Uncharted 4.
4220000	4225000	Also, AkumaJP in chat says there is a limited edition PlayStation 4 as well,
4225000	4227000	which of course there is. Of course there is.
4227000	4231000	There's always a limited edition something something over there,
4231000	4232000	way more than we see over here.
4232000	4234000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4234000	4236000	A few things.
4236000	4240000	We have on the 10th Uncharted 4 on PlayStation 4,
4240000	4243000	on the 12th Super Meat Boy for Wii U,
4243000	4250000	and on the 13th Doom 4 on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and on PC.
4250000	4252000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys,
4252000	4256000	and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4256000	4259000	So hey, this is kind of neat, this is more like internet news,
4259000	4263000	but you know how there's all those funky domains you can get nowadays?
4263000	4266000	In fact, I think they have .ninja as one of the options.
4266000	4271000	Well, one that would seem to make sense, that for whatever reason is not available,
4271000	4278000	.game and .games is something that's going to be coming around starting May 17th.
4278000	4284000	Apparently you can purchase your domain with that now, if you want.
4284000	4289000	So they do like, you know, Call of Duty .game or something like that.
4289000	4291000	Alright.
4292000	4296000	Does that mean we have to register another domain, vog.game or something?
4296000	4298000	I don't know. Is that something we need to look into?
4298000	4302000	Maybe, yeah. I'm sure it's something that's going to be available soon.
4302000	4307000	So I guess you can start ordering those, but yeah, it's going to launch quarter 3 of 2016,
4307000	4310000	and they're going to be selling them for $12.
4310000	4314000	Flappy vog.game. Look forward to it.
4316000	4317000	We can hope.
4317000	4325000	Or what was it? Was it, you do like, you lost .game or something like that?
4325000	4328000	You lost the .game? That's a good idea.
4328000	4330000	Somebody needs to get on that.
4330000	4333000	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out we do have vog.network.
4333000	4336000	I didn't realize that. That's pretty cool.
4336000	4337000	It's kind of fun.
4337000	4341000	Alright, talking about World of Warcraft here lastly.
4341000	4343000	Yes, World of Warcraft is still going.
4343000	4345000	Do you remember a couple weeks ago on the show we talked about
4345000	4349000	that Blizzard had actually shut down an underground server
4349000	4352000	that was dedicated to running vanilla World of Warcraft,
4352000	4355000	original Warcraft before all the expansions and all that,
4355000	4358000	for people who didn't want to let go,
4358000	4361000	or I guess who didn't want to have to pay the monthly fee
4361000	4363000	because the server wouldn't have those.
4363000	4366000	Well, I pretty much thought that would be the end of that.
4366000	4368000	It was just a matter of time before the cease and desist came out,
4368000	4369000	and it did, and that was that.
4369000	4375000	However, apparently one of the admins over at Nosalrius,
4375000	4378000	which was the name of this server, underground server,
4378000	4382000	they are saying that they're going to meet with Blizzard at their headquarters
4382000	4386000	in a statement there, so we don't know what more is with that
4386000	4389000	or when that meeting is or how that's going to take place
4389000	4392000	or if it's something maybe where it's just during BlizzCon or something,
4392000	4395000	but I think they should consider themselves very lucky
4395000	4397000	that Blizzard will give them the time of day
4397000	4400000	because they really don't have to be,
4400000	4403000	considering that people weren't really paying to be on this server
4403000	4405000	with a monthly fee or anything,
4405000	4408000	so it's really kind of fascinating to me that Blizzard would do that,
4408000	4411000	but maybe that shows that they are paying attention
4411000	4415000	to the big, I guess, demand, for lack of a better term, online,
4415000	4418000	where people are asking for something like this.
4418000	4420000	There's a part of me that is wondering,
4420000	4422000	do people really want this,
4422000	4425000	or do people want it because they didn't have to pay for it?
4425000	4428000	So I kind of think if something like this is going to end up being officially supported,
4428000	4431000	you better believe you're going to have to activate your full WoW account
4431000	4433000	to get access to the vanilla server.
4433000	4436000	But I guess some people are completely okay with that,
4436000	4438000	and that's fine, I suppose.
4438000	4442000	So, Stoppy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4442000	4446000	they will be frisked for tar and or feathers.
4446000	4448000	Perhaps.
4450000	4454000	All right, anyhow, let's get to another segment here
4454000	4458000	we like to do every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.
4460000	4464000	Every week here on the program, DarkSakura steps into the vault
4464000	4468000	and finds a game ten years older or more that she thinks,
4468000	4472000	hey, you know what, you kids and your Overwatch,
4472000	4475000	your fancy-ass graphics, your online play,
4475000	4479000	you know what, you need to go back and play a classic like this one.
4479000	4482000	So DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
4482000	4486000	I have chosen a game that I have always wanted to play
4486000	4488000	and never got around to playing.
4488000	4491000	What? This one you haven't even played yourself?
4491000	4495000	But it's adorable, it's actually been, I've watched a bunch of it,
4495000	4497000	I've just never had a chance to.
4497000	4501000	So the game I've chosen is Rocket Knight Adventures.
4501000	4506000	And it came out in 1993, and it is, as far as I recall,
4506000	4511000	the first game developed and published by Konami for the Sega Genesis.
4511000	4514000	It came out in the U.S. on August 5th, 1993,
4514000	4521000	and in Japan on August 6th, so it actually came out in the U.S. first.
4521000	4524000	Although I guess technically it would be sort of simultaneous
4524000	4526000	since, you know, the time difference and all that.
4528000	4533000	It was also designed by the same person who did several of the Contra games,
4533000	4536000	including the Alien Wars Hardcore and Shattered Soldier.
4536000	4540000	So you play as a possum named Sparkster,
4540000	4545000	who fights an army of robots and pigs and vehicles,
4545000	4547000	and he has a sword and a rocket pack.
4547000	4551000	So a lot of it is side scrolling.
4551000	4556000	You also have a few horizontal scrolling shooters,
4556000	4560000	I guess kind of like how the old cotton games were.
4560000	4565000	And then another one we use a large machine for dueling.
4565000	4569000	It's a pretty neat game overall, really great music, really great graphics.
4569000	4576000	Although I thought it was stupid that they changed the difficulty level names for the U.S.
4576000	4580000	In the U.S. you have children mode, easy mode, normal, and hard.
4580000	4585000	In Japan you have normal, hard, very hard, and crazy hard.
4585000	4588000	And in Europe you have easy, hard, very hard, and crazy hard.
4588000	4591000	I just think it would need to have the difficulty to be crazy hard, you know?
4593000	4597000	So anyway, it's been a game that's been on my list for quite a while.
4598000	4603000	And see, they had evil pigs before Angry Birds did, just saying.
4604000	4608000	There was a version planned for SNES and it never came out.
4608000	4613000	It did have a sequel called Sparkster Rocket Knight Adventures 2,
4613000	4616000	and a spinoff for the SNES called Sparkster,
4616000	4619000	and they were produced roughly around the same time.
4619000	4631000	There was actually an announcement of another sequel in 2009 called Rocket Knight,
4631000	4638000	but it was supposed to be a sequel to the actual Sparkster, Rocket Knight Adventures 2,
4638000	4642000	that was developed by Climax.
4642000	4646000	And it came out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Steam,
4646000	4651000	but it wasn't really so involved by the original designers.
4652000	4656000	The character's been around in other games, Sparkster was,
4656000	4659000	in New International Tracking Field for Nintendo DS,
4659000	4663000	and Crazy Cart Racing for iPhone and iPod Touch.
4663000	4667000	He's also had cameos in Ganbare Goemon 2,
4667000	4674000	Kitaretsu Shogu Maginess,
4674000	4676000	I can't read it.
4676000	4678000	For SNES,
4678000	4680000	Natcher for Mega CD,
4680000	4683000	Jikyo Power Pro Wrestling 96,
4683000	4686000	and Max Voltage for SNES,
4686000	4689000	Mitsumete Knight for PlayStation.
4690000	4696000	He was also a disguised character for Twinbee Paradise for PC,
4696000	4701000	and a figure kind of looking like him in Shattered Soldier.
4705000	4707000	The character's actually been around for a while,
4707000	4708000	and been through different things,
4708000	4713000	but I sadly never got really much of a chance to play it.
4713000	4716000	But it's had good ratings for ages,
4716000	4718000	and it looks really pretty,
4718000	4719000	it looks a lot of fun,
4719000	4720000	a decent challenge,
4720000	4722000	and it's got great music.
4722000	4724000	So that's it.
4724000	4727000	You mean there's not enough time to play every single video game ever released,
4727000	4728000	Dark Sakura?
4728000	4730000	How could you?
4730000	4733000	No, I have not played this game either.
4733000	4735000	But I'd seen it before,
4735000	4737000	but kind of looking at it again now,
4737000	4739000	obviously it's been a long time since I've seen this,
4739000	4742000	I'm like, wow, this looks really good for a Genesis game.
4742000	4748000	I think it was sort of around the time of Ristar as well.
4748000	4753000	So it's that same kind of family of just really pretty Genesis games.
4753000	4754000	No, don't get me wrong.
4754000	4756000	I'm like, wow, I really miss something by not checking this out,
4756000	4757000	but that's what this segment is for,
4757000	4760000	to remind me that I need to go check it out.
4760000	4762000	So, all right, there it is,
4762000	4763000	your classic game of the week,
4763000	4766000	Rocket Knight Adventures for the Sega Genesis,
4766000	4769000	or Mega Drive, depending on what part of the world you're in.
4769000	4770000	There it is.
4770000	4771000	We're going to take a quick break,
4771000	4772000	but when we come back,
4772000	4774000	there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4774000	4776000	We're going to get to your phone calls,
4776000	4777000	as well as more news.
4777000	4779000	We're going to talk about Persona 5,
4779000	4782000	and how many of you all want more Stardew Valley?
4782000	4783000	Because we're going to talk about that as well,
4783000	4785000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,
4785000	4787000	right after this.
4794000	4795000	Welcome back, everybody,
4795000	4799000	to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 640 of our show,
4799000	4803000	In Progress, for May the 8th of 2016.
4803000	4804000	Just myself, Dark Soccer,
4804000	4806000	and Loki here in studio tonight,
4806000	4807000	but it feels like it's been forever
4807000	4809000	since it's been just the three of us here on the show.
4809000	4811000	So we're having a good time tonight,
4811000	4812000	going over the week's news,
4812000	4814000	of which there was a little bit.
4814000	4816000	So we're going to continue things on right now,
4816000	4819000	with our rapid-fire news, starting off with Loki.
4822000	4823000	I think, right, Loki?
4823000	4824000	We're going to do some rapid-fire news.
4824000	4826000	What are you watching over there that's taken away?
4826000	4827000	I saw this at the store,
4827000	4828000	and I was trying to figure out what the fuck it was.
4828000	4830000	It's this thing called an Anki Overdrive.
4830000	4832000	It looks like one of those slot-racing cars.
4832000	4834000	It's super fucking expensive.
4834000	4835000	Yeah, it is.
4835000	4836000	What the fuck is that?
4836000	4837000	I've seen that as well.
4837000	4841000	I was looking for the Bluetooth controllers on Toys R Us,
4841000	4843000	and they pulled that up again.
4843000	4844000	I'm like, what the fuck is that?
4844000	4845000	So I went and watched,
4845000	4847000	I was trying to watch a video to see what it was.
4847000	4849000	I still don't know what the fuck it is yet.
4849000	4850000	But anyways.
4850000	4852000	I remember.
4852000	4853000	Because I was looking,
4853000	4854000	and I'm like, oh, hey,
4854000	4856000	there's a piece of track that you can buy for $20.
4856000	4857000	I'm like, fuck that.
4857000	4859000	But I remember when I was younger,
4859000	4861000	I had a little thing that my grandma,
4861000	4862000	rest in peace, had bought me.
4862000	4864000	Well, apparently it's like slot-car racing.
4864000	4866000	It's like slot-car racing.
4866000	4867000	It's slot-car racing,
4867000	4872000	but instead of it being just stuck in a little groove,
4872000	4874000	and you just hit the gas,
4874000	4877000	this is actually a track that the cars stick onto,
4877000	4880000	and you can go back and forth and actually drive it.
4880000	4881000	Oh.
4881000	4882000	Like you're doing RC cars or something like that.
4882000	4883000	Okay, all right.
4883000	4885000	So at least that's what it looks like.
4885000	4888000	Somehow it ties with your Android device,
4888000	4889000	your iOS device.
4889000	4891000	That's awesome, though.
4891000	4892000	But it's super fucking expensive.
4892000	4893000	You better watch out,
4893000	4895000	because next week you're going to come to the studio,
4895000	4896000	and there's going to be a car
4896000	4898000	that races around our Sakura's chair.
4898000	4900000	Yeah, it's like they had that shit,
4900000	4901000	and all the fucking accessories for that.
4901000	4902000	Like they don't already do that at home.
4902000	4904000	Oh, but God forbid we actually have
4904000	4906000	a fucking Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.
4906000	4907000	You know, that's impossible.
4907000	4908000	All right, calm down.
4908000	4909000	Calm down.
4909000	4910000	Get to the news.
4910000	4911000	All right.
4911000	4913000	So hey, shocking.
4913000	4915000	Mighty number nine's not fucking out yet,
4915000	4917000	so it's been delayed again.
4917000	4918000	Oh, surprise.
4918000	4920000	Now it's coming out June 21st.
4920000	4921000	You know what that means?
4921000	4922000	I don't give a shit about it,
4922000	4924000	because that's the same day as fucking No Man's Sky,
4924000	4926000	I probably won't be playing Mighty Number Nine,
4926000	4927000	but if you're interested in it,
4927000	4931000	the new date's June 21st until it gets delayed again,
4931000	4933000	so look forward to that.
4933000	4935000	And this is kind of cool.
4935000	4937000	A couple more games that are now backwards compatible
4937000	4939000	with the Xbox One.
4939000	4941000	Jet Set Radio.
4941000	4946000	Also, they're going to be including Texas Hold'em,
4946000	4949000	and MX versus ATV Reflex are the new games
4949000	4951000	added to backwards compatibility,
4951000	4953000	but Jet Set Radio, that's pretty sweet.
4954000	4957000	They've been pretty good about keeping the drip on
4957000	4959000	with those Xbox One backwards compatible.
4959000	4961000	Yeah, I gotta say, that is one thing
4961000	4964000	I am very impressed with Microsoft on.
4964000	4967000	I really wish they had some sort of backwards compatible
4967000	4971000	solution for the PlayStation 4.
4971000	4974000	I mean, seriously, at this point, I'm very baffled.
4974000	4977000	Like, even if, like, let's just say, for example,
4977000	4980000	that PlayStation 3, I kind of understand
4980000	4983000	that that might be impossible to do backwards compatible
4983000	4986000	on the actual device, I kind of wish it was,
4986000	4990000	but PlayStation 2, I mean, they should have a solution
4990000	4992000	aside from buying that shit again,
4992000	4996000	and PlayStation 1 should be fucking playable as is.
4996000	4997000	Yeah, I know.
4997000	4999000	PSP or something, I mean, that should be,
4999000	5002000	I mean, fuck, the PSP could run that stuff.
5002000	5004000	That might be a nice little bombshell
5004000	5006000	for them to drop at E3, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.
5006000	5008000	Anyway, let's move on.
5008000	5011000	Games that have just disappeared, no longer available.
5011000	5013000	Project Cross Zone, believe it or not,
5013000	5017000	on the 3DS eShop, disappeared over the weekend.
5017000	5019000	This was the game where you could play game characters
5019000	5022000	from As an Evil, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Mega Man,
5022000	5024000	I mean, a lot of cool little characters in this game,
5024000	5026000	but unfortunately, it's gone.
5026000	5028000	The 3DS eShop no longer carries the game.
5028000	5032000	You, for a moment, couldn't even redownload it,
5032000	5033000	although that has changed.
5033000	5036000	You are now able to redownload the software,
5036000	5038000	so that's good if you did already buy it.
5038000	5040000	The thought is that maybe licensing issues
5040000	5042000	are coming into this, because after all, you know,
5042000	5044000	there were different worlds kind of coming together here
5044000	5046000	with Bandai Namco and the Capcom stuff,
5046000	5048000	so maybe the licensing thing ran out,
5048000	5051000	and that's what happened, but no official statement there
5051000	5053000	otherwise on why it was pulled.
5053000	5056000	Also, kind of surprising that this game disappeared,
5056000	5060000	and that is VVVVVVV is also gone from the 3DS eShop.
5060000	5064000	Why? Because there is a homebrew exploit
5064000	5066000	that apparently was uncovered by people.
5066000	5069000	I guess you can hack the 3DS by using VVVVV.
5069000	5071000	It was one of the games that would facilitate it.
5071000	5074000	Now, Terry Cavana, the game's creator,
5074000	5077000	didn't think that he was going to have to patch it,
5077000	5079000	but they ended up actually pulling the game,
5079000	5081000	and I'm sure it wasn't something intentional done by the creator,
5081000	5083000	but unfortunately, just there was some back door
5083000	5085000	somehow open in it that they were able to exploit there,
5085000	5089000	so yeah, VVVVVV is now not on the eShop,
5089000	5092000	but I have that game on my 3DS.
5092000	5094000	What can I exploit on that?
5094000	5098000	I need to figure that out, have some fun, run some homebrew.
5099000	5101000	Maybe I don't actually want to do that,
5101000	5104000	because I kind of like my 3DS, I don't want it to break or anything like that.
5104000	5106000	Anyhow, let's also talk about this,
5106000	5109000	because you know what, I might be 37 years old,
5109000	5112000	but I don't give a fuck. I want these shoes.
5112000	5115000	Have you seen these? This is the Nintendo and Vans crossover,
5115000	5118000	and if you haven't seen these, I urge you to look it up in Google News.
5118000	5120000	Yeah, do the Nintendo Vans thing.
5120000	5123000	There's some fun, like they're very loud shoes,
5123000	5125000	I wouldn't really be able to wear them to work, they're not exactly subtle,
5125000	5129000	but they're great, because there's one that has a big Mario face on it,
5129000	5132000	with all these Mario characters, there's the old school NES controller,
5132000	5137000	there's some that have Donkey Kong and some graphics inspired by that,
5137000	5141000	and the ones I want more than anything, the Princess Peach ones,
5141000	5144000	that have Peach and the stars and all that stuff over there.
5144000	5147000	Why isn't it a thing, you know how they have these shoes and everything,
5147000	5150000	it's obviously screen printed on,
5150000	5154000	why don't they have that where you can custom print stuff on the side of your shoes?
5154000	5157000	I would think they probably do.
5157000	5159000	That would be pretty awesome.
5159000	5162000	Yeah, well this is official, it's an official partnership and official license,
5162000	5165000	so there's no homebrew or whatever you need to be doing.
5165000	5168000	I will say though, because I do see some people in chat are like,
5168000	5171000	some of them are kind of tacky and whatever, they're a little loud for me.
5171000	5174000	I do notice some of them are a little more subtle than others,
5174000	5178000	like there's one, all it really has is a brick pattern from Mario Brothers,
5178000	5182000	around the side of the shoe, and it's a lot more subtle than some of the others.
5182000	5185000	The other one looks like they're camouflage shoes,
5185000	5189000	but when you look close up, it actually has the duck from Duck Hunt and the dog.
5189000	5192000	So like some of them are a little more subtle than others,
5192000	5194000	but like those Peach ones, they ain't subtle.
5194000	5197000	But I'm not here to be subtle.
5197000	5200000	Dark Sakura's shaking her head, a green movie over there.
5200000	5203000	Nah, I think if you're gonna go, go loud.
5203000	5204000	That's right.
5204000	5207000	If you're gonna do something, be bold.
5207000	5209000	Alright, anyway, Dark Sakura, what do you have?
5209000	5213000	Well, I've got something about Splatoon.
5213000	5219000	There is going to be a global Splatfest, and it is me Tomo themed.
5219000	5221000	Yay.
5221000	5226000	And it actually has to do with the question if you want to go fancy,
5226000	5230000	or go to a costume party, which I voted for the costume party,
5230000	5233000	because ain't a party like a costume party.
5233000	5236000	So it's all global.
5236000	5241000	The Splatfest starts on May 13th at 8 p.m. Pacific time.
5241000	5244000	It ends at 3 a.m. Pacific time on May 15th.
5244000	5247000	So go for it.
5247000	5252000	And then Stardew Valley, which I still need to play.
5252000	5256000	It's getting co-op and console versions and content stuff.
5256000	5262000	It will have new farm buildings, crops, artisan goods,
5262000	5266000	different farming mechanics.
5266000	5270000	You get Shane and Emily as marriage candidates,
5270000	5274000	and more marriage content, bug fixes, secrets,
5274000	5277000	and little bits added to Le World.
5277000	5279000	So go get it.
5279000	5282000	I should go get it.
5282000	5286000	Yeah, I'm surprised you have not gotten into Stardew Valley yet.
5286000	5288000	That game really seems like it's up your alley.
5288000	5289000	Do you know how much no time I have?
5289000	5291000	Oh, come on. Come on.
5291000	5293000	You could waste your night away with Stardew Valley.
5293000	5295000	I know you. You'll get into this.
5295000	5299000	You know what, though? I work late, and I like to sleep.
5299000	5302000	Which sometimes I like to sleep more than I like to play games.
5302000	5304000	I know. Blasphemy.
5304000	5306000	No, not when it comes to sleep.
5306000	5309000	Sleep is amazing, and then I dream weird shit.
5309000	5312000	But Stardew Valley is worth losing a little sleep for, I'm just saying.
5312000	5313000	Fine, fine.
5313000	5315000	Thank you. That is the right answer.
5315000	5317000	Hey, listeners, get me the game.
5317000	5319000	Put it on your wish list. See what happens.
5319000	5321000	I might be on my wish list. I don't know.
5321000	5324000	All right. Let's get to the Foogle question of the week.
5332000	5335000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
5335000	5339000	You slam those words together, and you get Foogle.
5339000	5343000	This week we asked on Google and Facebook Plus, we asked,
5343000	5347000	Hey, six more games were inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame this week.
5347000	5352000	Combined with last year's six, these are now the games in the Hall of Fame.
5352000	5354000	Okay, so here they are. Here's the 12 games.
5354000	5360000	Grand Theft Auto 3, Legend of Zelda, Oregon Trail, Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog,
5360000	5367000	Space Invaders, Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.
5367000	5372000	If you had to take one out and put in a game that you think should be there instead,
5372000	5374000	what Switch would you make?
5375000	5379000	This is going to be a fun one, but it's like our list list segment.
5379000	5382000	Sometimes you have to delete something in order to get the most efficient list.
5382000	5385000	All right, here we go. What are you going to remove and put in its place?
5385000	5390000	Retertainment says, I would substitute Doom for Wolfenstein 3D.
5390000	5394000	While Doom had an unquestionably huge impact on PC first person shooters,
5394000	5400000	Doom would not have had as much impact as it did without the foundation laid out by Wolfenstein 3D.
5400000	5407000	Fifth Dream says, I'd remove World of Warcraft and replace it with Final Fantasy 6. Best game ever.
5407000	5413000	Danielle R says, I would personally remove Grand Theft Auto 3 and substitute it with Mortal Kombat.
5413000	5415000	That's just personal preference though.
5415000	5420000	William Murderface says, I would replace The Legend of Zelda with The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.
5420000	5424000	Now if I could add a few, I would add Super Metroid, Final Fantasy X,
5424000	5428000	Kingdom Hearts, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland.
5428000	5433000	Kane.I.Am says, I wouldn't change anything, but I would add Secret of Evermore.
5433000	5435000	But that's just me, and what do I know?
5435000	5438000	Well, what do we know either, to be fair, Kane.I.Am.
5438000	5443000	TigerClawnChat says, I would replace Super Mario Brothers with Donkey Kong,
5443000	5446000	because without that game, there would not have been a Super Mario Brothers.
5446000	5451000	It was Mario's first appearance, and that's a game that should have been in the Video Game Hall of Fame.
5451000	5459000	Our buddy John B. from back in the day says, replace them all with Crysis. It's the best game ever.
5459000	5462000	Glad to see that troll's still back.
5462000	5469000	Veronica Isabel says, I would remove Pong and replace it with the cult classic Earthbound,
5469000	5473000	a game I know I'll love when I play it later this year. I'm currently playing Earthbound Beginnings.
5473000	5477000	Degenerate Johnny says, I would replace WoW with Final Fantasy.
5477000	5483000	Hall of Fame's are about original, iconic titles that delivered inspiration and continues to do so for future generation of titles,
5483000	5486000	not the biggest successes in the industry.
5486000	5492000	Princess Irena replied and said, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd swap Grand Theft Auto 3 with Final Fantasy 7.
5492000	5499000	If it's for a Hall of Fame, then few games are more famous than that one, and it's still a top seller to this day for some strange reason.
5499000	5503000	Doesn't hurt that everybody be mad dick-hyped for the remake, too.
5503000	5506000	Those are Princess's words, not mine.
5506000	5510000	Rage Nator says, I'd take out WoW and put in SOCOM 2 in its place.
5510000	5518000	SOCOM 2, the series as a whole, was an addicting, squad-based third-person shooter whose multiplayer basically made the PlayStation 2's online capabilities.
5518000	5522000	Yes, the Xbox had Halo, but we had SOCOM, dammit.
5522000	5531000	And then over on Google+, just one answer over on the Google+, that says, from MacDeft, I'd probably take out the Oregon Trail since it's more of an American thing,
5531000	5534000	and not that really influential on the history of video games.
5534000	5540000	What game would I place instead of it? Metroid. It created a whole genre that's still very popular today,
5540000	5546000	and so many great games that will probably be in the Hall of Fame in future years are inspired by it.
5546000	5555000	Whoo, those are some really good answers, you guys, and I'm gonna ask here in studio to make the same decision if you think you can.
5555000	5559000	What game would you take off the list, and what game would you replace it with?
5559000	5563000	So, Loki, let's start with you. What game would you take off the list, and what would you replace it with?
5563000	5576000	Um, I would take... let's see, I would take The Sims off the list and replace it with... Metroid.
5576000	5578000	And why Metroid?
5578000	5589000	Because it's another classic game that really should be on there. I mean, it's kind of formed its own genre as far as, you know, Metroidvania games and everything.
5590000	5598000	Plus, again, The Sims... I mean, The Sims was alright, it was just... I don't know. I don't think it's that classic.
5598000	5599000	Fair enough.
5599000	5601000	Darsagra?
5612000	5615000	I guess that I would take off...
5619000	5621000	I'd take off Grand Theft Auto 3.
5622000	5624000	And what would you replace it with?
5627000	5629000	The Guardian Legend.
5632000	5633000	Of course you would!
5633000	5638000	I would honestly, I would almost even say instead of, like, Metroid, Street Fighter 2.
5638000	5647000	Damn you, you just took my answer. I was gonna say, you bastard, but I would actually take off... I'm gonna get so much shit because nobody said this game, I don't think.
5647000	5651000	I would take off Sonic the Hedgehog and replace it with Street Fighter 2.
5651000	5656000	And look, I love Sonic. I don't like his friends, but I like Sonic.
5656000	5662000	But here's the thing about Sonic. I feel that for a lot of the reasons Sonic is there, Super Mario Brothers is there.
5662000	5666000	And just so, I kind of just think they're both platformers.
5666000	5670000	And I also think later Sonic games have kind of tarnished the original Sonic.
5670000	5673000	I hate to say it, but that's just what it is for me.
5673000	5677000	Like, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 kind of diminished the original.
5677000	5681000	So, anyway, but I think Street Fighter 2 needs to be on there for what it did for the arcade scene.
5681000	5684000	I'm even saying that over Super Metroid.
5684000	5690000	Like, my heart would say, oh, Super Metroid or Civilization should be there.
5690000	5694000	But my head says, Street Fighter 2 did so much for the arcade scene in the 90s.
5694000	5700000	It's hard to dial it down to six, so, I mean, there's always the next year.
5701000	5706000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I would remove Street Fighter 2 and then replace it with Jones in the fast lane.
5707000	5711000	And Bobby Black Wolf also reminds us they can't induct every game in the first few years.
5711000	5714000	Well, dammit, why not?
5714000	5716000	I'm surprised Halo isn't on that list.
5716000	5722000	Of course, then when we get to, like, ten years from now, then we're going to be scraping for games to put on there.
5722000	5727000	So, all right, let's move on. We're going to go pass the football question of the week.
5727000	5730000	Let's get to, yes, thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.
5730000	5734000	MissNudeWorld96, one can hope, one can hope.
5734000	5736000	Loki, why don't you go ahead with your next story?
5736000	5738000	That should have really been in the first year, to be honest.
5738000	5740000	I mean, that's, like, number one.
5740000	5744000	So this is kind of cool. I'm always, you know, excited when I hear about a new Volition game.
5744000	5749000	But there's a rumor that Volition and Deep Silver are working on a title called Agents of Mayhem.
5749000	5754000	I can only hope that's a working title for another Saints Row game, but I will take...
5754000	5757000	Oh, God, do you think it's going to be an Avengers parody?
5757000	5761000	Because that's what, when you say, like, Agents of Mayhem, I don't know why, but that's, like, what pops into my mind.
5761000	5763000	It's going to be, like, a superhero thing.
5763000	5765000	I'd be down.
5765000	5767000	I'd be down, too.
5767000	5772000	I mean, as much as I hate on later Saints Row games, I'm still going to buy every single one of them.
5772000	5775000	So, I mean, I only hate because I love.
5775000	5777000	If that makes sense.
5777000	5779000	I criticize because I love.
5779000	5781000	That's it.
5781000	5783000	But, yeah.
5783000	5786000	So, hey, I'm down for anything that's coming out from Volition.
5786000	5791000	I wish it was another Saints Row game, but I'll take Agents of Mayhem.
5791000	5796000	If they want to take some time off and do a different title, a new IP, I think that's okay, too.
5796000	5801000	Or perhaps Saints Row has gotten so far from it that it's not going to be an Avengers parody.
5801000	5807000	Or perhaps Saints Row has gotten so far from Saints Row, it should just be its own thing.
5807000	5809000	Well, and maybe that's what they do.
5809000	5813000	They take some time off to do a new IP, and then they're going to come back and reboot Saints Row.
5813000	5817000	Because enough time will have passed, they can be like, okay, now we're going to reboot Saints Row.
5817000	5819000	So, maybe that's the plan.
5819000	5821000	I'm fine with that.
5821000	5823000	Or forget it. It'll just be Saints Row 5, and that'll be that.
5823000	5827000	SSU100Matt says, Superhero-themed Saints Row. I'd buy it.
5827000	5829000	You know what would be cool? Agents of Mayhem.
5829000	5832000	Because this kind of reminds me, I watched Kick-Ass 2 last night.
5832000	5835000	But like a Kick-Ass style game.
5835000	5840000	Where you're a superhero, but a superhero without any fucking powers.
5840000	5843000	You're just some dude dressed up that's fighting crime or something.
5843000	5845000	What do you mean, like Watchmen?
5845000	5847000	Why not?
5847000	5849000	Well, yeah, sort of like Watchmen, but I don't know.
5849000	5851000	Alright.
5851000	5854000	Hey, this is pretty big for some people.
5854000	5856000	I've been waiting a long time for this game.
5856000	5859000	And this is a really huge legendary series.
5859000	5861000	And that's Persona.
5861000	5863000	Atlus had a countdown that was running on their website.
5863000	5868000	And it finally ticked to the end for this Persona 5 countdown.
5868000	5872000	And what was revealed, the release date for Persona 5 in Japan.
5872000	5876000	Unfortunately, it was not revealed yet for the states.
5876000	5879000	Beyond what they said originally, which was 2016.
5879000	5883000	But Persona 5 will be out in Japan on September 15th.
5883000	5887000	That is coming out, remember, on the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4.
5887000	5890000	Because they originally announced Persona 5 for the PlayStation 3.
5890000	5895000	But it's been in development so long that it turns out they're going to put it on the PlayStation 4 as well.
5895000	5898000	Probably because so many people have moved on to PlayStation 4.
5898000	5900000	And there's no backwards compatibilities.
5900000	5902000	They kind of have to do both. Who knows?
5902000	5904000	Anyway, there's actually a little trailer.
5904000	5907000	And if you haven't seen the trailer, you should check it out.
5907000	5909000	Because it's pretty badass.
5910000	5912000	The whole anime, across the RPG.
5912000	5914000	Again, this series is quite legendary.
5914000	5918000	I have to admit, it's not one that I've played extensively.
5918000	5920000	I've played a little bit of Persona 4.
5920000	5923000	I really need to stop playing these fucking MMO time sinks.
5923000	5926000	And give Persona more attention than it probably deserves.
5926000	5930000	But I will say that these games have a lot of depth.
5930000	5934000	And it's pretty impressive what they pack onto one disc for these games.
5934000	5936000	So I'm looking forward to Persona 5.
5936000	5941000	Hopefully, like the other games, you don't have to have played the previous ones to be able to pick this one up.
5941000	5943000	And I don't think it'll be the case with this game either.
5943000	5946000	So there you go, Persona 5 is going to be out on September 15th.
5946000	5948000	No word on the release date in the States.
5948000	5951000	I'm assuming they're holding that for E3.
5951000	5954000	Hopefully it's still making 2016.
5954000	5959000	But maybe it'll just be November as opposed to September.
5959000	5960000	We'll see though.
5960000	5962000	I can't play Stardew Valley now.
5962000	5963000	Why?
5964000	5968000	There's new Hot to Full Boyfriend games for me to play.
5970000	5971000	Oh my god.
5971000	5972000	I cannot do these things.
5972000	5974000	I'm not even going to ask if you're going to have time to play Persona.
5974000	5978000	Because, no, I gotta get the 500th ending in Hot to Full Boyfriend instead.
5978000	5979000	Hi.
5981000	5982000	Hey.
5982000	5983000	Alright.
5983000	5987000	And Dungeon Buster reminding, yes, each Persona is pretty standalone.
5987000	5990000	And you still have time to play and finish Persona 4.
5990000	5991000	That is true.
5991000	5993000	I need to just suck it up and do it.
5993000	5994000	It's on my Vita.
5994000	5996000	What else am I playing on my Vita?
5996000	5999000	I bought it in some super sale on the Vita not that long ago.
5999000	6002000	Apparently the game's already on my wish list, so whatever.
6002000	6003000	I'll get it later.
6003000	6004000	There you go.
6004000	6006000	I'll do it later.
6006000	6008000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6009000	6012000	I have a Finally for us.
6012000	6014000	Finally.
6014000	6017000	We're finally getting Raiden 5.
6017000	6022000	It's going to come out in the US, or North America in general, on May 11th.
6022000	6025000	And it's going to have some neat multiplayer elements, like a cheer system,
6025000	6028000	so you feel better about yourself while you're killing things.
6028000	6036000	Anyway, basically you can buff other players, like by messages or ratings.
6036000	6038000	And you get leaderboards, and there's going to be eight stages in all,
6038000	6041000	with of course multiple different ships and all kinds of crazy weapons.
6041000	6049000	And the Raiden series has been my big favorite when it comes to shooting games.
6049000	6055000	And especially getting that big lightning thing that would just latch on to things
6055000	6057000	and take up the whole screen.
6057000	6059000	So over the top.
6059000	6060000	I love it.
6060000	6062000	So happy.
6062000	6065000	Dark Soccer will need to get an Xbox One so she can play this game.
6065000	6069000	Dark Soccer will be coming over to Rob's house so she can play this game.
6069000	6070000	Fair enough.
6070000	6073000	I'm going to treat it like I did Final Fantasy VII.
6073000	6074000	I didn't know the PlayStation.
6074000	6076000	I just bought the game and went to other people's houses.
6076000	6078000	No shit.
6078000	6080000	No, sometimes that works.
6080000	6081000	Yep.
6081000	6083000	That's hilarious.
6083000	6085000	All right.
6085000	6087000	SSJ100Matt in chat asks,
6087000	6092000	Can there be a Bobby Black Wolf forever mode that reduces the number of bullets by 75%?
6092000	6095000	Would it be as fun?
6095000	6098000	That's asking for an easy mode in Dark Souls,
6098000	6102000	which I'm not even going to go there with that discussion this week.
6102000	6103000	All right.
6103000	6105000	Loki, what do you have for us?
6105000	6106000	All right.
6106000	6108000	So, you know, when you think of Best Buy,
6108000	6112000	you think of the lack of Bluetooth controllers for your Android phones,
6112000	6115000	and you also think about different experiences where they have, you know,
6115000	6118000	where you can go view Nintendo games and that type of thing.
6118000	6121000	Well, now they're going to also have, you know,
6121000	6124000	where you can actually check out the Oculus Rift.
6124000	6127000	And this is going to be starting actually, well, it's already started.
6127000	6129000	In fact, I actually saw it today.
6129000	6130000	They had the Rift set up.
6130000	6136000	But you can go to select Best Buy locations and check out the Oculus Rift.
6136000	6140000	There are 48 locations nationwide.
6140000	6142000	Will you be taking the trip?
6142000	6146000	No, because I was there today, and I have an Oculus Rift dev kit.
6146000	6147000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6147000	6149000	And I don't really need that.
6149000	6152000	I had a big Gear VR, so I mean, heck yeah,
6152000	6155000	I'd like to check out the retail one to kind of, you know, see what it was.
6155000	6158000	There was someone using it today, so I didn't get a chance to do that.
6158000	6160000	And honestly, when I looked at it originally,
6160000	6163000	I thought it was just the Gear VR, but then it kind of did look different.
6163000	6165000	So I think it was the actual Rift.
6165000	6167000	All right.
6167000	6168000	Well, whatever.
6168000	6171000	Well, this reminds me about a 3DS game that I need to pick up
6171000	6174000	because these classics are a lot of fun.
6174000	6177000	The Sega 3D Classics Collection is available on the 3DS,
6177000	6179000	and I definitely want to check that out.
6179000	6182000	And Dark Sakura, I'm really surprised you're not all over this game,
6182000	6186000	but actually, after this news that made the blog rounds this week,
6186000	6191000	there is a secret tenth game that is unlockable in the game,
6191000	6194000	and it is not advertised on the box or anything like that
6194000	6196000	because they actually advertise there's nine games in the collection,
6196000	6198000	but there is a bonus tenth game.
6198000	6200000	So here's how you unlock it.
6200000	6203000	You go to the Extras menu where you have Maze Walker
6203000	6205000	and Fantasy Zone 2 Master System version,
6205000	6209000	and you tap the area next to the Back to Menu button,
6209000	6211000	and an enemy will pop up.
6211000	6217000	And as you tap the enemy, the original Master System Fantasy Zone will load,
6217000	6222000	and that is the extra game, Fantasy Zone for the Master System in the Sega 3D Classics.
6222000	6224000	You know why I care very little?
6224000	6225000	Why?
6225000	6230000	Because I have a Master System, and I have Fantasy Zone for Master System.
6230000	6234000	You don't want it in your pocket everywhere you go?
6234000	6235000	No.
6235000	6237000	All right. I tried.
6237000	6241000	Well, on top of that, I don't know.
6241000	6248000	Actually, I think I do have a couple of portable, whatever.
6248000	6252000	I sometimes do refer to that location near my pocket as the Fantasy Zone anyway,
6252000	6254000	so it's all good.
6254000	6256000	Get ready.
6256000	6258000	Do you have a pair of boxer shorts that says,
6258000	6262000	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready?
6262000	6263000	That's totally the name of my blog.
6263000	6265000	Oh my God, we need to.
6265000	6271000	Okay, that's going to be the first item for sale in the OLR merchandise store.
6271000	6275000	It's going to be underwear that says, Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.
6275000	6276000	Or is that trademarked?
6276000	6277000	Would we get in trouble for that?
6277000	6278000	Probably, but you know what?
6278000	6279000	What?
6279000	6283000	If you go to darksakura.com, the first thing you see is my blog that starts off,
6283000	6285000	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
6285000	6288000	But is it on panties?
6288000	6290000	It could be.
6290000	6295000	I don't tell what's in my drawers.
6295000	6297000	I guess you could always do, you could bend it a little bit and do,
6297000	6300000	Welcome to my Fantasy Zone, get ready, and then it's not the same thing.
6300000	6302000	That was used in Bayonetta.
6302000	6303000	Oh.
6303000	6305000	Welcome to my Fantasy Zone.
6305000	6307000	That's right. God damn.
6307000	6308000	All right, anyway.
6308000	6309000	Okay, so it doesn't say welcome.
6309000	6313000	It just says Fantasy Zone, and it says blog de darksakura.
6313000	6314000	Seems like you need an update.
6314000	6315000	Anyway.
6315000	6319000	I do need to update my blog, though, because the last thing I posted about was Oprah.
6320000	6322000	It was.
6322000	6324000	Well, what else do you need to post about?
6324000	6327000	It was about Oprah supporting Weight Watchers, which is stupid.
6327000	6332000	Do you want the queen of yo-yo dieters as your Enos spokeswoman, really?
6332000	6334000	Oprah may be fabulous.
6334000	6335000	She's absolutely fabulous.
6335000	6338000	But she is as fallible as the rest of us.
6338000	6340000	Well, it's hard to lose weight when all you're eating is yo-yos.
6340000	6342000	I mean, I don't know.
6342000	6346000	Moving on, there's more with this whole Sega 3D classics thing.
6346000	6352000	So, you know, some folks are wondering, hey, what about other Sega platforms, like Saturn and Dreamcast?
6352000	6358000	Well, Yosuke Okunare with Sega says, here's the reason why you haven't gotten 3D classics.
6358000	6362000	That has more to do with how the teams are divided amongst Sega as a company.
6362000	6371000	Up until now, M2 has been focused on 8-bit and 16-bit ports, whereas Dreamcast and Saturn titles were done by staff that were assigned to those games from teams like AM2 or Sega of China.
6372000	6378000	The idea behind that was to make these porting lines run as efficiently as possible with the teams learning the know-how behind specific systems.
6378000	6387000	At the time, if M2 had researched porting a Model 2 or 3 on their own and came to Sega for that, we'd have told them we had already had teams assigned to it or the market isn't right at the time.
6387000	6393000	That said, that sort of corporate direction has ended recently, and M2 is the only port line that really exists anymore.
6393000	6397000	There is the possibility that ports for Model 3 could continue on their side.
6397000	6403000	So what I'm hearing from this is there's a lot of corporate crap that they've got to cut through, so fans, you just need to bitch more.
6403000	6410000	Tweet at Sega that you want Space Channel 5 as a 3D classic, because who does not want Space Michael as a 3D classic?
6410000	6414000	Find me that person so I can tell them through their face that they're wrong.
6414000	6415000	Thank you, Lala.
6415000	6419000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.
6420000	6432000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is our email address, and we like to open up the mailbag every week, and DarkSakura dives in head first and finds an email or five to read for us here on air.
6432000	6433000	How many emails do we have this week?
6433000	6434000	One.
6434000	6437000	Just one? Fine. Do the email. Do the thing.
6437000	6438000	Where's my music?
6438000	6440000	I didn't have it ready, I'm sorry.
6440000	6443000	I cannot read emails without my music.
6443000	6451000	I do not have, unfortunately, I do not have your little cutesy theme, so tonight for the mailbag I'm giving you Enter the Gungeon.
6451000	6452000	You've been listening to-
6452000	6454000	Wait, that's not Enter the Gungeon.
6454000	6455000	That's not Enter the Gungeon.
6455000	6456000	What the hell?
6456000	6457000	Hot mess.
6457000	6458000	God damn it.
6458000	6460000	This is hot mess radio.
6460000	6462000	I don't know what I have queued up.
6462000	6463000	You'll buy what?
6463000	6467000	Apparently I did not actually have the Gungeon song in the same location on the folder.
6467000	6470000	Fine, you can have Shovel Knight.
6474000	6475000	By the way, Rob-
6475000	6476000	What?
6476000	6480000	I've decided that our little project should be called The Hot Mess.
6480000	6482000	For shovelry and emails!
6482000	6483000	Yes.
6484000	6485000	Okay.
6485000	6486000	Hello, OLR.
6486000	6490000	It's been a while since I've sent you guys an email, so here it is.
6490000	6494000	I have this feeling that the Wii U was Nintendo's Saturn.
6494000	6499000	Except for the Wii, Nintendo's last four consoles haven't really been true commercial successes.
6499000	6501000	The same story time and time again.
6501000	6505000	They had their share of great games, but always a lack of third party support.
6505000	6508000	You know, that was not the Saturn in Japan.
6508000	6511000	Saturn in Japan, tons of third party support.
6511000	6513000	Namely, Capcom.
6513000	6518000	I don't think Mario and friends will continue to save Nintendo.
6518000	6521000	I truly hope the NX will not be Nintendo's Dreamcast.
6521000	6523000	Dude, but the Dreamcast was great!
6523000	6526000	Anyway, I've finally been able to try the Oculus Rift.
6526000	6528000	It's cool, but not $600 cool.
6529000	6533000	It did impress me a lot, but it's missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.
6533000	6535000	Maybe it's the huge goggles?
6535000	6538000	Anyway, thanks for reading my email and doing the show.
6538000	6540000	Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.
6541000	6543000	Thank you, Fabrice.
6544000	6546000	I love my Dreamcast, by the way.
6546000	6550000	I was just thinking about taking out the Dreamcast the other day and playing through Rainbow Cotton.
6550000	6553000	The thing with that email that I'm kind of like...
6553000	6557000	I respect the opinion, of course, and all that stuff, but the thing that doesn't sit with me
6557000	6561000	is when you say that Nintendo's last four consoles have not done well except for the Wii.
6561000	6568000	But, like, I think you're really writing off way too fast how big the Wii was.
6568000	6575000	The Wii was the biggest video game console of period, all period, time, period.
6575000	6579000	And, granted, a lot of that is because of Wii Sports and so forth, but...
6579000	6583000	I mean, yes, when you follow up the greatest console of all time...
6583000	6589000	Or, I'm sorry, the best-selling console of all time, because when I say the greatest, other opinions are going to get involved.
6589000	6597000	When you sell the best-selling of all time, you follow it up with the Wii U, which, you know, next to the Wii, tanked.
6597000	6601000	Now, I still like the Wii U for a lot of the Nintendo exclusives and all that stuff, but...
6601000	6603000	It's getting a lot more play in my house.
6603000	6607000	Yeah, the third-party thing fucked them. That is essentially what it boils down to.
6607000	6617000	The third-party thing fucked them, and it was too hard to port the 360 and the PlayStation games and all that, and the 1 and the 4 and all that.
6617000	6623000	It's too hard to port those to the Wii U, because the second screen, you know, had this whole other element to it.
6623000	6626000	And companies didn't want to invest the time, because there just weren't...
6626000	6629000	It was one of those things that kept snowballing.
6629000	6635000	The Wii U didn't have the games on it that people really wanted to play at first, so it wasn't selling enough units.
6635000	6642000	So, companies didn't want to invest the time to make another game for it, because the units weren't out there, and it just kind of snowballed from there.
6642000	6647000	That's why the NX is being delayed, because they're not going to launch with a weak lineup again.
6647000	6657000	That's why they're holding Zelda for the launch of the NX, because it worked for them with the Wii, to launch the Wii with the Zelda title that everybody was anticipating.
6657000	6662000	And remember, the Wii was the biggest console of all time.
6662000	6673000	So, if, and this is a big if, if the NX has Zelda, and it has the real successor to Wii Sports that Nintendo Land was not,
6673000	6680000	and I'm not saying that game has to be Wii Sports 2, if it has something as accessible and as must-play as Wii Sports,
6680000	6685000	then the NX will do awesome out the gate, and the third-party support, not a problem at all.
6685000	6690000	I guess in some ways you could say Nintendo Land killed the Wii U.
6691000	6697000	That's essentially what it boils down to. Nintendo Land killed the Wii U. Period.
6697000	6702000	Alright, that's it for emails, right? Alright.
6702000	6707000	Then we'll get to the FUs of the week. We're going to do that right now.
6707000	6711000	And I do have the theme music for the FUs of the week. That's the good news.
6720000	6722000	Here is punishment.
6724000	6726000	This is fucked up.
6728000	6729000	Dark soccer.
6729000	6733000	FU to all the Star Wars games are on sale on Steam.
6733000	6741000	Also FU to having to work when Bernie's going to be in town tomorrow and I want to go to the rally,
6741000	6743000	because I am wearing my Bernie shirt right now.
6743000	6747000	I wanted to wear my Bernie shirt just because I was walking into a Walmart.
6747000	6750000	And I wore my Bernie shirt in a Walmart doing shopping.
6754000	6756000	At least traffic will be awful and you don't want to be in there.
6756000	6759000	Also FU to everyone at DragCon right now.
6761000	6763000	FU with love.
6763000	6764000	Loki.
6765000	6770000	I guess just FU to the fact that I haven't mentally been able to work on my game.
6771000	6772000	Too tired.
6772000	6777000	But not necessarily too tired. I did have some brain-tards the other day.
6777000	6782000	I'm still kind of just deciding how I want to look once I figure that out,
6782000	6786000	because that's the main portion of it since it's going to be the box, the base and everything.
6786000	6792000	Then I can build the rest, but since I haven't decided on that first part because I keep changing my mind,
6792000	6794000	it's kind of where I'm stuck at the moment.
6794000	6795000	Soon.
6796000	6801000	My FU of the week goes to the fact that the weekend went by so fast.
6801000	6803000	I need another three-day weekend soon.
6803000	6806000	I really enjoy my job and everything, but I really enjoy weekends.
6806000	6808000	So I need another three-day weekend soon.
6808000	6812000	I actually might be taking one, because Shane is really trying to convince me.
6812000	6823000	And you know Shane in convincing, but he's really trying to convince me to take a Friday off to go do the Mass Effect ride at Great America.
6823000	6825000	And I kind of want to do it.
6825000	6827000	I want to, but I can't get my Friday off. I tried.
6827000	6829000	Ugh. Man.
6829000	6835000	All right. I've got to address this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com before we get to our last couple stories here,
6835000	6839000	because some folks are wanting to correct me when I'm talking about that the Wii is the biggest console of all time.
6839000	6842000	Some folks in chat saying it was the PlayStation 2, it was the PlayStation 2.
6842000	6844000	Various folks saying that.
6844000	6852000	And to be fair, I don't have the sites in front of me, and I may be confusing the whole fact that Wii Sports is the biggest game of all time
6852000	6856000	against that, so if I'm, you know, losing the numbers game there, then fine.
6856000	6860000	I would say in the context of my argument, though, ultimately it doesn't matter,
6860000	6866000	because you look at what the Wii sold, especially for last generation next to the 360 and the PlayStation 3,
6866000	6871000	and I still think my points are somewhat valid. It doesn't really change the context of my argument.
6871000	6875000	But I will, okay, maybe I made a boo-boo and the PlayStation 2 is bigger.
6875000	6879000	I thought when you factored in the US and Europe, the Wii still outsold it.
6879000	6884000	I mean, I would totally get that the PlayStation 2 outsold it in Japan, but whatever, I don't want to...
6884000	6887000	I trust you guys, so whatever, I just want to get that out there.
6887000	6892000	Let's see, what else in chat over at live.funknetwork.com.
6892000	6896000	There was another one I wanted to show here.
6896000	6901000	Dr. Tsuya said, I think Nintendo is definitely trying to get the NX right.
6901000	6904000	I mean, instead of releasing it now and next to nothing like they had on the Wii U,
6904000	6907000	they're just going to forfeit this holiday and launch next spring.
6908000	6913000	Bobby Blackwolf says, just because we hardcore don't like the system doesn't mean it wasn't massively successful.
6913000	6919000	Oh, I know the other part. Oh, this one from an anonymous user in our chat room says,
6919000	6925000	the Wii was the best-selling console that nobody played after they'd owned it for a month.
6925000	6929000	Yes, but you do understand in the context of things, that doesn't really matter, right?
6929000	6931000	Because Nintendo still got the money.
6931000	6933000	Without a new Excite Truck game, come on.
6933000	6935000	You want an Excite Truck game on NX?
6935000	6936000	Excite Truck game.
6936000	6937000	That would actually be awesome.
6937000	6943000	Not Excite Bots. Excite Bots was totally wrong. That is in the wrong direction.
6943000	6948000	Minigames are not something that's involved in a racing game. Excite Truck was awesome.
6948000	6954000	I will say, though, to that comment's credit and so forth, and to what ultimately happened with the Wii,
6954000	6964000	it would be nice to see really strong first-party support that is planned out through a seven-year or so life cycle
6964000	6969000	so that it doesn't feel like all your biggest shit was in the first couple years and then that's it.
6969000	6971000	Like, the support just kind of died off for it.
6971000	6976000	Because the Wii was kind of expected to be carried by third parties at the end there,
6976000	6982000	and because the Wii was so successful, whether it outsold the PS2 or not, the Wii was so successful,
6982000	6984000	it had so many dumpy games on it.
6984000	6990000	There were so many dumpy games on the Wii, especially at the end of its life cycle.
6990000	6994000	So, hopefully less of that on the NX, but we will see.
6994000	6998000	Alright, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we will open it up for calls.
6998000	7004000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Loki.
7004000	7012000	So, there's a new Star Wars game in the works with EA, and it's being worked on by Respawn Entertainment,
7012000	7017000	the developers behind Titanfall. That's exciting.
7018000	7024000	Speaking of which, I wanted a Titanfall game, which I should be getting, hopefully, the way I just see her.
7024000	7028000	Or maybe early next year. But they're going to be working on it.
7028000	7031000	And it's because of the single-player campaign this time.
7031000	7034000	I thought Titanfall 2 was a given for this year's E3.
7034000	7041000	I'm hyped for that. And Battlefield 1, even though, I mean, because the trailer looked awesome.
7041000	7045000	You know all I want out of E3, especially now the NX is out of the picture.
7045000	7048000	All I want is that new Mass Effect game.
7048000	7054000	That's a thing, too. Like, I mean, it's seriously, you know, with Nintendo, they're not going to have a whole lot releasing.
7054000	7059000	There's not a lot of focus being put on them. Like, that's why I think they...
7059000	7064000	I mean, Zelda's good and all, but they need something to kind of like show me...
7064000	7067000	Like, because, okay, cool. I'm excited for Zelda.
7067000	7070000	But how's it going to look on the Wii U versus like...
7070000	7077000	I mean, because porting the game through the Wii U that's on a PlayStation 4 is totally fucking different, you know?
7077000	7080000	How's it going to look between those two systems?
7080000	7086000	And also, what is the draw for the NX? What is it that's going to sell me this system?
7086000	7087000	What's the Wii Sports?
7087000	7092000	Well, no, not necessarily Wii Sports. What's like, how does it control?
7092000	7095000	What exactly is the hook? What's unique about this concept?
7095000	7099000	How does the game sell the hook? Wii Sports is a great example of how to sell the hook.
7099000	7103000	Nintendo Land, unfortunately, was a bad one. Anyway.
7103000	7110000	Although, well, here's before the angry emails and stuff, it wasn't necessarily that Nintendo or Nintendo Land was the bad one,
7110000	7114000	but, I mean, it's just like the minigame collection thing just didn't...
7114000	7116000	It didn't work the same way that it did in Wii Sports.
7116000	7122000	And I think, I just, I don't know, like, a lot of them, I think you needed too many people to really see how it worked.
7122000	7124000	I don't know. Anyway, I don't want to get into it.
7124000	7129000	I do have one more story for you guys, though, before I open up the Skype line.
7129000	7133000	And that is about the game Momotaru Densetsu.
7133000	7134000	Konami has announced that...
7134000	7136000	Hey, it's the little boy who came out of the peach.
7136000	7142000	That's right. Momotaru Densetsu is a title from Konami, of all places, so I guess this is something else they have,
7142000	7149000	is going to be coming out for 3DS, Wii U, PlayStation 4, 3, and PS Vita.
7149000	7152000	This was a board game style game, if you didn't know that.
7152000	7157000	It was last on the Nintendo DS. The last Momotaru Densetsu game was in 2012.
7157000	7163000	In the game, you can go around by ship, by rail, by plane, and you gain wealth by buying properties.
7163000	7167000	And you get rivals, like the god of poverty and so forth.
7167000	7178000	So, no idea what else with this game, but more information, I guess, is coming on a Denjin Gaka Nico Nico livestream on May 5th,
7178000	7182000	which actually would have already happened, but I didn't see any additional news that came out of it from there.
7182000	7184000	I didn't see a date or anything like that.
7184000	7186000	But there you go.
7186000	7192000	And yes, the main character actually wears a little peach on his hat, just in case you didn't know that.
7192000	7193000	There you go.
7193000	7199000	Alright, that's it. We're going to open up the Skype line right now. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype.
7199000	7202000	You all have Skype on your smartphones and your game consoles and all that.
7202000	7207000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
7207000	7211000	Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to touch on while we wait for some calls here.
7211000	7213000	No, slow news week is slow.
7213000	7217000	Yeah, it was a little bit slow. I mean, there were some big stories, but overall it was a little slower.
7217000	7222000	I have had time at work now since I'm doing stuff that's data entry related, so I can listen to the podcast.
7222000	7225000	So, I have listened to all of the episodes of guys on the show.
7225000	7228000	Oh, god. When are you going to come on and guest?
7228000	7234000	I don't know. At some point. The problem is, it's hard for me to record during the week because I have to put the kids to bed.
7234000	7236000	So, that means I'm not available until after 8.
7236000	7240000	I understand. What was your favorite episode of guys on the show?
7240000	7245000	Let's see. I'm trying to think.
7245000	7248000	Did you hear the recent one with trolling?
7248000	7252000	Yeah, I did listen to the recent one. The trolling episode one.
7252000	7256000	I'm trying to think. Yeah, that's tough. Let's see.
7256000	7262000	Probably the... I'm trying to think what was the most interesting one.
7262000	7267000	It was... I'll say this. My personal favorite so far was the furry one.
7267000	7270000	Yeah, that was interesting. I like that one.
7270000	7273000	I think that was the one where I was really like, okay, we learned something.
7273000	7278000	Yeah, that was pretty cool. I don't remember. There was another one. It was about...
7278000	7283000	Maybe it was the retro gaming one. I don't remember which one exactly.
7283000	7286000	That's fun too. We're looking forward to doing more. It's a fun show.
7286000	7291000	Unfortunately, we were out for a couple weeks between the whole thing that I was going through with the personal issues.
7291000	7297000	And then with... Extover was sick one week, so we couldn't do it that week.
7297000	7299000	We were going to do the trolling thing last week, but we couldn't do it.
7299000	7301000	But thankfully, Parman and Princess Irene were able to reach out.
7301000	7307000	Yeah, the problem is I don't know what... If I were to be on the show, I have no idea what my special interests would be.
7307000	7311000	We need to talk about laser tag experiences from back in the day or something.
7311000	7318000	I think we need to tell laser tag stories and how Loki would bring back the laser tag world.
7318000	7320000	I think that would be a thing.
7320000	7324000	Or building a main cab is something Bobby is saying there in chat. We'll see.
7324000	7328000	Anyway, let's get to the Skype line. We got a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?
7328000	7331000	Hi, this is Raginator.
7331000	7334000	You don't know your name. All right. Raginator, what's up, buddy?
7334000	7339000	For a second, I heard a little feedback and was hearing my own voice for whatever reasons.
7339000	7341000	That got me off, but...
7341000	7343000	Sorry about that. Well, what's on your mind tonight?
7343000	7353000	Yeah, I just want to touch on something that Dr. Sakura kind of mentioned in a brief passing during her FUs of the week.
7353000	7358000	The recent Star Wars sale that's been going on.
7358000	7367000	I was wondering if any of you have bought any of the Star Wars games since they've been on sale since the 4th.
7367000	7369000	Nope.
7369000	7376000	I've glanced over the PlayStation Network stuff a few times, but I'm like, ehhhhh.
7376000	7381000	I'm just... I don't know. I'm like, I'll buy it and they won't play it.
7381000	7390000	Yeah, I've been there, done that, bought like three or four of the games from Steam already, and I haven't touched...
7390000	7393000	Well, aside from one, I haven't touched the rust yet, so...
7393000	7399000	My biggest problem, which is both bad news and good news, is that I pretty much already have them all.
7399000	7404000	So there's nothing new for me to get suckered into buying, because I already frickin' bought them at some point.
7404000	7408000	I want to say there was a Humble Bundle not that long ago that had a lot of the Star Wars stuff in it, so...
7408000	7413000	I have those, and I have not played any of them.
7413000	7423000	Yeah, well, in reference to what Sky just said, no, I would say Steam Horror, but that would be like the Pac-Man and the Kettle of Black, so...
7423000	7439000	But on a semi-related note, the same sales going on over on Good Old Games, and there's one game on there that's not currently on Steam,
7439000	7452000	which happens to be Star Wars Shadows of the Empire, which I never knew there was a PC version, but I'm definitely familiar with the N64 version.
7452000	7459000	And first thing in the morning, as soon as I put a couple bucks into my bank account, so it's not too late by then,
7459000	7464000	definitely going to go pick that game up, if only for nostalgia's sake.
7464000	7476000	But, yeah, I did pick up three or four games from Steam already, including Rose Quarter 3D, I've been playing that off and on all day.
7476000	7482000	Still pretty fun, exactly like how I remember on the N64.
7482000	7486000	Yeah, I like going back and visiting some of those retro classics.
7486000	7491000	You know, on the PlayStation 4, they have Super Star Wars, and that was kind of fun to go back and replay.
7491000	7498000	Just as hard as I remember! At least I was able to clear the first couple levels, and then it all goes to shit.
7498000	7501000	But, yeah, it's fun to revisit some of that stuff.
7501000	7511000	Yeah, ironically though, in terms of the retro Star Wars games, especially those that were originally on the Super Nintendo,
7511000	7519000	I had Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but I never had the original Super Star Wars, though.
7519000	7522000	This is the one that I missed out. Was that any good, though?
7522000	7526000	Yeah, but if you've played the other ones, you kind of have a sense, it's very similar.
7526000	7531000	They're all very similar, but obviously the first game follows a little more of the plot of the first movie.
7531000	7534000	But if you like the other games, of course you're going to like the first one as well.
7534000	7537000	They're all really solid platforming games.
7537000	7544000	I will say, though, if you're doing that whole gaming on a budget thing, don't forget the Old Republic, their MMO is free.
7544000	7547000	So, that might be a Star Wars game worth checking out, too.
7547000	7553000	In fact, I do think it's a pretty solid MMO, and worth your time if you're into the Star Wars universe, would be the Old Republic.
7553000	7556000	Yeah, definitely keep that in mind.
7557000	7565000	Now, what to consider is, even though I'm unemployed and therefore have a lot of free time,
7565000	7578000	I still have a considerable scheme library that's not even taking consideration to dollar services like Good Old Games, Origin, and all that.
7578000	7584000	So, trying to fit all those schemes I have in is proving to be a little bit of a task.
7584000	7585000	That makes sense.
7585000	7590000	Alright, well, you know what? I don't know how I have the time for games sometimes.
7590000	7595000	And then I find that when I do game, I'm playing the same games, which I don't think is such a bad thing.
7595000	7601000	I still love Diablo and Final Fantasy XIV, these games, but it does sometimes cut into my availability to play other games.
7601000	7604000	But I do try to force myself at least once a week to play something new.
7604000	7607000	And for nothing else, so I have something to talk about on the show.
7608000	7615000	Yeah, appreciate you talking about it here, because, I mean, like I was saying, I've got a decent-sized library.
7615000	7625000	And as you can probably see, if you're looking to steam on a regular basis, I'm usually playing the same game over and over again,
7625000	7635000	despite having that decent-sized library, that game being mentioned too far in 2014, so I know the feeling.
7635000	7643000	A good game is a good game, and if you honestly like the game, you're going to return to it constantly.
7643000	7646000	So that's pretty much a good thing.
7646000	7648000	Yeah, nothing wrong with that.
7648000	7652000	Alright, Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.
7652000	7653000	Sure, have a nice night.
7653000	7654000	You too, take care.
7654000	7660000	1877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
7660000	7665000	And as a reminder, if you've never called before, please give Echo123 a call on Skype before you give us a call,
7665000	7667000	just to make sure your connection's working and all that stuff.
7667000	7672000	You'll get the nice little British lady that says, hello, welcome to Skype call testing service.
7672000	7674000	That's not quite right.
7674000	7676000	Not quite right, I gave it my best shot.
7676000	7678000	Anyway, any other last minute stories you want to mention, Loki?
7678000	7685000	I guess I can mention this, it's not really that important, but apparently there's a fun little bit that's been going around
7685000	7695000	about how Pornhub has noticed an 800% boost in Overwatch porn searches since the beta's come out.
7695000	7700000	What characters? Winston?
7700000	7701000	I can only assume, yes.
7701000	7706000	Touched by a Winston.
7706000	7709000	Oh, lord, alright.
7709000	7710000	That's something.
7710000	7712000	Does any Overwatch porn actually exist?
7713000	7715000	Rule 34, right?
7715000	7718000	Yeah, somebody drew it and it's posted on Tumblr, I'm sure.
7718000	7723000	I'm sure that there's already 3D models that have been extracted and there's gonna be...
7723000	7729000	Has there been actually filmed porn with people dressed up in the cosplay?
7729000	7731000	Is there like a Final Fuck X?
7731000	7733000	And yes, that is a real thing.
7733000	7738000	Which is just basically a cosplay show where, by the way, there's fucking.
7738000	7741000	Is that a thing? No?
7742000	7744000	Yeah, I don't think so.
7744000	7751000	Anyway, well, I guess the phones are not really ringing, so that's that for calls tonight.
7751000	7756000	Let's see, SSG100Matt says, oh god, I just searched and yes, it's a thing.
7756000	7758000	That'll teach ya.
7758000	7759000	That'll teach ya.
7759000	7762000	And Rama says, it's not out yet.
7762000	7763000	Probably soon.
7763000	7767000	Tigerclass says, probably images of people shipping Winston and Tracer.
7767000	7768000	You know what, I'm not gonna judge.
7768000	7770000	Not gonna judge.
7770000	7773000	I'm not gonna look at it, but I'm not gonna judge.
7773000	7776000	I guess that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawn Tradeout.
7776000	7777000	Believe it or not, a little bit early.
7777000	7784000	Again, a little bit of a shorter show this week, but probably because the news cycle is a little bit slower, especially as we get into E3 more and more.
7784000	7788000	Especially since some of these companies aren't fucking talking about their stupid games.
7788000	7790000	Or they don't have games to come out.
7790000	7794000	We'll try to get some interviews in the coming weeks or something to fill a little more time here.
7795000	7801000	We have some more stuff to talk about as we wait for E3 and whatever we're gonna get out of that show.
7801000	7803000	At least from Sony and Microsoft if nothing else.
7803000	7806000	But anyway, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawn Tradeout.
7806000	7808000	Thank you guys so much for listening.
7808000	7810000	I actually saw some new people in chat tonight or some names I didn't recognize.
7810000	7812000	So thank you very much for being here.
7812000	7813000	I really appreciate that.
7813000	7815000	And I hope you enjoyed being here live.
7815000	7818000	And if you like what you heard here at the show, I always tell this every week.
7818000	7820000	Please just tell a friend or five about the show.
7821000	7822000	Help spread the word.
7822000	7824000	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7824000	7827000	But we can't use those voices if you don't give them to us.
7827000	7829000	So thank you in advance.
7829000	7831000	Really appreciate that.
7831000	7834000	It's time to go around and give everybody's final thought for the night.
7834000	7835000	Dark Sakura, welcome back.
7835000	7836000	Great to have you here.
7836000	7838000	And we'll see you next time.
7838000	7840000	What's your final thought tonight?
7840000	7842000	I miss burritos.
7842000	7844000	You know, we're done early enough.
7844000	7846000	Chipotle's probably still open.
7846000	7848000	I guess I could get a burrito bowl.
7851000	7853000	I have a goal.
7853000	7855000	And it is that core set.
7855000	7858000	Ah. Good times.
7858000	7863000	I got a mic to drop at GamerX and I'll leave it at that.
7863000	7865000	All right. Fair enough.
7865000	7867000	My final thought for the night.
7867000	7871000	I want to congratulate my partner of the past six years, Allen.
7871000	7875000	Got his driver's license this week at the age of 37.
7875000	7876000	Which I know you guys might be thinking.
7876000	7877000	In a row.
7877000	7878000	Isn't that a little bit late?
7878000	7879000	And my answer is it is.
7879000	7881000	First, he grew up in a big city where you don't need a car to get around.
7881000	7884000	And second, it's never too late.
7884000	7885000	And that just kind of proves that.
7885000	7887000	In fact, he had said tonight.
7887000	7888000	Why don't I just drive to the store?
7888000	7889000	Because he's home from work this week.
7889000	7891000	He's like, why don't I drive to the store and go get Pinkberry?
7891000	7893000	Or why don't I drive out and get Pinkberry during the show?
7893000	7895000	And I'm like, why didn't you?
7895000	7896000	Why? Why?
7896000	7898000	Because he's too busy playing Dark Souls in the other room.
7898000	7900000	He just like randomly.
7900000	7901000	Not Dark Souls three.
7901000	7902000	Dark Souls one.
7902000	7906000	But I bet he will finish the trilogy by year's end.
7907000	7909000	But I still think that's really awesome.
7909000	7910000	And big congratulations.
7910000	7911000	He passed it the first time.
7911000	7913000	Did you know they don't do scores now?
7913000	7914000	Because I asked him, what was your score?
7914000	7915000	And he's like, I don't know.
7915000	7916000	I'm like, what do you mean you don't know?
7916000	7918000	They tell you your score right at the end.
7918000	7919000	Now it's you're allowed.
7919000	7920000	They have a checklist.
7920000	7922000	You're allowed to make 15 mistakes.
7922000	7923000	What?
7923000	7925000	You're allowed to make 15 mistakes.
7925000	7929000	Why should you be allowed to make more than five?
7929000	7930000	Right?
7930000	7931000	It's 15 mistakes you can make.
7931000	7932000	He made two.
7932000	7935000	Which was, I guess he did one that was like too wide of a turn.
7935000	7936000	And whatever.
7936000	7937000	You murdered four people.
7937000	7940000	So you had 11 more people you could murder.
7940000	7941000	It's like Carmageddon.
7941000	7942000	He just, he hit two things.
7942000	7947000	I mean, I would think that, that, I mean, in everyday driving, yeah, sometimes you might
7947000	7950000	forget to signal, which I don't.
7950000	7951000	Because I'm perfect.
7951000	7952000	You should never forget the signal.
7952000	7956000	I said, which I don't because I'm perfect.
7956000	7961000	And some people may speed or go a little, go a lot too slow.
7961000	7963000	You know, people make mistakes.
7963000	7966000	Some people get in the wrong lane and they decide they, oh, I really do need to cut across
7966000	7968000	all these lanes to make a right turn.
7968000	7969000	That should be an automatic fail.
7969000	7972000	That should be an ejector seat in your car.
7972000	7976000	Instead of just like, okay, if you made the rough, you're in the wrong fucking lane, make
7976000	7981000	a U-turn and then correct your mistake instead of like, oh, I need to go this way.
7981000	7982000	Why aren't you guys letting me in?
7982000	7988000	That should be an ejection seat from the car with an automatic pile of manure, you know,
7989000	7993000	to cushion your fall in the shittiest way possible.
7993000	7996000	Literally, literally.
7996000	7998000	You are evil.
7998000	8002000	Yeah.
8002000	8003000	All right.
8003000	8004000	Let's see.
8004000	8007000	I'm looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8007000	8008000	This is awesome.
8008000	8013000	MXC in chat says this news inspires me to get my license finally as well.
8013000	8014000	That's awesome.
8014000	8017000	I will pass that word along to Alan if he's not listening in the other room while he's
8017000	8018000	driving.
8018000	8020000	Um, and then Dungeon Buster said, 15 mistakes.
8020000	8023000	No wonder drivers today are garbage.
8023000	8025000	I don't need a signal.
8025000	8027000	Turns across three layers and angers traffic.
8027000	8029000	All right.
8029000	8031000	Anyway, uh, let's see what else in chat.
8031000	8035000	Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Alan is doing burnouts and parking lots.
8035000	8040000	He has to experience teenage driving and Raginator says, in fairness, sky, I'm 38, nearly 39
8040000	8042000	and I never had a driver's license.
8042000	8043000	Okay.
8043000	8046000	I saw in chat, somebody really wanted to call and for some reason it didn't show up.
8046000	8048000	So I'm going to take care of this really fast.
8048000	8050000	So let's get to it higher on orange on radio.
8050000	8051000	Who's this?
8051000	8052000	Hey, it's Sherlock.
8052000	8055000	Hey, you know, you're really special because I let you call in after the buzzer.
8055000	8057000	So, um, we'll get to it fast.
8057000	8058000	What's up, buddy?
8058000	8060000	Uh, I'm a victim of delay, I guess.
8060000	8070000	Um, um, yeah, the reason I'm calling now is because, uh, I'm kind of going to be not around
8070000	8075000	for a couple of weeks, but, uh, I wanted to talk about a very,
8075000	8078000	very, very important Kickstarter that's going on right now.
8078000	8080000	Please go for it.
8080000	8086000	Uh, it's for a game called colors and basically it's a, you know,
8086000	8091000	turn-based RPG that is, you know, it's going to be for, you know,
8091000	8096000	it's like a normal RPG, you know, uh, everyone can play it, but, uh,
8097000	8105000	also, uh, accessibility is being built into it from the outset.
8105000	8109000	Which you would think more games would just, I don't know,
8109000	8112000	consider accessibility from the outset, wouldn't you think?
8112000	8114000	Wouldn't you think that should be the day and age that we live in?
8114000	8116000	Yeah. Well, I mean,
8116000	8119000	But I know now, now all our listeners may not be aware, but you,
8119000	8121000	you yourself are a blind gamer.
8121000	8126000	So accessibility issues are obviously of great importance to you as a gamer.
8126000	8130000	What kinds of accessibility thing is colors doing that makes you so enthused
8130000	8133000	that you have to tell us about it? Because obviously this is doing something right.
8133000	8137000	Uh, screen reader support, um, screen readers are how, you know,
8137000	8139000	us blind people use computers basically.
8139000	8143000	And they basically let our computers talk.
8143000	8149000	And, uh, so basically this will enable the game to, uh,
8149000	8155000	interface with screen readers in a way where the text will be read, um,
8155000	8160000	automatically as it comes in, uh, including, uh, menus and stuff.
8160000	8166000	Um, so this is actually unprecedented for a game like this.
8166000	8169000	I can't believe that this is like uncharted territory.
8169000	8175000	This doesn't seem difficult. Is somebody that's creating this have an accessibility need?
8175000	8179000	Or is this just like, no, we just actually thought to consider more people?
8179000	8184000	Um, yeah, no, she just, she has a lot of blind friends that play games.
8184000	8188000	And so she was just like, yeah, you know what? Um, I, I want to do this.
8188000	8196000	Actually, she started off, um, making a, an accessible port of, uh,
8196000	8200000	Pokemon, kind of built from scratch, called Braillemon.
8200000	8202000	Uh huh.
8202000	8208000	And, um, so yeah, she was kind of well known in the, uh, audio games community.
8208000	8214000	Audio games are, you know, basically games that are designed specifically for, uh, blind people.
8214000	8217000	Uh, basically just using all sound.
8217000	8224000	But, uh, so yeah, and now, uh, she's, uh, moved on to this, uh, colors game.
8224000	8232000	And, uh, the, uh, see, the thing that bugs me about this is that she's using Kickstarter,
8232000	8239000	which if she doesn't get all her funding, you know, she doesn't get any of that money.
8239000	8240000	Right.
8240000	8246000	And she's asking for 30 grand and just like, oh man, that's a tall order.
8246000	8247000	It's a big bar.
8247000	8248000	It's a big bar.
8248000	8252000	It's like, you know, if it doesn't end up working out, take it over the Indiegogo or something like that.
8252000	8259000	Yeah, she can always try something else or, you know, maybe if the right, if the right eyes or ears find this, you know, um,
8259000	8264000	that Mighty No. 9 company did a second Kickstarter. What was that called? The Red Ace? Was that what it was called?
8264000	8265000	Yeah, I think so.
8265000	8266000	Yeah, something like that.
8266000	8267000	Red Ash, I think it was.
8267000	8268000	That's it. Thank you. Red Ash.
8268000	8274000	And then a lot of people were pissed off actually at this because a company came in and was like, oh, we're just going to fund it.
8274000	8279000	So you never know. I mean, in this case, you know, I hopefully won't piss people off, but, you know, maybe somebody,
8279000	8286000	if the right ears or eyes find this, then maybe she'll get what she needs. Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully.
8286000	8293000	All right. Well, thank you for spreading the word. And if nothing else, just reminding us, accessibility, it's important.
8293000	8301000	Yeah. Um, so hopefully this will, uh, get funded and cause RPGs are my favorite genre.
8301000	8309000	And, uh, so this will be like the first, because the thing I really, really want to do with this is, um, you know,
8309000	8317000	I'd like to be able to like stream it on Twitch and be able to play it with the, you know, same degree as everybody else.
8317000	8321000	I think that's, uh, that's not an unreasonable request. I hope you get to do it.
8321000	8322000	Yeah.
8322000	8324000	All right. Take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go.
8324000	8328000	Sorry to, uh, sorry to make you bring this guy back up.
8328000	8333000	You know what? That's okay. I knew, I knew whatever you called in would be something worth mentioning, so I appreciate it.
8333000	8334000	All right. Thanks, man.
8334000	8335000	All right. Take care. Bye.
8335000	8336000	Yep. Bye.
8336000	8341000	Uh, all right. Now, now the Skype line is really done because, uh, I really let that one in under the buzzer.
8341000	8345000	But I know, yeah, I guess some people get delay, some don't. I think it just depends on your connection at home.
8345000	8348000	Some people get on the wifi and it ends up buffering it a little more.
8348000	8354000	But anyway, so to recap, we were doing final thoughts. Dark Sakura wants a burrito. I wanted to congratulate Alan.
8354000	8357000	But we didn't do Loki. Loki, your final thought this week?
8357000	8363000	Uh, my final thought is there's all these stores that I was going to go look for a controller and are closed.
8363000	8367000	I guess they start closing game stops now at six on Sundays. So.
8367000	8368000	Really?
8368000	8369000	Yeah. So they're all closed too.
8369000	8371000	So much for that. So much for that.
8371000	8372000	Oh, well.
8372000	8378000	Oh, well. All right. Well, uh, good luck, Loki. Try not to break people's eardrums next week. I hope you find the controllers.
8378000	8381000	Uh, maybe fries tomorrow or something. All right. That's going to do it.
8381000	8384000	Thank you guys so much for listening to the show. Really appreciate it.
8384000	8389000	Have a wonderful week. We will see you next time here on orange lounge radio. Good night.
8414000	8420000	Or fog network, but you know, they were all still true.
8420000	8423000	See you next week.
8444000	8447000	Thank you.
