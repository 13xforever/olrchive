00:00.000 --> 00:17.960
This week, not to be outdone by the PS4 Neo, Microsoft 2 hits the rumor mill with reports

00:17.960 --> 00:20.720
of an Xbox One slim body as well as another controller update.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.000
It's not all rumors this week as we also have delays, updates, releases and so much more

00:24.000 --> 00:27.320
and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.680
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.680 --> 00:34.600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.600 --> 00:36.160
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.160 --> 00:44.680
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, May the 1st of 2016, episode number 639 of our show.

00:44.680 --> 00:50.400
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in lovely Sacramento, California, Studio N7 to

00:50.400 --> 00:54.960
talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with you every Sunday

00:54.960 --> 01:00.120
night live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right

01:00.120 --> 01:04.120
after the Bobby Black Wolf show with my co-host.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.600
Joining me tonight, say hello everybody to Tech Master, Loki.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
Hello.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.760
How are you, Loki?

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
I'm hungry.

01:09.760 --> 01:10.760
Yes.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.440
Loki got in here just in the nick of time.

01:12.440 --> 01:18.800
I was really worried I was about to go on air by myself, all by myself.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.920
Nobody wanted that to happen so Loki got here just under the buzzer I guess because they

01:23.920 --> 01:24.920
were taking a long time.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.680
They were stupid, yeah.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.040
Perfectly rational explanation.

01:30.040 --> 01:34.840
Obviously we are usually joined by the lovely Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.400
I would not want to neglect her introduction but she's not here tonight.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.960
I mentioned last week she was going to be out this week.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.740
She was on a brief little two-week hiatus from the show just because she had been sick

01:45.740 --> 01:49.520
last week and she's at Disneyland today with Dan.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.900
Actually no, they are not at Disneyland.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.740
They are at California Adventure because I guess they had to do one or the other because

01:55.740 --> 01:57.300
it's expensive to do both now.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.460
Have you seen the cost of freaking Disney tickets lately?

02:00.460 --> 02:07.140
So they decided to just do California Adventure today so they are there riding California

02:07.140 --> 02:11.540
Screamin' over and over and on the Toy Story ride, I'm sure.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.580
So that's where she is at.

02:13.580 --> 02:17.300
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, usually on before us here at the Voice of the Geeks Network,

02:17.300 --> 02:18.300
was also not on tonight.

02:18.700 --> 02:24.420
So it's a very lonely night here, Sunday night, at VOG Network, just myself and Loki.

02:24.420 --> 02:31.380
And here's the other funny thing is that I'm not feeling so, well, I feel okay.

02:31.380 --> 02:34.480
Like I don't like have a fever or anything but maybe you might be able to hear my voice

02:34.480 --> 02:35.480
a little bit.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.380
I'm starting to get like sinacy.

02:37.380 --> 02:40.100
My throat's getting a little scratchy so it's like great.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.700
I'm catching whatever's going around which I think Loki had a little bit of last week

02:43.700 --> 02:46.100
and I know Alan has been fighting off.

02:46.100 --> 02:50.660
So it's like, oh my gosh, something out there like does not want OLR.

02:50.660 --> 02:54.500
Like does something bad happen if OLR hits 14 years?

02:54.500 --> 02:58.300
Because I feel like the forces out there are trying to prevent Orange Laundry.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.020
No, you know what it is?

03:00.020 --> 03:02.340
We're not allowed to hit episode number 666.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.340
That's what's happening.

03:03.340 --> 03:07.900
The forces out there are trying to stop us from getting to 666 with all these, what,

03:07.900 --> 03:11.260
sicknesses and things that come up and so forth.

03:11.260 --> 03:16.800
So yeah, I'm not feeling 100% my best today, but I'm going to like, I really don't want

03:16.800 --> 03:19.220
to turn into a bi-monthly show.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.820
So I'm going to push through tonight, but we'll probably be a little bit shorter of

03:21.820 --> 03:22.820
a show tonight.

03:22.820 --> 03:25.620
We're going to try to just push through one solid segment here.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.100
No break tonight.

03:27.100 --> 03:32.180
We cut a few story slots and a couple of our regular segments and thinking we'll be done

03:32.180 --> 03:33.620
at about eight o'clock.

03:33.620 --> 03:37.640
But I'm thinking, how long is your podcast when you're thinking, it's going to be a short

03:37.640 --> 03:38.640
show tonight.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.640
It's going to be about two hours.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.840
Anyway, enough of that type of housekeeping stuff.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.120
You guys are here to talk about video games.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.160
Let's get into it this week.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.320
Um, Loki, I wanted to start off with this.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.320
Sorry, my friend.

03:50.320 --> 03:55.040
I know you're trying to eat, but we have to talk about this because everybody's talking

03:55.040 --> 03:56.040
about this.

03:56.040 --> 04:01.600
Uh, this was all over Twitter a couple of days ago, literally in the middle of the night,

04:01.600 --> 04:05.920
Nintendo drops tweets on us announcing some like huge news, right?

04:05.920 --> 04:06.920
What happened?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.680
Tell us a little bit about this Nintendo stuff.

04:09.680 --> 04:15.400
Um, they said that they were going to have announced new amiibos, is that what we're

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
talking about?

04:16.400 --> 04:19.080
No, no, I don't, I don't think it's the new amiibos.

04:19.080 --> 04:23.720
I think that was also a thing, but there was more fanfare for the damn amiibos than there

04:23.720 --> 04:25.680
was this news.

04:25.680 --> 04:32.360
That the NX is scheduled to be coming out around, I think March of next year.

04:32.360 --> 04:39.200
And that Zelda is being delayed to coincide with its launch, which is who's big shock.

04:39.200 --> 04:46.840
Although it's not because we kind of figured it was, yeah, you make it sound like the most

04:46.840 --> 04:52.040
anticlimactic thing that ever happened, but my God, because we know nothing about the

04:52.040 --> 04:53.040
system.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.000
Did you read any news sites that day?

04:56.000 --> 05:01.180
Because I swear to God, the tone all over the internet on these websites was Nintendo

05:01.180 --> 05:02.900
is fucked.

05:02.900 --> 05:07.280
Like I don't think that's the headline they can actually run on the front page of yahoo,

05:07.280 --> 05:10.020
but I swear to God, if they could, that's what they would have said.

05:10.020 --> 05:16.860
Because every fricking like place is running this story about how fucked Nintendo is because

05:16.860 --> 05:25.500
of this news that like I, one headline's like the Wii U is the biggest purchase I ever regret

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
or something like that.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.060
Like I regret buying the Wii U more than anything else I've ever bought in my life.

05:30.060 --> 05:35.820
And I'm just like, fucking sit down, you drama queen, take all the seats.

05:35.820 --> 05:42.560
Like really clearly you never bought an Engage or, you know, or a Ouya.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
I shouldn't say that.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.300
We actually have Ouya fans out there, but you know what I mean?

05:45.300 --> 05:48.820
I think there are far worse things to have happened to gaming than the Wii U, but maybe

05:48.820 --> 05:50.740
that's just my perspective.

05:50.740 --> 05:53.340
I tend to defend Nintendo a little more on the show.

05:53.340 --> 05:56.780
I'm sure the listeners are dying to know what you think of all this.

05:56.780 --> 06:03.940
I thought that's when it was coming out anyways, was in the first part next year, I'm in that

06:03.940 --> 06:07.360
that, Oh, Zelda was delayed to launch with the system.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
No shit.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.020
It was going to launch with the system.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.020
I don't know.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.380
Nothing was a surprise to me.

06:14.380 --> 06:19.540
Big surprise, I guess is that, Hey, we're not making games for the Wii U.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.140
So now that one will.

06:21.140 --> 06:26.580
Well then there was the big E3 thing where, Hey, the only thing we're bringing to E3 are

06:26.580 --> 06:28.500
at least that's, that's what it sounds like.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.860
Like I still, I still kind of can't believe this, but the way the tweets were worded,

06:32.860 --> 06:36.860
it really made it sound like we're going to just bring Zelda.

06:36.860 --> 06:37.860
That's it.

06:37.860 --> 06:42.940
We got this big old booth and we're just going to have the Zelda line take up the booth because

06:42.940 --> 06:44.580
we know y'all want to play it.

06:44.580 --> 06:48.380
So Zelda is the only thing we're basically bringing to E3 and I'm thinking in the back

06:48.380 --> 06:51.340
of my mind, I'm like, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.380
Zelda is the only thing you're going to bring.

06:53.380 --> 07:00.300
Maybe it's the only thing you're bringing on Wii U to E3, but what about Pokemon sun

07:00.300 --> 07:01.340
and moon?

07:01.340 --> 07:03.580
Those games are kind of a big deal.

07:03.580 --> 07:07.460
They're really a big deal now that you've basically said, you're not going to have a

07:07.460 --> 07:11.620
console game in 2016 that, that, that, and that's why everybody's running with these

07:11.620 --> 07:18.700
headlines about how fucked Nintendo is, is because Nintendo has no 2016 holiday basically

07:18.700 --> 07:22.700
and when it comes to the Wii U, but they're obviously still going to have a game when

07:22.700 --> 07:27.260
it comes to the 3DS because Pokemon is not something to sneeze at.

07:27.260 --> 07:31.540
I think Nintendo's mobile advances are nothing to be ignored.

07:31.540 --> 07:35.060
That was the other surprise they dropped that, you know, everybody's talking, oh my God,

07:35.060 --> 07:40.540
NX, NX, but they also kind of dropped, and this is a big deal, that Fire Emblem and Animal

07:40.540 --> 07:45.660
Crossing are the franchises that are tapped to come to mobile and Animal Crossing I think

07:45.660 --> 07:47.740
makes a lot of freaking sense.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.220
Granted, I think it's going to end up pretty much being the same stinking game we've been

07:51.220 --> 07:56.020
playing for 15 years now, ever since the GameCube version with minor revisions, and

07:56.020 --> 08:01.860
I'm sure they'll do little things to it to make it the more free-to-play type stuff where,

08:01.860 --> 08:08.380
you know, the furniture costs coins that trickle in as you do the mundane errands, but you

08:08.380 --> 08:11.300
can get a lot of coins if you get out your wallet, like that whole type of thing.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.900
I'm sure it's going to tie into Animal Crossing, but it makes a lot of sense.

08:14.900 --> 08:21.860
And Nintendo amping up their mobile game in 2016 I still think is worth some credit and

08:21.860 --> 08:29.260
not worth running a headline about how hosed Nintendo is because, I mean, Zynga, freaking,

08:29.260 --> 08:33.020
all their success was because of mostly one mobile game.

08:33.020 --> 08:38.460
So if even one of those games is a success, I mean, Tomo continues to be a success, I

08:38.460 --> 08:41.900
don't see where Nintendo is like, hosed.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.580
Are they going to have a bad year?

08:43.580 --> 08:44.580
Probably.

08:44.580 --> 08:48.900
But they're also sitting, don't they sit on like $5 billion in the bank or something like

08:48.900 --> 08:49.900
that?

08:49.900 --> 08:51.760
They're sitting on an ungodly amount of money in the bank.

08:51.760 --> 08:56.860
So I don't think Nintendo's screwed, but the NX can't miss.

08:56.860 --> 09:02.180
Like if the NX is a miss, then maybe we're going to be talking about those types of articles,

09:02.180 --> 09:04.620
but I, you know, I don't know.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.620
We're a ways off.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.620
Anyway.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.700
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

09:09.700 --> 09:14.220
Again, we do tape live Sunday nights and you guys join us live in our chat room over

09:14.220 --> 09:20.220
at live.vognetwork.com and you lend us your opinions and sometimes things that you're

09:20.220 --> 09:23.700
digging up as well on some of the things that we're talking about right now.

09:23.700 --> 09:28.120
MXC actually posted in our chat room a portion of the official press release comment on the

09:28.120 --> 09:30.080
E3 thing.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.340
This June, Nintendo will focus its attention on the upcoming game in the Zelda franchise.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.180
The Wii U version of the game will be playable for the first time on the E3 show floor and

09:38.180 --> 09:44.300
it will be the only playable game Nintendo presents at the show in order to provide attendees

09:44.300 --> 09:45.860
a complete immersion.

09:45.860 --> 09:48.920
Okay, well that's, that's a PR.

09:48.920 --> 09:54.520
In order to provide attendees a complete immersion, Loki, you are going, it's going to be the

09:54.520 --> 09:56.860
Zelda experience.

09:56.860 --> 10:03.580
There's going to be like cosplayers and little statues and things at the booth and light

10:03.580 --> 10:10.020
mood lighting, Loki, maybe rupees that you can actually take home as swag loot.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.860
That's what it's sounding like to me.

10:11.860 --> 10:15.140
So I, that is interesting.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.980
So that is going to be the only playable thing they show at the show.

10:17.980 --> 10:18.980
That is...

10:18.980 --> 10:20.980
But Zelda's not a title that you really need to hype up.

10:20.980 --> 10:24.820
I mean, it kind of hypes itself.

10:24.820 --> 10:25.820
Yeah.

10:25.820 --> 10:30.960
Going to our chat for some more comments here, SSG100Matt says Nintendo doesn't need to show

10:30.960 --> 10:32.600
their full handed E3.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.280
Didn't help them to get in a pissing match there with other console makers.

10:36.280 --> 10:39.860
Tiger Claw says Nintendo is big enough to do their own events.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.000
They don't really need E3 anymore.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.120
Actually no, I think that's a whole load of shit right there to be honest, because you're

10:45.120 --> 10:50.200
trying to sell a new system that no one knows jack shit about, and Zelda's going to be coming

10:50.200 --> 10:51.200
to it.

10:51.200 --> 10:56.760
And you're hoping that all this goodwill that they have is going to sell that fucking system.

10:56.760 --> 11:00.960
If people don't see a system at holiday and they're like, well, you know, the PlayStation

11:00.960 --> 11:06.120
4 looks pretty nice or the Xbox One looks pretty nice, drop the money there.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.000
They're not going to have a money for the new system.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.400
I mean, it's, you're only selling a one game right now.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.320
I'm like half with you on that.

11:14.320 --> 11:19.000
I mean, I think that is a huge question right now is, okay, well, if the NX will not be

11:19.000 --> 11:21.860
playable at E3, then when?

11:21.860 --> 11:26.440
Are they going to show it before the holiday season or are they going to show it after

11:26.440 --> 11:29.120
the holiday season and how?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.920
Because there will be no E3.

11:30.920 --> 11:37.280
So, I mean, the obvious answer that jumps to my mind first is Tokyo Game Show.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.880
However, Nintendo hasn't participated in Tokyo Game Show for quite some time.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.240
I don't know why they would suddenly start now.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.960
Nintendo has in the past, not every year, but they have in the past run a concurrent

11:48.960 --> 11:52.240
event around Tokyo Game Show.

11:52.240 --> 11:58.040
So it seems likely that they could do something like that in Japan.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.980
But that, you know, again, doesn't show how it's going to get here in America.

12:01.980 --> 12:07.760
I wonder if they're not going to do a Nintendo Direct and every Best Buy in the nation is

12:07.760 --> 12:10.740
going to have some of the Nintendo stuff to play.

12:10.740 --> 12:17.080
I sort of just think that's the only path that's left because I don't really see Nintendo

12:17.080 --> 12:21.920
doing an expo of their own, say like the PlayStation experience.

12:21.920 --> 12:26.160
And so what else do they have where they can get directly to the players?

12:26.160 --> 12:27.720
Penny Arcade Expo?

12:28.440 --> 12:36.280
I don't know if that, I mean, I kind of think the NX will end up at PAX, I guess, East next

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
year.

12:37.280 --> 12:41.440
But, I mean, there's, I don't know.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.440
There really isn't a precedent now for how Nintendo gets that system out there.

12:44.440 --> 12:48.840
I sort of think they're going to have to do the mall tour, the Best Buys, you know, they're

12:48.840 --> 12:52.080
going to have to take their case to the consumers in that regard.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.800
But Nintendo has kind of done it before.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.800
We'll see.

12:56.800 --> 13:01.120
Interesting thought from Akdeft in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

13:01.120 --> 13:07.000
Universal Studios presents Nintendo Experience, calling it interesting.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.720
We do know there is that Nintendo Universal Partnership, which many of us are thinking

13:11.720 --> 13:14.880
thrill rides and, you know, obviously that'll be a part of it.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.640
But could Nintendo have the NX playable at theme parks?

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
That would be weird.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.640
That's the only thing about it.

13:21.480 --> 13:25.600
That would be really weird because then it's like you're paying money to go play those

13:25.600 --> 13:26.600
games.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.600
You know what I mean?

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
It's weird.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
It's a little weird.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
But then again...

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
They've done it before with other things.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Yeah.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.200
I've seen or remember at California Great America here, they had the Wii.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.680
They had like a Wii Experience type thing there for a while.

13:37.680 --> 13:42.080
I mean, it was after the system was out, but they, you know, it was still something.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
Oh, interesting.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.320
Let's see.

13:46.320 --> 13:50.880
We're trying to get a couple more comments here over at live.vognetwork.com.

13:50.880 --> 13:56.680
Kaijuto in chat says, Nintendo knows that E3 isn't relevant anymore.

13:56.680 --> 14:00.440
They have their own showcase shows.

14:00.440 --> 14:07.040
A lot of people are reading into that angle of it where here's yet another company that's

14:07.040 --> 14:08.760
really de-emphasizing E3.

14:08.760 --> 14:15.160
I mean, they haven't pulled out of E3, but they pulled the thing that almost everybody

14:15.160 --> 14:20.200
I know that was going to E3 this year had said, I'm excited to play the NX.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.400
And Nintendo just pulled that from E3.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.120
So yet another thing has just exited the show this year.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.880
Well, it's just like, it's...

14:27.880 --> 14:33.740
I understand that they don't have to reveal it at E3, but you gotta reveal it at some

14:33.740 --> 14:34.740
point.

14:34.740 --> 14:35.960
And it's...

14:35.960 --> 14:36.960
What's the harm?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.720
I mean, I guess unless you're unsure that, you know, people are going to be disappointed

14:40.720 --> 14:44.440
about what they see, but that gives you more time to get feedback on it.

14:44.440 --> 14:49.520
I'm just like thinking right now, there's nothing, nothing has me hyped for the NX.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.840
I don't know anything about it.

14:51.840 --> 14:57.400
Well, I kind of think that's a loaded perspective though, because of course you don't.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.000
Nintendo has kept everything under their hat.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.920
Well, let's, let's reevaluate after E3 this year, because maybe just because the NX will

15:03.920 --> 15:06.360
be there doesn't mean they won't say anything about it.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.440
They may still say some things about it, even though they may not necessarily have one there,

15:10.440 --> 15:13.580
and maybe they will unveil another title to get us hyped for it.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.660
Like I know if they came out and said, all right, we know you're all waiting to see what's

15:17.660 --> 15:23.780
going to be on the NX, here's Pikmin 4, how about F-Zero?

15:23.780 --> 15:27.940
Because if that's the one that they dropped, I'd be like, done.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.060
And I came like, there it is.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.060
Like that's all it's going to take.

15:31.060 --> 15:36.100
If they drop F-Zero and I'm spent like, you know, if they, if they announced like that

15:36.100 --> 15:40.100
big game or maybe a new Metroid or something like even just one little thing to tide us

15:40.100 --> 15:45.780
over, and then please look forward to October, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah in Japan and

15:45.780 --> 15:49.540
November, blah, blah, blah in the States, when we're going to have more information

15:49.540 --> 15:50.860
and a playable thing.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.780
Like maybe that'll be all they give us at E3, I don't know.

15:53.780 --> 15:56.140
But I'm fine with that.

15:56.140 --> 16:00.340
Just like would like some information.

16:00.340 --> 16:03.460
I also think, and one other thing, I don't want to drag this out too much, but again,

16:03.460 --> 16:08.980
this is, this is the thing that a lot, a lot of people are talking about this week.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.980
I have a feeling their strategy, because you, you kind of mentioned the whole, well, how

16:13.980 --> 16:17.340
are they going to sell them in March if they're not around at the holiday and dah, dah, dah,

16:17.340 --> 16:18.340
and all this stuff.

16:18.340 --> 16:24.380
I wonder if Nintendo isn't kind of planning on that they're going to release this in March

16:24.380 --> 16:28.900
or April, whenever the fiscal year ends, like right, like, like days before.

16:28.900 --> 16:34.060
And they're going to get their hardcore audience to pick it up the first day.

16:34.060 --> 16:38.220
And that's the audience that they're going to use to sell the system through Christmas,

16:38.260 --> 16:39.260
essentially.

16:39.260 --> 16:45.820
I think Nintendo is not actually targeting necessarily a huge spring, but a huge holiday

16:45.820 --> 16:52.700
2017, because yes, they'll have some big launch titles, but I bet there's going to be, I mean,

16:52.700 --> 16:54.900
we know Zelda is going to be like the big one, right?

16:54.900 --> 17:00.140
But I bet there's going to be something really big that's holiday 2017, and that's going

17:00.140 --> 17:07.540
to be your Mario or, you know, your hypothetical F-Zero or Metroid or some big fucking title

17:07.580 --> 17:10.500
that, you know, a lot of people are going to want to play is actually going to be a

17:10.500 --> 17:12.620
holiday 2017 game.

17:12.620 --> 17:15.500
And that's when they really expect to move units.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.500
And then that way the early adopters are also kind of their early sellers, if that makes

17:19.500 --> 17:20.500
sense.

17:20.500 --> 17:26.380
They're their early salesman, I guess, because I know that, you know, I really wanted a Super

17:26.380 --> 17:31.460
Nintendo after I went to my friend's house and played one, you know what I mean?

17:31.700 --> 17:39.300
Anyhow, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SH2100Matt says, they're trying to go grassroots.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.300
If they play it right, it could work.

17:41.300 --> 17:45.620
And Tiger Claw says, I have this feeling the NX is just an upgraded Wii U with a better

17:45.620 --> 17:48.460
CPU, GPU, and more memory.

17:48.460 --> 17:53.460
Well, it wouldn't exactly be out of character for Nintendo, but at the same time, if the

17:53.460 --> 17:57.100
rumors are to be believed, which there's an awful lot of them, if the rumors are to be

17:57.100 --> 18:03.220
believed, it's going to be more powerful than the current PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

18:03.220 --> 18:06.500
which is about where the Wii U was when it came out.

18:06.500 --> 18:12.140
I think it was just a slight more powerful than 360, but it wasn't, you know, like a

18:12.140 --> 18:14.620
huge thing.

18:14.620 --> 18:18.740
Will the Wii U, or excuse me, the NX, will the NX be capable of doing 4K and all that

18:18.740 --> 18:19.740
stuff?

18:19.740 --> 18:20.740
Probably not.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.740
It's probably not going to be doing that type of stuff.

18:22.740 --> 18:27.460
But anyhow, lots of Nintendo stuff.

18:27.460 --> 18:33.100
Let's see, SH2100Matt says, they'll have private events with the press and demo kiosks before

18:33.100 --> 18:35.340
the end of the year, I'm sure.

18:35.340 --> 18:39.860
And Rama says, the NX is going to have PC specs similar to the PlayStation 4, so we're

18:39.860 --> 18:40.860
good.

18:40.860 --> 18:44.220
Well, clearly they're going to want to do something that makes it really easy this time

18:44.220 --> 18:50.980
for the other companies to port their games over, because that was a big part of Wii U,

18:50.980 --> 18:54.580
is that if you wanted to do a Wii U game, you kind of had to put a lot of extra money

18:54.580 --> 18:57.900
into the port to have the second screen and all that stuff.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.580
So it'll be interesting to see what happens.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.780
Anyway, that's the big news everybody's talking about.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.180
Let's get into a little bit of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games

19:08.180 --> 19:11.300
that we've been playing this week, and then we'll get into housekeeping and the rest of

19:11.300 --> 19:13.300
our news and all that stuff.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.500
Sorry, I almost knocked over a dish.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
Live radio.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.900
Loki, how was your gaming week?

19:17.940 --> 19:24.780
My gaming week was terrible, to be honest, because I was so sick this week.

19:24.780 --> 19:33.060
I was just exhausted, literally falling asleep at 9 o'clock at night, so it was just not

19:33.060 --> 19:34.060
very conducive.

19:34.060 --> 19:39.060
And I tried to play games, I was like, oh hey, cool, I'll play some Enter the Gungeon

19:39.060 --> 19:40.740
or something like that.

19:40.740 --> 19:41.740
Nope.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.160
Not going to happen.

19:43.160 --> 19:49.720
So I played nothing this week, aside from Ingress, which I actually did on Friday.

19:49.720 --> 19:58.840
Take some time to go walk around the state capital and get some unique portals there.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.640
Just mainly because I was sick and I knew I couldn't concentrate.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.680
I wanted to concentrate in programming, but I was like, I needed some fresh air, and so

20:05.680 --> 20:11.280
I went for a few hour walk, and it felt great.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.680
But there was a lot of people there.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.440
My god, there's so many tours that go on there.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.440
It's ridiculous.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.840
I was like, holy cow!

20:18.840 --> 20:23.120
There's some sort of podium thing that they're setting up.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.800
I don't know if that's for the Trump rally thing or if that's something else, but they're

20:26.800 --> 20:32.720
setting up some sort of speaking podium thing, and then there's just school groups swarming

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
the building.

20:33.720 --> 20:34.720
It was ridiculous.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
But, yeah.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.720
So I did that.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
Alright, wow.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.280
Well, my gaming week, I haven't played a lot of new stuff, honestly.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.000
I feel like I've been playing a lot of games, but it's a lot of the same stuff.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.640
I don't have a lot of exciting new things to talk to you guys about.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.700
Final Fantasy XIV, I've still been doing the grind and that, and my Dark Knight finally

20:54.700 --> 21:00.120
hit 60, so every class in Heavensward, I have at 60, so that's my little accomplishment

21:00.120 --> 21:01.120
there.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.800
And you can do these grinds towards the end of the game to get the highest level equipment

21:05.800 --> 21:06.800
and so forth.

21:06.880 --> 21:12.800
It's called the Relic Weapon, basically, so I've been working on those quests on my Astrologian

21:12.800 --> 21:16.560
to try to get the best possible weapon, so I've been working on that.

21:16.560 --> 21:21.640
And then Diablo III had Season 6 start this weekend, and if you guys listen to the show

21:21.640 --> 21:25.160
for any length of time, you guys know I get into Diablo, especially when the seasons come

21:25.160 --> 21:26.160
around.

21:26.160 --> 21:31.320
And the big thing this season is that, finally, Blizzard added a lot more cosmetics to Diablo.

21:31.320 --> 21:35.760
They had introduced these pets, and then there's maybe three or four that you can actually

21:35.760 --> 21:36.760
acquire.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.560
Now, apparently, there's a whole ton of them, so that's a big part of what they're doing

21:39.560 --> 21:40.560
with this season.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.840
So, you know, it's, I mean, obviously, it's not just pets, but they're doing these other

21:43.840 --> 21:45.800
changes that, you know, are interesting.

21:45.800 --> 21:50.240
So I've been playing a little bit of that, because that season just started on Friday,

21:50.240 --> 21:54.500
and I really didn't start playing until yesterday, and I'm already level, like, 45, and that's

21:54.500 --> 21:56.080
without somebody power-leveling me.

21:56.080 --> 22:00.560
I find that joining public games, you get around people your same level, but you get

22:00.560 --> 22:04.800
a huge experience boost, and yeah, that's been helping me a lot.

22:04.840 --> 22:11.480
So, been playing the Diablo season, otherwise, on the Xbox One, I randomly had that on the

22:11.480 --> 22:14.480
other day, and I played Frogger.

22:14.480 --> 22:18.920
That's right, the Konami classic Frogger, because it showed up in my whole backwards

22:18.920 --> 22:20.320
compatibility thing.

22:20.320 --> 22:23.840
It's like every week, you turn on your Xbox One, it's like, let's see what little gem

22:23.840 --> 22:28.520
from ten years ago just popped into your collection from the backwards compatibility thing, and

22:28.520 --> 22:30.360
Frogger showed up this week.

22:30.360 --> 22:31.760
But you'll be proud of me, Loki.

22:31.760 --> 22:37.640
I also downloaded Saints Row IV, because that was the games with gold thing this week.

22:37.640 --> 22:42.060
Which I have not played IV, I've played Saints Row III, and I laughed my ass off, but I never

22:42.060 --> 22:43.060
played IV.

22:43.060 --> 22:48.840
Well, you'll like IV, because IV is basically III, since they recycled the map again.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.200
But it is fun.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.000
You'll like it.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.880
Alan said the first few minutes of the game are laugh-a-palooza, like the last game.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.880
It's ridiculous.

22:59.480 --> 23:03.680
It's just, yeah, it's a very unusual game.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.680
Can't wait.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.240
Sounds like fun.

23:06.240 --> 23:10.360
Otherwise, continuing on the 3DS, I've been playing Zelda P-Cross as my nice little game

23:10.360 --> 23:11.880
before I go to bed.

23:11.880 --> 23:16.480
And Miitomo, I don't know if I mentioned this in last week's show, so I'll mention it now.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.040
I hit the cap in Miitomo.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.520
The social cap and the style cap is level 20.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.240
You can progress no further.

23:24.240 --> 23:31.280
So you get a giant red sparkly hat for hitting level 20, and I hit both on style and social.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.200
So that was my big accomplishment, Miitomo.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.860
Yet, I'm still playing.

23:36.860 --> 23:37.860
I don't know why.

23:37.860 --> 23:42.040
I still load it every day, and I check answers, and I'll answer a question.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.120
The leaked footage from Pokemon Go, the beta?

23:46.120 --> 23:48.040
I did see a little bit of that, yeah.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.920
It looks, I mean, here's the thing.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.720
I think it looks interesting, but I've also been playing Ingress this whole time, so I

23:54.720 --> 23:57.240
don't look at it from the Pokemon frame of reference.

23:57.240 --> 24:01.360
I look at it from the Ingress frame of reference, and so, for me, there's a lot of cool stuff

24:01.360 --> 24:02.360
in there, I think.

24:02.360 --> 24:06.600
But I understand the Pokemon fans are like, where's the traditional battling?

24:06.600 --> 24:08.800
Because it kind of doesn't seem to be there.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.200
I'm not really sure how it plays, though.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.240
It's like, you go to spots, I'm not sure if you deploy your Pokemon there, and then they

24:15.240 --> 24:16.940
fight other people, or...

24:16.940 --> 24:20.940
It seems like what you do is you go out and you catch Pokemon, but you don't necessarily

24:20.940 --> 24:24.380
catch them by fighting them, you flick your balls at them.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.580
That's literally what you're doing in the game, right?

24:26.580 --> 24:30.740
You kind of flick the little balls at them, and that's where you can actually use a camera

24:30.740 --> 24:35.940
on your phone, so it makes it actually look like AR a little bit, and so you can capture

24:35.940 --> 24:37.540
the Pokemon that way.

24:37.540 --> 24:41.600
But then what happens is that at some point in the game, you have to choose if you're

24:41.600 --> 24:46.580
going to join the red gym, the blue gym, or the yellow gym, just like the old games from

24:46.620 --> 24:50.140
the Game Boy, red, blue, and yellow, which I guess they're going with the American colors,

24:50.140 --> 24:52.960
not the Japanese colors.

24:52.960 --> 24:58.420
And then once you choose a color for your gym, a lot of the places that we know as Ingress

24:58.420 --> 25:03.340
nodes today, as Ingress players, some of the beta players are saying about 40% of those

25:03.340 --> 25:06.260
nodes are Pokemon gyms.

25:06.260 --> 25:11.020
So what happens is that once you choose a color for your team, when you go to the gym,

25:11.020 --> 25:16.540
if it's a gym of the opposing color, you can battle the Pokemon that's there to take the

25:16.540 --> 25:24.940
gym for your color, and if it's your color, you leave a Pokemon behind to defend it.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.060
So imagine Ingress, but the resonators are Pokemon.

25:29.060 --> 25:34.060
That's kind of the sense I'm getting out of the game, and there's three factions, and

25:34.060 --> 25:39.260
none of this, at least as far as I know, none of this fielding, linking stuff that's big,

25:39.260 --> 25:40.500
that's not really part of it.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.920
That's all left in Ingress.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.620
So it's interesting.

25:43.620 --> 25:44.620
All right.

25:44.620 --> 25:45.620
Yeah.

25:45.620 --> 25:50.380
Again, this is all early beta, a lot can still change, we'll see.

25:50.380 --> 25:56.180
I wonder if that's not, maybe that'll be a thing Nintendo comes out at E3 and says,

25:56.180 --> 25:59.860
and Pokemon Go is out today, and you can download it on phones.

25:59.860 --> 26:05.140
I'm very much expecting Nintendo to have a mobile-focused year in a way.

26:05.140 --> 26:09.220
I think that E3, Nintendo Direct, will absolutely have mobile in it.

26:09.220 --> 26:16.020
I understand that Pokemon Go is not directly a Nintendo game, but it's close enough.

26:16.020 --> 26:19.380
And then they'll probably show footage from the Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem and give

26:19.380 --> 26:21.220
us a sense when to expect those.

26:21.220 --> 26:25.940
I would imagine Fire Emblem's first, but that's totally just guessing.

26:25.940 --> 26:32.940
So anyway, that is an SSG100Matt says, so Rob will be choosing Team Green.

26:32.940 --> 26:38.340
No, there is no green in Pokemon Go, so I'm still unsure.

26:38.460 --> 26:42.140
I have a feeling I'm going to get talked into doing blue, because that's what Shane will

26:42.140 --> 26:47.860
want to do, which is going to be very weird for me, because that's not what I do in Ingress,

26:47.860 --> 26:48.860
but we'll see.

26:48.860 --> 26:51.780
A lot can still change between now and Pokemon Go whenever that comes out.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.420
I have to kind of see, are there benefits for each team?

26:54.420 --> 26:56.140
Do some Pokemon get stronger?

26:56.140 --> 26:57.700
There's a lot that can still change my mind.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.700
I forgot.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.700
I was going to mention something.

26:59.700 --> 27:00.700
Yeah.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.700
Let me just bring this up here real fast.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.700
Okay.

27:02.700 --> 27:03.700
I want to show you something.

27:03.700 --> 27:04.700
Sure.

27:04.700 --> 27:05.700
He's getting out his phone to show me something.

27:05.700 --> 27:06.700
Okay.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.700
Let's see here.

27:08.060 --> 27:16.940
Actually, I remember I was talking to you about how Ingress screen burned my phone.

27:16.940 --> 27:18.060
Yeah.

27:18.060 --> 27:19.060
You did say something about that.

27:19.060 --> 27:20.060
Yeah.

27:20.060 --> 27:22.140
I'm going to try to see if I can get it so that you can actually see it here real quick.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.760
Well, this makes for riveting radio.

27:23.760 --> 27:29.860
It is make for riveting radio, but I just wanted to see if I can, here, let me try pulling

27:29.860 --> 27:30.860
this up here real fast.

27:30.860 --> 27:31.860
Okay.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.180
So he's dilling around on his phone, trying to, I guess, navigate to-

27:34.180 --> 27:37.420
I'm trying to get something so that you can actually see what I'm talking about here.

27:37.420 --> 27:40.940
Even like a new browser window, so it's like solid white.

27:40.940 --> 27:42.940
That would be what I would do.

27:42.940 --> 27:47.000
While he's working on that, let me try to get some more comments in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.700
Tiger Claw says, I got Star Fox Zero yesterday.

27:49.700 --> 27:54.620
I had enough points from the GameStop Power Up rewards to get $25 off.

27:54.620 --> 27:59.540
Orange Right talking about Miitomo says, that's 15 my Nintendo points a day.

27:59.540 --> 28:00.540
You know what, Orange Right?

28:00.540 --> 28:04.880
That is actually a big reason, I think, why I still do Miitomo, because if Nintendo's

28:04.880 --> 28:09.680
going to give us free games for 1,000 points, then yeah, I'm going to try to keep earning

28:09.680 --> 28:10.680
those.

28:10.680 --> 28:14.880
I mean, even though the games aren't that big a deal, I have been playing quite a bit

28:14.880 --> 28:17.640
of Zelda P-Cross, which was the game that you can get for 1,000 points.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.240
Is it like in the bottom corner here?

28:19.240 --> 28:20.720
You can see the com thing.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.720
Oh, wow.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.160
Yeah, you do have like a screen burn on your phone.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
That's crazy.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.160
Yeah.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.960
And then normally in the upper right hand corner, too, it's harder to see right here

28:29.960 --> 28:31.960
right now.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.280
In the upper, you can see the ops button and everything.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.680
You should take that to wherever you bought the phone, because that strikes me as what

28:38.680 --> 28:41.240
a cheap piece of shit.

28:41.240 --> 28:45.040
It's a Samsung Galaxy S6, though.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.280
Something went wrong in the factory.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.280
I don't know.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.680
Do any of you guys know?

28:48.680 --> 28:50.920
Do cell phones really screen burn like that?

28:50.920 --> 28:53.360
I guess they don't want you to play Ingress anymore.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.360
I don't know.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.360
All right.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.720
Anyhow, I don't have a lot of housekeeping for you guys tonight.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.440
We are still going to be here every Sunday, as far as I know.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.760
We will be at Dragon Con, or at least I will be at Dragon Con over Labor Day, but that's

29:04.760 --> 29:06.600
still a ways out.

29:06.600 --> 29:11.000
So in the meantime, you can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.280
facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.880
Act deft in chat about the screen burn saying, I'm pretty sure they shouldn't.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.320
Yeah, I don't, I'm pretty sure they shouldn't either.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.640
So interesting.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.800
Anyway, let's get into gaming news for the week.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.240
Loki, why don't you start us off?

29:26.240 --> 29:27.360
So this is pretty cool.

29:27.360 --> 29:32.120
One of the things that kind of leaked out, they have a few different ways this has been

29:32.120 --> 29:33.120
leaking out.

29:33.120 --> 29:39.880
So in Black Ops 3 right now, in the Nuketown map that they have, they've been kind of doing

29:39.880 --> 29:46.080
these little hidden trailers or teaser video things like that that are kind of teasing

29:46.080 --> 29:48.560
into the next Call of Duty.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.800
Also there were some retail pieces that were kind of leaked out as well about another Call

29:52.800 --> 29:57.720
of Duty game called Call of Duty Infinity Warfare.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.760
So kind of like a futuristic warfare thing.

29:59.760 --> 30:06.400
But one of the big things about that though, on the actual artwork, it lists not only they

30:06.400 --> 30:12.440
have Infinite Warfare, which will be coming out November 4th, 2016, but that there's also

30:12.440 --> 30:17.700
going to be, if you buy like a certain legacy edition, it's going to come with Call of Duty

30:17.700 --> 30:23.620
Modern Warfare, the original, number four, remastered.

30:23.620 --> 30:28.540
So it's basically going to be the, I consider probably one of the best games in the Modern

30:28.540 --> 30:34.000
Warfare series, remastered on the PlayStation 4.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.660
Which is fucking amazing and I can't wait for that.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.940
So that's the rumor right now.

30:38.940 --> 30:44.180
Apparently they're seeing that it's going to be the campaign plus ten of the multiplayer

30:44.180 --> 30:48.540
maps, which is kind of unusual because there were more than ten multiplayer maps in that

30:48.540 --> 30:49.540
game.

30:49.540 --> 30:53.780
So I'm not sure if they're just not redoing all of them, which it would be kind of disappointing.

30:53.780 --> 30:57.780
But maybe that opens up for DLC or something.

30:57.780 --> 31:01.100
So we'll just have to see if that's actually going to be a legit thing or not.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.300
But I hope it is.

31:02.300 --> 31:05.980
Is this, didn't I, I mean I might be talking crazy and that's fine.

31:05.980 --> 31:10.200
Didn't I hear that they might not put out new games in these series every year?

31:10.200 --> 31:13.020
So maybe this is like a holdover?

31:13.020 --> 31:14.860
Well no, it's going to be a new game this year.

31:14.860 --> 31:17.940
Oh, so it's just remastered but it's...

31:17.940 --> 31:21.900
They're going to put out the new Call of Duty game, which is Call of Duty Infinite Warfare

31:21.900 --> 31:26.180
and Call of Duty Modern Warfare remastered.

31:26.180 --> 31:27.460
That's a lot of Call of Duty.

31:27.460 --> 31:32.100
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, I would soon get the remastered version of Modern Warfare

31:32.100 --> 31:33.900
over Infinite Warfare.

31:33.900 --> 31:37.900
Uh, yeah, I would say the same thing.

31:37.900 --> 31:38.900
I'll play both.

31:38.900 --> 31:42.540
But I love Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the original one.

31:42.540 --> 31:45.580
It's had some of the best maps in the series.

31:45.580 --> 31:49.100
Yeah, it's kind of like, I don't know, it's kind of like when they remastered Final Fantasy

31:49.100 --> 31:50.100
X.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.620
It's like, yeah, I'm going to go back and play this because this is a great game, even

31:52.620 --> 31:55.260
though there might be newer Final Fantasies to experience, you know.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.180
But why not?

31:57.180 --> 31:59.680
If it was a great Call of Duty game, then yeah, they should remaster it and go back

31:59.680 --> 32:02.680
to it.

32:02.680 --> 32:07.620
Also by the way, on the screen burning issue in chat, S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, my Galaxy

32:07.620 --> 32:10.500
S3 had a little keyboard screen burn.

32:10.500 --> 32:14.500
Justin and I replaced it recently, but that was with three to four years of use.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.820
This is not three to four years of use.

32:16.820 --> 32:18.020
It's like three to four months, right?

32:18.020 --> 32:20.700
You haven't had that very long.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.700
Six months?

32:21.700 --> 32:22.700
In September.

32:22.700 --> 32:23.700
Still.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.860
All right, anyhow, more rumors about the Xbox One.

32:27.860 --> 32:32.540
You know, huge talk about the PlayStation 4 Neo, which I guess their code name, we were

32:32.540 --> 32:34.960
talking about in last week's show.

32:34.960 --> 32:40.340
And we've heard rumors that Microsoft is looking at doing something similar, and those rumors

32:40.340 --> 32:42.180
are gaining a lot of steam this week.

32:42.180 --> 32:46.660
There are yet more inside reports and rumors.

32:46.660 --> 32:51.620
There was a, I guess, leaked production notes that showed the Xbox One slim model, and those

32:51.620 --> 32:54.260
production notes came from a Chinese manufacturer.

32:54.260 --> 32:59.460
Well now another Microsoft insider has said that yes, new Xbox hardware is coming.

32:59.460 --> 33:02.660
That there's new Xbox hardware that's going to be announced at E3, and there will be a

33:02.660 --> 33:04.200
new controller.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.560
The controller is going to be similar to the current pad, but with probably a default white

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
color.

33:09.600 --> 33:13.480
The controller will be updated, but they don't really say how.

33:13.480 --> 33:17.640
I'm assuming just to make it the D-pad.

33:17.640 --> 33:21.360
I don't know, I like the Xbox One controller a lot more than the 360, but maybe they're

33:21.360 --> 33:24.880
going to try to throw some of those enhancements that are in the Elite in it?

33:24.880 --> 33:25.880
I don't know.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.600
We'll see.

33:27.600 --> 33:34.420
So yeah, and apparently the new Xbox is a much bigger deal than an updated standard

33:34.420 --> 33:35.420
controller.

33:35.420 --> 33:38.020
But what the fuck does that mean?

33:38.020 --> 33:42.220
So are they putting new power in it or not?

33:42.220 --> 33:47.460
If the Xbox thing is just a slim device, then okay, whatever, we see this happen all the

33:47.460 --> 33:48.460
time.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.460
This has been happening since the PlayStation One.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
It's coming with Microsoft Office as well.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.060
It's a big deal.

33:54.060 --> 34:00.620
Well, okay, nobody's talking about the whole like, you know, well, I guess they're talking

34:00.620 --> 34:04.700
about the upgrade thing, but maybe that is what it does.

34:04.700 --> 34:10.940
Maybe this box is not just an Xbox One, but this is more of a bridge with your PC, somehow.

34:10.940 --> 34:14.820
That it's going to stream more for your PC or let everything on your Xbox.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.820
Why can't it be a PC?

34:17.820 --> 34:20.900
Like seriously, like run- Just buy a PC and hook it up to your TV.

34:20.900 --> 34:28.420
You know, like the Windows tablets that they have, the Surface Pro, or the Surface, not

34:28.420 --> 34:33.580
the Pros, but like the RT ones, you know, have just like a limited app set on there

34:33.580 --> 34:36.060
and, you know, run Office stuff.

34:36.060 --> 34:39.940
That way you're buying the system and if you need to, you know, crunch an Excel file, you

34:39.940 --> 34:41.420
could do that as well.

34:41.420 --> 34:45.300
As long as they don't fragment the games, which, you know, we were talking about the

34:45.300 --> 34:50.140
PlayStation 4 stuff last week, okay, you know, as long as the games don't get fragmented.

34:50.140 --> 34:52.940
If it's doing 4K output for movies, then whatever.

34:52.940 --> 34:57.740
But I just hope that Microsoft is going down a similar path where the games do not end

34:57.740 --> 35:00.460
up all fragmented, if that makes sense.

35:00.460 --> 35:03.820
Like I don't want to see that happen, because I'll be pissed that I have all that money

35:03.820 --> 35:08.460
that I spent on the Xbox One, if now this year's holiday games are not going to run

35:08.460 --> 35:09.460
on it.

35:09.460 --> 35:10.460
You know what I mean?

35:10.460 --> 35:11.980
I really don't think that'll happen.

35:11.980 --> 35:16.100
I kind of just feel like this device is going to be, yeah, it's going to be a slimmer device

35:16.100 --> 35:22.620
and maybe a little more oomph for movies and a little more of the PC connectivity and doing

35:22.620 --> 35:23.940
more of that.

35:23.940 --> 35:28.980
Maybe it'll be a little more power in it for HoloLens or whatever, but as long as, you

35:28.980 --> 35:34.820
know, Crackdown will still run on the Xbox One that I have and Scalebound and all the

35:34.820 --> 35:38.020
stuff that I'm looking forward to, we'll be fine.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.740
So we'll see.

35:39.740 --> 35:43.980
Anyway, I guess that's what we've got coming out of Microsoft.

35:43.980 --> 35:44.980
Look forward to E3.

35:44.980 --> 35:46.220
It's going to be interesting.

35:46.220 --> 35:51.140
Now you've got Sony and Microsoft announcing new consoles, but they're not really new consoles.

35:51.140 --> 35:52.940
It's not a new console cycle.

35:52.940 --> 35:56.140
And then Nintendo is like, here's our one game.

35:56.140 --> 36:01.180
We'll see.

36:01.180 --> 36:05.460
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com,

36:05.460 --> 36:06.860
use the passphrase, point.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.540
Loki, what do you have for us next?

36:09.540 --> 36:10.540
All right.

36:10.540 --> 36:11.540
So this is kind of cool.

36:11.540 --> 36:15.220
You know, they're going to have, they put out these all the time on Steam, like this

36:15.220 --> 36:19.340
Genesis collections where there's a bunch of the ROMs and everything you could play.

36:19.340 --> 36:23.780
And a lot of times I'm like, why would I buy this?

36:23.780 --> 36:28.700
Because I could just run this through an emulator or something like that.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.660
I still buy them, yes.

36:30.660 --> 36:36.860
But I still, I asked myself that question though, why am I purchasing this?

36:36.860 --> 36:40.260
Probably because it's a large number of games that are on my Steam library and it pads the

36:40.260 --> 36:41.800
numbers quite well.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.020
That's usually the reason.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.020
But I actually...

36:44.020 --> 36:47.300
I want to look sicker to all my friends.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.740
I don't look crazy enough.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.740
I need to go for broke.

36:50.740 --> 36:51.740
Exactly.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.860
So, this is kind of cool though.

36:53.860 --> 36:57.140
This is actually something that they're doing that's very different.

36:57.140 --> 37:04.100
They're actually offering or adding Steam Workshop support for Sega Genesis and Mega

37:04.100 --> 37:05.740
Drive Classics.

37:05.740 --> 37:06.740
That's right.

37:06.740 --> 37:10.620
ROM hacks are going to be officially supported by this now.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.580
That's pretty exciting.

37:12.580 --> 37:16.940
So that would definitely be something I would have to pick up this collection just to check

37:16.940 --> 37:17.940
it out.

37:17.940 --> 37:25.100
But, very cool to see that they're actually kind of supporting that.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.620
Are you going to try playing around with this at all?

37:26.620 --> 37:28.140
Do you have any games to support it?

37:28.140 --> 37:34.060
I thought I bought a Humble Bundle that had all the old Sega stuff, but I guess not.

37:34.060 --> 37:39.140
I have Space Channel 5 Part 2, I bought something that had the Dreamcast stuff, but this isn't

37:39.140 --> 37:40.140
about...

37:40.140 --> 37:41.140
No, this is Genesis games.

37:41.140 --> 37:45.060
I have the Genesis one I bought off of Amazon a long time ago when I used to buy digital

37:45.060 --> 37:46.060
games off of there.

37:46.060 --> 37:49.500
So, I have the key for that.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.860
I'm not sure if that's the same collection or if they re-released it or something, but

37:52.860 --> 37:54.980
I'll take a look and see.

37:54.980 --> 38:01.380
Stop drop in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can't wait for Scrotum the Hedgehog.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.380
Because that's what happens.

38:02.380 --> 38:06.300
I remember when ROM hacking first started a long time ago.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.740
I remember there were two things.

38:08.740 --> 38:10.900
Somebody did Mario with dicks.

38:10.900 --> 38:11.900
It was just dicks everywhere.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.620
It was like the coins were dicks.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.620
Everything was a dick.

38:14.620 --> 38:19.460
It was Dick Mario, it was one of the first ROM hacks, one of the first I ever saw, Dick

38:19.460 --> 38:20.460
Mario.

38:20.460 --> 38:25.140
And then, okay, here's the greatest one, because this game wasn't even out in the US.

38:25.140 --> 38:31.300
There was a Japanese only game, God, I'm embarrassing myself even about to talk about this.

38:31.300 --> 38:37.180
There was a Japanese only game called Nuts and Milk.

38:37.180 --> 38:42.700
And I'll just let you fill in the gaps to what ROM hackers did to that game in the first

38:42.700 --> 38:48.580
month that people figured out how to get into the files and edit sprites and all that

38:48.580 --> 38:52.700
stuff is that it just became nuts and nuts is basically what happened there.

38:52.700 --> 38:58.940
So ROM hacking and making them dirty has been around since the turn of the century, basically.

38:58.940 --> 39:02.940
We've been saying that in gaming for forever is that, what's the time to penis?

39:02.940 --> 39:05.380
So that is a good question.

39:05.380 --> 39:10.220
How long until, I mean, is Steam going to police for Scrotum the Hedgehog?

39:10.220 --> 39:14.900
Or will that not, is that just, it's going to be a wild, wild west out there?

39:14.900 --> 39:15.900
What's going to happen?

39:15.900 --> 39:18.900
Do we know if, do we know if Steam is policing any of that stuff?

39:18.900 --> 39:22.900
I'm sure that they have like a review system.

39:22.900 --> 39:23.900
Right?

39:23.900 --> 39:24.900
Yeah.

39:24.900 --> 39:29.020
Dartetsuya in chat says, the ROM hacks are really interesting.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.780
Some of them even swap in a totally different game.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.980
Yeah, I'd seen some of that too.

39:33.980 --> 39:34.980
Funny stuff.

39:35.740 --> 39:41.460
And SSG100Matt says, like all the ROM hack cartridges that they were selling at Magfest.

39:41.460 --> 39:45.020
Yeah, that's, that was a, I don't know if I talked about that phenomenon here on this

39:45.020 --> 39:46.020
show.

39:46.020 --> 39:49.380
I think Bobby got into it on his show, but they were actually selling like ROM hacks

39:49.380 --> 39:53.460
dumped back to a cartridge that you could then take home and play on.

39:53.460 --> 39:55.020
That sounds kind of illegal.

39:55.020 --> 39:59.900
It's probably super illegal, but it's, it's this really weird gray area because I think

39:59.900 --> 40:04.940
the patents, like that's why you can have these third party Nintendos and Super Nintendos.

40:04.980 --> 40:09.340
Now is because I think the patents ran out, they ran out after like 20 or 30 years.

40:09.340 --> 40:12.440
And so I kind of think the cartridges, the same thing happens.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.580
So now it's just a question of the intellectual property.

40:14.580 --> 40:20.060
I mean, if, if somebody really wanted to sue them, they would probably have a case, but

40:20.060 --> 40:23.420
it's, it's a little vendor at a show.

40:23.420 --> 40:24.900
How many of these are they really selling?

40:24.900 --> 40:29.060
It's probably not worth it to pay the lawyer is probably the reality of that situation

40:29.060 --> 40:32.340
is that, yeah, it's probably illegal, but it's not worth it to pay the lawyer.

40:32.900 --> 40:33.900
I don't know.

40:33.900 --> 40:38.620
MXC in chat, giving us some insight here saying some steam workshop stuff has been removed.

40:38.620 --> 40:43.580
It appears if you download them once though, even after being officially removed, you can

40:43.580 --> 40:44.700
still access them.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.180
Oh, it's like iTunes.

40:46.180 --> 40:51.500
It's like when I got the main emulator on my iPad, I was like, Oh, got to get that before

40:51.500 --> 40:52.500
they take it down.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.700
And sure enough, they got it down, but now it's on my account so I can redownload it

40:55.700 --> 40:56.700
whenever.

40:56.700 --> 40:57.700
So it's kind of nice.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.700
All right.

40:58.700 --> 41:02.220
Anyhow, so I've been playing a lot of final fantasy 14 lately.

41:02.220 --> 41:05.740
So I, I don't mean to bring up a game that I play an awful lot on the show, but maybe

41:05.740 --> 41:11.860
I do, but they had a big like conference this week and some announcements and there's a

41:11.860 --> 41:13.940
very interesting crossover.

41:13.940 --> 41:19.100
That's just too cool to ignore a square Enix and level five announced this week that they

41:19.100 --> 41:20.220
will be teaming up.

41:20.220 --> 41:23.660
Uh, and this was announced during the latest final fantasy 14 letter from the producer

41:23.660 --> 41:31.980
live part 29, um, on final fantasy 14 is going to be getting Yo-kai watch in the game basically

41:31.980 --> 41:36.860
not the actual game, but some of the characters, uh, so some of the, uh, Yo-kai will actually

41:36.860 --> 41:38.780
become minions in the game.

41:38.780 --> 41:42.100
So like Jibanyan is going to be a minion that you can get in the game.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.100
That's pretty cool.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.060
Whisper and you know, a lot of the, uh, Yo-kai watch.

41:46.060 --> 41:51.380
And then there's going to be Yo-kai inspired weaponry, which is pretty cool.

41:51.380 --> 41:56.420
So like, for example, um, you can get like a white mage staff that has a Yo-kai on the

41:56.420 --> 41:57.420
end of it.

41:57.420 --> 42:04.100
Uh, I like to play, um, a astrologian and the astrologian has the, um, snake Yo-kai,

42:04.100 --> 42:11.020
I think it's Noko, uh, has that Yo-kai like embedded on the, um, uh, astroglobe.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.420
So that's pretty cool.

42:12.420 --> 42:18.540
Um, and then also your character can actually equip a Yo-kai watch as like a piece of equipment.

42:18.540 --> 42:20.740
I don't know what it'll do, but you can do that.

42:20.740 --> 42:25.560
And then they're actually going to be bringing a mount that is that ghost character.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.240
Whisper and you see this on a lot of box art, you actually be able to ride that as

42:29.240 --> 42:30.240
a mount.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.240
So that's really cool.

42:31.240 --> 42:38.600
But not only that, in Yo-kai watch three sushi and Yo-kai watch three tempura, they are going

42:38.600 --> 42:39.600
to be adding.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.880
So now this is going the other way in the Yo-kai games.

42:41.880 --> 42:47.560
They're going to add choco bonyan, which is jibanyan riding a choco.

42:47.560 --> 42:53.360
And then they're going to have moogle linyan, which is a moogle, but done in Yo-kai watch

42:53.360 --> 42:54.360
style.

42:54.360 --> 42:55.360
That's actually really rad.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.440
So it's a really kind of a neat little crossover there.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.740
Square Enix and level five doing that between the two.

43:01.740 --> 43:06.360
So as a Final Fantasy 14 player and someone who enjoyed what I played of Yo-kai watch,

43:06.360 --> 43:11.920
I will try to collect every one of those minions because I like to collect minions in the game

43:11.920 --> 43:12.920
anyway.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.880
So I'm looking forward to whatever event they do.

43:14.880 --> 43:19.460
I'm sure they're going to do some event to promote the release of the game in Japan.

43:19.460 --> 43:22.200
And hopefully we see it here in the States as well.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.880
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and look at some

43:25.880 --> 43:30.560
video games that are coming out soon, a lot sooner than Yo-kai three will be here in the

43:30.560 --> 43:31.560
States.

43:32.560 --> 43:41.160
All right, so we've got Battleborn coming out this week on PlayStation 4 PC and Xbox

43:41.160 --> 43:42.160
one.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.120
Man, so I'm not over that sickness yet.

43:47.120 --> 43:51.800
I'm telling you, the forces do not want us to get too much further.

43:52.400 --> 43:57.400
I still feel way better than I did with last week, whoa, that's for sure.

43:57.400 --> 44:06.400
And then along with that, let's see, aside from Battleborn, no, a whole lot, actually

44:06.400 --> 44:08.040
I want to say that's it.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.640
Battleborn, that is your week.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.840
Well that's supposed to be like a big title, right?

44:13.840 --> 44:18.960
Yeah, it's a 2K kind of equivalent of, wasn't it supposed to be similar to Team Fortress

44:18.960 --> 44:19.960
2 or something?

44:20.120 --> 44:25.000
I tried playing the beta, I couldn't get into it, I really couldn't, I'm sorry, but I know

44:25.000 --> 44:28.720
some other friends of mine have been playing it and loving it, so cool, hey, great, I couldn't

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
get into it.

44:29.720 --> 44:32.600
Maybe I just need to give it another chance, I don't know.

44:32.600 --> 44:37.320
So all right, but I know that was like a big thing that they showed at the PlayStation

44:37.320 --> 44:41.000
experience anyway and a lot of people were looking forward to that, so maybe that's...

44:41.000 --> 44:46.760
Well the trailer looked cool last year and I remember it's basically kind of like from

44:46.760 --> 44:53.120
the team that did Borderlands, so it, I don't know, it seemed interesting, but it's not

44:53.120 --> 44:54.440
my style of game.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.440
Gotcha.

44:55.440 --> 45:00.820
Well, looking at the release calendar in Japan, it's a very slow week in Japan.

45:00.820 --> 45:03.760
There is actually nothing on the PlayStation 4 this week.

45:03.760 --> 45:07.720
Uncharted 4 is the next big release in Japan, because that's going to be a big release here

45:07.720 --> 45:08.720
too as well.

45:08.720 --> 45:12.240
Japan will not be seeing that until May 10th, however, that is actually not happening this

45:12.240 --> 45:13.240
week.

45:13.240 --> 45:16.700
And the Vita doesn't really have anything this week either.

45:16.700 --> 45:21.280
And lastly on the 3DS, yeah, it's a very, very slow week in Japan, so really no game

45:21.280 --> 45:23.120
releases to look forward to there.

45:23.120 --> 45:27.160
However, if you go to Europe, the story is a little bit different, as Battleborn makes

45:27.160 --> 45:32.580
its way to Europe this week on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

45:32.580 --> 45:35.600
So that is what you have to look forward to in Europe this week.

45:35.600 --> 45:39.680
In our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says, wasn't Golden Week this week

45:39.680 --> 45:40.680
or was that last week?

45:40.840 --> 45:45.480
I thought it was last week, but that probably is coming into play as to why we don't have

45:45.480 --> 45:47.200
a ton of releases in Japan this week.

45:47.200 --> 45:54.240
So there you go, not a whole lot to look forward to this week in Japan, and just one big game

45:54.240 --> 45:55.240
in the UK.

45:55.240 --> 45:59.360
Well, this is the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and visit

45:59.360 --> 46:01.560
the classic game of the week.

46:01.560 --> 46:09.200
And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

46:09.200 --> 46:12.840
hey, you ungrateful little brat should be playing this game.

46:12.840 --> 46:16.360
But this week she's not here, so we're taking over this segment for her.

46:16.360 --> 46:19.440
Since last week, I got to do one of my picks.

46:19.440 --> 46:24.560
This week we're going to let Loki do one of his picks, and I actually still do not know

46:24.560 --> 46:25.560
what he's picking.

46:25.560 --> 46:29.720
I don't even have a YouTube up for anything for audio, so Loki, what is the classic game

46:29.720 --> 46:30.720
of the week?

46:30.720 --> 46:32.000
See, I was undecided first.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.340
I didn't know if I should, you know, Jamie has a very specific rule that she's never

46:37.340 --> 46:38.340
going to pick Halo.

46:38.380 --> 46:39.380
Right.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.380
And so I thought, well, maybe I should pick Halo.

46:41.380 --> 46:42.860
Just piss her off.

46:42.860 --> 46:43.860
Just to spite her.

46:43.860 --> 46:50.060
Well, I would disavow that completely, because I do not want, I want my Disneyland souvenir.

46:50.060 --> 46:51.300
Yours will get tossed in the fire.

46:51.300 --> 46:56.500
So, and unfortunately, you know, in order to best appreciate that, Bobby would really

46:56.500 --> 46:58.220
need to be in the chat to do that.

46:58.220 --> 46:59.220
That is true.

46:59.220 --> 47:01.740
Bobby did run out, I think he went on a trip or something, I don't know.

47:01.740 --> 47:02.740
I don't know.

47:02.740 --> 47:07.300
So he is not in chat, so perhaps we shall table that to another week.

47:07.300 --> 47:08.300
Fair enough.

47:09.260 --> 47:10.260
I'm going to have...

47:10.260 --> 47:12.500
So you're blaming Bobby now for the Halo thing not happening.

47:12.500 --> 47:16.260
I'm blaming Bobby for the Halo thing not happening.

47:16.260 --> 47:19.260
The classic game of the week would have been Halo, but Bobby's not here.

47:19.260 --> 47:21.260
It would have been Halo.

47:21.260 --> 47:23.620
Instead, we're going to get a far better game.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.620
Okay.

47:24.620 --> 47:25.620
What is it?

47:25.620 --> 47:26.620
Which is going to be Driver 3.

47:26.620 --> 47:32.180
Driver 3 is the classic game of the week.

47:32.180 --> 47:33.180
Of course.

47:33.620 --> 47:39.100
Because Driver 3 is just, it's where basically Atari said, hey, you know what?

47:39.100 --> 47:41.820
We could totally do that Grand Theft Auto thing.

47:41.820 --> 47:44.540
I mean, the first two Driver games were pretty awesome.

47:44.540 --> 47:49.620
I mean, it was basically all about, you know, car chases and about the driving.

47:49.620 --> 47:56.700
And then, Drive 3-er was all about, let's just try to steal, you know, copy Grand Theft

47:56.700 --> 48:00.900
Auto, and it just, it failed terribly.

48:00.900 --> 48:07.140
It had some really buggy AI, like the cops when they were chasing after you, you could

48:07.140 --> 48:11.500
hide behind a car and they would shoot at, they would try to shoot directly at you, and

48:11.500 --> 48:14.980
if, you know, the cop car that they happened to be hiding behind was right in front of

48:14.980 --> 48:17.980
them, they would blow up their own cop car and kill themselves because they were trying

48:17.980 --> 48:18.980
to shoot at you.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.580
It was awesome.

48:20.580 --> 48:31.860
So, Driver 3, you know, it basically came out in 2004 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as

48:31.860 --> 48:38.700
well as mobile platforms, even had a game version for Game Boy Advance.

48:38.700 --> 48:46.780
And basically, you know, the game revolved around, I guess, FBI agents Tanner, John Tanner

48:46.780 --> 48:48.620
and Tobias Jones.

48:48.620 --> 48:51.460
Wait, there was a story?

48:51.460 --> 48:52.460
Yes!

48:52.460 --> 48:53.460
No, seriously!

48:53.460 --> 48:54.460
Alright.

48:54.460 --> 48:55.460
There was!

48:55.460 --> 49:02.060
And they had actual, you know, they had Michael Madsen playing John Tanner and Ving Rhames

49:02.060 --> 49:07.900
playing Tobias Jones, and then they were trying to intercept the criminal Charles Jericho

49:07.900 --> 49:09.540
played by Mickey Rourke.

49:09.540 --> 49:11.700
That's some, like, serious talent right there.

49:11.700 --> 49:15.580
Too bad the game just did not reflect that talent.

49:16.540 --> 49:23.100
But basically, you know, it revolved around you, you know, chasing after them over several

49:23.100 --> 49:30.660
different locations, including Miami, Florida, Nice, France, and Istanbul, Turkey.

49:30.660 --> 49:34.740
And really the way I played the game was I would just go into it, they had like a free

49:34.740 --> 49:38.300
mode that you could drive around, and I would just get in cars and drive them until they

49:38.300 --> 49:43.220
were literally, because it had like a pretty, I wouldn't call it a realistic damage system,

49:43.220 --> 49:46.260
but there was a damage system where like stuff would fall off your car, like you could

49:46.260 --> 49:50.940
lose the front two wheels of your car, and drive around just on the axles and everything.

49:50.940 --> 49:55.860
And I would do that, and it was fun.

49:55.860 --> 50:00.420
I remember one night your character was just like swimming underwater endlessly, and it

50:00.420 --> 50:07.280
was so, like, you swam like through polygons that were underwater somehow, I don't even,

50:07.280 --> 50:08.280
it was a mess.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.540
It was a frickin' mess.

50:09.540 --> 50:10.540
It was a mess.

50:10.540 --> 50:17.460
You know, they had like some realistic physics in the game, I don't know if I'd call it realistic,

50:17.460 --> 50:19.180
but yeah.

50:19.180 --> 50:23.300
The reviews weren't that great, and this was one of the games that actually did kind of

50:23.300 --> 50:31.460
cause a controversy, because before the release of Driver 3, Atari had offered magazines PSM2

50:31.460 --> 50:37.080
and Xbox World early review copies of the game in exchange for positive review scores.

50:37.080 --> 50:40.520
Some folks in chat are talking about this right now, Stop Drop is mentioning this right

50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
now.

50:41.520 --> 50:45.320
They gave the game to two magazines early for promises of nine to ten reviews, nine

50:45.320 --> 50:49.360
out of ten reviews, excuse me, then everyone was expecting a great game, and real reviews

50:49.360 --> 50:54.240
came in, so they tried to suppress those reviews and ban people from forums.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.240
So much for that.

50:55.240 --> 50:58.720
Yeah, as you can see right now, oh, and this was another game that was kind of fun, because

50:58.720 --> 51:07.000
in, I don't know if it was Driver 3 that, my sister used to play Driver 3 quite a bit,

51:07.000 --> 51:13.200
and it would allow you to create replays of your actual, so you're driving around and

51:13.200 --> 51:16.120
causing mayhem and stuff, and you could do replays, but one of the best parts about the

51:16.120 --> 51:20.240
game and the replay system is it wouldn't always sync up to what you were doing.

51:20.240 --> 51:25.120
So you're recording all this stuff, you're stealing cars and things, and then you go

51:25.120 --> 51:30.000
back and watch the replay, and your guy's just running around aimlessly and running

51:30.000 --> 51:36.720
into the ocean, and all sorts of weird stuff happens, it was just a very glitchy, bad game.

51:36.720 --> 51:39.880
But it's fun, it's so bad, it's good at that point.

51:39.880 --> 51:45.240
And they were even so cocky that they had, like it was an Easter egg where they had the

51:45.240 --> 51:51.000
character from Vice City wearing like floaties and stuff, and you'd have to go, you know,

51:51.000 --> 51:54.880
kill him, and that was like an Easter egg in the game, it was like kind of going, haha,

51:54.880 --> 52:00.640
look it, we're so much better than Grand Theft Auto, but their game was just not good.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.640
It was not good.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.640
But it was fun.

52:03.640 --> 52:06.100
So no chance we'll ever have a Driver 4?

52:06.100 --> 52:07.100
We did, actually.

52:07.100 --> 52:08.100
Oh, we did?

52:08.100 --> 52:09.740
Yeah, we had Driver San Francisco, so.

52:09.740 --> 52:11.900
Oh, that's right, I thought that was before.

52:11.900 --> 52:16.500
So yes, we did actually have a Driver 4, and it was a better game, because it was just

52:16.500 --> 52:19.580
about driving and not about getting out and running around.

52:19.580 --> 52:21.140
They cut out all the Grand Theft Auto parts.

52:21.140 --> 52:22.140
Yes, they did.

52:22.140 --> 52:23.140
All right.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.140
That's it.

52:24.140 --> 52:26.980
That's it, your classic game of the week.

52:26.980 --> 52:27.980
Driver 3.

52:27.980 --> 52:28.980
Not Halo, unfortunately.

52:28.980 --> 52:29.980
Not Halo, unfortunately.

52:29.980 --> 52:33.900
But Driver 3, I know it's on the PC and it was on Playstation 2?

52:33.900 --> 52:34.900
And Xbox.

52:34.900 --> 52:35.900
Original Xbox.

52:35.900 --> 52:36.900
Awesome.

52:36.900 --> 52:42.620
Just, if you like glitchy games, and trying to break games, which you guys have to understand,

52:42.620 --> 52:46.580
Loki really, like, that's like one of Loki's favorite things in games, is breaking them

52:46.580 --> 52:47.580
and watching them do ridiculous stuff.

52:47.580 --> 52:50.980
Well, it was like one of those games, like, after I heard the review scores and how bad

52:50.980 --> 52:54.820
this game was, I'm like, I gotta try this thing, because I liked, the original Driver

52:54.820 --> 52:58.020
on Playstation 1 was a really good game.

52:58.020 --> 53:03.060
It was a fun game, like running from the cops and everything was fun, and Driver 2 wasn't

53:03.100 --> 53:04.100
so bad.

53:04.100 --> 53:09.100
I was like, well, I mean, it sounds like it could be fun, and so I played it, I'm like,

53:09.100 --> 53:13.740
wow, this is really terrible, but I had fun playing it, because it was really bad.

53:13.740 --> 53:15.340
All right.

53:15.340 --> 53:18.220
We are not going to be doing a break tonight, since I mentioned earlier in the show we're

53:18.220 --> 53:21.540
going to just keep moving on with some news, but we will get to your calls in just a little

53:21.540 --> 53:26.540
bit at 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

53:26.540 --> 53:30.460
But first, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, starting with Loki.

53:30.460 --> 53:31.740
All right.

53:31.740 --> 53:37.780
So as, I'm not sure if this is a result of the whole, you know, Microsoft opening up

53:37.780 --> 53:43.660
there online, but good news, DC Universe Online is now available on Xbox One.

53:43.660 --> 53:49.420
So that's right, you can play it on PC, Playstation 4, Playstation 3, and Xbox One now.

53:49.420 --> 53:52.180
So check it out.

53:52.180 --> 53:56.000
And it is still free to play.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.260
This is something that I wanted to get set up on my phone, I haven't quite gotten a chance

53:59.260 --> 54:03.980
to do it, because I was trying to sync my Playstation 4 controller to my Android phone,

54:03.980 --> 54:05.580
and it just does not want to work.

54:05.580 --> 54:10.860
So Minecraft is now available for Samsung Gear VR, and I purchased this day one, as

54:10.860 --> 54:12.660
soon as I saw that this was available.

54:12.660 --> 54:16.900
It is something I'm probably going to check out, hopefully, maybe tonight.

54:16.900 --> 54:22.740
And yeah, it's, you need a controller with it, so if you have a Bluetooth controller

54:22.740 --> 54:26.920
that works with your Android phone, then definitely check this out.

54:26.920 --> 54:30.640
But it's Minecraft in VR, what more can you want?

54:30.640 --> 54:37.280
It's $7.99, I want to say, if you purchase it from the, or $6.99 from the Gear VR store.

54:37.280 --> 54:41.960
And then finally we also have the free games you're going to be getting in May.

54:41.960 --> 54:47.640
So starting off with Games with Gold on Xbox, the free games you're going to get starting

54:47.640 --> 54:51.640
May 1st through May, or actually for the whole month of May, you're going to have Defense

54:51.640 --> 54:59.640
Grid 2, and then Costume Quest 2 will be available for the 2nd, from May 16th through June 15th.

54:59.640 --> 55:05.960
And then on Xbox 360, Grid 2 will be available for free May 1st through May 15th, and then

55:05.960 --> 55:10.640
Pagle will be available May 16th through May 31st, of course all those Xbox 360 games are

55:10.640 --> 55:17.360
compatible with the Xbox One, so be sure to pick them up even if you don't have a 360.

55:17.360 --> 55:23.860
And then finally, on PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting Tropico 5, Tabletop Racing

55:23.860 --> 55:29.080
World Tour, and Switch Galaxy Ultra on PlayStation 4.

55:29.080 --> 55:34.780
PlayStation 3, you're going to be getting Bionaut Commando Rearmed 2, and Loco, was

55:34.780 --> 55:46.920
it Loco Roco Cocoa, Loco Roco Cocoa, Loco Roco Cocoa Recto.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.560
That's hard to say.

55:48.560 --> 55:52.080
A lot of people were not feeling the free games this month.

55:52.080 --> 55:58.240
Yeah, I want to say there was a rumor that it was, which game was it, the rumor was they're

55:58.240 --> 56:05.160
going to have, it was supposed to be Watch Dogs, was the free game.

56:05.160 --> 56:06.160
Oh wow.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.240
That'd be kind of a video.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.640
Maybe for June, maybe because if they were, obviously they're going to be announcing Watch

56:10.640 --> 56:12.160
Dogs 2 or whatever.

56:12.160 --> 56:18.760
Right, my thought was that maybe they're trying to keep some things and holding it for E3,

56:18.760 --> 56:22.280
like because then they can announce at E3 that some big games are going to be playable.

56:22.280 --> 56:25.600
That's why you have kind of an A month, is that it's going to lead into a really big

56:25.600 --> 56:27.840
month because June's usually kind of a video.

56:27.840 --> 56:33.600
And then Vita, God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Switch Galaxy Ultra as well.

56:33.600 --> 56:35.120
So that's it.

56:35.120 --> 56:36.120
Alright.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.600
Well, you know what, hey, it's still free.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.040
It might not be the stuff you wanted, but it's free.

56:40.040 --> 56:41.040
Hey, exactly.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.280
You know what, I've not played Tropico 5 or any of the Tropico games.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.280
I mean, worth checking out.

56:45.280 --> 56:47.440
And sometimes these games are freaking awesome.

56:47.440 --> 56:50.200
You may not have heard of them and you play them and they're actually rad.

56:50.200 --> 56:52.120
So go check it out.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.680
Nintendo really did announce New Amiibo.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.680
Loki was not joking earlier.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.520
Splatoon is going to be getting some new amiibo.

56:58.520 --> 57:02.720
The Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, who do all the announcing in the game and they do

57:02.720 --> 57:07.000
that Stay Fresh, that little pose, the Stay Fresh pose, that is actually going to be the

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
pose.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.400
I love the way these amiibo look.

57:09.400 --> 57:13.160
I love the little, the bottoms with the ink kind of coming out.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.160
These look great.

57:14.160 --> 57:17.120
These amiibo are really getting put together better and better.

57:17.120 --> 57:21.840
They're also going to be releasing new color variants of Inkling Girl, Inkling Boy, and

57:21.840 --> 57:25.680
Inkling Squid, which is kind of, eh, whatever.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.760
But they're going to be out on July 8th.

57:27.760 --> 57:30.840
Callie and Marie will cost $25 together.

57:30.840 --> 57:35.720
And then the new bundle with the recolors is going to be $35 if you want to check that

57:35.720 --> 57:36.720
out.

57:36.760 --> 57:40.080
You were worried that Nintendo wasn't going to release anything this year.

57:40.080 --> 57:43.760
Well it is, it is interesting that, you know, they are adding more, I don't think these

57:43.760 --> 57:48.200
things add new levels or anything into Splatoon, but I think it is like recoloring so the characters

57:48.200 --> 57:51.280
or, uh, what did the Callie and Marie thing do?

57:51.280 --> 57:55.120
I don't remember what they did off the top of my head, maybe somebody in chat remembers.

57:55.120 --> 57:58.400
But they're just going to do like tiny little tweaks, like it's nothing like major major

57:58.400 --> 58:00.640
to the game.

58:00.640 --> 58:03.800
But it's still something, if that makes sense.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.880
Act F says they have music in them.

58:06.320 --> 58:08.240
Well that's still something, a little something.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.280
I just, I would honestly get these for the figures.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.000
They just, they look great.

58:13.000 --> 58:20.120
So, anyway, moving on, Xenoblade Chronicles, not the one that was on Wii U, but was on

58:20.120 --> 58:24.480
the Wii, and was really hard to get on the Wii, because when they finally released it

58:24.480 --> 58:29.400
here in the States, after like years of waiting, they only released it at GameStop, which was

58:29.400 --> 58:31.040
a big pile of shit.

58:31.040 --> 58:35.200
Actually, I think they did do the online shop, to be fair, I think you could buy it direct

58:35.240 --> 58:36.880
through Nintendo as well, to be fair.

58:36.880 --> 58:40.800
But you couldn't buy it everywhere else, it was kind of a retailer exclusive.

58:40.800 --> 58:45.440
Well now, if you missed Xenoblade Chronicles, and you want to experience where Shulk comes

58:45.440 --> 58:50.480
from and so forth, you can actually download it on Wii U eShop, that is kind of a big release

58:50.480 --> 58:52.800
that just came out for the Wii U eShop.

58:52.800 --> 58:57.280
If you want it, it will cost you $20, or $19.99.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.880
So it is a good game.

58:58.880 --> 59:06.800
It is one of the greatest Japanese PlayStation 2 RPGs I played, yet it was on the Wii.

59:06.800 --> 59:08.960
So take that for what it's worth.

59:08.960 --> 59:13.400
And lastly, we talked a little bit about this last week, but now we have a date.

59:13.400 --> 59:19.920
The new Mass Effect ride, Mass Effect, does the ride have a name?

59:19.920 --> 59:22.200
I don't think it does, I think it's just the Mass Effect Experience.

59:22.200 --> 59:24.960
No, Mass Effect New Earth, thank you, I knew it had a name.

59:24.960 --> 59:30.880
Mass Effect New Earth is going to be opening May 18th at California's Great America.

59:30.880 --> 59:37.480
That is a Wednesday, and I'm trying to actually get over there, hopefully to do, hopefully

59:37.480 --> 59:41.360
if I can, I don't have the nice camera and all that set up that Bobby has, but I'm hoping

59:41.360 --> 59:45.280
somehow I can do some video day one to bring back for you.

59:45.280 --> 59:49.560
Obviously I can't film the ride, I think they'd probably frown on that, but if the rumors

59:49.560 --> 59:53.760
are true that there's going to be cosplayers, people dressed up, and some of the ambiance

59:53.760 --> 59:56.640
I'm sure around the ride and so forth, I'm very excited to see it.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.240
So yeah, I'm trying to make things happen so I can get over there that Wednesday to

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.920
be one of the first to ride the ride.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920
Very excited.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920
So, May 18th.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.800
Are you going to check that out at some point, Loki?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.960
I know you're not as into Mass Effect as the rest of us, but it's still a video game ride,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960
which is kind of cool.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960
No.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960
No?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960
Hater.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960
Alright.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.020
Tiger Claw in chat says, guys should dress up as Joker while at that ride.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:25.500
You know, people don't really dress up for places like Great America like they do for

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.500
Disneyland.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.380
And, well, the Disneyland thing is weird.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.540
Okay, I'm going to do a quick, quick side tangent, because this actually doesn't relate

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.100
to where, like, Jamie is there at the park today, right?

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:40.140
And today is a thing called Dapper Day, where people dress up like it was the days when

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.660
Disneyland opened, when people would dress all fancy to go to the parks.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.740
So like, you know, some friends of mine, like Victoria, who was on Guys on a Show a couple

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:51.300
weeks ago, she was wearing like this really nice dress that she made out of like a Disney

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.640
sheet and so forth.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.020
But they do this thing where you can't go into Disneyland dressed up as characters,

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.580
because they don't want people confusing you with the real characters, right?

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:07.340
But they do this thing called Disneybounding, which is where you wear something that's inspired

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340
by a ride.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:13.420
So it's like you look kind of like it's, it's like a crossbreed type of thing.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.460
So she wore a dress that looked like the Haunted Mansion colors, but it wasn't a Haunted

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.500
Mansion dress, if that makes sense.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.780
But she wore something that was very much like, oh, that looks like a Haunted Mansion

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.960
adjacent thing.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.800
So anyway, I maybe can wear my SR2 hat.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800
That's what I'll do.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:41.440
I will, I will Biowarebound when I go to California, Great America, that's what I will do.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.980
I will have my red beard and my SR2 hat.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:52.080
So like if someone came dressed up like, you know, Freddy Fazbear, you know, to Disneyland.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.660
It would be frowned on.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.400
But it doesn't look like any of the Disney characters.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.760
It just looks like one of their rides came alive and trying to eat children.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.880
They're going to get you on the fact that you're wearing a mask.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.440
You can't wear anything that conceals your face.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.720
It's not a mask, this is my face.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.040
Yeah, I think it's a safety issue because they're going to say that they can't videotape

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.600
you because, you know, there's a camera pointing at every single thing at Disneyland.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.320
Do not have sex at a Disney park.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.580
You will be filmed.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.800
I'm just saying.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.660
I've heard stories of what the Haunted Mansion employees have seen.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.800
That's all I'm going to say.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.120
Do not have sex at a Disney park.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.720
Don't do it.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.080
Unless you're into that kind of thing where you like to be an exhibitionist.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.260
No sex in Disney park.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.360
No sex in the Disney park.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.400
Absolutely positively.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.760
No sex in the Disney park.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.800
You could probably have sex at Great America though.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.880
I don't think their budget's as high as security.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.800
I can't wear my ass like I wear it.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.880
You could probably get a Bijon Gold Striker and nobody would notice.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.600
Oh wait, no, no, all those rides, they fucking film you.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
That's the big thing now.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:10.720
We're going to film you on the ride screaming and hollering and all this shit so when you

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.400
get off the ride you can see a video of how stupid you are and then we'll sell it to you

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.160
for like 30 bucks.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.080
That's the big thing they do now.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.080
You want your porno?

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:25.200
It's going to cost you $30.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.400
Which means I've got to take Extrofer to, I need to see what he's doing on May 18th.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.800
We're going to take Extrofer to the park and make him ride Top Gun or whatever they

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800
call it now.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.720
It's not called Top Gun anymore but it's going to always be Top Gun.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.000
Really fast jet ride.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Homo Erotic Volleyball.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.160
Alright, let's get to-

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:57.240
Maverick and Goose's Wild Ride.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.660
Let's get to the emails.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:04.540
Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.700
of our favorite emails to read here on the show.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:13.060
So again, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.580
Tiger Claw says, I wouldn't be surprised if people were caught having sex and it's a small

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.580
world.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.780
Why would you do that?

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.780
Don't.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.780
Don't do it.

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.780
Alright, we have several emails tonight.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.180
I'm going to get through these though.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.580
Email number one from Flaco Jones.

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:32.460
Remember last week on the show, we talked about Flaco Jones submitting to Summer Games

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.460
Done Quick.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.460
Yes.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.460
This is a follow up to that.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.460
For his, yeah.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.460
For PT.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.460
PT.

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.140
So Flaco writes us and says, just finished the latest episode and yes, I did submit one

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.660
of my PT runs for the Summer Games Done Quick marathon but it was rejected.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:50.380
They always do a spooky Games Done Quick block during the summer marathon and I was hoping

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.740
since PT is kind of short that they could have squeezed it in despite not having cool

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.940
glitches or skips.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.260
Sadly, they are only running three spooky games this year.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.940
Silent Hill 3, one of the Amnesia games and one of the Resident Evil games.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.740
I'm too lazy to look it up.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.260
I'll keep trying every time a marathon comes around.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.740
Plus, my time keeps getting better so that should help.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.060
I'm currently top three in any percent and top two in the 100% category.

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.420
I have a feeling that PT would have a better chance of making it through though if they

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.460
didn't pick another Silent Hill game for the spooky block.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.460
Wish me luck.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.700
You get accepted.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.220
Yours will be the first podcast to know.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.500
Well, I appreciate that.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.980
Tiger Claw on chat says, maybe it got rejected because it's not a proper game.

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.300
It's just a demo.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.340
You know what?

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.180
It's more than just a demo.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.180
It's much more.

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.180
How dare you?

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:40.380
It's much more than a demo.

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.140
Someday we can hope.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:46.980
Moving on to another email coming this week from YYR.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.540
Hello LR.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.140
One of the many, many NX discussion threads on NeoGAF this week again brought up the big

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.580
issue of third-party support.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.740
As it stands, love it or hate it, I think most of us can agree that the only reason

01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:02.060
to own Wii U is for its exclusives, most of which are from Nintendo themselves.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.300
Some gamers say, who cares?

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.300
I buy a Nintendo console to play Nintendo games.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:09.460
But we can easily see with the Wii U that this group isn't big enough to carry the system

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.580
on its own.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.980
How do we approach this problem?

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.020
Unfortunately, my belief is that the root of the problem is also the root of Nintendo's

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:19.540
strategy to intentionally not do the same thing that everyone else is doing, but instead

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.040
to build a console around a concept.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.900
Let's say I'm a developer, which I am.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.140
If I'm going to develop something for Wii U, I feel compelled to write a game that takes

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.980
advantage of the gamepad because of how unique it is.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.540
But because of that, it takes more effort to design or release such a game, and then

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.620
the end result can't be ported to other platforms as is.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:40.420
This makes developing for Wii U a riskier proposition right out the gate.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.980
Or I could develop something for Wii U that barely or doesn't take advantage of the gamepad

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.980
at all.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:48.660
If this means I could release the same game on other platforms, owners of these platforms

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.460
will then say, well, why would I buy it on Wii U then?

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.460
Because the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, you could get the added value of trophies

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:58.460
or achievements, the social features, and of course, the convenience of using the console

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.120
that is already your primary gaming platform.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.580
If it's a big risk regardless of the approach, why would a developer put their game on Wii

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.580
U at all?

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:09.300
And if the NX turns out to be another Nintendo concept piece, how will it change a third

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.540
party's mind about developing for a Nintendo console?

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:17.420
That I believe is the greatest challenge Nintendo faces with NX, especially in year one, when

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.900
the initial sales numbers can make or break a console.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.260
I hope they're ready for it.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:25.580
Crossing my fingers, toes, and eyes, Aaron, YYR.

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:29.820
Great email, because this kind of piggybacks on something I was saying earlier in the show,

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:35.420
but there is one little twist I want you to consider with NX that's a little different.

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:41.820
At least, again, this is all hypothesizing, but some of the loudest rumors have been that

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:46.980
there is going to be some type of handheld console synergy with the NX, which is, I

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.900
think, why Loki said earlier in the show, whatever.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.580
I wasn't expecting it until 2017 anyway, because actually, I think a lot of people were expecting

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.180
that the handheld was going to come this year, the console was going to come next year.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.300
Does this news affect that whole relationship?

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:06.720
I don't know, because we don't know what NX is, but hold on a minute and let's assume there's

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.880
a dual thing going on with the handheld slash console.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.640
There's really not a lot of competition in the handheld space right now.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640
Mobile.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.040
I mean, that's the biggest competitor.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.520
I'm sorry, but the Vita at this point is really a fringe thing, and that's not really...

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.840
Look, I know I'm pissing off Vita fans with that, but you got a dose of realism here.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.680
The Vita is kind of a fringe ultra fan thing.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.040
You think Nintendo's thing is narrow.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.320
The Vita is a very, very narrow audience right now as it is, which is too bad.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.880
I really like the Vita.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:46.760
But Nintendo kind of dominates the handheld outside of mobile, so if a company were to

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.200
make a game for NX, it's going to be a lot easier to get in that handheld space.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:59.320
So I wonder if Nintendo isn't somehow leveraging their robust third-party network on 3DS, of

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.680
which they have a lot of people still making games on 3DS, to maybe port the games that

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.760
way, if that makes any sense at all.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760
That's just...

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760
It's just a wild thought.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.240
Again, we don't really know shit until they really tell us more about what this console's

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.920
all about, but if we want to put all the rumors together and hypothesize from there, I would

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.560
say the handheld angle is what may make this a little bit different situation, because

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.840
now you're not just putting out a game that you can't put out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:33.680
or whatever, but you will have a game that's on console and the dominant handheld.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.560
Dominant dedicated handheld anyway, because I can't really ignore that mobile is kind

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.400
of a big deal.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.720
Anyway.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.580
Stop Drop in Chat says, maybe if they cater to indie games, neither Sony or Microsoft

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.440
has really gone head first in the indie scene.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.240
Maybe Nintendo can compete as a highly polished Steam store.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.640
You know, I feel like Nintendo does try to do that a little bit.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.000
They just don't do the greatest job of really pushing the indie games front and center,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.020
but if you actually go on the eShop, there is quite a bit of stuff.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.000
By the way, there's a really killer Humble Bundle right now that's some indie Nintendo

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.280
games that's definitely worth checking out, and I think there's even some commercial release.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.360
I think Rhythm Thief is one of the games in it, which was for you music game fans.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.800
You get a kick out of that.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:24.600
But to be fair, I want to say Sony, wasn't this just two E3s ago that they had a whole

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.240
line of indie developers up on the stage.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.840
And they were like, here's this, and this, and this.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.840
So I don't know if I would say that Sony and Microsoft are like, not, I kind of think they

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.840
actually, Sony and Microsoft do just as good of a job with the indies, at least right now.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.840
We'll see.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.840
We'll see.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.640
Again, the handheld thing I think could be a big deal.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.620
If that's even what it is, I don't know.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.520
Let's get to another email from AZHP.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:54.320
AZHP says, since I chimed in on earlier reports from this show about the Coleco Chameleon,

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.240
I thought I'd share the final bit of information reported by Eurogamer about our pal Mike Kennedy.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.880
The article can be found here, and he links over to a Eurogamer article, and then there's

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.120
an Atari Age post that it references as well.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.540
I'm going to summarize for the benefit of the show.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.160
Mike Kennedy came forward on the Atari Age forums announcing that he was tabling the

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:15.800
console endeavor for good, and explained that yes, the two prototype consoles were fakes.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.920
However, he claims that he was in the dark just as much as the fans who were misled.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.160
He claims that he hired a hardware engineer who provided the original prototype with in

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.400
instructions to not show the back of the unit no matter what.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.600
Mike didn't understand why, so he ended up releasing pictures of the back of the system

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.920
anyway to prove that the console was actually plugged in.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.080
This is when the unit was identified as a Super Nintendo Jr. inside a Jaguar shell.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.640
When he took this information back to his engineer, he insisted that it was Super Nintendo

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.280
parts for the output, but the rest was his.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.060
Kennedy believed him, and they released images of the clear Jaguar shell with the PCP visible.

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:52.680
According to Kennedy, he even joked about how people online were trying to identify

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.880
the board in our shell, laughing and telling me they won't find it because it's our

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880
original work.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.440
Again, I believed him.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:03.080
After the PCB was exposed to be a PCI capture card, Kennedy withdrew from the venture.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.160
He claims he was swindled out of nearly $10,000 of development costs and is just as much a

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.520
victim as anyone else.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.640
Whether or not this is true will only be ever known by those involved, but this is likely

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.080
the last we will hear regarding what actually happened with the chameleon.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.160
If it's true, I do feel sorry for Mike as he just wanted to revive retro games, which

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.820
was clearly a passion of his as he spoke about on this very show.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:27.300
Now his name is tarnished, and he will likely never be able to launch a video game-related

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.300
endeavor again.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.000
Hopefully, you all found this enlightening.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Yours truly, AZHP.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Thank you for the follow-up.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.600
I appreciate it.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.840
I hope that what he is saying is true.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.280
I have no reason to disbelieve it.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.360
It is just a real bummer.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.520
It just sounds like, and with all due respect, obviously, he's been on the show before, and

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:50.520
I don't know if he listens, but I know some people who work with him do.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.240
I'm sure he's a brilliant guy, and I'm sure he does really enjoy the retro gaming and

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240
all that stuff.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.020
It just sounds like if I'm taking all this when I'm reading at face value, he was just

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.200
in over his head.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.860
He got into a venture that he really needed to rely on other people to kind of help out,

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.200
and that's what you do sometimes.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.960
You might be the producer, but you really rely on building that team.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.760
I can't believe I'm going to fucking use this analogy, but here I go.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.600
Donald Trump keeps saying if he becomes president, he's going to surround himself with a cabinet

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:26.040
of people that know what they're doing, essentially, because obviously Donald Trump does not know

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040
what he's doing.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040
Am I really making this comparison?

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.240
My God.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.280
But that's what you do.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.840
If you're a good producer, you surround yourself with people that are going to lift you up,

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.400
and it sounds like, unfortunately, he got done in by some of the people he surrounded

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.520
himself with, and it's unfortunate too bad.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.520
So there it is.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.560
Now I need to take a shower after making that comparison.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.860
Here's the thing about that guy, dude.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:56.800
He claims that it was this other person that made this prototype console and said, hey,

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.920
whatever you do, don't show the back of the console.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.880
Wouldn't that kind of like send out some red flags, or wouldn't you want to dig in there

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.080
to see what exactly was in that console prototype that you paid this guy several thousand dollars

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080
to make?

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.280
And then after it was come out that that, oh, yeah, it was a Super Nintendo in there,

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.320
you went back to the same fucking idiot to put out another fucking prototype that ended

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.000
up being another fake.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.920
It's like, come on.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.440
Hindsight is 20-20, what can I say?

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.600
Stop Drop wants to offer another perspective here in chat from live.vognetwork.com saying

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.000
he's so full of it, he's not the victim here, he already had drama in the Indiegogo campaign,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.520
he knows he had to have all his ducks in a row, he has no excuse for claiming ignorance,

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.720
as if this is the first time he's ever gone down this road.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:52.160
All right, let's get to our last email tonight from Raginator, who says, hi, OLR.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.360
As per usual, it's Raginator, and I have a short email for you this week.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.360
You're welcome, DarkSakura.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.120
Haha, joke's on you, she's not here.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.520
As you may remember, every so often on OLR, I practically beg companies to re-release

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.080
their classic games on Steam.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.840
Well, to a limited degree, it would seem that Namco has listened.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.480
A week to ten days ago, they released four titles for individual sale, two of which technically

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.080
were available via Pac-Man Museum, Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.240
Just a quick aside, Raginator, they also released these on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.320
It actually isn't unique to PC, but yes, it did hit PC as well.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.200
While I won't speak for others, I'll say this.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.840
While this is rather limited and not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.480
I hope the trend continues, not just with Namco, but with other companies as well.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.480
This email was brought to you by Rocket Weasel, home of the rocket-propelled, asploding weasels.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.480
Thank you, Raginator.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.880
Yes, lots of retroactivity on Steam between what Loki was talking about earlier and what

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.840
you're bringing up with the classic arcade releases.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.440
And I suppose, as with most things in the industry, if those re-releases sell well,

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.920
then they'll do more.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:04.080
Which is why I kind of wish Namco had done something else.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.600
Like you said, they released games they've already done in Pac-Man Museum.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:14.840
And I want to say Dig Dug was in a PlayStation 3 collection, Galaga is available on Xbox

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.400
One and Xbox 360.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:24.480
I just feel like these choices are not exactly new, so I kind of wish Nintendo would look

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.960
elsewhere in the catalog for some things to release because Namco has a very rich 80s

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.960
arcade library.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.800
So I don't know, maybe Pac-Man is kind of a big deal, so I guess it's to test the waters,

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.800
but we'll see.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800
We'll see what comes of it.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.240
I did want to say, though, on kind of a tangent thing, because this is something Raginator

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.560
brought up a couple weeks ago, and Loki, maybe you saw this as well.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.480
Do you remember when Raginator was talking about the whole movies on Steam thing and

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.800
that there's not a lot of movies available on Steam?

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.800
I swear to God, just within the last week, I see an ad on Steam, Lionsgate is now selling

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.360
movies on Steam, and you can get like Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay and all

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360
this stuff.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.640
You can get these movies, probably Saw is on there, too, Lionsgate.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.160
You can get a lot of these movies through Steam.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.240
Here's the thing, though, because the first, the minute I saw that, I thought of, huh,

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.240
that's interesting because we just had that discussion on the show this last week about

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.080
what are they going to do when they have to hit the kill switch.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.720
These movies that they're selling are rentals.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.080
They're not actually to own the title.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.640
It's just to rent them, so I guess that's how they got around that.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.800
But anyway, I just, I thought of that, Raginator, because your email or call or something from

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:37.720
last week, and then like literally in the past seven days, suddenly we have expanded

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.080
movie presence on Steam, so I just thought that was very interesting.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:46.320
So, um, uh, SHO and Hunter Matt says, Raginator is Steam's biggest fanboy.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.280
Of course, they'd have tabs on his thoughts.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.840
All right, there it is.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.120
Thank you for all the emails this week.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.280
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for consideration

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.080
for a future week.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.520
We're just a couple stories away from your calls, but first, we have to get some of the

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.640
angst out in a little segment we call the FUs of the Week.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:23.920
Um, F you to being sick.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:29.600
Thankfully, it's a lot better now because I don't have a fever, but like from seriously

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:38.000
Monday through practically Friday, I was running a fever all the time, even with, you know,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.720
ibuprofen and acetaminophen in my system.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:48.240
It was just not fun whatsoever because that made it very hard to learn a new job since

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:53.560
I'm kind of working in a different position at the moment, but thankfully I'm better now,

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.480
but it's still congested, so that still sucks and tired and goddammit, why won't this load

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480
up?

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.040
Are you trying to dinker around with something there on the Gear VR?

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.200
Yeah, I was trying to get the Gear VR Minecraft to work, but like I popped it in there.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.920
It's all installed the Gear VR software.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.680
I'm like, it's already fucking on there.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.680
I've used it before.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.680
Okay, fine.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.680
All right.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:22.280
My FU of the Week goes to getting sick because I've been sick like three times in the past

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.280
six months.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.200
This is ridiculous.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.440
People in my job are going to be like, what's wrong with you?

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.180
You're a big box of cooties.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.480
They're probably not wrong.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.480
That's how I feel.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.200
Anyway, I'm hoping, I'm hoping whatever this is will blow over really quick because I would

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.360
like to, I would like to work next week.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.840
There's a lot of stuff going on.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.080
Anyhow, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we are going to get to the Skype

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.080
line.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.200
But first, Logie's going to have to put down the Gear VR and get to our last story.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.720
So you know, last we heard of them, they were basically messing with Activision.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:02.040
Activision finally wiped their hands clean of them and now they've parted ways.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:09.800
Now they have turned towards Ubisoft and they're making purchases of their shares to,

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.340
I don't know, maybe try to take over the company.

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:20.960
But apparently after receiving the buyout package from Activision, they've been buying

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.320
up shares of Ubisoft, hinting at a hostile takeover.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:31.140
Their control, let's see, their last purchase that they made brought their control percentage

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:38.100
up to 17.73% and 15% of the voting shares.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.740
And of course Ubisoft made a comment regarding this as well.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:47.100
We are not at all surprised by this latest statement from Vivendi nor by the intent behind

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.100
it.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:56.620
This is a confirmation of their habitual strategy of creeping control in which they say they

01:20:56.620 --> 01:21:01.660
have no intention to take control of Ubisoft while steadily increasing their stake and

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.700
preparing for an offensive at the next annual shareholders meeting.

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:15.460
This strategy successfully, sorry, this strategy of successively announcing conflicting intentions

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:22.100
is contrary to good corporate practices and is not in the best interest of Ubisoft's other

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.100
shareholders.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:28.940
Moreover, despite our repeated written requests since they first entered into our capital,

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:34.300
Vivendi has never presented any details or a convincing plan on how this supposed cooperation

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:35.540
would take place.

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:41.580
Ubisoft's management remains committed to preserving the independence of the company,

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:48.980
which the condition for long-term value creation that will benefit for all of our shareholders.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:55.940
So I don't know, it didn't work out that great last time that they took over a company.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:56.940
So we'll see.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:03.460
It would be interesting to see what the long-term vision is there, especially going into what

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:09.180
could be a new console cycle here or half console cycle.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:17.540
Well lastly, but not leastly, we have an esports related story and boy, this is embarrassing,

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:18.940
but it's not loading for me.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:23.940
So unfortunately, all I know is I don't have the details, I just have the headline, but

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:30.260
there's an esports league out there that has banned you porn from sponsoring an esports

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.260
team.

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.900
Poor you porn, can't catch a break.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:37.620
What do you mean they don't want to associate pornography with esports?

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.380
What's up with that?

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:44.020
I think you should take, you know, whoever, whatever sponsors you can.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:46.180
So yeah, basically it says the ESL.

01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.180
Oh, thank you.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.180
Yeah.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.180
And it finally, go ahead, go ahead though.

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.180
It finally came up.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.180
No, go ahead.

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.180
Go ahead.

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.180
All right.

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:59.220
The ESL, the directors of the esports league, eslgaming.com, they have ruled that you porn,

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:03.820
that team is going to be banned because of the association with that sponsor.

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.540
Advertising pornography is not legal in the markets we operate in and the vast majority

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:12.520
of partners we're working with have a strict no drugs, no alcohol, no pornography rule,

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.960
no fun, Jesus, rules that we've contractually taken on board.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.240
These aren't new rules, but ones that have been in our rule books for a long time.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.200
We spoke to the manager of team YP earlier this year.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.920
And in that conversation, we explained the situation and rules in detail and offered

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.560
to look for potential alternatives in a bigger group.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.080
At the same time, we are consulting with our legal teams about this.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.460
We will inform the team and management as soon as we have any updates.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.680
So there you go.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.920
You porn team has been banned.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920
Come on.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.720
If it's on the internet, there's porn.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.080
Like people don't know that.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.080
What's the big deal with porn anyway?

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.920
I think what's more shocking is they're playing Evolve.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.680
Stop dropping chat asks, did the you porn team yell money shot instead of headshot?

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.680
Maybe.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.720
I don't know.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.040
Is this the actual you porn team that they show in the picture here?

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040
I don't think so.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.040
Yeah.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.880
I think they're just, I think they're just, that's going to, that's going to be interesting

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.880
though when your team just, the stock photo just ends up on the you porn story.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.880
Who gives a shit?

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.160
I mean, I, it's just a company.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.800
I'm sorry that you don't like what they do now.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.640
I think you should have your, you know, that would make it more exciting.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:37.120
Sex drugs and you know, alcohol, that should all be a part of this e-sports thing.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120
You know what I, here's the thing.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.920
If you porn, yeah, I guess this is the same group cause this is a, a tiger clause posted

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920
a picture in the chat.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920
So it is the same group.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.920
Hey, if you porn wants to sponsor this show, I'm all for it.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.640
Bring it on.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.560
We'll interview some of the actors and actresses.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.880
We'll go, we'll go the whole nine yards.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.880
What do you guys think?

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.760
Should OLR sell out to you porn?

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.760
Yes or no?

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.440
Yes, I'm fully, I'm fully fine with selling out to you porn.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.240
All right.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.880
We put it out there.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:18.520
You porn, you participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to come on over.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520
All right.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.680
Uh, that's it for the, uh, news that we had on deck tonight.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:23.680
So we're going to open up the Skype line.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.920
I know it's a little early, but I warned you guys it was going to be a shorter show tonight.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.920
One eight seven seven game OLR or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.920
All one word.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.880
If you want to give us a call, um, while we wait to see if any calls come in.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.160
Uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.920
Uh, no.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:50.360
Sadly, no, there wasn't a whole lot, um, last minute stuff.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.760
Yeah, it actually, all things considered, despite the, uh, big news about Nintendo that

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.400
happened, um, it seemed to be a little bit, a little bit more relaxed this week.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.120
It was, it was a little bit quieter.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.860
I was scanning through Twitter to see if we got any tweets this week.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.180
This one's really random, but we were tweeted something by blue swim a few days ago that

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.900
talks about, I don't know if you heard about this Loki, maybe you saw the, um, uh, tweet

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.540
as well, but ABC is bringing back the match game.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540
Oh yeah.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.540
Alec Baldwin is the host.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.660
It's kind of a weird choice for host for me.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:25.760
I mean, you know, Alec Baldwin was great on 30 rock, but there was something I was going

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.760
to mention.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.740
It's like Clyde brought up to me earlier and I did watch it, um, this weekend, um, was

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:37.380
that independent animation that was done for Star Fox called a Fox in space.

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.380
Oh yeah.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.380
Have you watched that?

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.380
Yeah.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380
You were tweeting.

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.380
I have not watched it, but I, it's actually pretty cool.

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:45.340
It's, it's like, uh, it's, it's a very interesting style.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:50.380
Remind me like a, like early eighties, you know, like more of the, not, not necessarily

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:58.080
adult, but like, you know, kind of like that adult style, um, cartoon or animation from

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.580
like the early eighties, I guess, you know, where it's.

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:06.180
Back when cartoons, you know, were just, it's a medium, you know, where they had some adult

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:11.380
storylines like heavy metal, you know, for example, um, you know, something like that,

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.660
but it was, you know, Star Fox related and I thought it was pretty cool.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.660
Hmm.

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.660
No, I didn't see that.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:17.660
I'll have to check that out.

01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.380
I still need to watch the final fantasy 15 anime too.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:23.620
Cause that was the thing that came out a few weeks ago when they did the big fantasy 15

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.960
event and I still haven't watched that.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.300
So yeah, tiger claw linked it in chat, so go check it out.

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:29.300
Awesome.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:30.300
All right.

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:31.300
I'll do one last call for calls.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.300
It's early tonight.

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.140
It's probably throwing some people off, but we'll see, uh, one eight seven seven game

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.100
O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:43.580
Um, but I think, I think we just have less, uh, of an audience and stuff tonight just

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.460
because Bobby wasn't here.

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:49.220
And then I think there isn't, isn't game of Thrones back tonight or something.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.220
Is it?

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220
Yeah, I think it is.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.920
So there, there goes Sunday nights for some people and these are, these are the ones that

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.340
now are in uncharted territory because they are past the books at this point because George

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.780
R R Martin can't write fast enough.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.300
Although somehow he's killing everybody in 2016.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:09.180
Ah, I don't get it.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.180
All right.

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.260
Oh, well our phone is lighting up, so let's get to it.

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.260
Hello.

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.260
You're on orange songs radio.

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.260
Who's this?

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:18.380
I guess it's the savior of the show, Rama.

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.940
Hey Rama, how's it going?

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.380
Ah, pretty good.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.380
Pretty good.

01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:26.260
I'm just kind of relaxing after a fun, interesting weekend.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.860
Did you do a con this weekend or what?

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:29.860
What was your weekend?

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:30.860
Uh, no.

01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:36.060
Uh, this weekend was Sakuna Matsuri, but I decided I didn't go because I forgot to get

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.020
time off and so forth.

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:44.140
And I triple booked my weekend and then I was like, you know what, maybe I will go cause

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.420
someone had an extra pass.

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:50.060
I get up this morning, it's raining and I'm like, I'm not taking my thousand dollars of

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:53.060
equipment out into the, no, not doing it.

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.060
Nope.

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.060
Nope.

01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.060
Nope.

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:59.660
I'm like, um, my end of June is looking crazy right now.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:01.900
I'm like triple booked crazy.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:06.060
So anyway, I just opened up outlook and I'm like, let me look at my calendar for next,

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.060
for the summer.

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:09.060
I'm just like, Oh shit.

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.060
Yeah.

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.060
Fuck.

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.060
Well, what's on your mind?

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:17.260
Uh, this whole thing about Nintendo, I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:22.180
Nintendo has fail us in the past, but I can overlook those for what they were trying to

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.180
do.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:27.300
I don't think the NX is going to quote unquote, make or break the company.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:30.380
I mean, they have one hell of a war chest.

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:37.820
If you ask me, the console just has to have the tech to keep up with everybody else.

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:44.380
And it, and I believe the rumor that it's going to be PC based, which means cheaper

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.380
overhead costs.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:50.040
You just pull what you need off of, off the shelves and everything's going to just rock

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.520
and roll.

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.920
Um, but what about the whole backwards compatibility?

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.760
Cause that's something Nintendo is famous for.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.460
I would be very surprised if they did not retain backwards compatibility with at least

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:06.440
the Wii U games that would really surprise me if they jumped that whole ship.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.800
I just have three words about that.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.800
Fuck backwards compatibility.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.240
Oh, those are some strong words.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.240
Maybe it's me.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.400
I look at it this way.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.400
Yes.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.400
I have my PS3.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.760
I have the hardware fat model that's fully compatible with the PS2.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.280
Do you know what else I have sitting up hooked up to my TV?

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.280
My PS2.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.740
Just cause I do have import games that do not play on my PS3.

01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:38.240
If I was go out and get an Xbox one, I would not trade in my Xbox 360 because maybe out

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.320
of my collection, only one game would be compatible.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.880
Plus you're also looking at, you have two different types of hardware architecture to

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:47.880
deal with.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.560
That would increase the overhead costs of the system.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:56.120
I had an interesting discussion with a friend of mine about this and she was trying to prove

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.800
the point of the backwards compatibility on the PS4 and I'm just like, well that's all

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.000
streaming between you and me.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.040
I'm not paying monthly for a streaming service for it to play older titles.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:14.280
I will not pay, like if I already paid 40 bucks on a game for the 360, if they recode

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.520
the game for the Xbox one, I'm not going to spend another 40 bucks when I already have

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.520
the game.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:25.040
I'd rather deal with the patience of the emulation or I'll just pop in my 360 and I'll play it.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.720
I really wish though that PlayStation 3 was backwards compatible on PlayStation 4 and

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:35.160
it kind of irritates me that they even have that whole PlayStation Now thing and yet if

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.200
I put a PS3 disc in the drive, it's still not going to let me do it.

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.200
I'm going to have to buy it separately.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.760
It just kind of irritates me.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.080
I'm out of shelf space is what it is, Rama.

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:48.520
I mean, I don't have space for all these fucking consoles in the living room and so

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.520
I had to make a choice.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:54.320
I moved the PS3 out to the, I only use the PS3 now for TuneIn here in the studio so we

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.960
can listen to Bobby's show while we wait for OLR.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.520
That's pretty much the use of the PS3 right now.

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.000
I don't really game a lot on it anymore.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.240
I really wish, if nothing else, if I could just like stream from the PS3 to the PS4,

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:10.320
even that would be something but I just kind of doubt that's going to be a thing.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:15.080
I mean, theoretically with the proper hardware software, you could do it, Sony could do it,

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.800
but they probably don't want to.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:22.960
But again, it's two different types of architectures and it's going to be harder to emulate like

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:28.520
on the Xbox One, emulate the power PC processor and for the PS3 is hard and like the cell

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.520
processor to Sony, it's just cheaper to offer this service.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:39.560
Now if I had a PS4 and these games are streaming compatible, if I did not have the game, I

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.960
would not mind paying monthly to play those backwards compatible games.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:48.920
But if that game is on my shelf, I want to run that service, pop the game in, and not

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.920
pay for it.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.920
Yeah, I agree.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.640
I really wish that's the way they'd done it, but for whatever reason it's not.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:59.200
We can always hope that maybe they'll change it, come out E3, I just hope, here's what

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:05.480
I really hope, because this would be such a fucking Nintendo thing to do.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.640
They come out and say the PlayStation 4 Neo will be backwards compatible with PlayStation

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.640
4 or PlayStation 3.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.520
I'm going to be so fucking mad if that's the case.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:18.920
I've been reading specs on it and the upgrade for the PlayStation 4 has me kind of pissed

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920
off.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.120
I mean from this aspect of how much memory that's going to be in the system, I mean like

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120
memory is cheap.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.760
You mean to tell me you can't put an extra eight gigs in the system?

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.920
Yes, I know the dev kits are designed around eight, but if you put another eight in there,

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.440
the games will run a lot smoother and a lot faster.

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.320
I mean, come on, fam.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.320
Come on.

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.320
Yeah.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.400
Well, it seems like we've got a lot of questions going into E3, but the good news is we only

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.880
have, what, not even six weeks to wait.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:46.880
Yeah.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.880
So we'll get there.

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:48.880
Very much.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.840
All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else comes through, but

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.480
have a good week and we'll talk to you next time.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.480
Yeah, bro.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480
You take care of yourself.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.480
All right.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.480
Take care.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.480
Bye.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.480
Bye.

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.880
For the folks just joining us, if you joined late, yes, we are already in phone calls.

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.640
It is going to be a shorter show tonight just because at the top of the show I mentioned

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.800
I'm actually not feeling too well, but I really, really did not want to skip another week.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.960
My nose is getting bleh and my throat is scratchy, so I did not really want to talk for the full

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.000
three hours.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.840
So I hope you guys all understand we are doing a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.400
we just, we had to do something because we've just been missing too many weeks lately and

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.880
I don't want to be a bimonthly show.

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:25.600
I want to be a weekly show with incidental weeks off.

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.840
Anyway, we'll put one more shout out there for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or I usually name

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:34.520
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.040
And then after we get this last call, looks like we've got one more call coming in.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:41.960
Who's this?

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:42.960
Hey, this is Akdeft.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:43.960
Hi, Akdeft.

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.240
What's up?

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.740
Why can't we be so negative against Nintendo?

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:54.520
Why can't we be negative against Nintendo or why are we negative?

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.640
Well, why can't we and why are we negative against Nintendo?

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:06.720
Well, I could show you a tweet that says, please look forward to the new Zelda game

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.120
coming holiday of 2015.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.520
So maybe some people just feel that Nintendo is disappointing with the pushback and the

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.520
pushback.

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.920
And yes, I know the whole Miyamoto line about, you know, a good, a bad game is bad and the

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.240
good game will be memorable and everybody will forget.

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.120
But at the same time, you know, you sort of, I think you kind of invest yourself and you,

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.240
you emotionally get ready for some of these games and even those folks that support Nintendo

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.720
kind of champion and saying, you know, these games are coming, they're going to be awesome.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:38.480
And then to find out they're not, it's just, it's a little disheartening, you know, but

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.240
again, I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.840
I tend to feel like, all right, once 2017 gets here, if the NX really delivers with

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:52.760
the games I want, I'm telling you, if the NX has like Metroid, F-Zero, Mario, this conversation

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.760
is done.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.640
I am on the NX day one.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.680
I probably will be no matter what anyway.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.260
But like, you know, with the right games, Nintendo will pull it out.

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:06.320
But maybe the fact that those right games never seem to show up is also part of the

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.320
reason we get very frustrated with Nintendo.

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320
I don't know.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.320
What are your thoughts?

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:16.240
Well, I would think, uh, partially like that, yeah, we do have some games that don't deliver

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.280
on their promises and all that.

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:28.480
And with the Wii U, it was a really, really, uh, like a hard, uh, period, if we could say

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480
that.

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:37.160
Uh, when only, uh, well, we can say a handful of games were really, really, really excellent.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:42.920
Though I do have a vast, uh, Wii U library and I could pretty much mention more than

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.920
10.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:52.480
But yeah, most people probably want at least, uh, five games that they want with the system.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:37:05.040
And I hope the NX fixes that problem and Nintendo does get the idea that we want some of the

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:11.200
older games like F-Zero, like a new Metroid and all that stuff.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.720
But we also kind of underestimate Nintendo a lot.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.000
And I mean a lot.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:28.000
We uh, like Splatoon and even Pikmin 3, like many people, and I was reading a tweet earlier

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.340
today that said, oh, the Nintendo Wii U doesn't have any strategy games.

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:39.920
And I'm like, uh, what about Pikmin 3, which is one of, I don't, I'm not into strategy

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.000
games, but Pikmin 3 was pretty, pretty good.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:53.720
So I don't know about that and, and the Nintendo Wii U has some really great games that pretty

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.160
much were overlooked.

01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:03.840
That's my, my probably biggest problem with people, uh, saying that the Wii U failed when,

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.440
uh, most of the time they didn't even give it, give them a chance, chance, sorry.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:16.440
Um, I, I, I would agree that there's a lot of people out there that probably hate on

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:21.200
the Wii U that's probably never touched one, but that's just the nature of the internet,

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.200
unfortunately.

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:28.440
And, um, I, I think, you know, there's also a lot of Wii U champions out there too.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:32.280
So it's kind of a, it's kind of a mixed bag, I suppose, on, on Twitter and in any circle

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:35.560
of gaming, you're always going to have the Nintendo fans and so forth.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.320
But I think too, part of Nintendo's kind of tone, I think changed with Wii U and I

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.680
really blame third parties for that.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.480
You look, you go back and you look at that first E3, it looked like every third party

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:50.720
in the world was gung ho about the Wii U.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:55.180
The problem was is that they made a key error and that was that all the games that they

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:59.360
released right out the gate were rehashes of games that they had just put out a year

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.400
ago.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:06.240
And I think if there had been more games like Zombie U out the gate and less, I hate to

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.520
say it, Mass Effect 3 and less Batman, Arkham, whatever game it was that it was a silent,

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:17.720
no, it was Arkham Knight, no, it was Arkham City, whatever, whatever Batman game came

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.760
out on Wii U when it came out, you know, if it was less of that and more of the stuff

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.800
like Zombie U and so forth coming from third parties, it would have helped tremendously.

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:34.580
I think and I have a feeling Nintendo pushing back the MX may have something to do with

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.440
third parties more than we think.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.120
The third parties might have said we need more time to make these games work and Nintendo

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.680
is giving it to them because they do not want to make the same mistake twice.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:53.760
Not to mention that, yeah, the Wii U lacked a lot of first party support too at the beginning.

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:59.500
What was the only game or I think two games that were Nintendo published that were Nintendo

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:06.960
Land and I think, I can't remember exactly but I think it was also Gaming Wario.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.960
But yeah, also Nintendo didn't push like a big game.

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.440
That's probably why we're also seeing the new Zelda on the NX.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440
Yeah.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:21.480
I think Nintendo may have underestimated how fast EA and Ubisoft were going to get

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.600
the fuck out of there.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.560
I think that really caught them off guard.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.280
Yeah, pretty much.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.280
Yeah.

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.280
All right.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.080
Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.080
thoughts.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.080
I appreciate it.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.080
Hey, thanks for having me.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.080
All right.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.080
Take care, my friend.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.080
All right.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.920
That is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:43.880
I want to thank you guys for being here, whether it be on the live or the podcast feed, I really

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.160
appreciate that.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:49.240
You know what we always say here at OLR, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.400
about the show.

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.800
Help us spread the word.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.520
We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't share those voices unless you

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.800
guys use them.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.000
Dark Sakura will be back next week and we'll catch up with how her week at Disneyland was

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.240
and what all games she got to play, maybe she got to visit the arcade there or something.

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.240
I don't know.

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.960
I want to say that PinnaGogo, the pinball thing, is coming up really soon too.

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:15.400
I don't know if that's next week or two weeks away but I'm sure Dark Sakura will give us

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.040
some perspective on that as well.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.160
Loki, have fun with your Gear VR.

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.880
Yeah, I didn't get my old ass controller to sync with it.

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.360
Try to play some games this week, now that you're feeling a little better.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.480
Uh, yeah.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.440
And I'll try to play something that's not just Final Fantasy XIV or Diablo.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.720
You guys, I just love online games, I just do.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.720
Keep on giving.

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.440
Anyway, that's what I play.

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:41.440
Final thoughts tonight?

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.840
Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.560
I'm going to go buy a new Bluetooth controller because this one doesn't work.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.560
What?

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:52.080
Well it works but it doesn't work with what I want it to work with.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.440
I got to buy something more generic.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.480
Well hey, at least you have a little time tonight.

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.320
You might be able to get the best buy before they close, who knows.

01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.320
Uh, no.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320
Don't.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.320
Close at 8.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.320
Oh, I thought it was 9.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.320
Alright.

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.000
And then my final thought is I'm going to just rest up, I'm going to go have some tea

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.320
and just try to rest my voice and feel better.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.840
Thank you guys for understanding and bearing with our ups and our downs.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.880
Your support means an awful lot and that's why we continue to do this as much as we can

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.600
for free every week for you guys.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.680
Really appreciate it.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.040
Have a great week.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.040
Go play some games.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.040
Have fun.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.280
We'll talk about games again in seven days.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.280
Good night everybody.
