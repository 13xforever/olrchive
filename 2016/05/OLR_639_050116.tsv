0	17960	This week, not to be outdone by the PS4 Neo, Microsoft 2 hits the rumor mill with reports
17960	20720	of an Xbox One slim body as well as another controller update.
20720	24000	It's not all rumors this week as we also have delays, updates, releases and so much more
24000	27320	and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27680	30680	Orange Lounge Radio
31680	34600	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34600	36160	where every gamer has a voice.
36160	44680	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, May the 1st of 2016, episode number 639 of our show.
44680	50400	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in lovely Sacramento, California, Studio N7 to
50400	54960	talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with you every Sunday
54960	60120	night live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right
60120	64120	after the Bobby Black Wolf show with my co-host.
64120	66600	Joining me tonight, say hello everybody to Tech Master, Loki.
66600	67600	Hello.
67600	68760	How are you, Loki?
68760	69760	I'm hungry.
69760	70760	Yes.
70760	72440	Loki got in here just in the nick of time.
72440	78800	I was really worried I was about to go on air by myself, all by myself.
78800	83920	Nobody wanted that to happen so Loki got here just under the buzzer I guess because they
83920	84920	were taking a long time.
84920	87680	They were stupid, yeah.
87680	90040	Perfectly rational explanation.
90040	94840	Obviously we are usually joined by the lovely Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
94840	98400	I would not want to neglect her introduction but she's not here tonight.
98400	101960	I mentioned last week she was going to be out this week.
101960	105740	She was on a brief little two-week hiatus from the show just because she had been sick
105740	109520	last week and she's at Disneyland today with Dan.
109520	110900	Actually no, they are not at Disneyland.
110900	115740	They are at California Adventure because I guess they had to do one or the other because
115740	117300	it's expensive to do both now.
117300	120460	Have you seen the cost of freaking Disney tickets lately?
120460	127140	So they decided to just do California Adventure today so they are there riding California
127140	131540	Screamin' over and over and on the Toy Story ride, I'm sure.
131540	133580	So that's where she is at.
133580	137300	Our pal Bobby Black Wolf, usually on before us here at the Voice of the Geeks Network,
137300	138300	was also not on tonight.
138700	144420	So it's a very lonely night here, Sunday night, at VOG Network, just myself and Loki.
144420	151380	And here's the other funny thing is that I'm not feeling so, well, I feel okay.
151380	154480	Like I don't like have a fever or anything but maybe you might be able to hear my voice
154480	155480	a little bit.
155480	157380	I'm starting to get like sinacy.
157380	160100	My throat's getting a little scratchy so it's like great.
160100	163700	I'm catching whatever's going around which I think Loki had a little bit of last week
163700	166100	and I know Alan has been fighting off.
166100	170660	So it's like, oh my gosh, something out there like does not want OLR.
170660	174500	Like does something bad happen if OLR hits 14 years?
174500	178300	Because I feel like the forces out there are trying to prevent Orange Laundry.
178300	180020	No, you know what it is?
180020	182340	We're not allowed to hit episode number 666.
182340	183340	That's what's happening.
183340	187900	The forces out there are trying to stop us from getting to 666 with all these, what,
187900	191260	sicknesses and things that come up and so forth.
191260	196800	So yeah, I'm not feeling 100% my best today, but I'm going to like, I really don't want
196800	199220	to turn into a bi-monthly show.
199220	201820	So I'm going to push through tonight, but we'll probably be a little bit shorter of
201820	202820	a show tonight.
202820	205620	We're going to try to just push through one solid segment here.
205620	207100	No break tonight.
207100	212180	We cut a few story slots and a couple of our regular segments and thinking we'll be done
212180	213620	at about eight o'clock.
213620	217640	But I'm thinking, how long is your podcast when you're thinking, it's going to be a short
217640	218640	show tonight.
218640	219640	It's going to be about two hours.
219640	222840	Anyway, enough of that type of housekeeping stuff.
222840	225120	You guys are here to talk about video games.
225120	227160	Let's get into it this week.
227160	229320	Um, Loki, I wanted to start off with this.
229320	230320	Sorry, my friend.
230320	235040	I know you're trying to eat, but we have to talk about this because everybody's talking
235040	236040	about this.
236040	241600	Uh, this was all over Twitter a couple of days ago, literally in the middle of the night,
241600	245920	Nintendo drops tweets on us announcing some like huge news, right?
245920	246920	What happened?
246920	249680	Tell us a little bit about this Nintendo stuff.
249680	255400	Um, they said that they were going to have announced new amiibos, is that what we're
255400	256400	talking about?
256400	259080	No, no, I don't, I don't think it's the new amiibos.
259080	263720	I think that was also a thing, but there was more fanfare for the damn amiibos than there
263720	265680	was this news.
265680	272360	That the NX is scheduled to be coming out around, I think March of next year.
272360	279200	And that Zelda is being delayed to coincide with its launch, which is who's big shock.
279200	286840	Although it's not because we kind of figured it was, yeah, you make it sound like the most
286840	292040	anticlimactic thing that ever happened, but my God, because we know nothing about the
292040	293040	system.
293040	296000	Did you read any news sites that day?
296000	301180	Because I swear to God, the tone all over the internet on these websites was Nintendo
301180	302900	is fucked.
302900	307280	Like I don't think that's the headline they can actually run on the front page of yahoo,
307280	310020	but I swear to God, if they could, that's what they would have said.
310020	316860	Because every fricking like place is running this story about how fucked Nintendo is because
316860	325500	of this news that like I, one headline's like the Wii U is the biggest purchase I ever regret
325500	326500	or something like that.
326500	330060	Like I regret buying the Wii U more than anything else I've ever bought in my life.
330060	335820	And I'm just like, fucking sit down, you drama queen, take all the seats.
335820	342560	Like really clearly you never bought an Engage or, you know, or a Ouya.
342560	343560	I shouldn't say that.
343560	345300	We actually have Ouya fans out there, but you know what I mean?
345300	348820	I think there are far worse things to have happened to gaming than the Wii U, but maybe
348820	350740	that's just my perspective.
350740	353340	I tend to defend Nintendo a little more on the show.
353340	356780	I'm sure the listeners are dying to know what you think of all this.
356780	363940	I thought that's when it was coming out anyways, was in the first part next year, I'm in that
363940	367360	that, Oh, Zelda was delayed to launch with the system.
367360	368360	No shit.
368360	371020	It was going to launch with the system.
371020	372020	I don't know.
372020	374380	Nothing was a surprise to me.
374380	379540	Big surprise, I guess is that, Hey, we're not making games for the Wii U.
379540	381140	So now that one will.
381140	386580	Well then there was the big E3 thing where, Hey, the only thing we're bringing to E3 are
386580	388500	at least that's, that's what it sounds like.
388500	392860	Like I still, I still kind of can't believe this, but the way the tweets were worded,
392860	396860	it really made it sound like we're going to just bring Zelda.
396860	397860	That's it.
397860	402940	We got this big old booth and we're just going to have the Zelda line take up the booth because
402940	404580	we know y'all want to play it.
404580	408380	So Zelda is the only thing we're basically bringing to E3 and I'm thinking in the back
408380	411340	of my mind, I'm like, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
411340	413380	Zelda is the only thing you're going to bring.
413380	420300	Maybe it's the only thing you're bringing on Wii U to E3, but what about Pokemon sun
420300	421340	and moon?
421340	423580	Those games are kind of a big deal.
423580	427460	They're really a big deal now that you've basically said, you're not going to have a
427460	431620	console game in 2016 that, that, that, and that's why everybody's running with these
431620	438700	headlines about how fucked Nintendo is, is because Nintendo has no 2016 holiday basically
438700	442700	and when it comes to the Wii U, but they're obviously still going to have a game when
442700	447260	it comes to the 3DS because Pokemon is not something to sneeze at.
447260	451540	I think Nintendo's mobile advances are nothing to be ignored.
451540	455060	That was the other surprise they dropped that, you know, everybody's talking, oh my God,
455060	460540	NX, NX, but they also kind of dropped, and this is a big deal, that Fire Emblem and Animal
460540	465660	Crossing are the franchises that are tapped to come to mobile and Animal Crossing I think
465660	467740	makes a lot of freaking sense.
467740	471220	Granted, I think it's going to end up pretty much being the same stinking game we've been
471220	476020	playing for 15 years now, ever since the GameCube version with minor revisions, and
476020	481860	I'm sure they'll do little things to it to make it the more free-to-play type stuff where,
481860	488380	you know, the furniture costs coins that trickle in as you do the mundane errands, but you
488380	491300	can get a lot of coins if you get out your wallet, like that whole type of thing.
491300	494900	I'm sure it's going to tie into Animal Crossing, but it makes a lot of sense.
494900	501860	And Nintendo amping up their mobile game in 2016 I still think is worth some credit and
501860	509260	not worth running a headline about how hosed Nintendo is because, I mean, Zynga, freaking,
509260	513020	all their success was because of mostly one mobile game.
513020	518460	So if even one of those games is a success, I mean, Tomo continues to be a success, I
518460	521900	don't see where Nintendo is like, hosed.
521900	523580	Are they going to have a bad year?
523580	524580	Probably.
524580	528900	But they're also sitting, don't they sit on like $5 billion in the bank or something like
528900	529900	that?
529900	531760	They're sitting on an ungodly amount of money in the bank.
531760	536860	So I don't think Nintendo's screwed, but the NX can't miss.
536860	542180	Like if the NX is a miss, then maybe we're going to be talking about those types of articles,
542180	544620	but I, you know, I don't know.
544620	545620	We're a ways off.
545620	546620	Anyway.
546620	549700	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
549700	554220	Again, we do tape live Sunday nights and you guys join us live in our chat room over
554220	560220	at live.vognetwork.com and you lend us your opinions and sometimes things that you're
560220	563700	digging up as well on some of the things that we're talking about right now.
563700	568120	MXC actually posted in our chat room a portion of the official press release comment on the
568120	570080	E3 thing.
570080	574340	This June, Nintendo will focus its attention on the upcoming game in the Zelda franchise.
574340	578180	The Wii U version of the game will be playable for the first time on the E3 show floor and
578180	584300	it will be the only playable game Nintendo presents at the show in order to provide attendees
584300	585860	a complete immersion.
585860	588920	Okay, well that's, that's a PR.
588920	594520	In order to provide attendees a complete immersion, Loki, you are going, it's going to be the
594520	596860	Zelda experience.
596860	603580	There's going to be like cosplayers and little statues and things at the booth and light
603580	610020	mood lighting, Loki, maybe rupees that you can actually take home as swag loot.
610020	611860	That's what it's sounding like to me.
611860	615140	So I, that is interesting.
615140	617980	So that is going to be the only playable thing they show at the show.
617980	618980	That is...
618980	620980	But Zelda's not a title that you really need to hype up.
620980	624820	I mean, it kind of hypes itself.
624820	625820	Yeah.
625820	630960	Going to our chat for some more comments here, SSG100Matt says Nintendo doesn't need to show
630960	632600	their full handed E3.
632600	636280	Didn't help them to get in a pissing match there with other console makers.
636280	639860	Tiger Claw says Nintendo is big enough to do their own events.
639860	642000	They don't really need E3 anymore.
642000	645120	Actually no, I think that's a whole load of shit right there to be honest, because you're
645120	650200	trying to sell a new system that no one knows jack shit about, and Zelda's going to be coming
650200	651200	to it.
651200	656760	And you're hoping that all this goodwill that they have is going to sell that fucking system.
656760	660960	If people don't see a system at holiday and they're like, well, you know, the PlayStation
660960	666120	4 looks pretty nice or the Xbox One looks pretty nice, drop the money there.
666120	668000	They're not going to have a money for the new system.
668000	672400	I mean, it's, you're only selling a one game right now.
672400	674320	I'm like half with you on that.
674320	679000	I mean, I think that is a huge question right now is, okay, well, if the NX will not be
679000	681860	playable at E3, then when?
681860	686440	Are they going to show it before the holiday season or are they going to show it after
686440	689120	the holiday season and how?
689120	690920	Because there will be no E3.
690920	697280	So, I mean, the obvious answer that jumps to my mind first is Tokyo Game Show.
697280	701880	However, Nintendo hasn't participated in Tokyo Game Show for quite some time.
701880	704240	I don't know why they would suddenly start now.
704240	708960	Nintendo has in the past, not every year, but they have in the past run a concurrent
708960	712240	event around Tokyo Game Show.
712240	718040	So it seems likely that they could do something like that in Japan.
718040	721980	But that, you know, again, doesn't show how it's going to get here in America.
721980	727760	I wonder if they're not going to do a Nintendo Direct and every Best Buy in the nation is
727760	730740	going to have some of the Nintendo stuff to play.
730740	737080	I sort of just think that's the only path that's left because I don't really see Nintendo
737080	741920	doing an expo of their own, say like the PlayStation experience.
741920	746160	And so what else do they have where they can get directly to the players?
746160	747720	Penny Arcade Expo?
748440	756280	I don't know if that, I mean, I kind of think the NX will end up at PAX, I guess, East next
756280	757280	year.
757280	761440	But, I mean, there's, I don't know.
761440	764440	There really isn't a precedent now for how Nintendo gets that system out there.
764440	768840	I sort of think they're going to have to do the mall tour, the Best Buys, you know, they're
768840	772080	going to have to take their case to the consumers in that regard.
772080	774800	But Nintendo has kind of done it before.
774800	775800	We'll see.
776800	781120	Interesting thought from Akdeft in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
781120	787000	Universal Studios presents Nintendo Experience, calling it interesting.
787000	791720	We do know there is that Nintendo Universal Partnership, which many of us are thinking
791720	794880	thrill rides and, you know, obviously that'll be a part of it.
794880	798640	But could Nintendo have the NX playable at theme parks?
798640	799640	That would be weird.
799640	800640	That's the only thing about it.
801480	805600	That would be really weird because then it's like you're paying money to go play those
805600	806600	games.
806600	807600	You know what I mean?
807600	808600	It's weird.
808600	809600	It's a little weird.
809600	810600	But then again...
810600	811600	They've done it before with other things.
811600	812600	Yeah.
812600	815200	I've seen or remember at California Great America here, they had the Wii.
815200	817680	They had like a Wii Experience type thing there for a while.
817680	822080	I mean, it was after the system was out, but they, you know, it was still something.
822080	824080	Oh, interesting.
824080	826320	Let's see.
826320	830880	We're trying to get a couple more comments here over at live.vognetwork.com.
830880	836680	Kaijuto in chat says, Nintendo knows that E3 isn't relevant anymore.
836680	840440	They have their own showcase shows.
840440	847040	A lot of people are reading into that angle of it where here's yet another company that's
847040	848760	really de-emphasizing E3.
848760	855160	I mean, they haven't pulled out of E3, but they pulled the thing that almost everybody
855160	860200	I know that was going to E3 this year had said, I'm excited to play the NX.
860200	862400	And Nintendo just pulled that from E3.
862400	866120	So yet another thing has just exited the show this year.
866120	867880	Well, it's just like, it's...
867880	873740	I understand that they don't have to reveal it at E3, but you gotta reveal it at some
873740	874740	point.
874740	875960	And it's...
875960	876960	What's the harm?
876960	880720	I mean, I guess unless you're unsure that, you know, people are going to be disappointed
880720	884440	about what they see, but that gives you more time to get feedback on it.
884440	889520	I'm just like thinking right now, there's nothing, nothing has me hyped for the NX.
889520	891840	I don't know anything about it.
891840	897400	Well, I kind of think that's a loaded perspective though, because of course you don't.
897400	899000	Nintendo has kept everything under their hat.
899000	903920	Well, let's, let's reevaluate after E3 this year, because maybe just because the NX will
903920	906360	be there doesn't mean they won't say anything about it.
906360	910440	They may still say some things about it, even though they may not necessarily have one there,
910440	913580	and maybe they will unveil another title to get us hyped for it.
913580	917660	Like I know if they came out and said, all right, we know you're all waiting to see what's
917660	923780	going to be on the NX, here's Pikmin 4, how about F-Zero?
923780	927940	Because if that's the one that they dropped, I'd be like, done.
927940	930060	And I came like, there it is.
930060	931060	Like that's all it's going to take.
931060	936100	If they drop F-Zero and I'm spent like, you know, if they, if they announced like that
936100	940100	big game or maybe a new Metroid or something like even just one little thing to tide us
940100	945780	over, and then please look forward to October, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah in Japan and
945780	949540	November, blah, blah, blah in the States, when we're going to have more information
949540	950860	and a playable thing.
950860	953780	Like maybe that'll be all they give us at E3, I don't know.
953780	956140	But I'm fine with that.
956140	960340	Just like would like some information.
960340	963460	I also think, and one other thing, I don't want to drag this out too much, but again,
963460	968980	this is, this is the thing that a lot, a lot of people are talking about this week.
968980	973980	I have a feeling their strategy, because you, you kind of mentioned the whole, well, how
973980	977340	are they going to sell them in March if they're not around at the holiday and dah, dah, dah,
977340	978340	and all this stuff.
978340	984380	I wonder if Nintendo isn't kind of planning on that they're going to release this in March
984380	988900	or April, whenever the fiscal year ends, like right, like, like days before.
988900	994060	And they're going to get their hardcore audience to pick it up the first day.
994060	998220	And that's the audience that they're going to use to sell the system through Christmas,
998260	999260	essentially.
999260	1005820	I think Nintendo is not actually targeting necessarily a huge spring, but a huge holiday
1005820	1012700	2017, because yes, they'll have some big launch titles, but I bet there's going to be, I mean,
1012700	1014900	we know Zelda is going to be like the big one, right?
1014900	1020140	But I bet there's going to be something really big that's holiday 2017, and that's going
1020140	1027540	to be your Mario or, you know, your hypothetical F-Zero or Metroid or some big fucking title
1027580	1030500	that, you know, a lot of people are going to want to play is actually going to be a
1030500	1032620	holiday 2017 game.
1032620	1035500	And that's when they really expect to move units.
1035500	1039500	And then that way the early adopters are also kind of their early sellers, if that makes
1039500	1040500	sense.
1040500	1046380	They're their early salesman, I guess, because I know that, you know, I really wanted a Super
1046380	1051460	Nintendo after I went to my friend's house and played one, you know what I mean?
1051700	1059300	Anyhow, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SH2100Matt says, they're trying to go grassroots.
1059300	1061300	If they play it right, it could work.
1061300	1065620	And Tiger Claw says, I have this feeling the NX is just an upgraded Wii U with a better
1065620	1068460	CPU, GPU, and more memory.
1068460	1073460	Well, it wouldn't exactly be out of character for Nintendo, but at the same time, if the
1073460	1077100	rumors are to be believed, which there's an awful lot of them, if the rumors are to be
1077100	1083220	believed, it's going to be more powerful than the current PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
1083220	1086500	which is about where the Wii U was when it came out.
1086500	1092140	I think it was just a slight more powerful than 360, but it wasn't, you know, like a
1092140	1094620	huge thing.
1094620	1098740	Will the Wii U, or excuse me, the NX, will the NX be capable of doing 4K and all that
1098740	1099740	stuff?
1099740	1100740	Probably not.
1100740	1102740	It's probably not going to be doing that type of stuff.
1102740	1107460	But anyhow, lots of Nintendo stuff.
1107460	1113100	Let's see, SH2100Matt says, they'll have private events with the press and demo kiosks before
1113100	1115340	the end of the year, I'm sure.
1115340	1119860	And Rama says, the NX is going to have PC specs similar to the PlayStation 4, so we're
1119860	1120860	good.
1120860	1124220	Well, clearly they're going to want to do something that makes it really easy this time
1124220	1130980	for the other companies to port their games over, because that was a big part of Wii U,
1130980	1134580	is that if you wanted to do a Wii U game, you kind of had to put a lot of extra money
1134580	1137900	into the port to have the second screen and all that stuff.
1137900	1141580	So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
1141580	1144780	Anyway, that's the big news everybody's talking about.
1144780	1148180	Let's get into a little bit of our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games
1148180	1151300	that we've been playing this week, and then we'll get into housekeeping and the rest of
1151300	1153300	our news and all that stuff.
1153300	1155500	Sorry, I almost knocked over a dish.
1155500	1156500	Live radio.
1156500	1157900	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1157940	1164780	My gaming week was terrible, to be honest, because I was so sick this week.
1164780	1173060	I was just exhausted, literally falling asleep at 9 o'clock at night, so it was just not
1173060	1174060	very conducive.
1174060	1179060	And I tried to play games, I was like, oh hey, cool, I'll play some Enter the Gungeon
1179060	1180740	or something like that.
1180740	1181740	Nope.
1181740	1183160	Not going to happen.
1183160	1189720	So I played nothing this week, aside from Ingress, which I actually did on Friday.
1189720	1198840	Take some time to go walk around the state capital and get some unique portals there.
1198840	1201640	Just mainly because I was sick and I knew I couldn't concentrate.
1201640	1205680	I wanted to concentrate in programming, but I was like, I needed some fresh air, and so
1205680	1211280	I went for a few hour walk, and it felt great.
1211280	1213680	But there was a lot of people there.
1213680	1216440	My god, there's so many tours that go on there.
1216440	1217440	It's ridiculous.
1217440	1218840	I was like, holy cow!
1218840	1223120	There's some sort of podium thing that they're setting up.
1223120	1226800	I don't know if that's for the Trump rally thing or if that's something else, but they're
1226800	1232720	setting up some sort of speaking podium thing, and then there's just school groups swarming
1232720	1233720	the building.
1233720	1234720	It was ridiculous.
1234720	1235720	But, yeah.
1235720	1237720	So I did that.
1237720	1238720	Alright, wow.
1239160	1243280	Well, my gaming week, I haven't played a lot of new stuff, honestly.
1243280	1247000	I feel like I've been playing a lot of games, but it's a lot of the same stuff.
1247000	1250640	I don't have a lot of exciting new things to talk to you guys about.
1250640	1254700	Final Fantasy XIV, I've still been doing the grind and that, and my Dark Knight finally
1254700	1260120	hit 60, so every class in Heavensward, I have at 60, so that's my little accomplishment
1260120	1261120	there.
1261120	1265800	And you can do these grinds towards the end of the game to get the highest level equipment
1265800	1266800	and so forth.
1266880	1272800	It's called the Relic Weapon, basically, so I've been working on those quests on my Astrologian
1272800	1276560	to try to get the best possible weapon, so I've been working on that.
1276560	1281640	And then Diablo III had Season 6 start this weekend, and if you guys listen to the show
1281640	1285160	for any length of time, you guys know I get into Diablo, especially when the seasons come
1285160	1286160	around.
1286160	1291320	And the big thing this season is that, finally, Blizzard added a lot more cosmetics to Diablo.
1291320	1295760	They had introduced these pets, and then there's maybe three or four that you can actually
1295760	1296760	acquire.
1296760	1299560	Now, apparently, there's a whole ton of them, so that's a big part of what they're doing
1299560	1300560	with this season.
1300560	1303840	So, you know, it's, I mean, obviously, it's not just pets, but they're doing these other
1303840	1305800	changes that, you know, are interesting.
1305800	1310240	So I've been playing a little bit of that, because that season just started on Friday,
1310240	1314500	and I really didn't start playing until yesterday, and I'm already level, like, 45, and that's
1314500	1316080	without somebody power-leveling me.
1316080	1320560	I find that joining public games, you get around people your same level, but you get
1320560	1324800	a huge experience boost, and yeah, that's been helping me a lot.
1324840	1331480	So, been playing the Diablo season, otherwise, on the Xbox One, I randomly had that on the
1331480	1334480	other day, and I played Frogger.
1334480	1338920	That's right, the Konami classic Frogger, because it showed up in my whole backwards
1338920	1340320	compatibility thing.
1340320	1343840	It's like every week, you turn on your Xbox One, it's like, let's see what little gem
1343840	1348520	from ten years ago just popped into your collection from the backwards compatibility thing, and
1348520	1350360	Frogger showed up this week.
1350360	1351760	But you'll be proud of me, Loki.
1351760	1357640	I also downloaded Saints Row IV, because that was the games with gold thing this week.
1357640	1362060	Which I have not played IV, I've played Saints Row III, and I laughed my ass off, but I never
1362060	1363060	played IV.
1363060	1368840	Well, you'll like IV, because IV is basically III, since they recycled the map again.
1368840	1371200	But it is fun.
1371200	1373000	You'll like it.
1373000	1377880	Alan said the first few minutes of the game are laugh-a-palooza, like the last game.
1377880	1378880	It's ridiculous.
1379480	1383680	It's just, yeah, it's a very unusual game.
1383680	1384680	Can't wait.
1384680	1386240	Sounds like fun.
1386240	1390360	Otherwise, continuing on the 3DS, I've been playing Zelda P-Cross as my nice little game
1390360	1391880	before I go to bed.
1391880	1396480	And Miitomo, I don't know if I mentioned this in last week's show, so I'll mention it now.
1396480	1399040	I hit the cap in Miitomo.
1399040	1402520	The social cap and the style cap is level 20.
1402520	1404240	You can progress no further.
1404240	1411280	So you get a giant red sparkly hat for hitting level 20, and I hit both on style and social.
1411280	1414200	So that was my big accomplishment, Miitomo.
1414200	1416860	Yet, I'm still playing.
1416860	1417860	I don't know why.
1417860	1422040	I still load it every day, and I check answers, and I'll answer a question.
1422040	1426120	The leaked footage from Pokemon Go, the beta?
1426120	1428040	I did see a little bit of that, yeah.
1428040	1429920	It looks, I mean, here's the thing.
1430240	1434720	I think it looks interesting, but I've also been playing Ingress this whole time, so I
1434720	1437240	don't look at it from the Pokemon frame of reference.
1437240	1441360	I look at it from the Ingress frame of reference, and so, for me, there's a lot of cool stuff
1441360	1442360	in there, I think.
1442360	1446600	But I understand the Pokemon fans are like, where's the traditional battling?
1446600	1448800	Because it kind of doesn't seem to be there.
1448800	1451200	I'm not really sure how it plays, though.
1451200	1455240	It's like, you go to spots, I'm not sure if you deploy your Pokemon there, and then they
1455240	1456940	fight other people, or...
1456940	1460940	It seems like what you do is you go out and you catch Pokemon, but you don't necessarily
1460940	1464380	catch them by fighting them, you flick your balls at them.
1464380	1466580	That's literally what you're doing in the game, right?
1466580	1470740	You kind of flick the little balls at them, and that's where you can actually use a camera
1470740	1475940	on your phone, so it makes it actually look like AR a little bit, and so you can capture
1475940	1477540	the Pokemon that way.
1477540	1481600	But then what happens is that at some point in the game, you have to choose if you're
1481600	1486580	going to join the red gym, the blue gym, or the yellow gym, just like the old games from
1486620	1490140	the Game Boy, red, blue, and yellow, which I guess they're going with the American colors,
1490140	1492960	not the Japanese colors.
1492960	1498420	And then once you choose a color for your gym, a lot of the places that we know as Ingress
1498420	1503340	nodes today, as Ingress players, some of the beta players are saying about 40% of those
1503340	1506260	nodes are Pokemon gyms.
1506260	1511020	So what happens is that once you choose a color for your team, when you go to the gym,
1511020	1516540	if it's a gym of the opposing color, you can battle the Pokemon that's there to take the
1516540	1524940	gym for your color, and if it's your color, you leave a Pokemon behind to defend it.
1524940	1529060	So imagine Ingress, but the resonators are Pokemon.
1529060	1534060	That's kind of the sense I'm getting out of the game, and there's three factions, and
1534060	1539260	none of this, at least as far as I know, none of this fielding, linking stuff that's big,
1539260	1540500	that's not really part of it.
1540500	1541920	That's all left in Ingress.
1541920	1543620	So it's interesting.
1543620	1544620	All right.
1544620	1545620	Yeah.
1545620	1550380	Again, this is all early beta, a lot can still change, we'll see.
1550380	1556180	I wonder if that's not, maybe that'll be a thing Nintendo comes out at E3 and says,
1556180	1559860	and Pokemon Go is out today, and you can download it on phones.
1559860	1565140	I'm very much expecting Nintendo to have a mobile-focused year in a way.
1565140	1569220	I think that E3, Nintendo Direct, will absolutely have mobile in it.
1569220	1576020	I understand that Pokemon Go is not directly a Nintendo game, but it's close enough.
1576020	1579380	And then they'll probably show footage from the Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem and give
1579380	1581220	us a sense when to expect those.
1581220	1585940	I would imagine Fire Emblem's first, but that's totally just guessing.
1585940	1592940	So anyway, that is an SSG100Matt says, so Rob will be choosing Team Green.
1592940	1598340	No, there is no green in Pokemon Go, so I'm still unsure.
1598460	1602140	I have a feeling I'm going to get talked into doing blue, because that's what Shane will
1602140	1607860	want to do, which is going to be very weird for me, because that's not what I do in Ingress,
1607860	1608860	but we'll see.
1608860	1611780	A lot can still change between now and Pokemon Go whenever that comes out.
1611780	1614420	I have to kind of see, are there benefits for each team?
1614420	1616140	Do some Pokemon get stronger?
1616140	1617700	There's a lot that can still change my mind.
1617700	1618700	I forgot.
1618700	1619700	I was going to mention something.
1619700	1620700	Yeah.
1620700	1621700	Let me just bring this up here real fast.
1621700	1622700	Okay.
1622700	1623700	I want to show you something.
1623700	1624700	Sure.
1624700	1625700	He's getting out his phone to show me something.
1625700	1626700	Okay.
1626700	1627700	Let's see here.
1628060	1636940	Actually, I remember I was talking to you about how Ingress screen burned my phone.
1636940	1638060	Yeah.
1638060	1639060	You did say something about that.
1639060	1640060	Yeah.
1640060	1642140	I'm going to try to see if I can get it so that you can actually see it here real quick.
1642140	1643760	Well, this makes for riveting radio.
1643760	1649860	It is make for riveting radio, but I just wanted to see if I can, here, let me try pulling
1649860	1650860	this up here real fast.
1650860	1651860	Okay.
1651860	1654180	So he's dilling around on his phone, trying to, I guess, navigate to-
1654180	1657420	I'm trying to get something so that you can actually see what I'm talking about here.
1657420	1660940	Even like a new browser window, so it's like solid white.
1660940	1662940	That would be what I would do.
1662940	1667000	While he's working on that, let me try to get some more comments in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
1667000	1669700	Tiger Claw says, I got Star Fox Zero yesterday.
1669700	1674620	I had enough points from the GameStop Power Up rewards to get $25 off.
1674620	1679540	Orange Right talking about Miitomo says, that's 15 my Nintendo points a day.
1679540	1680540	You know what, Orange Right?
1680540	1684880	That is actually a big reason, I think, why I still do Miitomo, because if Nintendo's
1684880	1689680	going to give us free games for 1,000 points, then yeah, I'm going to try to keep earning
1689680	1690680	those.
1690680	1694880	I mean, even though the games aren't that big a deal, I have been playing quite a bit
1694880	1697640	of Zelda P-Cross, which was the game that you can get for 1,000 points.
1697640	1699240	Is it like in the bottom corner here?
1699240	1700720	You can see the com thing.
1700720	1701720	Oh, wow.
1701720	1704160	Yeah, you do have like a screen burn on your phone.
1704160	1705160	That's crazy.
1705160	1706160	Yeah.
1706160	1709960	And then normally in the upper right hand corner, too, it's harder to see right here
1709960	1711960	right now.
1712080	1715280	In the upper, you can see the ops button and everything.
1715280	1718680	You should take that to wherever you bought the phone, because that strikes me as what
1718680	1721240	a cheap piece of shit.
1721240	1725040	It's a Samsung Galaxy S6, though.
1725040	1726280	Something went wrong in the factory.
1726280	1727280	I don't know.
1727280	1728680	Do any of you guys know?
1728680	1730920	Do cell phones really screen burn like that?
1730920	1733360	I guess they don't want you to play Ingress anymore.
1733360	1734360	I don't know.
1734360	1735360	All right.
1735360	1738720	Anyhow, I don't have a lot of housekeeping for you guys tonight.
1738720	1741440	We are still going to be here every Sunday, as far as I know.
1741440	1744760	We will be at Dragon Con, or at least I will be at Dragon Con over Labor Day, but that's
1744760	1746600	still a ways out.
1746600	1751000	So in the meantime, you can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook,
1751000	1754280	facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1754280	1757880	Act deft in chat about the screen burn saying, I'm pretty sure they shouldn't.
1757880	1760320	Yeah, I don't, I'm pretty sure they shouldn't either.
1760320	1761640	So interesting.
1761640	1764800	Anyway, let's get into gaming news for the week.
1764800	1766240	Loki, why don't you start us off?
1766240	1767360	So this is pretty cool.
1767360	1772120	One of the things that kind of leaked out, they have a few different ways this has been
1772120	1773120	leaking out.
1773120	1779880	So in Black Ops 3 right now, in the Nuketown map that they have, they've been kind of doing
1779880	1786080	these little hidden trailers or teaser video things like that that are kind of teasing
1786080	1788560	into the next Call of Duty.
1788560	1792800	Also there were some retail pieces that were kind of leaked out as well about another Call
1792800	1797720	of Duty game called Call of Duty Infinity Warfare.
1797720	1799760	So kind of like a futuristic warfare thing.
1799760	1806400	But one of the big things about that though, on the actual artwork, it lists not only they
1806400	1812440	have Infinite Warfare, which will be coming out November 4th, 2016, but that there's also
1812440	1817700	going to be, if you buy like a certain legacy edition, it's going to come with Call of Duty
1817700	1823620	Modern Warfare, the original, number four, remastered.
1823620	1828540	So it's basically going to be the, I consider probably one of the best games in the Modern
1828540	1834000	Warfare series, remastered on the PlayStation 4.
1834000	1836660	Which is fucking amazing and I can't wait for that.
1836660	1838940	So that's the rumor right now.
1838940	1844180	Apparently they're seeing that it's going to be the campaign plus ten of the multiplayer
1844180	1848540	maps, which is kind of unusual because there were more than ten multiplayer maps in that
1848540	1849540	game.
1849540	1853780	So I'm not sure if they're just not redoing all of them, which it would be kind of disappointing.
1853780	1857780	But maybe that opens up for DLC or something.
1857780	1861100	So we'll just have to see if that's actually going to be a legit thing or not.
1861100	1862300	But I hope it is.
1862300	1865980	Is this, didn't I, I mean I might be talking crazy and that's fine.
1865980	1870200	Didn't I hear that they might not put out new games in these series every year?
1870200	1873020	So maybe this is like a holdover?
1873020	1874860	Well no, it's going to be a new game this year.
1874860	1877940	Oh, so it's just remastered but it's...
1877940	1881900	They're going to put out the new Call of Duty game, which is Call of Duty Infinite Warfare
1881900	1886180	and Call of Duty Modern Warfare remastered.
1886180	1887460	That's a lot of Call of Duty.
1887460	1892100	S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, I would soon get the remastered version of Modern Warfare
1892100	1893900	over Infinite Warfare.
1893900	1897900	Uh, yeah, I would say the same thing.
1897900	1898900	I'll play both.
1898900	1902540	But I love Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the original one.
1902540	1905580	It's had some of the best maps in the series.
1905580	1909100	Yeah, it's kind of like, I don't know, it's kind of like when they remastered Final Fantasy
1909100	1910100	X.
1910100	1912620	It's like, yeah, I'm going to go back and play this because this is a great game, even
1912620	1915260	though there might be newer Final Fantasies to experience, you know.
1915260	1917180	But why not?
1917180	1919680	If it was a great Call of Duty game, then yeah, they should remaster it and go back
1919680	1922680	to it.
1922680	1927620	Also by the way, on the screen burning issue in chat, S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, my Galaxy
1927620	1930500	S3 had a little keyboard screen burn.
1930500	1934500	Justin and I replaced it recently, but that was with three to four years of use.
1934500	1936820	This is not three to four years of use.
1936820	1938020	It's like three to four months, right?
1938020	1940700	You haven't had that very long.
1940700	1941700	Six months?
1941700	1942700	In September.
1942700	1943700	Still.
1943700	1947860	All right, anyhow, more rumors about the Xbox One.
1947860	1952540	You know, huge talk about the PlayStation 4 Neo, which I guess their code name, we were
1952540	1954960	talking about in last week's show.
1954960	1960340	And we've heard rumors that Microsoft is looking at doing something similar, and those rumors
1960340	1962180	are gaining a lot of steam this week.
1962180	1966660	There are yet more inside reports and rumors.
1966660	1971620	There was a, I guess, leaked production notes that showed the Xbox One slim model, and those
1971620	1974260	production notes came from a Chinese manufacturer.
1974260	1979460	Well now another Microsoft insider has said that yes, new Xbox hardware is coming.
1979460	1982660	That there's new Xbox hardware that's going to be announced at E3, and there will be a
1982660	1984200	new controller.
1984200	1988560	The controller is going to be similar to the current pad, but with probably a default white
1988560	1989560	color.
1989600	1993480	The controller will be updated, but they don't really say how.
1993480	1997640	I'm assuming just to make it the D-pad.
1997640	2001360	I don't know, I like the Xbox One controller a lot more than the 360, but maybe they're
2001360	2004880	going to try to throw some of those enhancements that are in the Elite in it?
2004880	2005880	I don't know.
2005880	2007600	We'll see.
2007600	2014420	So yeah, and apparently the new Xbox is a much bigger deal than an updated standard
2014420	2015420	controller.
2015420	2018020	But what the fuck does that mean?
2018020	2022220	So are they putting new power in it or not?
2022220	2027460	If the Xbox thing is just a slim device, then okay, whatever, we see this happen all the
2027460	2028460	time.
2028460	2029460	This has been happening since the PlayStation One.
2029460	2031460	It's coming with Microsoft Office as well.
2031460	2034060	It's a big deal.
2034060	2040620	Well, okay, nobody's talking about the whole like, you know, well, I guess they're talking
2040620	2044700	about the upgrade thing, but maybe that is what it does.
2044700	2050940	Maybe this box is not just an Xbox One, but this is more of a bridge with your PC, somehow.
2050940	2054820	That it's going to stream more for your PC or let everything on your Xbox.
2054820	2057820	Why can't it be a PC?
2057820	2060900	Like seriously, like run- Just buy a PC and hook it up to your TV.
2060900	2068420	You know, like the Windows tablets that they have, the Surface Pro, or the Surface, not
2068420	2073580	the Pros, but like the RT ones, you know, have just like a limited app set on there
2073580	2076060	and, you know, run Office stuff.
2076060	2079940	That way you're buying the system and if you need to, you know, crunch an Excel file, you
2079940	2081420	could do that as well.
2081420	2085300	As long as they don't fragment the games, which, you know, we were talking about the
2085300	2090140	PlayStation 4 stuff last week, okay, you know, as long as the games don't get fragmented.
2090140	2092940	If it's doing 4K output for movies, then whatever.
2092940	2097740	But I just hope that Microsoft is going down a similar path where the games do not end
2097740	2100460	up all fragmented, if that makes sense.
2100460	2103820	Like I don't want to see that happen, because I'll be pissed that I have all that money
2103820	2108460	that I spent on the Xbox One, if now this year's holiday games are not going to run
2108460	2109460	on it.
2109460	2110460	You know what I mean?
2110460	2111980	I really don't think that'll happen.
2111980	2116100	I kind of just feel like this device is going to be, yeah, it's going to be a slimmer device
2116100	2122620	and maybe a little more oomph for movies and a little more of the PC connectivity and doing
2122620	2123940	more of that.
2123940	2128980	Maybe it'll be a little more power in it for HoloLens or whatever, but as long as, you
2128980	2134820	know, Crackdown will still run on the Xbox One that I have and Scalebound and all the
2134820	2138020	stuff that I'm looking forward to, we'll be fine.
2138020	2139740	So we'll see.
2139740	2143980	Anyway, I guess that's what we've got coming out of Microsoft.
2143980	2144980	Look forward to E3.
2144980	2146220	It's going to be interesting.
2146220	2151140	Now you've got Sony and Microsoft announcing new consoles, but they're not really new consoles.
2151140	2152940	It's not a new console cycle.
2152940	2156140	And then Nintendo is like, here's our one game.
2156140	2161180	We'll see.
2161180	2165460	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2165460	2166860	use the passphrase, point.
2166860	2169540	Loki, what do you have for us next?
2169540	2170540	All right.
2170540	2171540	So this is kind of cool.
2171540	2175220	You know, they're going to have, they put out these all the time on Steam, like this
2175220	2179340	Genesis collections where there's a bunch of the ROMs and everything you could play.
2179340	2183780	And a lot of times I'm like, why would I buy this?
2183780	2188700	Because I could just run this through an emulator or something like that.
2188700	2190660	I still buy them, yes.
2190660	2196860	But I still, I asked myself that question though, why am I purchasing this?
2196860	2200260	Probably because it's a large number of games that are on my Steam library and it pads the
2200260	2201800	numbers quite well.
2201800	2203020	That's usually the reason.
2203020	2204020	But I actually...
2204020	2207300	I want to look sicker to all my friends.
2207300	2208740	I don't look crazy enough.
2208740	2210740	I need to go for broke.
2210740	2211740	Exactly.
2211740	2213860	So, this is kind of cool though.
2213860	2217140	This is actually something that they're doing that's very different.
2217140	2224100	They're actually offering or adding Steam Workshop support for Sega Genesis and Mega
2224100	2225740	Drive Classics.
2225740	2226740	That's right.
2226740	2230620	ROM hacks are going to be officially supported by this now.
2230620	2232580	That's pretty exciting.
2232580	2236940	So that would definitely be something I would have to pick up this collection just to check
2236940	2237940	it out.
2237940	2245100	But, very cool to see that they're actually kind of supporting that.
2245100	2246620	Are you going to try playing around with this at all?
2246620	2248140	Do you have any games to support it?
2248140	2254060	I thought I bought a Humble Bundle that had all the old Sega stuff, but I guess not.
2254060	2259140	I have Space Channel 5 Part 2, I bought something that had the Dreamcast stuff, but this isn't
2259140	2260140	about...
2260140	2261140	No, this is Genesis games.
2261140	2265060	I have the Genesis one I bought off of Amazon a long time ago when I used to buy digital
2265060	2266060	games off of there.
2266060	2269500	So, I have the key for that.
2269500	2272860	I'm not sure if that's the same collection or if they re-released it or something, but
2272860	2274980	I'll take a look and see.
2274980	2281380	Stop drop in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can't wait for Scrotum the Hedgehog.
2281380	2282380	Because that's what happens.
2282380	2286300	I remember when ROM hacking first started a long time ago.
2286300	2288740	I remember there were two things.
2288740	2290900	Somebody did Mario with dicks.
2290900	2291900	It was just dicks everywhere.
2291900	2293620	It was like the coins were dicks.
2293620	2294620	Everything was a dick.
2294620	2299460	It was Dick Mario, it was one of the first ROM hacks, one of the first I ever saw, Dick
2299460	2300460	Mario.
2300460	2305140	And then, okay, here's the greatest one, because this game wasn't even out in the US.
2305140	2311300	There was a Japanese only game, God, I'm embarrassing myself even about to talk about this.
2311300	2317180	There was a Japanese only game called Nuts and Milk.
2317180	2322700	And I'll just let you fill in the gaps to what ROM hackers did to that game in the first
2322700	2328580	month that people figured out how to get into the files and edit sprites and all that
2328580	2332700	stuff is that it just became nuts and nuts is basically what happened there.
2332700	2338940	So ROM hacking and making them dirty has been around since the turn of the century, basically.
2338940	2342940	We've been saying that in gaming for forever is that, what's the time to penis?
2342940	2345380	So that is a good question.
2345380	2350220	How long until, I mean, is Steam going to police for Scrotum the Hedgehog?
2350220	2354900	Or will that not, is that just, it's going to be a wild, wild west out there?
2354900	2355900	What's going to happen?
2355900	2358900	Do we know if, do we know if Steam is policing any of that stuff?
2358900	2362900	I'm sure that they have like a review system.
2362900	2363900	Right?
2363900	2364900	Yeah.
2364900	2369020	Dartetsuya in chat says, the ROM hacks are really interesting.
2369020	2371780	Some of them even swap in a totally different game.
2371780	2373980	Yeah, I'd seen some of that too.
2373980	2374980	Funny stuff.
2375740	2381460	And SSG100Matt says, like all the ROM hack cartridges that they were selling at Magfest.
2381460	2385020	Yeah, that's, that was a, I don't know if I talked about that phenomenon here on this
2385020	2386020	show.
2386020	2389380	I think Bobby got into it on his show, but they were actually selling like ROM hacks
2389380	2393460	dumped back to a cartridge that you could then take home and play on.
2393460	2395020	That sounds kind of illegal.
2395020	2399900	It's probably super illegal, but it's, it's this really weird gray area because I think
2399900	2404940	the patents, like that's why you can have these third party Nintendos and Super Nintendos.
2404980	2409340	Now is because I think the patents ran out, they ran out after like 20 or 30 years.
2409340	2412440	And so I kind of think the cartridges, the same thing happens.
2412440	2414580	So now it's just a question of the intellectual property.
2414580	2420060	I mean, if, if somebody really wanted to sue them, they would probably have a case, but
2420060	2423420	it's, it's a little vendor at a show.
2423420	2424900	How many of these are they really selling?
2424900	2429060	It's probably not worth it to pay the lawyer is probably the reality of that situation
2429060	2432340	is that, yeah, it's probably illegal, but it's not worth it to pay the lawyer.
2432900	2433900	I don't know.
2433900	2438620	MXC in chat, giving us some insight here saying some steam workshop stuff has been removed.
2438620	2443580	It appears if you download them once though, even after being officially removed, you can
2443580	2444700	still access them.
2444700	2446180	Oh, it's like iTunes.
2446180	2451500	It's like when I got the main emulator on my iPad, I was like, Oh, got to get that before
2451500	2452500	they take it down.
2452500	2455700	And sure enough, they got it down, but now it's on my account so I can redownload it
2455700	2456700	whenever.
2456700	2457700	So it's kind of nice.
2457700	2458700	All right.
2458700	2462220	Anyhow, so I've been playing a lot of final fantasy 14 lately.
2462220	2465740	So I, I don't mean to bring up a game that I play an awful lot on the show, but maybe
2465740	2471860	I do, but they had a big like conference this week and some announcements and there's a
2471860	2473940	very interesting crossover.
2473940	2479100	That's just too cool to ignore a square Enix and level five announced this week that they
2479100	2480220	will be teaming up.
2480220	2483660	Uh, and this was announced during the latest final fantasy 14 letter from the producer
2483660	2491980	live part 29, um, on final fantasy 14 is going to be getting Yo-kai watch in the game basically
2491980	2496860	not the actual game, but some of the characters, uh, so some of the, uh, Yo-kai will actually
2496860	2498780	become minions in the game.
2498780	2502100	So like Jibanyan is going to be a minion that you can get in the game.
2502100	2503100	That's pretty cool.
2503100	2506060	Whisper and you know, a lot of the, uh, Yo-kai watch.
2506060	2511380	And then there's going to be Yo-kai inspired weaponry, which is pretty cool.
2511380	2516420	So like, for example, um, you can get like a white mage staff that has a Yo-kai on the
2516420	2517420	end of it.
2517420	2524100	Uh, I like to play, um, a astrologian and the astrologian has the, um, snake Yo-kai,
2524100	2531020	I think it's Noko, uh, has that Yo-kai like embedded on the, um, uh, astroglobe.
2531020	2532420	So that's pretty cool.
2532420	2538540	Um, and then also your character can actually equip a Yo-kai watch as like a piece of equipment.
2538540	2540740	I don't know what it'll do, but you can do that.
2540740	2545560	And then they're actually going to be bringing a mount that is that ghost character.
2545560	2549240	Whisper and you see this on a lot of box art, you actually be able to ride that as
2549240	2550240	a mount.
2550240	2551240	So that's really cool.
2551240	2558600	But not only that, in Yo-kai watch three sushi and Yo-kai watch three tempura, they are going
2558600	2559600	to be adding.
2559600	2561880	So now this is going the other way in the Yo-kai games.
2561880	2567560	They're going to add choco bonyan, which is jibanyan riding a choco.
2567560	2573360	And then they're going to have moogle linyan, which is a moogle, but done in Yo-kai watch
2573360	2574360	style.
2574360	2575360	That's actually really rad.
2575760	2578440	So it's a really kind of a neat little crossover there.
2578440	2581740	Square Enix and level five doing that between the two.
2581740	2586360	So as a Final Fantasy 14 player and someone who enjoyed what I played of Yo-kai watch,
2586360	2591920	I will try to collect every one of those minions because I like to collect minions in the game
2591920	2592920	anyway.
2592920	2594880	So I'm looking forward to whatever event they do.
2594880	2599460	I'm sure they're going to do some event to promote the release of the game in Japan.
2599460	2602200	And hopefully we see it here in the States as well.
2602560	2605880	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and look at some
2605880	2610560	video games that are coming out soon, a lot sooner than Yo-kai three will be here in the
2610560	2611560	States.
2612560	2621160	All right, so we've got Battleborn coming out this week on PlayStation 4 PC and Xbox
2621160	2622160	one.
2624160	2627120	Man, so I'm not over that sickness yet.
2627120	2631800	I'm telling you, the forces do not want us to get too much further.
2632400	2637400	I still feel way better than I did with last week, whoa, that's for sure.
2637400	2646400	And then along with that, let's see, aside from Battleborn, no, a whole lot, actually
2646400	2648040	I want to say that's it.
2648040	2651640	Battleborn, that is your week.
2651640	2653840	Well that's supposed to be like a big title, right?
2653840	2658960	Yeah, it's a 2K kind of equivalent of, wasn't it supposed to be similar to Team Fortress
2658960	2659960	2 or something?
2660120	2665000	I tried playing the beta, I couldn't get into it, I really couldn't, I'm sorry, but I know
2665000	2668720	some other friends of mine have been playing it and loving it, so cool, hey, great, I couldn't
2668720	2669720	get into it.
2669720	2672600	Maybe I just need to give it another chance, I don't know.
2672600	2677320	So all right, but I know that was like a big thing that they showed at the PlayStation
2677320	2681000	experience anyway and a lot of people were looking forward to that, so maybe that's...
2681000	2686760	Well the trailer looked cool last year and I remember it's basically kind of like from
2686760	2693120	the team that did Borderlands, so it, I don't know, it seemed interesting, but it's not
2693120	2694440	my style of game.
2694440	2695440	Gotcha.
2695440	2700820	Well, looking at the release calendar in Japan, it's a very slow week in Japan.
2700820	2703760	There is actually nothing on the PlayStation 4 this week.
2703760	2707720	Uncharted 4 is the next big release in Japan, because that's going to be a big release here
2707720	2708720	too as well.
2708720	2712240	Japan will not be seeing that until May 10th, however, that is actually not happening this
2712240	2713240	week.
2713240	2716700	And the Vita doesn't really have anything this week either.
2716700	2721280	And lastly on the 3DS, yeah, it's a very, very slow week in Japan, so really no game
2721280	2723120	releases to look forward to there.
2723120	2727160	However, if you go to Europe, the story is a little bit different, as Battleborn makes
2727160	2732580	its way to Europe this week on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
2732580	2735600	So that is what you have to look forward to in Europe this week.
2735600	2739680	In our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says, wasn't Golden Week this week
2739680	2740680	or was that last week?
2740840	2745480	I thought it was last week, but that probably is coming into play as to why we don't have
2745480	2747200	a ton of releases in Japan this week.
2747200	2754240	So there you go, not a whole lot to look forward to this week in Japan, and just one big game
2754240	2755240	in the UK.
2755240	2759360	Well, this is the part of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and visit
2759360	2761560	the classic game of the week.
2761560	2769200	And every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
2769200	2772840	hey, you ungrateful little brat should be playing this game.
2772840	2776360	But this week she's not here, so we're taking over this segment for her.
2776360	2779440	Since last week, I got to do one of my picks.
2779440	2784560	This week we're going to let Loki do one of his picks, and I actually still do not know
2784560	2785560	what he's picking.
2785560	2789720	I don't even have a YouTube up for anything for audio, so Loki, what is the classic game
2789720	2790720	of the week?
2790720	2792000	See, I was undecided first.
2792000	2797340	I didn't know if I should, you know, Jamie has a very specific rule that she's never
2797340	2798340	going to pick Halo.
2798380	2799380	Right.
2799380	2801380	And so I thought, well, maybe I should pick Halo.
2801380	2802860	Just piss her off.
2802860	2803860	Just to spite her.
2803860	2810060	Well, I would disavow that completely, because I do not want, I want my Disneyland souvenir.
2810060	2811300	Yours will get tossed in the fire.
2811300	2816500	So, and unfortunately, you know, in order to best appreciate that, Bobby would really
2816500	2818220	need to be in the chat to do that.
2818220	2819220	That is true.
2819220	2821740	Bobby did run out, I think he went on a trip or something, I don't know.
2821740	2822740	I don't know.
2822740	2827300	So he is not in chat, so perhaps we shall table that to another week.
2827300	2828300	Fair enough.
2829260	2830260	I'm going to have...
2830260	2832500	So you're blaming Bobby now for the Halo thing not happening.
2832500	2836260	I'm blaming Bobby for the Halo thing not happening.
2836260	2839260	The classic game of the week would have been Halo, but Bobby's not here.
2839260	2841260	It would have been Halo.
2841260	2843620	Instead, we're going to get a far better game.
2843620	2844620	Okay.
2844620	2845620	What is it?
2845620	2846620	Which is going to be Driver 3.
2846620	2852180	Driver 3 is the classic game of the week.
2852180	2853180	Of course.
2853620	2859100	Because Driver 3 is just, it's where basically Atari said, hey, you know what?
2859100	2861820	We could totally do that Grand Theft Auto thing.
2861820	2864540	I mean, the first two Driver games were pretty awesome.
2864540	2869620	I mean, it was basically all about, you know, car chases and about the driving.
2869620	2876700	And then, Drive 3-er was all about, let's just try to steal, you know, copy Grand Theft
2876700	2880900	Auto, and it just, it failed terribly.
2880900	2887140	It had some really buggy AI, like the cops when they were chasing after you, you could
2887140	2891500	hide behind a car and they would shoot at, they would try to shoot directly at you, and
2891500	2894980	if, you know, the cop car that they happened to be hiding behind was right in front of
2894980	2897980	them, they would blow up their own cop car and kill themselves because they were trying
2897980	2898980	to shoot at you.
2898980	2900580	It was awesome.
2900580	2911860	So, Driver 3, you know, it basically came out in 2004 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as
2911860	2918700	well as mobile platforms, even had a game version for Game Boy Advance.
2918700	2926780	And basically, you know, the game revolved around, I guess, FBI agents Tanner, John Tanner
2926780	2928620	and Tobias Jones.
2928620	2931460	Wait, there was a story?
2931460	2932460	Yes!
2932460	2933460	No, seriously!
2933460	2934460	Alright.
2934460	2935460	There was!
2935460	2942060	And they had actual, you know, they had Michael Madsen playing John Tanner and Ving Rhames
2942060	2947900	playing Tobias Jones, and then they were trying to intercept the criminal Charles Jericho
2947900	2949540	played by Mickey Rourke.
2949540	2951700	That's some, like, serious talent right there.
2951700	2955580	Too bad the game just did not reflect that talent.
2956540	2963100	But basically, you know, it revolved around you, you know, chasing after them over several
2963100	2970660	different locations, including Miami, Florida, Nice, France, and Istanbul, Turkey.
2970660	2974740	And really the way I played the game was I would just go into it, they had like a free
2974740	2978300	mode that you could drive around, and I would just get in cars and drive them until they
2978300	2983220	were literally, because it had like a pretty, I wouldn't call it a realistic damage system,
2983220	2986260	but there was a damage system where like stuff would fall off your car, like you could
2986260	2990940	lose the front two wheels of your car, and drive around just on the axles and everything.
2990940	2995860	And I would do that, and it was fun.
2995860	3000420	I remember one night your character was just like swimming underwater endlessly, and it
3000420	3007280	was so, like, you swam like through polygons that were underwater somehow, I don't even,
3007280	3008280	it was a mess.
3008280	3009540	It was a frickin' mess.
3009540	3010540	It was a mess.
3010540	3017460	You know, they had like some realistic physics in the game, I don't know if I'd call it realistic,
3017460	3019180	but yeah.
3019180	3023300	The reviews weren't that great, and this was one of the games that actually did kind of
3023300	3031460	cause a controversy, because before the release of Driver 3, Atari had offered magazines PSM2
3031460	3037080	and Xbox World early review copies of the game in exchange for positive review scores.
3037080	3040520	Some folks in chat are talking about this right now, Stop Drop is mentioning this right
3040520	3041520	now.
3041520	3045320	They gave the game to two magazines early for promises of nine to ten reviews, nine
3045320	3049360	out of ten reviews, excuse me, then everyone was expecting a great game, and real reviews
3049360	3054240	came in, so they tried to suppress those reviews and ban people from forums.
3054240	3055240	So much for that.
3055240	3058720	Yeah, as you can see right now, oh, and this was another game that was kind of fun, because
3058720	3067000	in, I don't know if it was Driver 3 that, my sister used to play Driver 3 quite a bit,
3067000	3073200	and it would allow you to create replays of your actual, so you're driving around and
3073200	3076120	causing mayhem and stuff, and you could do replays, but one of the best parts about the
3076120	3080240	game and the replay system is it wouldn't always sync up to what you were doing.
3080240	3085120	So you're recording all this stuff, you're stealing cars and things, and then you go
3085120	3090000	back and watch the replay, and your guy's just running around aimlessly and running
3090000	3096720	into the ocean, and all sorts of weird stuff happens, it was just a very glitchy, bad game.
3096720	3099880	But it's fun, it's so bad, it's good at that point.
3099880	3105240	And they were even so cocky that they had, like it was an Easter egg where they had the
3105240	3111000	character from Vice City wearing like floaties and stuff, and you'd have to go, you know,
3111000	3114880	kill him, and that was like an Easter egg in the game, it was like kind of going, haha,
3114880	3120640	look it, we're so much better than Grand Theft Auto, but their game was just not good.
3120640	3122640	It was not good.
3122640	3123640	But it was fun.
3123640	3126100	So no chance we'll ever have a Driver 4?
3126100	3127100	We did, actually.
3127100	3128100	Oh, we did?
3128100	3129740	Yeah, we had Driver San Francisco, so.
3129740	3131900	Oh, that's right, I thought that was before.
3131900	3136500	So yes, we did actually have a Driver 4, and it was a better game, because it was just
3136500	3139580	about driving and not about getting out and running around.
3139580	3141140	They cut out all the Grand Theft Auto parts.
3141140	3142140	Yes, they did.
3142140	3143140	All right.
3143140	3144140	That's it.
3144140	3146980	That's it, your classic game of the week.
3146980	3147980	Driver 3.
3147980	3148980	Not Halo, unfortunately.
3148980	3149980	Not Halo, unfortunately.
3149980	3153900	But Driver 3, I know it's on the PC and it was on Playstation 2?
3153900	3154900	And Xbox.
3154900	3155900	Original Xbox.
3155900	3156900	Awesome.
3156900	3162620	Just, if you like glitchy games, and trying to break games, which you guys have to understand,
3162620	3166580	Loki really, like, that's like one of Loki's favorite things in games, is breaking them
3166580	3167580	and watching them do ridiculous stuff.
3167580	3170980	Well, it was like one of those games, like, after I heard the review scores and how bad
3170980	3174820	this game was, I'm like, I gotta try this thing, because I liked, the original Driver
3174820	3178020	on Playstation 1 was a really good game.
3178020	3183060	It was a fun game, like running from the cops and everything was fun, and Driver 2 wasn't
3183100	3184100	so bad.
3184100	3189100	I was like, well, I mean, it sounds like it could be fun, and so I played it, I'm like,
3189100	3193740	wow, this is really terrible, but I had fun playing it, because it was really bad.
3193740	3195340	All right.
3195340	3198220	We are not going to be doing a break tonight, since I mentioned earlier in the show we're
3198220	3201540	going to just keep moving on with some news, but we will get to your calls in just a little
3201540	3206540	bit at 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3206540	3210460	But first, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, starting with Loki.
3210460	3211740	All right.
3211740	3217780	So as, I'm not sure if this is a result of the whole, you know, Microsoft opening up
3217780	3223660	there online, but good news, DC Universe Online is now available on Xbox One.
3223660	3229420	So that's right, you can play it on PC, Playstation 4, Playstation 3, and Xbox One now.
3229420	3232180	So check it out.
3232180	3236000	And it is still free to play.
3236000	3239260	This is something that I wanted to get set up on my phone, I haven't quite gotten a chance
3239260	3243980	to do it, because I was trying to sync my Playstation 4 controller to my Android phone,
3243980	3245580	and it just does not want to work.
3245580	3250860	So Minecraft is now available for Samsung Gear VR, and I purchased this day one, as
3250860	3252660	soon as I saw that this was available.
3252660	3256900	It is something I'm probably going to check out, hopefully, maybe tonight.
3256900	3262740	And yeah, it's, you need a controller with it, so if you have a Bluetooth controller
3262740	3266920	that works with your Android phone, then definitely check this out.
3266920	3270640	But it's Minecraft in VR, what more can you want?
3270640	3277280	It's $7.99, I want to say, if you purchase it from the, or $6.99 from the Gear VR store.
3277280	3281960	And then finally we also have the free games you're going to be getting in May.
3281960	3287640	So starting off with Games with Gold on Xbox, the free games you're going to get starting
3287640	3291640	May 1st through May, or actually for the whole month of May, you're going to have Defense
3291640	3299640	Grid 2, and then Costume Quest 2 will be available for the 2nd, from May 16th through June 15th.
3299640	3305960	And then on Xbox 360, Grid 2 will be available for free May 1st through May 15th, and then
3305960	3310640	Pagle will be available May 16th through May 31st, of course all those Xbox 360 games are
3310640	3317360	compatible with the Xbox One, so be sure to pick them up even if you don't have a 360.
3317360	3323860	And then finally, on PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting Tropico 5, Tabletop Racing
3323860	3329080	World Tour, and Switch Galaxy Ultra on PlayStation 4.
3329080	3334780	PlayStation 3, you're going to be getting Bionaut Commando Rearmed 2, and Loco, was
3334780	3346920	it Loco Roco Cocoa, Loco Roco Cocoa, Loco Roco Cocoa Recto.
3346920	3348560	That's hard to say.
3348560	3352080	A lot of people were not feeling the free games this month.
3352080	3358240	Yeah, I want to say there was a rumor that it was, which game was it, the rumor was they're
3358240	3365160	going to have, it was supposed to be Watch Dogs, was the free game.
3365160	3366160	Oh wow.
3366160	3367240	That'd be kind of a video.
3367240	3370640	Maybe for June, maybe because if they were, obviously they're going to be announcing Watch
3370640	3372160	Dogs 2 or whatever.
3372160	3378760	Right, my thought was that maybe they're trying to keep some things and holding it for E3,
3378760	3382280	like because then they can announce at E3 that some big games are going to be playable.
3382280	3385600	That's why you have kind of an A month, is that it's going to lead into a really big
3385600	3387840	month because June's usually kind of a video.
3387840	3393600	And then Vita, God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Switch Galaxy Ultra as well.
3393600	3395120	So that's it.
3395120	3396120	Alright.
3396120	3398600	Well, you know what, hey, it's still free.
3399040	3400040	It might not be the stuff you wanted, but it's free.
3400040	3401040	Hey, exactly.
3401040	3404280	You know what, I've not played Tropico 5 or any of the Tropico games.
3404280	3405280	I mean, worth checking out.
3405280	3407440	And sometimes these games are freaking awesome.
3407440	3410200	You may not have heard of them and you play them and they're actually rad.
3410200	3412120	So go check it out.
3412120	3414680	Nintendo really did announce New Amiibo.
3414680	3416680	Loki was not joking earlier.
3416680	3418520	Splatoon is going to be getting some new amiibo.
3418520	3422720	The Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, who do all the announcing in the game and they do
3422720	3427000	that Stay Fresh, that little pose, the Stay Fresh pose, that is actually going to be the
3427000	3428000	pose.
3428400	3429400	I love the way these amiibo look.
3429400	3433160	I love the little, the bottoms with the ink kind of coming out.
3433160	3434160	These look great.
3434160	3437120	These amiibo are really getting put together better and better.
3437120	3441840	They're also going to be releasing new color variants of Inkling Girl, Inkling Boy, and
3441840	3445680	Inkling Squid, which is kind of, eh, whatever.
3445680	3447760	But they're going to be out on July 8th.
3447760	3450840	Callie and Marie will cost $25 together.
3450840	3455720	And then the new bundle with the recolors is going to be $35 if you want to check that
3455720	3456720	out.
3456760	3460080	You were worried that Nintendo wasn't going to release anything this year.
3460080	3463760	Well it is, it is interesting that, you know, they are adding more, I don't think these
3463760	3468200	things add new levels or anything into Splatoon, but I think it is like recoloring so the characters
3468200	3471280	or, uh, what did the Callie and Marie thing do?
3471280	3475120	I don't remember what they did off the top of my head, maybe somebody in chat remembers.
3475120	3478400	But they're just going to do like tiny little tweaks, like it's nothing like major major
3478400	3480640	to the game.
3480640	3483800	But it's still something, if that makes sense.
3483800	3485880	Act F says they have music in them.
3486320	3488240	Well that's still something, a little something.
3488240	3491280	I just, I would honestly get these for the figures.
3491280	3493000	They just, they look great.
3493000	3500120	So, anyway, moving on, Xenoblade Chronicles, not the one that was on Wii U, but was on
3500120	3504480	the Wii, and was really hard to get on the Wii, because when they finally released it
3504480	3509400	here in the States, after like years of waiting, they only released it at GameStop, which was
3509400	3511040	a big pile of shit.
3511040	3515200	Actually, I think they did do the online shop, to be fair, I think you could buy it direct
3515240	3516880	through Nintendo as well, to be fair.
3516880	3520800	But you couldn't buy it everywhere else, it was kind of a retailer exclusive.
3520800	3525440	Well now, if you missed Xenoblade Chronicles, and you want to experience where Shulk comes
3525440	3530480	from and so forth, you can actually download it on Wii U eShop, that is kind of a big release
3530480	3532800	that just came out for the Wii U eShop.
3532800	3537280	If you want it, it will cost you $20, or $19.99.
3537280	3538880	So it is a good game.
3538880	3546800	It is one of the greatest Japanese PlayStation 2 RPGs I played, yet it was on the Wii.
3546800	3548960	So take that for what it's worth.
3548960	3553400	And lastly, we talked a little bit about this last week, but now we have a date.
3553400	3559920	The new Mass Effect ride, Mass Effect, does the ride have a name?
3559920	3562200	I don't think it does, I think it's just the Mass Effect Experience.
3562200	3564960	No, Mass Effect New Earth, thank you, I knew it had a name.
3564960	3570880	Mass Effect New Earth is going to be opening May 18th at California's Great America.
3570880	3577480	That is a Wednesday, and I'm trying to actually get over there, hopefully to do, hopefully
3577480	3581360	if I can, I don't have the nice camera and all that set up that Bobby has, but I'm hoping
3581360	3585280	somehow I can do some video day one to bring back for you.
3585280	3589560	Obviously I can't film the ride, I think they'd probably frown on that, but if the rumors
3589560	3593760	are true that there's going to be cosplayers, people dressed up, and some of the ambiance
3593760	3596640	I'm sure around the ride and so forth, I'm very excited to see it.
3596640	3601240	So yeah, I'm trying to make things happen so I can get over there that Wednesday to
3601240	3602920	be one of the first to ride the ride.
3602920	3603920	Very excited.
3603920	3604920	So, May 18th.
3604920	3606800	Are you going to check that out at some point, Loki?
3606800	3609960	I know you're not as into Mass Effect as the rest of us, but it's still a video game ride,
3609960	3610960	which is kind of cool.
3610960	3611960	No.
3611960	3612960	No?
3612960	3613960	Hater.
3613960	3614960	Alright.
3614960	3619020	Tiger Claw in chat says, guys should dress up as Joker while at that ride.
3619020	3625500	You know, people don't really dress up for places like Great America like they do for
3625500	3626500	Disneyland.
3626500	3629380	And, well, the Disneyland thing is weird.
3629380	3632540	Okay, I'm going to do a quick, quick side tangent, because this actually doesn't relate
3632540	3635100	to where, like, Jamie is there at the park today, right?
3635100	3640140	And today is a thing called Dapper Day, where people dress up like it was the days when
3640140	3643660	Disneyland opened, when people would dress all fancy to go to the parks.
3643660	3646740	So like, you know, some friends of mine, like Victoria, who was on Guys on a Show a couple
3646740	3651300	weeks ago, she was wearing like this really nice dress that she made out of like a Disney
3651300	3652640	sheet and so forth.
3652640	3657020	But they do this thing where you can't go into Disneyland dressed up as characters,
3657020	3660580	because they don't want people confusing you with the real characters, right?
3660580	3667340	But they do this thing called Disneybounding, which is where you wear something that's inspired
3667340	3668340	by a ride.
3668340	3673420	So it's like you look kind of like it's, it's like a crossbreed type of thing.
3673420	3679460	So she wore a dress that looked like the Haunted Mansion colors, but it wasn't a Haunted
3679460	3681500	Mansion dress, if that makes sense.
3681500	3685780	But she wore something that was very much like, oh, that looks like a Haunted Mansion
3685780	3686960	adjacent thing.
3686960	3692800	So anyway, I maybe can wear my SR2 hat.
3692800	3693800	That's what I'll do.
3693800	3701440	I will, I will Biowarebound when I go to California, Great America, that's what I will do.
3701480	3705980	I will have my red beard and my SR2 hat.
3705980	3712080	So like if someone came dressed up like, you know, Freddy Fazbear, you know, to Disneyland.
3712080	3713660	It would be frowned on.
3713660	3715400	But it doesn't look like any of the Disney characters.
3715400	3718760	It just looks like one of their rides came alive and trying to eat children.
3718760	3721880	They're going to get you on the fact that you're wearing a mask.
3721880	3723440	You can't wear anything that conceals your face.
3723440	3727720	It's not a mask, this is my face.
3727720	3732040	Yeah, I think it's a safety issue because they're going to say that they can't videotape
3732040	3736600	you because, you know, there's a camera pointing at every single thing at Disneyland.
3736600	3739320	Do not have sex at a Disney park.
3739320	3740580	You will be filmed.
3740580	3742800	I'm just saying.
3742800	3745660	I've heard stories of what the Haunted Mansion employees have seen.
3745660	3746800	That's all I'm going to say.
3746800	3749120	Do not have sex at a Disney park.
3749120	3750720	Don't do it.
3750720	3753080	Unless you're into that kind of thing where you like to be an exhibitionist.
3753080	3755260	No sex in Disney park.
3755260	3759360	No sex in the Disney park.
3759360	3761400	Absolutely positively.
3761400	3764760	No sex in the Disney park.
3764760	3766800	You could probably have sex at Great America though.
3766800	3770880	I don't think their budget's as high as security.
3770880	3775800	I can't wear my ass like I wear it.
3775800	3778880	You could probably get a Bijon Gold Striker and nobody would notice.
3778880	3782600	Oh wait, no, no, all those rides, they fucking film you.
3783600	3784600	That's the big thing now.
3784600	3790720	We're going to film you on the ride screaming and hollering and all this shit so when you
3790720	3794400	get off the ride you can see a video of how stupid you are and then we'll sell it to you
3794400	3796160	for like 30 bucks.
3796160	3798080	That's the big thing they do now.
3798080	3799080	You want your porno?
3799080	3805200	It's going to cost you $30.
3805200	3809400	Which means I've got to take Extrofer to, I need to see what he's doing on May 18th.
3809400	3812800	We're going to take Extrofer to the park and make him ride Top Gun or whatever they
3812800	3813800	call it now.
3813800	3815720	It's not called Top Gun anymore but it's going to always be Top Gun.
3815720	3819000	Really fast jet ride.
3819000	3823000	Homo Erotic Volleyball.
3823000	3828160	Alright, let's get to-
3828160	3837240	Maverick and Goose's Wild Ride.
3837240	3838660	Let's get to the emails.
3838660	3844540	Every week you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some
3844540	3847700	of our favorite emails to read here on the show.
3847700	3853060	So again, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
3853060	3856580	Tiger Claw says, I wouldn't be surprised if people were caught having sex and it's a small
3856580	3857580	world.
3857580	3859780	Why would you do that?
3859780	3860780	Don't.
3860780	3861780	Don't do it.
3861780	3862780	Alright, we have several emails tonight.
3862780	3864180	I'm going to get through these though.
3864180	3867580	Email number one from Flaco Jones.
3867580	3872460	Remember last week on the show, we talked about Flaco Jones submitting to Summer Games
3872460	3873460	Done Quick.
3873460	3874460	Yes.
3874460	3875460	This is a follow up to that.
3875460	3876460	For his, yeah.
3876460	3877460	For PT.
3877460	3878460	PT.
3878460	3881140	So Flaco writes us and says, just finished the latest episode and yes, I did submit one
3881140	3885660	of my PT runs for the Summer Games Done Quick marathon but it was rejected.
3885660	3890380	They always do a spooky Games Done Quick block during the summer marathon and I was hoping
3890380	3893740	since PT is kind of short that they could have squeezed it in despite not having cool
3893740	3894940	glitches or skips.
3894940	3898260	Sadly, they are only running three spooky games this year.
3898260	3901940	Silent Hill 3, one of the Amnesia games and one of the Resident Evil games.
3901940	3903740	I'm too lazy to look it up.
3903740	3906260	I'll keep trying every time a marathon comes around.
3906260	3908740	Plus, my time keeps getting better so that should help.
3908740	3913060	I'm currently top three in any percent and top two in the 100% category.
3913060	3916420	I have a feeling that PT would have a better chance of making it through though if they
3916420	3919460	didn't pick another Silent Hill game for the spooky block.
3919460	3920460	Wish me luck.
3920460	3921700	You get accepted.
3921700	3924220	Yours will be the first podcast to know.
3924220	3926500	Well, I appreciate that.
3926500	3929980	Tiger Claw on chat says, maybe it got rejected because it's not a proper game.
3929980	3931300	It's just a demo.
3931300	3932340	You know what?
3932340	3934180	It's more than just a demo.
3934180	3935180	It's much more.
3935180	3936180	How dare you?
3936180	3940380	It's much more than a demo.
3940380	3943140	Someday we can hope.
3943140	3946980	Moving on to another email coming this week from YYR.
3946980	3948540	Hello LR.
3948540	3952140	One of the many, many NX discussion threads on NeoGAF this week again brought up the big
3952140	3954580	issue of third-party support.
3954580	3957740	As it stands, love it or hate it, I think most of us can agree that the only reason
3957740	3962060	to own Wii U is for its exclusives, most of which are from Nintendo themselves.
3962060	3963300	Some gamers say, who cares?
3963300	3965300	I buy a Nintendo console to play Nintendo games.
3965300	3969460	But we can easily see with the Wii U that this group isn't big enough to carry the system
3969460	3970580	on its own.
3970580	3971980	How do we approach this problem?
3971980	3975020	Unfortunately, my belief is that the root of the problem is also the root of Nintendo's
3975020	3979540	strategy to intentionally not do the same thing that everyone else is doing, but instead
3979540	3982040	to build a console around a concept.
3982040	3983900	Let's say I'm a developer, which I am.
3983900	3987140	If I'm going to develop something for Wii U, I feel compelled to write a game that takes
3987140	3989980	advantage of the gamepad because of how unique it is.
3989980	3993540	But because of that, it takes more effort to design or release such a game, and then
3993540	3996620	the end result can't be ported to other platforms as is.
3996620	4000420	This makes developing for Wii U a riskier proposition right out the gate.
4000420	4003980	Or I could develop something for Wii U that barely or doesn't take advantage of the gamepad
4003980	4004980	at all.
4004980	4008660	If this means I could release the same game on other platforms, owners of these platforms
4008660	4011460	will then say, well, why would I buy it on Wii U then?
4011460	4014460	Because the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, you could get the added value of trophies
4014460	4018460	or achievements, the social features, and of course, the convenience of using the console
4018460	4021120	that is already your primary gaming platform.
4021120	4024580	If it's a big risk regardless of the approach, why would a developer put their game on Wii
4024580	4025580	U at all?
4025580	4029300	And if the NX turns out to be another Nintendo concept piece, how will it change a third
4029300	4032540	party's mind about developing for a Nintendo console?
4032540	4037420	That I believe is the greatest challenge Nintendo faces with NX, especially in year one, when
4037420	4039900	the initial sales numbers can make or break a console.
4039900	4041260	I hope they're ready for it.
4041260	4045580	Crossing my fingers, toes, and eyes, Aaron, YYR.
4045580	4049820	Great email, because this kind of piggybacks on something I was saying earlier in the show,
4049820	4055420	but there is one little twist I want you to consider with NX that's a little different.
4055420	4061820	At least, again, this is all hypothesizing, but some of the loudest rumors have been that
4061820	4066980	there is going to be some type of handheld console synergy with the NX, which is, I
4066980	4069900	think, why Loki said earlier in the show, whatever.
4069900	4074580	I wasn't expecting it until 2017 anyway, because actually, I think a lot of people were expecting
4074580	4079180	that the handheld was going to come this year, the console was going to come next year.
4079180	4081300	Does this news affect that whole relationship?
4081300	4086720	I don't know, because we don't know what NX is, but hold on a minute and let's assume there's
4086720	4092880	a dual thing going on with the handheld slash console.
4092880	4096640	There's really not a lot of competition in the handheld space right now.
4096640	4097640	Mobile.
4097640	4099040	I mean, that's the biggest competitor.
4099040	4104520	I'm sorry, but the Vita at this point is really a fringe thing, and that's not really...
4104520	4109840	Look, I know I'm pissing off Vita fans with that, but you got a dose of realism here.
4109840	4112680	The Vita is kind of a fringe ultra fan thing.
4112680	4115040	You think Nintendo's thing is narrow.
4115040	4118320	The Vita is a very, very narrow audience right now as it is, which is too bad.
4118320	4119880	I really like the Vita.
4119880	4126760	But Nintendo kind of dominates the handheld outside of mobile, so if a company were to
4126760	4132200	make a game for NX, it's going to be a lot easier to get in that handheld space.
4132200	4139320	So I wonder if Nintendo isn't somehow leveraging their robust third-party network on 3DS, of
4139320	4144680	which they have a lot of people still making games on 3DS, to maybe port the games that
4144680	4146760	way, if that makes any sense at all.
4146760	4147760	That's just...
4147760	4148760	It's just a wild thought.
4148760	4152240	Again, we don't really know shit until they really tell us more about what this console's
4152240	4156920	all about, but if we want to put all the rumors together and hypothesize from there, I would
4156920	4161560	say the handheld angle is what may make this a little bit different situation, because
4161560	4166840	now you're not just putting out a game that you can't put out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox
4166840	4173680	or whatever, but you will have a game that's on console and the dominant handheld.
4173680	4177560	Dominant dedicated handheld anyway, because I can't really ignore that mobile is kind
4177560	4180400	of a big deal.
4180400	4182720	Anyway.
4182720	4186580	Stop Drop in Chat says, maybe if they cater to indie games, neither Sony or Microsoft
4186580	4189440	has really gone head first in the indie scene.
4189440	4192240	Maybe Nintendo can compete as a highly polished Steam store.
4192240	4194640	You know, I feel like Nintendo does try to do that a little bit.
4194640	4200000	They just don't do the greatest job of really pushing the indie games front and center,
4200000	4203020	but if you actually go on the eShop, there is quite a bit of stuff.
4203020	4207000	By the way, there's a really killer Humble Bundle right now that's some indie Nintendo
4207000	4211280	games that's definitely worth checking out, and I think there's even some commercial release.
4211280	4215360	I think Rhythm Thief is one of the games in it, which was for you music game fans.
4215360	4217800	You get a kick out of that.
4217800	4224600	But to be fair, I want to say Sony, wasn't this just two E3s ago that they had a whole
4224640	4227240	line of indie developers up on the stage.
4227240	4229840	And they were like, here's this, and this, and this.
4229840	4233840	So I don't know if I would say that Sony and Microsoft are like, not, I kind of think they
4233840	4239840	actually, Sony and Microsoft do just as good of a job with the indies, at least right now.
4239840	4240840	We'll see.
4240840	4241840	We'll see.
4241840	4243640	Again, the handheld thing I think could be a big deal.
4243640	4246620	If that's even what it is, I don't know.
4246620	4248520	Let's get to another email from AZHP.
4248520	4254320	AZHP says, since I chimed in on earlier reports from this show about the Coleco Chameleon,
4254360	4259240	I thought I'd share the final bit of information reported by Eurogamer about our pal Mike Kennedy.
4259240	4262880	The article can be found here, and he links over to a Eurogamer article, and then there's
4262880	4265120	an Atari Age post that it references as well.
4265120	4267540	I'm going to summarize for the benefit of the show.
4267540	4271160	Mike Kennedy came forward on the Atari Age forums announcing that he was tabling the
4271160	4275800	console endeavor for good, and explained that yes, the two prototype consoles were fakes.
4275800	4279920	However, he claims that he was in the dark just as much as the fans who were misled.
4279920	4284160	He claims that he hired a hardware engineer who provided the original prototype with in
4284200	4287400	instructions to not show the back of the unit no matter what.
4287400	4290600	Mike didn't understand why, so he ended up releasing pictures of the back of the system
4290600	4293920	anyway to prove that the console was actually plugged in.
4293920	4298080	This is when the unit was identified as a Super Nintendo Jr. inside a Jaguar shell.
4298080	4301640	When he took this information back to his engineer, he insisted that it was Super Nintendo
4301640	4304280	parts for the output, but the rest was his.
4304280	4309060	Kennedy believed him, and they released images of the clear Jaguar shell with the PCP visible.
4309060	4312680	According to Kennedy, he even joked about how people online were trying to identify
4312680	4315880	the board in our shell, laughing and telling me they won't find it because it's our
4315880	4316880	original work.
4316880	4318440	Again, I believed him.
4318440	4323080	After the PCB was exposed to be a PCI capture card, Kennedy withdrew from the venture.
4323080	4327160	He claims he was swindled out of nearly $10,000 of development costs and is just as much a
4327160	4328520	victim as anyone else.
4328520	4332640	Whether or not this is true will only be ever known by those involved, but this is likely
4332640	4336080	the last we will hear regarding what actually happened with the chameleon.
4336080	4340160	If it's true, I do feel sorry for Mike as he just wanted to revive retro games, which
4340160	4343820	was clearly a passion of his as he spoke about on this very show.
4343820	4347300	Now his name is tarnished, and he will likely never be able to launch a video game-related
4347300	4348300	endeavor again.
4348300	4352000	Hopefully, you all found this enlightening.
4352000	4353000	Yours truly, AZHP.
4353000	4354000	Thank you for the follow-up.
4354000	4355600	I appreciate it.
4355600	4357840	I hope that what he is saying is true.
4357840	4360280	I have no reason to disbelieve it.
4360280	4362360	It is just a real bummer.
4362360	4366520	It just sounds like, and with all due respect, obviously, he's been on the show before, and
4366520	4370520	I don't know if he listens, but I know some people who work with him do.
4370520	4374240	I'm sure he's a brilliant guy, and I'm sure he does really enjoy the retro gaming and
4374240	4375240	all that stuff.
4375240	4379020	It just sounds like if I'm taking all this when I'm reading at face value, he was just
4379020	4380200	in over his head.
4380200	4385860	He got into a venture that he really needed to rely on other people to kind of help out,
4385860	4388200	and that's what you do sometimes.
4388200	4392960	You might be the producer, but you really rely on building that team.
4392960	4396760	I can't believe I'm going to fucking use this analogy, but here I go.
4396760	4400600	Donald Trump keeps saying if he becomes president, he's going to surround himself with a cabinet
4400600	4406040	of people that know what they're doing, essentially, because obviously Donald Trump does not know
4406040	4407040	what he's doing.
4407040	4408040	Am I really making this comparison?
4408040	4409240	My God.
4409240	4410280	But that's what you do.
4410280	4413840	If you're a good producer, you surround yourself with people that are going to lift you up,
4413840	4417400	and it sounds like, unfortunately, he got done in by some of the people he surrounded
4417400	4420520	himself with, and it's unfortunate too bad.
4420520	4422520	So there it is.
4423080	4426560	Now I need to take a shower after making that comparison.
4426560	4429860	Here's the thing about that guy, dude.
4429860	4436800	He claims that it was this other person that made this prototype console and said, hey,
4436800	4438920	whatever you do, don't show the back of the console.
4438920	4444880	Wouldn't that kind of like send out some red flags, or wouldn't you want to dig in there
4444880	4449080	to see what exactly was in that console prototype that you paid this guy several thousand dollars
4449080	4450080	to make?
4450120	4455280	And then after it was come out that that, oh, yeah, it was a Super Nintendo in there,
4455280	4460320	you went back to the same fucking idiot to put out another fucking prototype that ended
4460320	4462000	up being another fake.
4462000	4464920	It's like, come on.
4464920	4468440	Hindsight is 20-20, what can I say?
4468440	4473600	Stop Drop wants to offer another perspective here in chat from live.vognetwork.com saying
4473600	4478000	he's so full of it, he's not the victim here, he already had drama in the Indiegogo campaign,
4478000	4481520	he knows he had to have all his ducks in a row, he has no excuse for claiming ignorance,
4481520	4484720	as if this is the first time he's ever gone down this road.
4484720	4492160	All right, let's get to our last email tonight from Raginator, who says, hi, OLR.
4492160	4495360	As per usual, it's Raginator, and I have a short email for you this week.
4495360	4496360	You're welcome, DarkSakura.
4496360	4499120	Haha, joke's on you, she's not here.
4499120	4503520	As you may remember, every so often on OLR, I practically beg companies to re-release
4503520	4505080	their classic games on Steam.
4505080	4507840	Well, to a limited degree, it would seem that Namco has listened.
4507840	4512480	A week to ten days ago, they released four titles for individual sale, two of which technically
4512480	4517080	were available via Pac-Man Museum, Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug.
4517080	4521240	Just a quick aside, Raginator, they also released these on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4521240	4525320	It actually isn't unique to PC, but yes, it did hit PC as well.
4525320	4527200	While I won't speak for others, I'll say this.
4527200	4531840	While this is rather limited and not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.
4531840	4536480	I hope the trend continues, not just with Namco, but with other companies as well.
4536480	4541480	This email was brought to you by Rocket Weasel, home of the rocket-propelled, asploding weasels.
4541480	4543480	Thank you, Raginator.
4543480	4548880	Yes, lots of retroactivity on Steam between what Loki was talking about earlier and what
4548880	4551840	you're bringing up with the classic arcade releases.
4551840	4557440	And I suppose, as with most things in the industry, if those re-releases sell well,
4557440	4558920	then they'll do more.
4558920	4564080	Which is why I kind of wish Namco had done something else.
4564080	4568600	Like you said, they released games they've already done in Pac-Man Museum.
4568600	4574840	And I want to say Dig Dug was in a PlayStation 3 collection, Galaga is available on Xbox
4574840	4576400	One and Xbox 360.
4576400	4584480	I just feel like these choices are not exactly new, so I kind of wish Nintendo would look
4584480	4588960	elsewhere in the catalog for some things to release because Namco has a very rich 80s
4588960	4589960	arcade library.
4589960	4595800	So I don't know, maybe Pac-Man is kind of a big deal, so I guess it's to test the waters,
4595800	4596800	but we'll see.
4596800	4597800	We'll see what comes of it.
4597800	4601240	I did want to say, though, on kind of a tangent thing, because this is something Raginator
4601240	4604560	brought up a couple weeks ago, and Loki, maybe you saw this as well.
4604560	4607480	Do you remember when Raginator was talking about the whole movies on Steam thing and
4607480	4609800	that there's not a lot of movies available on Steam?
4609800	4614800	I swear to God, just within the last week, I see an ad on Steam, Lionsgate is now selling
4614800	4621360	movies on Steam, and you can get like Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay and all
4621360	4622360	this stuff.
4622360	4625640	You can get these movies, probably Saw is on there, too, Lionsgate.
4625640	4628160	You can get a lot of these movies through Steam.
4628160	4632240	Here's the thing, though, because the first, the minute I saw that, I thought of, huh,
4632240	4635240	that's interesting because we just had that discussion on the show this last week about
4635240	4638080	what are they going to do when they have to hit the kill switch.
4638080	4640720	These movies that they're selling are rentals.
4640720	4643080	They're not actually to own the title.
4643080	4647640	It's just to rent them, so I guess that's how they got around that.
4647640	4651800	But anyway, I just, I thought of that, Raginator, because your email or call or something from
4651800	4657720	last week, and then like literally in the past seven days, suddenly we have expanded
4657720	4661080	movie presence on Steam, so I just thought that was very interesting.
4661080	4666320	So, um, uh, SHO and Hunter Matt says, Raginator is Steam's biggest fanboy.
4666320	4668280	Of course, they'd have tabs on his thoughts.
4668280	4670840	All right, there it is.
4670840	4673120	Thank you for all the emails this week.
4673120	4677280	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for consideration
4677280	4679080	for a future week.
4679080	4682520	We're just a couple stories away from your calls, but first, we have to get some of the
4682520	4685640	angst out in a little segment we call the FUs of the Week.
4696320	4703920	Um, F you to being sick.
4703920	4709600	Thankfully, it's a lot better now because I don't have a fever, but like from seriously
4709600	4718000	Monday through practically Friday, I was running a fever all the time, even with, you know,
4718000	4721720	ibuprofen and acetaminophen in my system.
4721720	4728240	It was just not fun whatsoever because that made it very hard to learn a new job since
4728240	4733560	I'm kind of working in a different position at the moment, but thankfully I'm better now,
4733560	4739480	but it's still congested, so that still sucks and tired and goddammit, why won't this load
4739480	4740480	up?
4740480	4743040	Are you trying to dinker around with something there on the Gear VR?
4743040	4747200	Yeah, I was trying to get the Gear VR Minecraft to work, but like I popped it in there.
4747200	4749920	It's all installed the Gear VR software.
4749920	4751680	I'm like, it's already fucking on there.
4751680	4753680	I've used it before.
4753680	4754680	Okay, fine.
4754680	4755680	All right.
4755680	4762280	My FU of the Week goes to getting sick because I've been sick like three times in the past
4762280	4763280	six months.
4763280	4765200	This is ridiculous.
4765200	4767440	People in my job are going to be like, what's wrong with you?
4767440	4769180	You're a big box of cooties.
4769180	4770480	They're probably not wrong.
4770480	4771480	That's how I feel.
4771480	4776200	Anyway, I'm hoping, I'm hoping whatever this is will blow over really quick because I would
4776200	4778360	like to, I would like to work next week.
4778360	4779840	There's a lot of stuff going on.
4779840	4784080	Anyhow, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we are going to get to the Skype
4784080	4785080	line.
4785080	4789200	But first, Logie's going to have to put down the Gear VR and get to our last story.
4789200	4795720	So you know, last we heard of them, they were basically messing with Activision.
4795720	4802040	Activision finally wiped their hands clean of them and now they've parted ways.
4802040	4809800	Now they have turned towards Ubisoft and they're making purchases of their shares to,
4809800	4813340	I don't know, maybe try to take over the company.
4813340	4820960	But apparently after receiving the buyout package from Activision, they've been buying
4820960	4825320	up shares of Ubisoft, hinting at a hostile takeover.
4825320	4831140	Their control, let's see, their last purchase that they made brought their control percentage
4831140	4838100	up to 17.73% and 15% of the voting shares.
4838100	4841740	And of course Ubisoft made a comment regarding this as well.
4841740	4847100	We are not at all surprised by this latest statement from Vivendi nor by the intent behind
4847100	4848100	it.
4848100	4856620	This is a confirmation of their habitual strategy of creeping control in which they say they
4856620	4861660	have no intention to take control of Ubisoft while steadily increasing their stake and
4861660	4865700	preparing for an offensive at the next annual shareholders meeting.
4865700	4875460	This strategy successfully, sorry, this strategy of successively announcing conflicting intentions
4875460	4882100	is contrary to good corporate practices and is not in the best interest of Ubisoft's other
4882100	4883100	shareholders.
4883100	4888940	Moreover, despite our repeated written requests since they first entered into our capital,
4888940	4894300	Vivendi has never presented any details or a convincing plan on how this supposed cooperation
4894300	4895540	would take place.
4895540	4901580	Ubisoft's management remains committed to preserving the independence of the company,
4901580	4908980	which the condition for long-term value creation that will benefit for all of our shareholders.
4908980	4915940	So I don't know, it didn't work out that great last time that they took over a company.
4915940	4916940	So we'll see.
4916940	4923460	It would be interesting to see what the long-term vision is there, especially going into what
4923460	4929180	could be a new console cycle here or half console cycle.
4929180	4937540	Well lastly, but not leastly, we have an esports related story and boy, this is embarrassing,
4937540	4938940	but it's not loading for me.
4938940	4943940	So unfortunately, all I know is I don't have the details, I just have the headline, but
4943940	4950260	there's an esports league out there that has banned you porn from sponsoring an esports
4950260	4951260	team.
4951260	4953900	Poor you porn, can't catch a break.
4953900	4957620	What do you mean they don't want to associate pornography with esports?
4957620	4959380	What's up with that?
4959380	4964020	I think you should take, you know, whoever, whatever sponsors you can.
4964020	4966180	So yeah, basically it says the ESL.
4966180	4967180	Oh, thank you.
4967180	4968180	Yeah.
4968180	4969180	And it finally, go ahead, go ahead though.
4969180	4970180	It finally came up.
4970180	4971180	No, go ahead.
4971180	4972180	Go ahead.
4972180	4973180	All right.
4973180	4979220	The ESL, the directors of the esports league, eslgaming.com, they have ruled that you porn,
4979220	4983820	that team is going to be banned because of the association with that sponsor.
4983820	4987540	Advertising pornography is not legal in the markets we operate in and the vast majority
4987540	4992520	of partners we're working with have a strict no drugs, no alcohol, no pornography rule,
4992520	4996960	no fun, Jesus, rules that we've contractually taken on board.
4996960	5000240	These aren't new rules, but ones that have been in our rule books for a long time.
5000240	5003200	We spoke to the manager of team YP earlier this year.
5003200	5006920	And in that conversation, we explained the situation and rules in detail and offered
5006920	5009560	to look for potential alternatives in a bigger group.
5009560	5013080	At the same time, we are consulting with our legal teams about this.
5013080	5017460	We will inform the team and management as soon as we have any updates.
5017460	5019680	So there you go.
5019680	5021920	You porn team has been banned.
5021920	5022920	Come on.
5022920	5026720	If it's on the internet, there's porn.
5026720	5030080	Like people don't know that.
5030080	5031080	What's the big deal with porn anyway?
5031080	5036920	I think what's more shocking is they're playing Evolve.
5036920	5041680	Stop dropping chat asks, did the you porn team yell money shot instead of headshot?
5041680	5042680	Maybe.
5042680	5043720	I don't know.
5043720	5046040	Is this the actual you porn team that they show in the picture here?
5046040	5047040	I don't think so.
5047040	5048040	Yeah.
5048040	5051880	I think they're just, I think they're just, that's going to, that's going to be interesting
5051880	5055880	though when your team just, the stock photo just ends up on the you porn story.
5055880	5056880	Who gives a shit?
5056880	5059160	I mean, I, it's just a company.
5059160	5061800	I'm sorry that you don't like what they do now.
5061800	5066640	I think you should have your, you know, that would make it more exciting.
5066640	5077120	Sex drugs and you know, alcohol, that should all be a part of this e-sports thing.
5077120	5079120	You know what I, here's the thing.
5079120	5082920	If you porn, yeah, I guess this is the same group cause this is a, a tiger clause posted
5082920	5083920	a picture in the chat.
5083920	5084920	So it is the same group.
5084920	5088920	Hey, if you porn wants to sponsor this show, I'm all for it.
5088920	5092640	Bring it on.
5092640	5094560	We'll interview some of the actors and actresses.
5094560	5096880	We'll go, we'll go the whole nine yards.
5096880	5097880	What do you guys think?
5097880	5099760	Should OLR sell out to you porn?
5099760	5101760	Yes or no?
5101760	5107440	Yes, I'm fully, I'm fully fine with selling out to you porn.
5107440	5109240	All right.
5109240	5110880	We put it out there.
5110880	5118520	You porn, you participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to come on over.
5118520	5119520	All right.
5119520	5122680	Uh, that's it for the, uh, news that we had on deck tonight.
5122680	5123680	So we're going to open up the Skype line.
5123680	5126920	I know it's a little early, but I warned you guys it was going to be a shorter show tonight.
5126920	5131920	One eight seven seven game OLR or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
5131920	5132920	All one word.
5132920	5135880	If you want to give us a call, um, while we wait to see if any calls come in.
5135880	5140160	Uh, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
5140160	5142920	Uh, no.
5142920	5150360	Sadly, no, there wasn't a whole lot, um, last minute stuff.
5150360	5155760	Yeah, it actually, all things considered, despite the, uh, big news about Nintendo that
5155760	5159400	happened, um, it seemed to be a little bit, a little bit more relaxed this week.
5159400	5161120	It was, it was a little bit quieter.
5161120	5164860	I was scanning through Twitter to see if we got any tweets this week.
5164860	5169180	This one's really random, but we were tweeted something by blue swim a few days ago that
5169180	5173900	talks about, I don't know if you heard about this Loki, maybe you saw the, um, uh, tweet
5173900	5177540	as well, but ABC is bringing back the match game.
5177540	5178540	Oh yeah.
5178540	5179540	Alec Baldwin is the host.
5179540	5181660	It's kind of a weird choice for host for me.
5181660	5185760	I mean, you know, Alec Baldwin was great on 30 rock, but there was something I was going
5185760	5186760	to mention.
5186760	5191740	It's like Clyde brought up to me earlier and I did watch it, um, this weekend, um, was
5192620	5197380	that independent animation that was done for Star Fox called a Fox in space.
5197380	5198380	Oh yeah.
5198380	5199380	Have you watched that?
5199380	5200380	Yeah.
5200380	5201380	You were tweeting.
5201380	5202380	I have not watched it, but I, it's actually pretty cool.
5202380	5205340	It's, it's like, uh, it's, it's a very interesting style.
5205340	5210380	Remind me like a, like early eighties, you know, like more of the, not, not necessarily
5210380	5218080	adult, but like, you know, kind of like that adult style, um, cartoon or animation from
5218080	5221580	like the early eighties, I guess, you know, where it's.
5221580	5226180	Back when cartoons, you know, were just, it's a medium, you know, where they had some adult
5226180	5231380	storylines like heavy metal, you know, for example, um, you know, something like that,
5231380	5234660	but it was, you know, Star Fox related and I thought it was pretty cool.
5234660	5235660	Hmm.
5235660	5236660	No, I didn't see that.
5236660	5237660	I'll have to check that out.
5237660	5240380	I still need to watch the final fantasy 15 anime too.
5240380	5243620	Cause that was the thing that came out a few weeks ago when they did the big fantasy 15
5243620	5244960	event and I still haven't watched that.
5244960	5248300	So yeah, tiger claw linked it in chat, so go check it out.
5248300	5249300	Awesome.
5249300	5250300	All right.
5250300	5251300	I'll do one last call for calls.
5251300	5252300	It's early tonight.
5252300	5255140	It's probably throwing some people off, but we'll see, uh, one eight seven seven game
5255140	5259100	O L R or username on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word.
5259100	5263580	Um, but I think, I think we just have less, uh, of an audience and stuff tonight just
5263580	5265460	because Bobby wasn't here.
5265460	5269220	And then I think there isn't, isn't game of Thrones back tonight or something.
5269220	5270220	Is it?
5270220	5271220	Yeah, I think it is.
5271220	5274920	So there, there goes Sunday nights for some people and these are, these are the ones that
5274920	5279340	now are in uncharted territory because they are past the books at this point because George
5279340	5281780	R R Martin can't write fast enough.
5281780	5285300	Although somehow he's killing everybody in 2016.
5285300	5289180	Ah, I don't get it.
5289180	5290180	All right.
5290180	5293260	Oh, well our phone is lighting up, so let's get to it.
5293260	5294260	Hello.
5294260	5295260	You're on orange songs radio.
5295260	5296260	Who's this?
5296260	5298380	I guess it's the savior of the show, Rama.
5298380	5300940	Hey Rama, how's it going?
5300940	5302380	Ah, pretty good.
5302380	5303380	Pretty good.
5303380	5306260	I'm just kind of relaxing after a fun, interesting weekend.
5306260	5308860	Did you do a con this weekend or what?
5308860	5309860	What was your weekend?
5309860	5310860	Uh, no.
5310860	5316060	Uh, this weekend was Sakuna Matsuri, but I decided I didn't go because I forgot to get
5316060	5318020	time off and so forth.
5318020	5324140	And I triple booked my weekend and then I was like, you know what, maybe I will go cause
5324140	5325420	someone had an extra pass.
5325420	5330060	I get up this morning, it's raining and I'm like, I'm not taking my thousand dollars of
5330060	5333060	equipment out into the, no, not doing it.
5333060	5334060	Nope.
5334060	5335060	Nope.
5335060	5336060	Nope.
5336060	5339660	I'm like, um, my end of June is looking crazy right now.
5339660	5341900	I'm like triple booked crazy.
5341900	5346060	So anyway, I just opened up outlook and I'm like, let me look at my calendar for next,
5346060	5347060	for the summer.
5347060	5349060	I'm just like, Oh shit.
5349060	5350060	Yeah.
5350060	5351060	Fuck.
5351060	5352060	Well, what's on your mind?
5352060	5357260	Uh, this whole thing about Nintendo, I mean, don't get me wrong.
5357260	5362180	Nintendo has fail us in the past, but I can overlook those for what they were trying to
5362180	5363180	do.
5363180	5367300	I don't think the NX is going to quote unquote, make or break the company.
5367300	5370380	I mean, they have one hell of a war chest.
5370380	5377820	If you ask me, the console just has to have the tech to keep up with everybody else.
5377820	5384380	And it, and I believe the rumor that it's going to be PC based, which means cheaper
5384380	5385380	overhead costs.
5385380	5390040	You just pull what you need off of, off the shelves and everything's going to just rock
5390040	5391520	and roll.
5391520	5394920	Um, but what about the whole backwards compatibility?
5394920	5396760	Cause that's something Nintendo is famous for.
5396760	5401460	I would be very surprised if they did not retain backwards compatibility with at least
5401460	5406440	the Wii U games that would really surprise me if they jumped that whole ship.
5406440	5409800	I just have three words about that.
5409800	5410800	Fuck backwards compatibility.
5410800	5415240	Oh, those are some strong words.
5415240	5416240	Maybe it's me.
5416240	5417400	I look at it this way.
5417400	5418400	Yes.
5418400	5419400	I have my PS3.
5419760	5423760	I have the hardware fat model that's fully compatible with the PS2.
5423760	5426280	Do you know what else I have sitting up hooked up to my TV?
5426280	5428280	My PS2.
5428280	5432740	Just cause I do have import games that do not play on my PS3.
5432740	5438240	If I was go out and get an Xbox one, I would not trade in my Xbox 360 because maybe out
5438240	5442320	of my collection, only one game would be compatible.
5442320	5446880	Plus you're also looking at, you have two different types of hardware architecture to
5446880	5447880	deal with.
5448360	5451560	That would increase the overhead costs of the system.
5451560	5456120	I had an interesting discussion with a friend of mine about this and she was trying to prove
5456120	5459800	the point of the backwards compatibility on the PS4 and I'm just like, well that's all
5459800	5462000	streaming between you and me.
5462000	5468040	I'm not paying monthly for a streaming service for it to play older titles.
5468040	5474280	I will not pay, like if I already paid 40 bucks on a game for the 360, if they recode
5474280	5478520	the game for the Xbox one, I'm not going to spend another 40 bucks when I already have
5478520	5479520	the game.
5479520	5485040	I'd rather deal with the patience of the emulation or I'll just pop in my 360 and I'll play it.
5485040	5489720	I really wish though that PlayStation 3 was backwards compatible on PlayStation 4 and
5489720	5495160	it kind of irritates me that they even have that whole PlayStation Now thing and yet if
5495160	5498200	I put a PS3 disc in the drive, it's still not going to let me do it.
5498200	5499200	I'm going to have to buy it separately.
5499200	5500760	It just kind of irritates me.
5500760	5503080	I'm out of shelf space is what it is, Rama.
5503080	5508520	I mean, I don't have space for all these fucking consoles in the living room and so
5508520	5509520	I had to make a choice.
5509520	5514320	I moved the PS3 out to the, I only use the PS3 now for TuneIn here in the studio so we
5514320	5516960	can listen to Bobby's show while we wait for OLR.
5516960	5519520	That's pretty much the use of the PS3 right now.
5519520	5521000	I don't really game a lot on it anymore.
5521000	5526240	I really wish, if nothing else, if I could just like stream from the PS3 to the PS4,
5526240	5530320	even that would be something but I just kind of doubt that's going to be a thing.
5530360	5535080	I mean, theoretically with the proper hardware software, you could do it, Sony could do it,
5535080	5536800	but they probably don't want to.
5536800	5542960	But again, it's two different types of architectures and it's going to be harder to emulate like
5542960	5548520	on the Xbox One, emulate the power PC processor and for the PS3 is hard and like the cell
5548520	5552520	processor to Sony, it's just cheaper to offer this service.
5552520	5559560	Now if I had a PS4 and these games are streaming compatible, if I did not have the game, I
5559600	5563960	would not mind paying monthly to play those backwards compatible games.
5563960	5568920	But if that game is on my shelf, I want to run that service, pop the game in, and not
5568920	5569920	pay for it.
5569920	5570920	Yeah, I agree.
5570920	5574640	I really wish that's the way they'd done it, but for whatever reason it's not.
5574640	5579200	We can always hope that maybe they'll change it, come out E3, I just hope, here's what
5579200	5585480	I really hope, because this would be such a fucking Nintendo thing to do.
5585480	5589640	They come out and say the PlayStation 4 Neo will be backwards compatible with PlayStation
5589640	5590640	4 or PlayStation 3.
5590640	5593520	I'm going to be so fucking mad if that's the case.
5593520	5598920	I've been reading specs on it and the upgrade for the PlayStation 4 has me kind of pissed
5598920	5599920	off.
5599920	5604120	I mean from this aspect of how much memory that's going to be in the system, I mean like
5604120	5605120	memory is cheap.
5605120	5607760	You mean to tell me you can't put an extra eight gigs in the system?
5607760	5612920	Yes, I know the dev kits are designed around eight, but if you put another eight in there,
5612920	5615440	the games will run a lot smoother and a lot faster.
5615440	5617320	I mean, come on, fam.
5617320	5618320	Come on.
5618320	5619320	Yeah.
5619320	5623400	Well, it seems like we've got a lot of questions going into E3, but the good news is we only
5623400	5625880	have, what, not even six weeks to wait.
5625880	5626880	Yeah.
5626880	5627880	So we'll get there.
5627880	5628880	Very much.
5628880	5630840	All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else comes through, but
5630840	5632480	have a good week and we'll talk to you next time.
5632480	5633480	Yeah, bro.
5633480	5634480	You take care of yourself.
5634480	5635480	All right.
5635480	5636480	Take care.
5636480	5637480	Bye.
5637480	5638480	Bye.
5638480	5640880	For the folks just joining us, if you joined late, yes, we are already in phone calls.
5640880	5643640	It is going to be a shorter show tonight just because at the top of the show I mentioned
5643640	5648800	I'm actually not feeling too well, but I really, really did not want to skip another week.
5648800	5652960	My nose is getting bleh and my throat is scratchy, so I did not really want to talk for the full
5652960	5654000	three hours.
5654000	5656840	So I hope you guys all understand we are doing a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but
5656840	5660400	we just, we had to do something because we've just been missing too many weeks lately and
5660400	5661880	I don't want to be a bimonthly show.
5661880	5665600	I want to be a weekly show with incidental weeks off.
5665600	5670840	Anyway, we'll put one more shout out there for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or I usually name
5670840	5674520	on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
5674520	5679040	And then after we get this last call, looks like we've got one more call coming in.
5679040	5680960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5680960	5681960	Who's this?
5681960	5682960	Hey, this is Akdeft.
5682960	5683960	Hi, Akdeft.
5683960	5686240	What's up?
5686240	5691740	Why can't we be so negative against Nintendo?
5691740	5694520	Why can't we be negative against Nintendo or why are we negative?
5694520	5699640	Well, why can't we and why are we negative against Nintendo?
5699640	5706720	Well, I could show you a tweet that says, please look forward to the new Zelda game
5706720	5709120	coming holiday of 2015.
5709120	5714520	So maybe some people just feel that Nintendo is disappointing with the pushback and the
5714520	5715520	pushback.
5715520	5719920	And yes, I know the whole Miyamoto line about, you know, a good, a bad game is bad and the
5719920	5722240	good game will be memorable and everybody will forget.
5722240	5727120	But at the same time, you know, you sort of, I think you kind of invest yourself and you,
5727120	5731240	you emotionally get ready for some of these games and even those folks that support Nintendo
5731240	5734720	kind of champion and saying, you know, these games are coming, they're going to be awesome.
5734720	5738480	And then to find out they're not, it's just, it's a little disheartening, you know, but
5738480	5741240	again, I don't think it's going to be the end of the world.
5741240	5745840	I tend to feel like, all right, once 2017 gets here, if the NX really delivers with
5745840	5752760	the games I want, I'm telling you, if the NX has like Metroid, F-Zero, Mario, this conversation
5752760	5753760	is done.
5753760	5755640	I am on the NX day one.
5755640	5757680	I probably will be no matter what anyway.
5757680	5761260	But like, you know, with the right games, Nintendo will pull it out.
5761260	5766320	But maybe the fact that those right games never seem to show up is also part of the
5766320	5768320	reason we get very frustrated with Nintendo.
5768320	5769320	I don't know.
5769320	5770320	What are your thoughts?
5770320	5776240	Well, I would think, uh, partially like that, yeah, we do have some games that don't deliver
5776240	5779280	on their promises and all that.
5779280	5788480	And with the Wii U, it was a really, really, uh, like a hard, uh, period, if we could say
5788480	5789480	that.
5789480	5797160	Uh, when only, uh, well, we can say a handful of games were really, really, really excellent.
5797160	5802920	Though I do have a vast, uh, Wii U library and I could pretty much mention more than
5802920	5803920	10.
5803920	5812480	But yeah, most people probably want at least, uh, five games that they want with the system.
5812480	5825040	And I hope the NX fixes that problem and Nintendo does get the idea that we want some of the
5825040	5831200	older games like F-Zero, like a new Metroid and all that stuff.
5831200	5836720	But we also kind of underestimate Nintendo a lot.
5836720	5838000	And I mean a lot.
5838000	5848000	We uh, like Splatoon and even Pikmin 3, like many people, and I was reading a tweet earlier
5848000	5854340	today that said, oh, the Nintendo Wii U doesn't have any strategy games.
5854340	5859920	And I'm like, uh, what about Pikmin 3, which is one of, I don't, I'm not into strategy
5859920	5864000	games, but Pikmin 3 was pretty, pretty good.
5864000	5873720	So I don't know about that and, and the Nintendo Wii U has some really great games that pretty
5873720	5876160	much were overlooked.
5876160	5883840	That's my, my probably biggest problem with people, uh, saying that the Wii U failed when,
5883840	5889440	uh, most of the time they didn't even give it, give them a chance, chance, sorry.
5889440	5896440	Um, I, I, I would agree that there's a lot of people out there that probably hate on
5896440	5901200	the Wii U that's probably never touched one, but that's just the nature of the internet,
5901200	5902200	unfortunately.
5902200	5908440	And, um, I, I think, you know, there's also a lot of Wii U champions out there too.
5908440	5912280	So it's kind of a, it's kind of a mixed bag, I suppose, on, on Twitter and in any circle
5912280	5915560	of gaming, you're always going to have the Nintendo fans and so forth.
5915560	5920320	But I think too, part of Nintendo's kind of tone, I think changed with Wii U and I
5920320	5922680	really blame third parties for that.
5922680	5926480	You look, you go back and you look at that first E3, it looked like every third party
5926480	5930720	in the world was gung ho about the Wii U.
5930720	5935180	The problem was is that they made a key error and that was that all the games that they
5935180	5939360	released right out the gate were rehashes of games that they had just put out a year
5939360	5940400	ago.
5940400	5946240	And I think if there had been more games like Zombie U out the gate and less, I hate to
5946240	5951520	say it, Mass Effect 3 and less Batman, Arkham, whatever game it was that it was a silent,
5951520	5957720	no, it was Arkham Knight, no, it was Arkham City, whatever, whatever Batman game came
5957720	5960760	out on Wii U when it came out, you know, if it was less of that and more of the stuff
5960760	5965800	like Zombie U and so forth coming from third parties, it would have helped tremendously.
5965800	5974580	I think and I have a feeling Nintendo pushing back the MX may have something to do with
5974580	5976440	third parties more than we think.
5976440	5981120	The third parties might have said we need more time to make these games work and Nintendo
5981120	5985680	is giving it to them because they do not want to make the same mistake twice.
5985680	5993760	Not to mention that, yeah, the Wii U lacked a lot of first party support too at the beginning.
5993760	5999500	What was the only game or I think two games that were Nintendo published that were Nintendo
5999500	6006960	Land and I think, I can't remember exactly but I think it was also Gaming Wario.
6006960	6010960	But yeah, also Nintendo didn't push like a big game.
6010960	6016440	That's probably why we're also seeing the new Zelda on the NX.
6016440	6017440	Yeah.
6017440	6021480	I think Nintendo may have underestimated how fast EA and Ubisoft were going to get
6021480	6022600	the fuck out of there.
6022640	6024560	I think that really caught them off guard.
6026280	6027280	Yeah, pretty much.
6027280	6028280	Yeah.
6028280	6029280	All right.
6029280	6031080	Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your
6031080	6032080	thoughts.
6032080	6033080	I appreciate it.
6033080	6034080	Hey, thanks for having me.
6034080	6035080	All right.
6035080	6036080	Take care, my friend.
6036080	6037080	All right.
6037080	6039920	That is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
6039920	6043880	I want to thank you guys for being here, whether it be on the live or the podcast feed, I really
6043880	6046160	appreciate that.
6046160	6049240	You know what we always say here at OLR, if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend or two
6049240	6050400	about the show.
6050400	6051800	Help us spread the word.
6051800	6055520	We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't share those voices unless you
6055520	6057800	guys use them.
6057800	6062000	Dark Sakura will be back next week and we'll catch up with how her week at Disneyland was
6062000	6067240	and what all games she got to play, maybe she got to visit the arcade there or something.
6067240	6068240	I don't know.
6068240	6071960	I want to say that PinnaGogo, the pinball thing, is coming up really soon too.
6071960	6075400	I don't know if that's next week or two weeks away but I'm sure Dark Sakura will give us
6075400	6078040	some perspective on that as well.
6078040	6081160	Loki, have fun with your Gear VR.
6081160	6084880	Yeah, I didn't get my old ass controller to sync with it.
6084880	6088360	Try to play some games this week, now that you're feeling a little better.
6088360	6089480	Uh, yeah.
6089480	6093440	And I'll try to play something that's not just Final Fantasy XIV or Diablo.
6093440	6096720	You guys, I just love online games, I just do.
6096720	6097720	Keep on giving.
6097720	6100440	Anyway, that's what I play.
6100440	6101440	Final thoughts tonight?
6101440	6102840	Loki, your final thoughts tonight?
6102840	6106560	I'm going to go buy a new Bluetooth controller because this one doesn't work.
6106560	6107560	What?
6107560	6112080	Well it works but it doesn't work with what I want it to work with.
6112080	6113440	I got to buy something more generic.
6113440	6115480	Well hey, at least you have a little time tonight.
6115480	6118320	You might be able to get the best buy before they close, who knows.
6118320	6119320	Uh, no.
6119320	6120320	Don't.
6120320	6121320	Close at 8.
6121320	6122320	Oh, I thought it was 9.
6122320	6123320	Alright.
6123320	6126000	And then my final thought is I'm going to just rest up, I'm going to go have some tea
6126000	6128320	and just try to rest my voice and feel better.
6128320	6131840	Thank you guys for understanding and bearing with our ups and our downs.
6131840	6136880	Your support means an awful lot and that's why we continue to do this as much as we can
6136880	6138600	for free every week for you guys.
6138600	6139680	Really appreciate it.
