00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, the list of generic top-level domains will soon include .game and .games.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
You may soon be able to get Bungie Ferretossings from yyr.games slash bungieferretossing.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
There's more tangible news to come, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Did he pay for that spot? He paid for that spot, right?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh hey, hi everybody, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 640 of our show for May the 8th of 2016.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And joining me in studio, welcome back, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Sup? Hey, how you doing? Welcome back. How you feeling?

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I feel a lot better, now that I no longer have viral laryngitis.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
Like, you can't go be around people, because you're contagious.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Like, you realize I've already been out shopping on my birthday. You have a disease.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
So, I just, I said, okay sure, I was like out two days of work, and I missed money.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
My paycheck was dismal. But hey, I went to Karthy Circle and got the World of Color three course meal deal.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And you made Dan pay for it, because it's your birthday.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Comes out the same place.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
And then we also, though, I got to try wine from the Lassiter Vineyard. It's pretty damn good.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
I was going to ask, how was Disneyland? Although, you were technically at Disneyland, but it's all still Disneyland to me.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I was at California Avenger. It was really fun.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
If you went to Hollywood Studios, I would still say you were at Disney World.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
We didn't really ride much, though. We just sort of hung out.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Really?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
Because it was Bats Day and Dapper Day, so I was all bat-stout. It looked like I was dressed like high school.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
You know, the only thing I was missing was like a huge flannel shirt to wear over my all black ensemble.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
You know, I had raccoon eyes going on, because it was all black makeup.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Ah, fun.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
But yeah, it was pretty cool.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Now, I'm surprised you didn't wait and go this weekend when you could have done DragCon as well.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Although, I don't know if Dan would have had a great time at DragCon.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Dan probably wouldn't have had a great time at DragCon. He barely.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
The only thing that I think Dan knows from all of my Drag Race watching and YouTubing is, really, Queen?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Because he thinks Bianca Del Rio is funny.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Bianca Del Rio is funny.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I know.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
You don't have to be any-

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
She has inspired my speed dial of spite.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
Alright, well hopefully we'll keep the gaming companies away from your speed dial of spite later on.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
I must point this out. Victoria just posted a picture of Dax Exclamation Point, who is not dressed as Storm.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
She's dressed as Emma Frost.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Pretty nice.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
And for those that don't know, because I imagine there might be a lot of video game people that find this podcast that really don't know a lot about Drag Queens.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
The people in the comics.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Well that's true, but Dax Exclamation Point is a drag queen who is a big nerd.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
And specializes in Storm cosplay.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Like every iteration of Storm.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Mm-hmm.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
That bitch is done.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
And now she's busting out Emma Frost. It's like, we didn't expect that.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Alright.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It's okay.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
So, did you get to play any games on your trip when you were-

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I left my DS in the hotel room.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay, I was gonna say Disneyland has arcade games and-

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Not anymore.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Toy Story is-

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
We did Toy Story. I beat Dan.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh, that's important.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Because I had like a 47% accuracy and he had a 12.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Mm-hmm.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
Didn't they have a phone game at one point where like if your GPS showed that you were at Disney California Adventure in front of the ride or something, you got like a bonus unlock?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I seem to remember that was a thing.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
That-

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't know.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It was something. I played Ingress at Disneyland.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Of course.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
And-

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Because everything's a portal at Disneyland.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
There are a fuckload of portals. Oh my god.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
And then, um-

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Just think of all the Pokemon you'll be able to get there soon when Pokemon GO comes out.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I know.

04:06.000 --> 04:18.000
Um, and then, um, I did play some Animal Crossing and then I actually have beat Danganronpa and I'm on Danganronpa 2 or as it was in Japan, Super Danganronpa 2.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, don't give away your gaming week just yet.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
We gotta, we gotta still introduce-

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, I forgot.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Over here.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
She's just-

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
After a couple weeks off, you kind of forgot how this show works. That's okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Alright. No one can see my favorite accessory now.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Your new fan that you have.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Uh, you, uh, you do remember we take calls and everything at the end of the show, right?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
You do emails? Do you remember that you read emails?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Who does email anymore?

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
So, 2002.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Alright, say hello everybody over there to Tech Master Loki.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Hello.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
How are you doing?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Fine.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Hello.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Um, I don't know. Angry?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Angry? What's wrong? Did I, did I, did I anger you?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
No, you didn't anger me.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh, good.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
The world angered me.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
The world?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I was in a perfectly good mood leaving my house.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Are you mad about the Mighty No. 9 thing? I mean, people should be used to this by now, right?

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
Oh, I'm talking about, like, I decided, because, you know, I have a Gear VR.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Uh-huh.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
And Minecraft came out for, you know, the Gear VR.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Uh-huh.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Minecraft requires a Bluetooth controller.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Okay.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
That should be pretty simple to get, considering that, you know, they're pushing those Gear VRs.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
There's a ton of them out there now.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
I mean, they were including them with all the pre-orders for the Galaxy S7, the S, you know, S6.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's been available for a while and all that stuff.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
And you would think, you know, a major game like Minecraft that requires a controller.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Those are pretty plentiful out there.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Nobody fucking has a goddamn fucking controller!

05:45.000 --> 05:55.000
Even goddamn Best Buy, which, I swear to God, they have, like, a section for, like, they have a million fucking cases and headphones.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
But they have one fucking controller for iOS.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That does me no fucking good.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Same with fucking Target.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
One fucking controller.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
I go to fucking Game Software damn controller, because they carry iPads and bullshit like that all the time.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
But no!

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
We don't carry fucking controllers to our goddamn store.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But you could go online and order one from our website.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm like, if I'm going fucking online to order one, I'm not ordering from your fucking website.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Try to warn me before you do that next time.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
I literally just had to move your volume meter down, like, halfway.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm feeling the heat.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'll have to fix that in post-production.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
So yes, I haven't found a controller yet, because no one fucking carries goddamn Bluetooth controllers for fucking Android.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
It's a Bluetooth fucking universal goddamn format.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
But oh, fuck me, you can't possibly make a goddamn controller for an Android system.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
You know, because there's no fucking Android devices out there ever.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
What about, like, Amazon?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I want to go to a fucking store and pick it up.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
If I wanted to order it online, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
But these are electronic stores that should fucking have electronics.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
This is what happens when you close every Radio Shack.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
They have, like, Gear V. They sell fucking Gear VRs there.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
It's like, I mean, I don't understand what the point is.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Let's have them do the order for you.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Over at our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Because as you tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vog.network.com.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
And in our chatroom, people just saying, you're not looking hard enough.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Target is a big answer.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Bullshit. I went to all the Targets in the area.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
They each had the same fucking controller for iOS.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Not compatible with the fucking Android.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Huh. Interesting.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I went to Walmarts. They did not have them there either.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
The only place I have not been is Fry's yet.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Alright. So, Loki clapbacking.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah. Yes, he did check at Target.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Interesting.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Wow.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
So, you've gone to every, you can't find a stinking controller.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
That is a little weird. I would have gone online at this point.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Although, I understand the frustration that sometimes you want it now.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
So, huh.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
And then, you know, older Bluetooth controllers do not pair my phone.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Because I'm a Galaxy S6.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
They're different now.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Like, I have an old Moga controller that used to pair my old Galaxy S2.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It does not work on this controller anymore.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Or at least, take that back.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
It doesn't work for anything that's not using their app.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
I want something generic that just, okay, it's a Bluetooth controller.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
It pairs with the phone. Done. That's it.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Some folks in chat suggesting an Ouya controller?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Okay. The controller's a fucking shit.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So, I'm not gonna buy one.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
It's still gotta be a somewhat decent controller, right?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
They have, like, a SteelSeries controller that just came out.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
The one that they had at Best Buy was the SteelSeries XL.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
But it's for iOS.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm like, why is a Bluetooth controller fucking operating system dependent?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It's Bluetooth. It's a fucking format.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Bluetooth devices sync to all things except Bluetooth.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
But for some reason, they locked it down. Thank you very much, Apple.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Alright, well, check the chat.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Because some of the chatters have some ideas for you there.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
But I don't know if they're gonna help with the local stuff.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Which, apparently, there is a drought in California, not just water.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah, see, the Moga controllers have a switch.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, the new Moga controllers do. I have the old one.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
The old one does not have a switch.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
If it was the old one or the new one, yeah, I'd be...

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I can fucking flip a switch and we're good to go.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
But that's the thing. It's like, those controllers have been out forever.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Nobody carries them. Nobody.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
It's like, come on. I mean, you would think you would have, like, a controller.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
You're selling these devices that, you know, are for gaming and stuff.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I mean, what the hell do you think you're gonna control the Gear VR with?

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
It seems like it's a big thing. It's like you think, hmm.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
People are probably gonna be a little bit excited about Minecraft on the Gear VR.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
That's a pretty major game.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
But fuck if you can actually play it because there's no controllers.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
We don't sell them in our stores.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm kind of surprised you can't use, like, an Xbox One controller.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
You can't sync a PlayStation... I wanted to sync a PlayStation 4 DualShock.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You can't do it unless I root my phone.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Huh. Well.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Sadly, online may end up being faster than hunting in person.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Especially if you've torn up most of the shows.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That's stupid.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
No, I know, I know. It's weird. A little weird.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Alright, well anyway, whew. You're very upset over there.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Alright, well hopefully you're able to calm down a little bit.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Can we get into the news and our gaming weeks and all that stuff.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, and then stupid, you know.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
What is it? Gym Boys over here has to be closed.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
That was Craig and Taco.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
So we're all...

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
We're way out of the way for Gym Boys.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm like, ah, you fucking kidding me.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
All Loki wanted to feel better was the Taco.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And then, turns out, by the way, it didn't just close.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
It closed like six months ago.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, I don't drive that way, so, you know, how am I supposed to know?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Stoppy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
The World vs. Loki.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
That's how it feels this week, right, Loki?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
The World vs. Loki.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Alright, anyhow, our kickoff topic tonight.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I want to say a very happy Mother's Day.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
To all the gaming moms out there who might be listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
And, of course, mom type figures as well and pet mommies and kid mommies

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
and anybody who might be a mother in any sort of way.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
A big happy Mother's Day to ya.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
And I thought maybe we could talk briefly a little bit here at the top of the show before we get into the gaming weeks.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Maybe a memory about maybe how our mom might have influenced our gaming ways

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
or maybe a particular gaming memory that we might have, including our mom.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
DarkSakura, I know you've got to have some stories about your mom.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh, lord. So, I get a Nintendo from my dad.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
NES. Gray gun, mind you, because the gray one was the better one.

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
Get it home. I go to school, I come home, and my mom is trying to beat Super Mario Brothers.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm like, Mama, that's mine. It's in my house.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
Technically, it's in Grandmom's house. Shut up. How do you do this one?

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
I love that even as a child, you're pulling technicalities on your mother.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
That is so you. That is so you.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
My favorite was the one where you threatened to call somebody on her and report her or something like that.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
No. When my mom tried to ground me and she took my TV, so I went and got it back.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
And she's like, I took that away from you for a reason. I was like, yeah, but you didn't buy it. It belongs to me.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
It was theft.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
That's right. No, one time I got paddled, and I told the teacher who was paddling me that I was going to call Child Protective Services.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
She didn't paddle me again.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
All right, so back to the gaming.

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
So, my mom was really, really good at Super Mario Brothers, and I had Dr. Mario, and she got really good at that.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
So just be like, I'd come home from school, and if Mom wasn't working, she'd be like in my bedroom playing my Nintendo.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
I was like, Mama? So one year she comes like, I'm going to get your brothers a present.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Now, you think they'd want a Genesis or a Super Nintendo?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
They want a Super Nintendo.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And you ain't just saying that because you won't play it, right?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
No.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
So she got the Super Nintendo, and guess who played it? Me.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Guess whose bedroom it was set up in? Mine.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So, yep.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
That was my Super Nintendo.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Awesome.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
And then when they moved to Arizona, they took it with them, and I was like, fuck.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
So, I go to Arizona to visit my mom, and my grandmom, poor grandmom, she pulled out her back.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
She was lying in bed, and here I am with the volume way down trying to beat Link to the Past again.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
So, Mom's like, you're going to wake up Grandmom.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I was like, no, I'm not. She's asleep.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Grandmom's like, I like the music.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
That was before Grandmom died.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
So, Grandmom would just be like, I have no idea what you're doing, but I like the music in it. That's pretty.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
And that was it.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
That's good, though, a fondness for the video game music.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
There are some great composings that are in 8-bit games.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I mean, everybody knows the Mario Brothers theme, the Zelda theme, the Metroid theme.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I mean, a lot of that stuff is legendary.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Awesome. Well, thank you for sharing.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
My pleasure.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Okay, so I've called my mom here on OLR before. I'm not going to do it today, sorry.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
I already called her earlier today, but some folks have been listening to OLR for a long time.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
I know my mom is pretty hilarious when it comes to video games, especially the stuff that's very violent and over the top.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
She just thinks it's disgusting, but she's laughing while she's saying it.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
That's so gross, you know, type of thing.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
But, yeah, I remember my mom was not a big fan of me playing video games all the time,

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
but I think she kind of got it that video games were what I did to kind of stay out of trouble sort of thing.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
So she always kind of had a love-hate relationship, I think, with it.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
But I know sometimes I would have to actually play video games in her bedroom because we had two TVs in the house.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
We had the one in the living room, and she got one in her bedroom.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
So I didn't get a TV in my room, and at the time we had like a Commodore 64 setup,

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
and that was before I was probably still too young to realize that I could have probably hooked up the Nintendo to the Commodore 64 monitor,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
because I did that years later when I figured that out, but at that time I didn't realize that.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
So if I wanted to play Nintendo, I had to do it in my mom's bedroom.

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
Or actually, the memory I really have is with the Atari 2600, and I remember my dad was like,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
you can't play on the TV because I want to watch, he's trying to watch PBS or something, I don't know.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
And so I ended up, my mom let me play in her room, and she's just kind of watching,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
and she's like, she just kind of has like that look of confusion on her face, like I don't get it.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
What do you do? What is that? What are you doing? Why is this fun? Isn't this boring?

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Like she's just kind of like, kind of judging it, but yet she's still just kind of sitting in her chair watching,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
like she doesn't get up or go do anything else, she's just kind of watching like,

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
I don't get it yet, I can't stop watching you controlling, I think I was probably playing Pac-Man or Spider-Man,

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
or one of those old Atari 2600 games, and I remember that.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
But the other one that I definitely remember playing with my mom, because she would get into this,

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
is that on the Commodore 64, I used to have a ton of game show influenced games,

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
like Wheel of Fortune, Family Feud, Jeopardy, God what else,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
Classic Concentration, like pretty much any game show, because I loved game shows as a kid, and I really still do,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
and so when they made game shows into video games, I was like, hey, two worlds colliding.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
So I remember she used to play Family Feud with me, and that was fun,

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
is that she would play and give me the answers, and then she would,

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
when something wasn't up on the board and she got a strike or something, she's like,

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
oh come on, what are you talking, oh come on, Rob, the computer's cheating, Rob,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
how does it know all, it just knows all the answers, how do you know it's not just,

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
how do you know it's not stacked against you, Rob, how do you know it's not just telling you the right answer,

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
so it beats you every time, Rob. So, you know, she got a little upset that she would lose all the time.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
And there was some trivia game that we used to play a lot on the Commodore 64,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
I don't remember the name of it unfortunately, because trivia games I'm sure were a dime a dozen,

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
but it was a very, you know, you remember in the 80s, Trivial Pursuit was all the rage,

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
so of course they tried to make knockoffs on Commodore 64, so we had one of them,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
and we used to play that game too, and she would also get mad when she got the wrong answers in that.

17:45.000 --> 17:54.000
There was one I used to play on the Apple IIe, that it would like tell you congratulations on the most outdated,

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
outdated methods, like 21 Skidoo, or Wowie Zowie, and all this other stuff,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I don't remember what the game was called though, but you made me think of it.

18:03.000 --> 18:12.000
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I see Ziba quoting an earlier phone call from my mom,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Rob, that's gross, or no, that was when I was filming her watching me play Mortal Kombat.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Moms react to Mortal Kombat, and she was not enjoying that very much.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt says, my mom also had a love-hate relationship with it when I was a kid.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Sometimes she'll be watching me play, other times she's throwing out my games for doing poorly in school.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Oh yeah, definitely, I always, well the Nintendo was a reward for me getting straight A's to begin with,

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
so, and then my grades all went downhill from there, just kidding, maybe.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
Stopy in chat says, the same confusion I have when my nephew plays Minecraft is probably the same my parents had

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
when they saw me play on NES.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
Perhaps, I mean, I kind of get Minecraft now, but I am very surprised that kids enjoy Minecraft.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm always, I always kind of feel like Minecraft might have a lot more depth,

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
but I'm always amazed that kids, like, are super into Minecraft, it's like, no joke.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
A lot of kids that play games are playing the crap out of Minecraft.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
You know, a couple months ago on the show at this point now, we had Julian, who knew more about Minecraft than I did.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
That kid.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm telling you, he's taking over.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
And Pirate101.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
He's taking over the show when I finally retire.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Alright, Loki, do you have a memory?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
No.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
No?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I do not.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Does your mom never support your video game habit, or what?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
She's kind of neutral, so.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Neutral?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yep.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
She never got involved, never played anything?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Never played anything.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Really?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Alright.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
She just kind of, kind of kept a watchful eye from a distance, I suppose.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Does your dad, your dad got into it though, right?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
I still remember you.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
He says he wasn't into video games, but he's the one that bought all the fucking video games, so I don't believe that for a second.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
I don't know, we went to the video game world championship.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Oh yeah.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
No, not video game world championship, it was Nintendo World or something like that?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
In 1990?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Nintendo World?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah, in Oakland.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
So they took me to that.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
That's cool.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
But, I don't know, not really playing any games or anything.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't remember anything in particular.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
My dad would take me to see those video game movies.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Like, he took me to see The Wizard.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
He took me to see, well I guess it's not really a video game, but he took me to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
By the time Mortal Kombat was out, I was old enough to go by myself.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
I didn't really have my dad, but I'm trying to think of other video game movies from when I was younger.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Because Super Mario Brothers I never did see.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
And I guess I made the right call.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
I never saw that movie, and it sounds by every practical purpose that was the right call to not bother with that.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
So, hmm.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Anyway.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
S2 and Hunter Matt says, Loki's mom kept her distance to avoid his young Loki rants.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Were you the type that would throw the controller across the room, Loki?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
No.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
No?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Dan did that once.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Did he?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
He crushed a Playstation controller with his bare hands.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh my god.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Put it back in the box and returned it.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
That's not nice.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
No, he was like 19.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Oh, well, still, not nice.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Alright.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Let's see.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
One more comment here from the chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.

21:09.000 --> 21:17.000
Sky, did you do the thing where you waited till your parents were sleeping, then you'd turn on the TV and console and continue playing your video games?

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
Probably more often when I had that in my room.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
But by that point, the Game Boy was out.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
And that was the one that, you know, they really couldn't stop me from playing, was the Game Boy.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
Although, you might remember with the original Game Boy, there was no backlight or anything.

21:36.000 --> 21:48.000
So you had to have the lights on to be able to play Game Boy, or they sold those crappy little clips that would like go on top of the Game Boy and it was a screen magnifier slash light.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Remember those crappy little things?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I had that.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
So I had one of those, but it was still really hard to play in the pitch dark.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
For him not being into video games, he sure bought me a lot of stuff, including obscure systems like the Atari Lynx.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:12.000
Well, my dad was super into tech, so I think sometimes he liked to buy that stuff just because I think, in a way, he was enabling me.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And I think that's what he wanted to do.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Maybe.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
Like, the Commodore 64 was always intended as a family thing, but I used that thing way more than anybody else.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
He got it granted when it came down to, you know, he wanted to do a spreadsheet or something.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
He had his programs that he used.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
He was into genealogy for a long time.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
He got more into that after he retired, but he was into it a while ago and he had those programs on Commodore 64 as well.

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
But then, like, I remember there were some of them that he would, like, I knew how to use them better than him, so he would just tell me what to do.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
So, anyway.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Alright, hope you guys enjoyed some of those memories.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Let's see, some comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
SSG100Matt says, my mom would sneak into my room in the middle of the night to play Mario Brothers and Tetris.

22:59.000 --> 23:09.000
TigerKlaw says, I remember times I played a video game till it was very late at night, which caused you to lose a few hours of sleep, and then you feeling all drowsy in school.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
Oh, I'm sure video games have caused me to have problems in school from staying up too late.

23:15.000 --> 23:28.000
Even though my mom was usually pretty good at keeping a watchful eye on it, sometimes she would slack off and, yeah, I would end up playing the video game for a very, very, very long time.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Excuse me.

23:31.000 --> 23:43.000
Sorry guys, you might remember on last week's show I was a little bit sick, and the good news is I'm mostly over it, but Radio Guy's worst fear is having a coughing fit, so sorry about that.

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
Anyway, we're going to now get into how is your gaming week and talk a little bit about the video games we've been playing this week, the new stuff, and then we'll get into the news as well for the week.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
So Dark Sakura, I know you started to get into it a little bit a minute ago, but how else was your gaming week?

23:59.000 --> 24:16.000
It was really just mostly Danganronpa 2 and some Animal Crossing and Ingress, and R-Type, I played some R-Type, and we're still going through Shovel Knight, Dan and I are.

24:17.000 --> 24:32.000
Finished Twilight Princess HD, which was pretty cool. The ending, of course, always makes me cry, and, um, did I say Ingress? Because I'm going to say Ingress again, because I just feel like I've been doing nothing to play that, and Heroes of Dragon Age.

24:32.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh, and of course, Miitomo, because I'm still checking every day, because I have a few people who are just absolutely fascinating to chat with for their questions, so I've just been using these as, like, chat rooms. It's pretty funny.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
Well, but you can't really do, like, live chat or anything, you know, you can't provide the questions that are going to be asked or anything.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
You just ignore the topic. Go off on your own subject.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Oh, you mean in the little responses?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh, okay, I got you.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
You don't have to stay on topic.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah, no, you're right, because, like, there was even one where we were going back and forth on it a little bit.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:08.000 --> 25:16.000
Oh, you said, the best day of my life was when you moved to California, and I replied and put, and the second best day was when you met me.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I said, girl, you know it.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
And then we were going back and forth with Drag Queen references from Trixie and Katya, our mothers.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
That's it. I wonder if we could just write them and say, hey, we're not exactly doing drag, but be our moms anyway.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Actually, I hear that they're a little sick of being called that, but anyway.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Really?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
That's for another day. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so anything else with your game a week?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Um, no.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Nope. All right.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
I wish that there was a game that would reward me with pie.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
A game that would reward you with pie?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Real pie.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Real pie.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Like, oh, you've beaten the game, and then, ding dong, here's your pie.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
Here's a coupon for a pie, or maybe an MMO where you can type slash pie to order pie.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
But dude, they don't have a pie delivery service, and pizza pie doesn't count.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
But there's a takeout taxi or whatever they call it out here where you can get Cheesecake Factory to deliver.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Oh, hey.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I know, right?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
None of that stuff delivers all the way out here where I live, though.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
You know, well, I live in, well, you know where I live.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Yeah, further away.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
In the boons.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
They're not quite boons.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
There's chain restaurants out there, though. I'm sure you don't have a problem.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah, but we don't have the Cheesecake Factory.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
But we do have a Sally's.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
And then I can just, like, wear so much makeup that I can't move my face, and so I can't eat the pie.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
So it won't matter as much.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
All right.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
I didn't play a whole ton. I just mainly played Enter the Gungeon, and...

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
You keep meaning to buy that, and I keep forgetting.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
I did purchase, even though I'm not really sure if I really wanted all the games, but...

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
I did purchase that Nintendo Humble Bundle, so I have more things on the Wii U at least.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
It looked okay. I mean, we'll have to try some of those.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
But it was inexpensive.

27:11.000 --> 27:18.000
And I've been trying to hold off on buying other games, because they do have Deadpool on sale right now, and...

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I may want to pick that up.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Trying to behave.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
It's just like, I don't want to buy it, because I'm not going to play it.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Maybe I'll just wait for more stuff to come out.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
The first level of it? Like, after you leave his house?

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
It's funny, but the camera's really screwed up in it.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I watched all the cutscenes already, so, you know.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Well, there you go.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
It looks like a funny game, but yeah.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
I do like the air guitar in the elevator.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
That was it.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
For my gaming week, I guess piggybacking off what Loki was talking about,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
I also bought that Humble Nintendo Bundle, which, reminder to our live audience at least,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I think it's over tomorrow morning.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
So by the time most of you hear the podcast, unfortunately, that Nintendo Bundle's probably done.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I don't know if one of you can check the timer on that.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
But for those of you listening live, if you haven't got it yet, that Nintendo Humble Bundle is still going.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
It is a pretty good deal.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
You know, again, it's not Nintendo titles, but it's some indie stuff that's really worth checking out.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
And I actually did spend a bit of time playing one of the games in the bundle this week

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
because I didn't really realize it was there until I bought it.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And I was like, oh, this game! Oh my God!

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Like, I wanted to get this game and I never did.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
And that is Rhythm Thief on 3DS because that is, you know, it's a music game

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
and, you know, I always am going to have a soft spot for those.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
So yeah, if you didn't realize, Rhythm Thief, the full version for 3DS by Sega,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
which kind of unfortunately came and went.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
You know, I remember when it came out and then I don't know how well it sold.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
So here's a great second chance to go back and check it out because, you know,

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
they have a lot of like 3D movies and animations

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
and there's a whole story that goes behind it between the little dancing scenes.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
And it's kind of like silly, cheesy, but fun.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
So, you know, especially for the price with this whole bundle thing,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
I mean, check it out just for Rhythm Thief if nothing else.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
So yeah, I was playing a bit of that.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Which, how would I describe how it plays?

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
It uses the touch pad so like when you want to go like down or do a twirl or left or right.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
You kind of just trace the motions.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
But I wouldn't say it's like Elite Beat Agents either.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
It's kind of a little more like a combination of maybe like Space Channel 5,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
but instead of just 2 or whatever, you're drawing the directions.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
I would say maybe that's the closest thing I can think of.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Which makes sense because they're both Sega.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
So there you go.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
So yeah, check out Rhythm Thief if nothing else.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But there's other stuff in the bundle too that I'm looking forward to getting to play.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
So yeah, again, if you haven't picked up the bundle yet,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I would really urge you to.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
But unfortunately, by the time you hear the podcast, it may be too late.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
So sorry, hope you didn't make an angry face because you just realized you missed it.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
But maybe there'll be another bundle worth your time or something. Who knows?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I wish they would do more of those for console games.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Yeah.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Like Sony would be nice.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah, well, you know, I don't...

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I mean, they do really good deals on there.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Here's the thing, though, is that you do have to realize the game makers have to make money as well.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
And I don't know how much they make off these bundles,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
especially if you have a lot of people that donate a lot of the money to charity.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Which is great. I mean, not that charity is a bad thing,

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
but the game makers do have to profit off their games or they're not going to be able to pay their employees.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I think a lot of these games have been out for a while.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
And it doesn't matter any profit you're making off of it at this point because it's digital.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah, and that's where I'm like, okay, well, usually by the time these games end up in a bundle,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
it's like round two or round three even, especially with a game like Rhythm Thief.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Like Rhythm Thief had come and gone.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
And they had Super Street Fighter IV, which was like a launch title.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
Yeah, that's true. Oh, I forgot. I actually didn't pay enough to get that.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
No, I didn't either because I was like, I don't have a 3DS and it was Darksiders II.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
And I was like, eh, I've already got this on a few different platforms.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, I think I have it on Steam already and I was like, eh, I don't really need it on Wii U.

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
And I already have Super Street Fighter II because that was actually one of the launch titles I bought.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
So there you go. Or Street Fighter II. Street Fighter IV, hello.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Okay, so other games that I played this week besides Rhythm Thief.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
I've been continuing on with Diablo III because season six started.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
I'm already like Paragon 60 or something because once you start getting your set pieces rolling in, man,

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
I'm playing a Demon Hunter and I can just tear through things now on like Torment V and the XP just starts rolling in.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
I can probably actually do Torment VI at this point. I might try to do some of that a little bit tonight.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
Still continuing with Final Fantasy XIV as well. I play Ingress like these other nerds here too.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
I went on a little trip yesterday to go visit a friend and get some portals in a new area.

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
And then also I was playing the Overwatch Beta. It was kind of a big deal this weekend.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
If you haven't checked out the Overwatch Beta, time is just about out.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
Again, podcast feed, you're not going to be able to get to it. Live listeners, you can download it tonight and play for a few hours,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
but it's done at 10 a.m. tomorrow. And at that point you're going to have to buy the game.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
So, okay, so the Overwatch Beta. I have kind of mixed feelings on it.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
I really don't think it's a bad game at all. In fact, I think for what it is, it's extremely well polished.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
It's like you're playing a game like Team Fortress 2, obviously.

32:19.000 --> 32:25.000
When I'm playing a character like Mercy, it's like you are playing the medic from Team Fortress 2 pretty much without the invincibility thing.

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
I mean, that's really all it is. But there's such a coat of polish on it.

32:31.000 --> 32:38.000
It's like you're watching a movie. I mean, the characters are phenomenal and so well-rounded.

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
Blizzard really excels at character design, I think. And that's how they're able to have a game like Heroes of the Storm that does a lot of this too.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
And the characters are so memorable, they put them in more than one game.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
So do they have any of the Overwatch characters come in the Heroes of the Storm?

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
Tracer is either arriving or has just arrived. I think Tracer was out in the past couple weeks or so.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
And I'm sure she will not be the last. I'm sure many of these Overwatch characters will cross over in Heroes of the Storm.

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
Like Winston, the ape with the glasses. Oh, come on. It's only a matter of time. He'll be the next one for sure.

33:11.000 --> 33:20.000
I mean, some of these characters are already iconic. I have a lot of friends who love D.Va, the girl with the tank.

33:20.000 --> 33:27.000
The mech. Excuse me, she has the mech. Mei is great as well. Does the giant ice walls.

33:27.000 --> 33:34.000
I love Mercy and I love Symmetra. That's why I like to play. In fact, in one of the matches I was playing with my friends, we did double Symmetra.

33:34.000 --> 33:42.000
So Symmetra just puts turrets everywhere. That's all she does. So we were defending and so myself and it was Extrovert's partner Matt were both playing Symmetra.

33:42.000 --> 33:49.000
And we just both loaded up each side with turrets. And as people would try to run in, they'd just get fried by the turrets. It was hilarious.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
And so when I was playing with friends, I was actually having a really good time.

33:54.000 --> 34:03.000
Here's where I see the problem is. Overwatch, I feel like, is going to be one of those games that for the first couple weeks when everybody's playing it will be a lot of fun.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
And then dead because my friends will have moved on to something else because we all have gamer ADD.

34:09.000 --> 34:20.000
And then it's like, oh, well, I could play with strangers, which I'm not really into doing. I could do the AI thing, which is okay, but there's no single player mode.

34:20.000 --> 34:32.000
And I really think a game like Overwatch that is so focused on the character design and has developed these movies and things that they're just putting out on YouTube and putting out in other places.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
And doing these movie things for like a Coke sponsored thing that's going to be in theaters and all this stuff.

34:37.000 --> 34:45.000
Like, I'm really surprised they didn't take time to flesh some of that out into a single player mode because it could have been epic.

34:45.000 --> 34:54.000
I mean, even if it was just kind of like generic arena matches against the CPU that would reward you with really great cut scenes and things like I wish they had at least done that.

34:54.000 --> 35:04.000
If nothing else, I really think the potentialness of what I'm looking for in a game like Overwatch really suffers because there is no single player mode.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
And it makes me not really want to drop $60 on it for two weeks of thrill.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
And I kind of got into this on Twitter and some people are saying like, you know, games don't have to have the single player mode.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
And I'm like, you're right, they don't.

35:19.000 --> 35:27.000
I always worry about multiplayer games like that too that are multiplayer only because you're reliant on a server to be there.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
And who's to say that, oh, we're just going to pull the servers for this eventually?

35:33.000 --> 35:40.000
That's a good point although Blizzard I would say is a little more reliable than say EA in that capacity.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
I mean, Blizzard is still supporting Diablo 2 for fuck's sake with a patch.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
So I trust Blizzard more than I would trust other companies to keep that going for a long time.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
I'll give them that.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So I'm not going to penalize them on that point.

35:51.000 --> 35:59.000
But I just, you know, I don't get that same thrill out of playing online against strangers that some people do.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
And I recognize that.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
And so again, I can't look at Overwatch and go, it's a bad game. It's not.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
I think it's going to have huge esports followings and people are going to get a real kick out of it.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But I can also look at it and go, eh, it's probably not for me.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
Heroes of the Storm, I'm really, really, really surprised they did not go for the Heroes of the Storm model with it.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.000
Where the game would be free and you would have rotating characters but have to pay for some characters and some of this.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
I'm really, really shocked because I think it would have made it last more with some of my friends if it was like a free thing.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
That it's like, you know, oh, well it's free. Just come on and sign up and play.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
Oh, I know the other thing that hurts it too in the whole trying to line up and play with my friends.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC are not cross platform.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And that's a problem.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
I'm going to have some friends that get it on PS4.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I'm going to have some that get it on PC and some that get it on Xbox One.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
And if, you know, either I have to buy all three to play with everybody, which I'm sorry is not going to happen.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Or, you know, I kind of have to make a choice and then some of my friends I just don't get to play with.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
So I really wish they had considered cross platform with it.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
I do understand, just before somebody, you know, corrects me on it in chat.

37:06.000 --> 37:16.000
I understand there was some talk and some feedback that it was felt that PC players because of keyboard and mouse had an advantage over PlayStation.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
And so I suppose, you know, I can understand that.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
I still wish there had been a choice that maybe, like, you can cross platform with friends if you want to.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Well, then support keyboard and mouse.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, on PlayStation 4, yeah.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I mean, how hard is that?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
It's not. You can do it on Final Fantasy XIV on PS4.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh, it's unfair. Well, then support keyboard and mouse.

37:38.000 --> 37:45.000
I don't really understand why you can't support keyboard and mouse anyways for pretty much anything. I think that would be great.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
Alright, I'm finally looking over in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

37:51.000 --> 37:59.000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, I played with someone that used D.Va and unlocked the Is This Easy mode taunt and used it in every single round.

37:59.000 --> 38:09.000
Let's see, also we have Dungeon Buster who says, it's a nice slice of the game and I enjoyed what I played but I'm not really into multiplayer only games.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Tiger Claw says, Overwatch will be one of those games you will hear a lot in esports.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
ActDef says, you're asking too much for something like a game like Overwatch.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
But that's the difference between Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch. Team Fortress 2 offered the same for cheaper years ago.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
I could say the same for Splatoon kinda and Splatoon offered a single player campaign.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Yeah, and that's kind of been my answer.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
Can you imagine if they did an orange box or whatever of Blizzard stuff?

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
Hey, we're gonna throw in some Starcraft 2, we're gonna have Diablo 3, Overwatch, and hell, we'll throw in some World of Warcraft.

38:43.000 --> 38:53.000
Here's the thing though, and don't hear me wrong, Team Fortress 2 is awesome and has its own things that make it great.

38:53.000 --> 39:02.000
But it is an aging game. Overwatch does take the Team Fortress thing and really pushes it to the next level with, I would say, better characters than Team Fortress 2.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
And yet I acknowledge Team Fortress 2 had great character design. Overwatch is actually better.

39:08.000 --> 39:18.000
It's a great game. Too bad that Valve's unable to make third games in series, so we're not gonna get any more Team Fortress games.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
And the lack of single player thing in Team Fortress 2 didn't bother me. Why? Because it was free.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
And it was very easy to just, you know, oh it's free, I'll download this on a Friday night.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
And even when it wasn't, it was in the orange box, which was an incredible deal anyways.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
That's very true. Very, very true. Let's see, other comments from chat.

39:36.000 --> 39:45.000
Stoppy in chat says, I'm not interested in Overwatch as a MOBA, but as a story driven campaign, I'd be all over that like spray tan on Trump.

39:45.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, that's pretty good. I feel very similar. I think I would have preordered that today if it had had a single player campaign.

39:54.000 --> 40:01.000
Interesting, also Dungeon Busters says, Quake 3 was fun back in the day, but the mods made it worth playing in the long term for me.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Oh, and that's something you won't have in Overwatch, is mods.

40:04.000 --> 40:14.000
You're not really gonna be able to do that on console, and I'm sure through the whole Battle.net front end and all that, you're not gonna be able to do that on PC either, because it's always online basically.

40:15.000 --> 40:25.000
Interesting. Let's see, also Kaijuto says, I've been playing the Overwatch beta. I'm 50-50 with it. It looks cool and it has some fun characters, but the modes are gonna get old fast.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
They don't have enough content for a $60 game. It should be $40.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Alright, there you go. That was my thoughts on Overwatch.

40:34.000 --> 40:41.000
Again, it's hard because I look at it and I go, this game is like fucking awesome, but it's just not what I'm looking for.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
It's tough, it's tough. Anyway, some housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
Follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio. We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

40:54.000 --> 41:02.000
And that's really all I got for right now. I don't know of any special events or anything coming up that we're doing.

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
Dragon Con is months and months away. I should mention this, because this is fast approaching.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
Bobby Blackwolf is going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo that's going to be in Atlanta.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
And VOG Networks is actually going to be a sponsor of this.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
And it's going to be from June 10th through 12th this year in the Atlanta area.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm trying to remember exactly where it's at. It's not one of the downtown places that I'm used to.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
It's the Renaissance Atlanta Waverly is where it's going to be at.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
And you can check that. That's a lot like, it sounds like the more and more I read about the Southern Fried Game Room Expo,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
it sounds a lot like kind of what we have with California Extreme out here.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
There's a lot of similarities between that, where they have all the old school arcade games and a ballroom or a place.

41:45.000 --> 41:52.000
And they do some panels. They have some, you know, celebs from classic gaming history and so forth.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
That'll be fun. So check that out.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
Bobby points out it's the same weekend as Anime Weekend Atlanta.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Or, I'm sorry, same location, not same weekend. Sorry.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Apparently I'm still sick in some ways.

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
All right. Let's get into some gaming news for the week. We're going to start it off with Loki.

42:09.000 --> 42:17.000
So there's a rumor or at least another bit of a rumor that was going towards the Nintendo NX not having an optical drive.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
This is coming from, I guess, a report from a Japanese website called Moneylink.

42:23.000 --> 42:37.000
And they're talking about this company, Macronix, who manufactures ROM chips that are used in some of the different 3DS cartridges and that type of thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:46.000
And they're having a comment from the company saying that they're expecting that the ROM sales are going to increase in the latter half of the year.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
And we'll have a large growth potential because of this new console that's coming out in March.

42:51.000 --> 43:05.000
So it's kind of odd that if this is a console that's going to be using optical media that this company would be saying that they're expecting to have an increase in sales on these chips that are basically used for cartridges.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
If it's not going to be using these cartridges.

43:08.000 --> 43:16.000
To which I say, I don't care which format these things are on as long as I don't have to buy a proprietary memory card format.

43:16.000 --> 43:29.000
And maybe there are some advantages to them. Maybe they're faster than optical media. Maybe something like using solid state drives instead of actual platter drives or something like that.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
Maybe the fact they'll be harder to copy. Please.

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
I'm not saying they won't. I didn't say they won't be copyable. I just said they'll be harder to copy.

43:40.000 --> 43:50.000
It's not even an issue. That's the thing. Don't even bother with doing a proprietary format like that. It's not going to matter.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Seriously, it's not going to matter. People will find a way to copy it.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
I don't think that should be necessarily the issue.

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
My thing is that I don't know if these are going to be more expensive to manufacture because optical media is pretty damn cheap.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
I don't know why you wouldn't use it, but I'm sure they have a reason for it.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
Maybe because this system is smaller and so fitting a disk drive onto like...

44:15.000 --> 44:27.000
Let's assume for a minute here that we're talking about a system that's basically going to look like the Wii U gamepad, but it's its own thing and has its own processor in it and you can take it with you.

44:27.000 --> 44:37.000
Having an optical drive in that would probably not make much sense because it would eat up the fuck of the battery and also, you know, it's going to be huge.

44:37.000 --> 44:44.000
So it makes sense to have like a little cartridge thing, kind of like the Vita does, you know, for their games.

44:44.000 --> 44:53.000
But obviously it's going to need to be some sort of high capacity format because the games that are going to be on this are probably going to be much larger than a couple gigabytes.

44:53.000 --> 44:59.000
They're going to be, you know, tens of gigabytes. So we'll see.

44:59.000 --> 45:11.000
I thought maybe part of the reason they're going to get rid of the optical drive is so that they just have download only and make the move completely to digital.

45:11.000 --> 45:19.000
Which I realize is highly controversial, but would not be the first time this rumor has come up either.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
I don't know. I don't think that's a good idea.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
I don't think it's a good idea either. I still think it's a little soon.

45:26.000 --> 45:35.000
Because here's the thing with download only, you're basically, you have to figure, okay, who's selling these consoles?

45:35.000 --> 45:43.000
Retailers are selling these consoles. If you don't have anything for them to sell, they're going to say, fuck you, we aren't selling your console because they're not making any money off that console.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.000
They're making money off the software and what, are you going to sell them download codes?

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
Fuck that. I'm not going to go to the store to buy a download code. I'll just download it off the website or off of their storefront.

45:54.000 --> 46:04.000
I'm not going to give Nintendo a pass or I wouldn't give Microsoft one when the Xbox one was first announced and that goes back to the whole equity in the game you buy and all that.

46:04.000 --> 46:10.000
You know what's funny? We were talking about moms and all that. I did call my mom for Mother's Day today and she said,

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
Oh, your old video games ought to be worth a ton of money, huh? All those old video games. I'm like, actually, mom, you sold a lot of my old video games in a garage sale for $3 a piece.

46:17.000 --> 46:25.000
She's like, Oh, well, too bad. Cause I guess she saw somewhere the old video games were selling now for a lot of money.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
Yeah, it depends on what they are, but she, she seemed to know enough where like certain ones were selling for a lot of money.

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
I don't think she, I think, I think she hears that like one is going for a lot of money. So clearly I must have owned that one.

46:37.000 --> 46:43.000
Yeah, because she, she just remembers she had to buy me every fucking game when I was a kid. So clearly I had that one game, right?

46:43.000 --> 46:49.000
But anyway, my point is, is that, you know, I, you know, should be able to hold, even with CD based media.

46:49.000 --> 46:57.000
Heck, if you were lucky enough to have a copy of sweet code and two or what, what the Castlevania on the symphony of the night on the Saturn or whatever the one for a ton of money.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
I mean, there's still what, uh, there's Saturn games that go for tons of money.

47:01.000 --> 47:11.000
You know, obviously with something like this is that you better make sure that the format that you're coming up with is going to be able to have the capacity to where that's not going to hinder the games that you're putting on it.

47:11.000 --> 47:19.000
You know, don't make it like the Xbox 360 where you have, you know, basically DVD format that you can only fit so much on there.

47:19.000 --> 47:28.000
You know, I'm assuming that these games are going to be bigger and stuff. Now we were talking like, you know, PlayStation four games and stuff for like 50 gigs, 60 gigs.

47:28.000 --> 47:39.000
I mean, so that's a lot to fit on a little cartridge. So, I mean, I'm, I'm expecting this to be, you know, to work out.

47:39.000 --> 47:47.000
I don't want this like, Oh yeah, fuck. We should have, you know, we really should have made it bigger, but we were fucking stupid.

47:47.000 --> 47:55.000
You know, I let's, let's hope not, but I, you know, you, you could fit a lot on a, on a cartridge these days, so we'll, we'll see.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
I mean, but of course, memory is, you know, going to have a price to it, but we'll see.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
I mean, again, this is all just fucking rumors until we have something official from Nintendo at some point.

48:05.000 --> 48:13.000
Um, but Akuma JP in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says no optical drive equals save energy, thinner console, less DOA.

48:14.000 --> 48:22.000
And yeah, I, I definitely see the advantage. I mean, some people bitch that the PlayStation four is too slow with some of the loading times and having this type of light.

48:22.000 --> 48:33.000
But, but, but with the optical, you know, thing not being there, it also doesn't, it kind of removes it from being like this universal device, you know, like for Blu-ray and that type of stuff.

48:33.000 --> 48:47.000
Well, I, how many, well, I don't know if I should say this, but I'm going to, how many people are still going to be using Blu-ray in five years as Netflix and all the digital stuff is more and more of our lives?

48:47.000 --> 48:58.000
I think a lot of people, because the, the bandwidth is still not such to where you can stream, you know, reliably like 4k or ultra HD content.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
That's fair.

48:59.000 --> 49:07.000
And, you know, especially with these devices, you know, going, you know, the Neo or whatever, pushing for this ultra HD, you know, content.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
I would think that you would want the media to support that as well.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
And I mean, maybe Nintendo realizes that, you know what, they're not going to be the only device in the living room.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
And if not having to license the Blu-ray stuff is going to save money on the console, then take a risk.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
That's not a good stance.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
I don't think that's a great stance at all.

49:22.000 --> 49:32.000
Because if you're, if you're, if you're booked, you know, basically guaranteeing that your console is going to be a secondary console, why are you gunning for second place?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I mean, seriously gunning for second place.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
That's where you got fucked on your fucking third party support.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Because fuck it.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
You know what?

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
If you want third party support, you'll have a PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
They can play the games that they can't run on the Wii U.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
How well did that work out for you, Nintendo?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Not very fucking well.

49:49.000 --> 49:59.000
I'm like half with you, but I still feel like, again, if Nintendo has this whole thing where the stuff that's on the drive can move to this portable unit.

49:59.000 --> 50:16.000
And if that whole rumor turns out to be true, there's this synergy between a portable unit and the thing that maybe there's something where a movie that you get on Netflix, or maybe Nintendo plans to do their own thing, would be not only good in the TV realm, but something you can take with you on the go.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
And maybe they're trying to do something that kind of competes with Blu-ray in that regard.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Well, here's what I want to see, okay?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
You know, right now...

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Ooh, wait, quickly, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Don't you remember when the 3DS was going to do movies?

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
It didn't end up doing it.

50:28.000 --> 50:35.000
But remember, at one time, Nintendo wanted, they were showing off at E3 one year, it was like Tangled or something was on the 3DS cartridges.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
No, it did do it a little bit.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
So, maybe Nintendo's going to compete with Blu-ray with this cartridge format.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah, but the...

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Tinfoil haddish, but I'm throwing it out there.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
The reason that was cool is because it was 3D movies.

50:47.000 --> 50:54.000
And that was pretty awesome, because it was like, ooh, cool, I can watch my 3D movies without having to wear the glasses and everything.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
So that's not a thing now, but...

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
I just think right now, we need to know more about the NX.

51:02.000 --> 51:07.000
And the fact that they're not talking about it, and they're not going to show it off at E3...

51:07.000 --> 51:13.000
Like, right now, my expectation is, you know, something like the Wii U, but it's basically a separate device.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
I need to know what the hook is going to be on this, because right now, I'm not that excited about it.

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
Alright. Let's see, going to the chat for some more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
Kaijuto says, Nintendo is going to have a video streaming app that runs Captain N 24x7.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
I'd be totally okay with that, actually.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
No, thank you.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I'd be totally okay with that.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
Hopefully it would also run old episodes of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I would totally be into that.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Newloser in our chatroom says, why would a manufacturer do this?

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
Optical storage is dirt cheap, and moving away from it would eat into their profit.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
Depends on the form factor of the device.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
Has Nintendo shown that they're willing to cut the price of the console by even 20 bucks by taking something out?

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
Like the whole, you know, when they took DVD playback out of that second Wii.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
But it's not about that at all.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
It's about, we don't know what the form factor of this device is going to be.

52:04.000 --> 52:10.000
If it's a handheld type of device, then you can't really put an optical drive in that.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I mean, I guess you could.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
I mean, you could put a laptop, you know, type drive.

52:15.000 --> 52:25.000
But to be honest, I mean, it's going to be better to have some sort of cartridge-based, or some sort of, you know, flash ROM-based storage medium.

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
AkumaJP in chat says, cartridge used to be expensive, less storage, but not in these days.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
That's right, that's a big part of the reason why everybody switched in the first place.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
But yeah, times have changed quite a bit.

52:35.000 --> 52:41.000
And then Rama in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, fuck it, the NX should use zip disks.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
Rest in peace to all those old zip disks.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Those things were beasts.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
Imagine what you could fit on something that size these days, though.

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
Something like, you know, depending on how much...

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
A hundred megabytes?

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
No, I mean like, take the same size and shape of a zip disk.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
How much could you put on something that size these days?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
I bet you could fit a ton.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
And those things were not extraordinarily big. That could be the new cartridge.

53:09.000 --> 53:19.000
But I still think if they're going cartridge, I have this funky feeling it's a cartridge that works on the NX for the TV, and it works on your portable NX.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
That it's that small where it does both.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
But we'll see.

53:22.000 --> 53:29.000
This is all just fucking speculating until Nintendo shuts us down, which I wish they'd do sooner rather than later.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
I really do.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Alright, let's move on, though. We got more stories to cover.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
Well, I still like Miitomo. There are still people who like Miitomo.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
I play it every day. I still play it every day, Dark Soccer.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I hate the fucking pinball thing.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
No, I'm not even going to call it pinball, because that's disrespecting pinball.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
It's more like Pachinko.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Yeah.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
It's more like Pachinko.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
It's more...

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Miitomo drop.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
It's more bullshit, is what it is.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
There's always something I want and I never get it, like the corndog hat, and it's bullshit.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
I've managed to get most of the stuff I've wanted out of it.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I've spent a little, but I've gotten it.

54:03.000 --> 54:10.000
In the gothic thing, the only thing I got in the gothic drop, besides candy, was a dress for my male...

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
See, you know what? I just wore the fucking dress.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
I don't give a fuck, because it's the only thing that I could win in the gothic drop.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
So I wore the gothic dress and some sunglasses, and I was like, this is my style.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
I won the poofy sailor dress schoolgirl uniform twice.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
That one was a bitch.

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
I tried to get the pants so I could go all boy style, and I couldn't get the slouchy pants, but so whatever.

54:32.000 --> 54:45.000
Anyway, so Miitomo is actually going to be getting an update soon, and in that update you will be able to add friends via email and quote other memes.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
The all answers thing is getting an improvement.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
They are doing adjustments for Mi photos, which Mi photo is like the most fun ever.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
I've just been having a field day with that, like taking real life pictures.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
You know the little area when you get off the Toy Story Mania?

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
I took a picture of that in a pano, and I've been using it for Mi photo.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
So it's been pretty cool.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Oh yeah, no, your Mi photos crack me up.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
I have some other friends, like Jonko, my buddy that was on Koopa Club when they were still around, rest in peace.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
He has some funny ones. He's used his comments and so forth.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
I'm not very good with the Mi photo stuff, but Alan does some really funny ones.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
He likes to do the really good captions. There's one of his characters that says,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I'm a disaster, and it's really funny.

55:29.000 --> 55:36.000
There's also, I've found that our buddy Rob K. in the UK does some really great ones.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
Oh yes, he posted one on Facebook that was hilarious.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
This is the Sakura Vicarian that was me serving tea.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Yeah, I should go, I should go, I should go. That was funny.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Anyway, sorry.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
So anyway, there are going to be the updates coming out.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
I'm trying to get a little bit more detail on it if this stupid thing will ever load.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
It was on a Nintendo blog.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
They pushed some of it to the game too.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
There's a little news item within the game, but I think you hit on the biggest stuff, really.

56:05.000 --> 56:13.000
Yeah, I just want to see the ability to, instead of having to have the extra Mi's saved,

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
I would like to be able to just pick whatever friend and add them to a Mi photo, things like that.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
But it would be neat. The Mi photo thing is really the most fun to me.

56:22.000 --> 56:28.000
Yeah, I am shocked, shocking myself with how frequently I use Mi Tomo.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
I still check it every day. Again, I treat it kind of like a social network, you know?

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
I think it's what it's intended to be, really. Like a combination of a game plus.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
I think it's a neat concept and I'm glad that it's sticking around.

56:41.000 --> 56:49.000
Congrats to Nintendo. I consider it successful, but I guess we'll see when their next earnings report comes in.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Because I haven't spent a dime on it, I'll tell you that.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
I play it every day and I haven't spent a goddamn dime and I'm not going,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Oh, did you spend money?

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
I did, because I like the outfits.

57:00.000 --> 57:06.000
Seriously, right now, every day I've been signing in, it gives me a thousand coins.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
Or it gives me some huge prize because it's like, we're celebrating 10 million users worldwide.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
And I thought I would get that once. I swear to God, I've gotten that pop-up like every day in May.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
And it's like, here's 2,000 coins, here's 5 gameplay tickets.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
It's been a big reward every day.

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
I haven't spent a lot on it, but I've done just enough when I wanted the 7-layer kimono when that came out.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
Hey, you have 250 unused invites for Ingress.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
Oh, please.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
It's like, no, sorry.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki, what do you have for us?

57:39.000 --> 57:45.000
Alright, so there's a few more games that have been inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
And originally, the first six were Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.

57:53.000 --> 58:02.000
The newest six would be Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, The Organ Trail, The Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Space Invaders.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Not a bad selection.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
Yeah, it's really not a bad selection at all. I know the first year I was like, well, where's this game and where's this game?

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
And now this year I'm like, okay, well, there's Space Invaders, which really should have been there the first year.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
A little harder for me to complain now as things are rounding out a little more here.

58:21.000 --> 58:32.000
But, I mean, okay, I understand this place is in Rochester, New York or whatever, but what makes this the Video Game Hall of Fame other than the fact that's what they're calling it?

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
They just self-proclaimed, just like, was it the video game capital of the world or something like that?

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
Which you can't even get to by an airport or whatever.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
In the middle of fucking nowhere or something like that?

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Yeah.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
I don't know.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
This is in Iowa somewhere, I think.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Yeah, you can just self-proclaim all that shit, I guess.

58:49.000 --> 59:00.000
Well, and to be fair, even the Metreon in San Francisco at one point had the Video Game Walk of Fame that lasted maybe one or two years before finally they just turned the Metreon into a target.

59:00.000 --> 59:08.000
So, I know I've been in that target going, I wonder if this is where the Hall of Fame used to be. I wonder if this was it.

59:08.000 --> 59:18.000
I wonder if this was the Oops I Killed Your Friend. What was that store with the little thing that was like, Oops I Killed You or something like that. Remember the clothing store?

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
Dark Soccer, you're killing me here. Do you remember in the Metreon there was that Oops?

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Uh, kinda?

59:25.000 --> 59:30.000
God, that was the funniest fucking stuff. And that store is maybe open for three months.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Sucks.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Oh well.

59:32.000 --> 59:46.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Kossin in chat says, Metreon is a target now? Oh Jesus, that's tragic. To be fair, the movie theater part didn't change. That is still there and I think Sony runs the movie theater.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
The IMAX.

59:47.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And it has an IMAX and the XD or whatever they call it is there as well. But yeah, the rest of it, most of it is a target. The food court part didn't change either, except I think the vendors in there did.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And then there's just a lot of other food vendors in there now and that's it. But as far as the arcade, gone. All that other stuff, gone, gone, gone.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So much sadness.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Yeah, it's not what it used to be.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bone.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Let's move on. We're going to come back to the Video Game Hall of Fame a little later in the show during our FUGL question of the week.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But for now, let's talk about Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon. Pokemon Sun and Moon. Pokemon Sun and Moon, more information is going to be coming on these games on May 10th.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
That's right. Pokemon Sun and Moon for the Nintendo 3DS. There's going to be an event in Japan that happens on May 10th.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So I look forward to that because with E3 apparently being nothing but Legend of Zelda this year, you can, you know, do the Pokemon stuff at a different time.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
An earlier time in this case. May 10th.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
So hopefully the type of information you'll be expecting to hear at E3, like maybe release date.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But don't set the expectation bar too high. Just saying.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Also that may be of interest to you is the Japanese Nintendo Direct for Cultcept Revolt on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That Nintendo Direct will be on May 11th. Sadly there is no US version of this Direct, probably because we're not getting it.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
But Cultcept is kind of awesome. It's like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
They have a version of it. I think Cultcept Saga is what it's called on Xbox 360.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And then I think there was one on regular DS.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But sadly I don't think that series did too well. Oh, and there was one on Playstation 2. That's where it all started.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But sadly I don't think the series did too well here in the States.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Or we'd probably be hearing more about Cultcept Revolt over here.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But we can always cross our fingers on our toes and hope we can.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Well another game I've been excitedly looking forward to is Bloodstained.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And thankfully they're going to go in a different direction than Mighty No. 9 was going with its Kickstarter.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000
They're going to make sure that the game isn't delayed by delivering a core package as soon as it's finished.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And then updates are going to come afterwards.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
The same thing happened with Shovel Knight, as you'll recall.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So they're basically making sure that people are getting the product that they have put out the money for.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And that their money is going to be applied towards something better down the line.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I think that that is a great way to handle it.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I mean it's definitely going to save them the PR nightmare that Inafune is going through with Mighty No. 9.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
So I don't know. I think it's a good idea.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
This is probably the best way to do it to ensure the game gets out faster.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But as long as that core game is solid, that's so important I think.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
All the extra stuff is just extra stuff.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And sometimes that can even make the game more fun because it makes you want to go back and revisit it.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Like Shovel Knight. Like when they added the amiibo it was like, oh I have a reason to go back and play Shovel Knight again.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000
So I definitely think that's the way to do it as opposed to what Mighty No. 9 is doing.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But I do also understand the need to feel like you're delivering on promises.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Which is also of course super important.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So I don't want to discount that.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But yeah, I think this is probably a better approach.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Alright, before we get to some release dates when we travel around the world.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I did want to mention, because a minute ago I talked about Nintendo and the Zelda E3 thing.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And sure enough, we already kind of talked about this a little bit last week.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But a little bit more details came out about the whole Nintendo and what they're going to do with E3 and Zelda and all that.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And yes, it really is going to be nothing but Zelda for Nintendo E3.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
From this quote here, at E3 this year we're treating people to an immersive Zelda experience.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And that's from Scott Moffett, who is Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Continuing on, by giving attendees extended hands-on time with this remarkable game.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
They'll be able to get a much deeper understanding of something new for the franchise.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
The E3 thing will start at 9am on Tuesday.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And that will be when Reggie Fils-Aime introduces the Nintendo Treehouse Live.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Which will be dedicated to a day of livestream gameplay of The Legend of Zelda.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
What's interesting about all that is that 9am is usually when they do their direct.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So it seems like there is no Nintendo...

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Well, I don't know if you can say there's no Nintendo Direct, but they really are doing nothing but Zelda.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It's going to be Zelda all day. That's it.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So that is becoming more and more clear.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And especially now with this whole Pokémon thing I just talked about that they were doing at a different time.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Because I said, how the fuck are you going to go to E3 and not show your Pokémon game?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Well, it seems like they're just going to get that out of the way earlier.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So very, very, very interesting development.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And a big gamble as well.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
We'll have to see what pays off for Nintendo this year at E3.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You know what's going to be interesting?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
There's always those people that every year feel the need.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And god, we've probably done this in the past too.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So I'm including ourselves in this little bit of a read I'm doing here.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Every single year we feel the need to grade the big three, right?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
What grade did Sony get?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Did they get an A or did they get a C minus?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Or what did Microsoft get?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Well Nintendo this year, that's going to be a hard one to grade.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Because Nintendo is even kind of saying we're only there with one game.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So do you just give them an F on principle?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Or are you going to give them an A because you're a big Zelda fan?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Or are you just going to toss your grading system?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
That might be the best.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I'm just going to, I don't know, depends what they show.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That's true.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It's like, hey, we came up with this really cool tilt system that you have to use with Kill Zelda.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
You'll tilt it forward and Link will run forward.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Or tilt it backwards and Link will roll backwards.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Loki will just hit that big red buzzer just like he's a judge on America's Got Talent.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
No.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Done.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's going to take a lot to screw up Zelda.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The minute they start talking about tilt controls.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's going to take a lot.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
But if there's anybody I think that could possibly pull it out, it could be Zelda.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Or it could be Nintendo with Zelda.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Dungeon Buster says, bring back the Game Pro faces.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
That was always a good way to rate things.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
SSJ100Matt says, my bank account will be my grading system.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
If it's empty, then you'll know why.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Very true.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Kossen, giving us maybe a different way to grade E3 this year, saying,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
which press conference will have the drunkest host this time?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I think that's worth looking into.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Well, a little more detail on Microsoft's plans for E3 as well,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
although not really unexpected either.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
The E3 2016 media event will be Monday, June 13th at 9.30,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
which is the time slot that they usually do.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It will be on Spike TV.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You can also watch it on your console as well and on Xbox.com.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I wonder if it will be like last year when I could actually watch the Microsoft press event on my PlayStation

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
because I love those types of Inception sort of things.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I'm going to try to do that, see if I can watch the Microsoft event on my PlayStation,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and then I'll watch the Sony event on my Xbox.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Why?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Oh, my God, you're such a rebel.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Because I can.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Because I can.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Anyway, there's also going to be an official Xbox Twitch stream,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
which now that's two out of three that are embracing Twitch,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and I've got to be sure Sony's going to do something as well.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
They always do an extended thing every year anyway.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But, yeah, the Xbox Twitch stream is going to be Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
for about four to six hours each of those days,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
on Tuesday from noon to four, Wednesday from 10 a.m. to four,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Apparently, the rumor and the buzz, of course, is new Xbox One bundles

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and possibly this whole redesign thing, the slimmer Xbox One.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
That's what a lot of the buzz is about right now.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
We'll see.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Only about a month away at this point, believe it or not.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So, actdeftnchat, also a rebel, says,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I have watched the last two Microsoft conferences for my Wii U lol.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
and look at some games that are coming out soon in your region.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Loki.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
All right, well, this week we've got Uncharted 4 coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Also, we have Mega Tagmenson Blanc plus Neptune vs. Zombies

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
for PlayStation Vita.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And then, because they have to be fucking different,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Bethesda's releasing Doom on Friday on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
as well as the collector's edition and all that jazz.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Why can't you just fucking release shit on a...

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Wait, you think you're fucking Nintendo now?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I mean, seriously, speaking of Nintendo, also releasing shit on fucking Fridays.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Disney Art Academy coming out for 3DS.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
You can practice your drawing Mickey and other Disney characters.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That's it.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
All right, traveling over to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
On this week, actually not a lot.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
You could look in other regions to get Uncharted 4 this week,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
but I don't believe that's getting a Japanese...

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Oh, no, it is getting a Japanese release, excuse me, on May 10th.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
It was just at the very bottom of my list.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
There is a deluxe edition there of Uncharted 4 coming out on May 10th,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
so that is getting, I guess, a worldwide type of release,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
because that is coming out everywhere, it sure seems.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Looking at other consoles, the Wii U, nothing until June, sorry to say.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
The Vita, really nothing until next week.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
On May 19th is when we start seeing releases again on the Vita.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And then lastly, on the 3DS, nothing really this week as well,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
so it's another very quiet week in Japan outside of Uncharted 4.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Also, AkumaJP in chat says there is a limited edition PlayStation 4 as well,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
which of course there is. Of course there is.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
There's always a limited edition something something over there,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
way more than we see over here.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
A few things.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
We have on the 10th Uncharted 4 on PlayStation 4,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
on the 12th Super Meat Boy for Wii U,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
and on the 13th Doom 4 on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and on PC.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So hey, this is kind of neat, this is more like internet news,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
but you know how there's all those funky domains you can get nowadays?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
In fact, I think they have .ninja as one of the options.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Well, one that would seem to make sense, that for whatever reason is not available,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
.game and .games is something that's going to be coming around starting May 17th.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Apparently you can purchase your domain with that now, if you want.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So they do like, you know, Call of Duty .game or something like that.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Alright.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Does that mean we have to register another domain, vog.game or something?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't know. Is that something we need to look into?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Maybe, yeah. I'm sure it's something that's going to be available soon.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So I guess you can start ordering those, but yeah, it's going to launch quarter 3 of 2016,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and they're going to be selling them for $12.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Flappy vog.game. Look forward to it.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
We can hope.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Or what was it? Was it, you do like, you lost .game or something like that?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
You lost the .game? That's a good idea.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Somebody needs to get on that.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out we do have vog.network.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I didn't realize that. That's pretty cool.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
It's kind of fun.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Alright, talking about World of Warcraft here lastly.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Yes, World of Warcraft is still going.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Do you remember a couple weeks ago on the show we talked about

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
that Blizzard had actually shut down an underground server

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
that was dedicated to running vanilla World of Warcraft,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
original Warcraft before all the expansions and all that,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
for people who didn't want to let go,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
or I guess who didn't want to have to pay the monthly fee

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
because the server wouldn't have those.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Well, I pretty much thought that would be the end of that.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It was just a matter of time before the cease and desist came out,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
and it did, and that was that.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
However, apparently one of the admins over at Nosalrius,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
which was the name of this server, underground server,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
they are saying that they're going to meet with Blizzard at their headquarters

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
in a statement there, so we don't know what more is with that

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
or when that meeting is or how that's going to take place

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
or if it's something maybe where it's just during BlizzCon or something,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
but I think they should consider themselves very lucky

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
that Blizzard will give them the time of day

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
because they really don't have to be,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
considering that people weren't really paying to be on this server

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
with a monthly fee or anything,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
so it's really kind of fascinating to me that Blizzard would do that,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
but maybe that shows that they are paying attention

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
to the big, I guess, demand, for lack of a better term, online,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
where people are asking for something like this.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
There's a part of me that is wondering,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
do people really want this,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
or do people want it because they didn't have to pay for it?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
So I kind of think if something like this is going to end up being officially supported,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
you better believe you're going to have to activate your full WoW account

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
to get access to the vanilla server.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But I guess some people are completely okay with that,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
and that's fine, I suppose.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So, Stoppy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
they will be frisked for tar and or feathers.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Perhaps.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
All right, anyhow, let's get to another segment here

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
we like to do every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Every week here on the program, DarkSakura steps into the vault

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and finds a game ten years older or more that she thinks,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
hey, you know what, you kids and your Overwatch,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
your fancy-ass graphics, your online play,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
you know what, you need to go back and play a classic like this one.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I have chosen a game that I have always wanted to play

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and never got around to playing.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
What? This one you haven't even played yourself?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
But it's adorable, it's actually been, I've watched a bunch of it,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I've just never had a chance to.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So the game I've chosen is Rocket Knight Adventures.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And it came out in 1993, and it is, as far as I recall,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
the first game developed and published by Konami for the Sega Genesis.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
It came out in the U.S. on August 5th, 1993,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and in Japan on August 6th, so it actually came out in the U.S. first.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Although I guess technically it would be sort of simultaneous

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
since, you know, the time difference and all that.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
It was also designed by the same person who did several of the Contra games,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
including the Alien Wars Hardcore and Shattered Soldier.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
So you play as a possum named Sparkster,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
who fights an army of robots and pigs and vehicles,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
and he has a sword and a rocket pack.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So a lot of it is side scrolling.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
You also have a few horizontal scrolling shooters,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I guess kind of like how the old cotton games were.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And then another one we use a large machine for dueling.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It's a pretty neat game overall, really great music, really great graphics.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Although I thought it was stupid that they changed the difficulty level names for the U.S.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
In the U.S. you have children mode, easy mode, normal, and hard.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
In Japan you have normal, hard, very hard, and crazy hard.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And in Europe you have easy, hard, very hard, and crazy hard.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I just think it would need to have the difficulty to be crazy hard, you know?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So anyway, it's been a game that's been on my list for quite a while.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
And see, they had evil pigs before Angry Birds did, just saying.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
There was a version planned for SNES and it never came out.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It did have a sequel called Sparkster Rocket Knight Adventures 2,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and a spinoff for the SNES called Sparkster,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
and they were produced roughly around the same time.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:11.000
There was actually an announcement of another sequel in 2009 called Rocket Knight,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
but it was supposed to be a sequel to the actual Sparkster, Rocket Knight Adventures 2,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
that was developed by Climax.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And it came out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Steam,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
but it wasn't really so involved by the original designers.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
The character's been around in other games, Sparkster was,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
in New International Tracking Field for Nintendo DS,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
and Crazy Cart Racing for iPhone and iPod Touch.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
He's also had cameos in Ganbare Goemon 2,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Kitaretsu Shogu Maginess,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I can't read it.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
For SNES,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Natcher for Mega CD,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Jikyo Power Pro Wrestling 96,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and Max Voltage for SNES,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Mitsumete Knight for PlayStation.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000
He was also a disguised character for Twinbee Paradise for PC,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
and a figure kind of looking like him in Shattered Soldier.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
The character's actually been around for a while,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and been through different things,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
but I sadly never got really much of a chance to play it.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But it's had good ratings for ages,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
and it looks really pretty,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
it looks a lot of fun,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
a decent challenge,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and it's got great music.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So that's it.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
You mean there's not enough time to play every single video game ever released,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Dark Sakura?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
How could you?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
No, I have not played this game either.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But I'd seen it before,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
but kind of looking at it again now,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
obviously it's been a long time since I've seen this,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I'm like, wow, this looks really good for a Genesis game.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I think it was sort of around the time of Ristar as well.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000
So it's that same kind of family of just really pretty Genesis games.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
No, don't get me wrong.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I'm like, wow, I really miss something by not checking this out,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
but that's what this segment is for,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
to remind me that I need to go check it out.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
So, all right, there it is,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
your classic game of the week,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Rocket Knight Adventures for the Sega Genesis,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
or Mega Drive, depending on what part of the world you're in.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
There it is.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We're going to take a quick break,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
but when we come back,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
We're going to get to your phone calls,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
as well as more news.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
We're going to talk about Persona 5,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
and how many of you all want more Stardew Valley?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Because we're going to talk about that as well,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
right after this.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Welcome back, everybody,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 640 of our show,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
In Progress, for May the 8th of 2016.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Just myself, Dark Soccer,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
and Loki here in studio tonight,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
but it feels like it's been forever

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
since it's been just the three of us here on the show.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
So we're having a good time tonight,

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
going over the week's news,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
of which there was a little bit.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
So we're going to continue things on right now,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
with our rapid-fire news, starting off with Loki.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I think, right, Loki?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
We're going to do some rapid-fire news.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
What are you watching over there that's taken away?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I saw this at the store,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
and I was trying to figure out what the fuck it was.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
It's this thing called an Anki Overdrive.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
It looks like one of those slot-racing cars.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
It's super fucking expensive.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Yeah, it is.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
What the fuck is that?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I've seen that as well.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I was looking for the Bluetooth controllers on Toys R Us,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and they pulled that up again.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I'm like, what the fuck is that?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
So I went and watched,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I was trying to watch a video to see what it was.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I still don't know what the fuck it is yet.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
But anyways.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I remember.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Because I was looking,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
and I'm like, oh, hey,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
there's a piece of track that you can buy for $20.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I'm like, fuck that.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But I remember when I was younger,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I had a little thing that my grandma,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
rest in peace, had bought me.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Well, apparently it's like slot-car racing.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
It's like slot-car racing.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It's slot-car racing,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
but instead of it being just stuck in a little groove,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
and you just hit the gas,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
this is actually a track that the cars stick onto,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and you can go back and forth and actually drive it.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Like you're doing RC cars or something like that.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Okay, all right.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
So at least that's what it looks like.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Somehow it ties with your Android device,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
your iOS device.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
That's awesome, though.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But it's super fucking expensive.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
You better watch out,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
because next week you're going to come to the studio,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
and there's going to be a car

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
that races around our Sakura's chair.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Yeah, it's like they had that shit,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
and all the fucking accessories for that.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Like they don't already do that at home.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Oh, but God forbid we actually have

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
a fucking Bluetooth controller for an Android phone.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You know, that's impossible.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
All right, calm down.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Calm down.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Get to the news.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
All right.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So hey, shocking.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Mighty number nine's not fucking out yet,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
so it's been delayed again.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Oh, surprise.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Now it's coming out June 21st.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
You know what that means?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I don't give a shit about it,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
because that's the same day as fucking No Man's Sky,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I probably won't be playing Mighty Number Nine,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
but if you're interested in it,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
the new date's June 21st until it gets delayed again,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
so look forward to that.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And this is kind of cool.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
A couple more games that are now backwards compatible

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
with the Xbox One.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Jet Set Radio.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Also, they're going to be including Texas Hold'em,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
and MX versus ATV Reflex are the new games

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
added to backwards compatibility,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
but Jet Set Radio, that's pretty sweet.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
They've been pretty good about keeping the drip on

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
with those Xbox One backwards compatible.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah, I gotta say, that is one thing

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I am very impressed with Microsoft on.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I really wish they had some sort of backwards compatible

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
solution for the PlayStation 4.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I mean, seriously, at this point, I'm very baffled.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Like, even if, like, let's just say, for example,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
that PlayStation 3, I kind of understand

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
that that might be impossible to do backwards compatible

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
on the actual device, I kind of wish it was,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
but PlayStation 2, I mean, they should have a solution

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
aside from buying that shit again,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
and PlayStation 1 should be fucking playable as is.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Yeah, I know.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
PSP or something, I mean, that should be,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I mean, fuck, the PSP could run that stuff.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
That might be a nice little bombshell

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
for them to drop at E3, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Games that have just disappeared, no longer available.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Project Cross Zone, believe it or not,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
on the 3DS eShop, disappeared over the weekend.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
This was the game where you could play game characters

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
from As an Evil, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Mega Man,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I mean, a lot of cool little characters in this game,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
but unfortunately, it's gone.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
The 3DS eShop no longer carries the game.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You, for a moment, couldn't even redownload it,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
although that has changed.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
You are now able to redownload the software,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
so that's good if you did already buy it.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
The thought is that maybe licensing issues

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
are coming into this, because after all, you know,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
there were different worlds kind of coming together here

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
with Bandai Namco and the Capcom stuff,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
so maybe the licensing thing ran out,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
and that's what happened, but no official statement there

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
otherwise on why it was pulled.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Also, kind of surprising that this game disappeared,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and that is VVVVVVV is also gone from the 3DS eShop.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Why? Because there is a homebrew exploit

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
that apparently was uncovered by people.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I guess you can hack the 3DS by using VVVVV.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
It was one of the games that would facilitate it.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Now, Terry Cavana, the game's creator,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
didn't think that he was going to have to patch it,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
but they ended up actually pulling the game,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
and I'm sure it wasn't something intentional done by the creator,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
but unfortunately, just there was some back door

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
somehow open in it that they were able to exploit there,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
so yeah, VVVVVV is now not on the eShop,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
but I have that game on my 3DS.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
What can I exploit on that?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I need to figure that out, have some fun, run some homebrew.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Maybe I don't actually want to do that,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
because I kind of like my 3DS, I don't want it to break or anything like that.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Anyhow, let's also talk about this,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
because you know what, I might be 37 years old,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
but I don't give a fuck. I want these shoes.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Have you seen these? This is the Nintendo and Vans crossover,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and if you haven't seen these, I urge you to look it up in Google News.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Yeah, do the Nintendo Vans thing.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
There's some fun, like they're very loud shoes,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I wouldn't really be able to wear them to work, they're not exactly subtle,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
but they're great, because there's one that has a big Mario face on it,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
with all these Mario characters, there's the old school NES controller,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
there's some that have Donkey Kong and some graphics inspired by that,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
and the ones I want more than anything, the Princess Peach ones,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
that have Peach and the stars and all that stuff over there.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Why isn't it a thing, you know how they have these shoes and everything,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
it's obviously screen printed on,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
why don't they have that where you can custom print stuff on the side of your shoes?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I would think they probably do.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
That would be pretty awesome.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah, well this is official, it's an official partnership and official license,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
so there's no homebrew or whatever you need to be doing.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I will say though, because I do see some people in chat are like,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
some of them are kind of tacky and whatever, they're a little loud for me.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I do notice some of them are a little more subtle than others,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
like there's one, all it really has is a brick pattern from Mario Brothers,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
around the side of the shoe, and it's a lot more subtle than some of the others.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
The other one looks like they're camouflage shoes,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
but when you look close up, it actually has the duck from Duck Hunt and the dog.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
So like some of them are a little more subtle than others,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
but like those Peach ones, they ain't subtle.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
But I'm not here to be subtle.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Dark Sakura's shaking her head, a green movie over there.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Nah, I think if you're gonna go, go loud.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
That's right.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
If you're gonna do something, be bold.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Alright, anyway, Dark Sakura, what do you have?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Well, I've got something about Splatoon.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
There is going to be a global Splatfest, and it is me Tomo themed.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Yay.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And it actually has to do with the question if you want to go fancy,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
or go to a costume party, which I voted for the costume party,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
because ain't a party like a costume party.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
So it's all global.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
The Splatfest starts on May 13th at 8 p.m. Pacific time.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
It ends at 3 a.m. Pacific time on May 15th.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So go for it.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And then Stardew Valley, which I still need to play.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It's getting co-op and console versions and content stuff.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
It will have new farm buildings, crops, artisan goods,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
different farming mechanics.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You get Shane and Emily as marriage candidates,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and more marriage content, bug fixes, secrets,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
and little bits added to Le World.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
So go get it.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I should go get it.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah, I'm surprised you have not gotten into Stardew Valley yet.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
That game really seems like it's up your alley.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Do you know how much no time I have?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Oh, come on. Come on.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
You could waste your night away with Stardew Valley.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I know you. You'll get into this.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
You know what, though? I work late, and I like to sleep.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Which sometimes I like to sleep more than I like to play games.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I know. Blasphemy.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
No, not when it comes to sleep.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Sleep is amazing, and then I dream weird shit.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
But Stardew Valley is worth losing a little sleep for, I'm just saying.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Fine, fine.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Thank you. That is the right answer.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Hey, listeners, get me the game.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Put it on your wish list. See what happens.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I might be on my wish list. I don't know.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
All right. Let's get to the Foogle question of the week.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
You slam those words together, and you get Foogle.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
This week we asked on Google and Facebook Plus, we asked,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Hey, six more games were inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame this week.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Combined with last year's six, these are now the games in the Hall of Fame.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Okay, so here they are. Here's the 12 games.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Grand Theft Auto 3, Legend of Zelda, Oregon Trail, Sims, Sonic the Hedgehog,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Space Invaders, Doom, Pac-Man, Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Tetris, and World of Warcraft.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
If you had to take one out and put in a game that you think should be there instead,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
what Switch would you make?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
This is going to be a fun one, but it's like our list list segment.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Sometimes you have to delete something in order to get the most efficient list.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
All right, here we go. What are you going to remove and put in its place?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Retertainment says, I would substitute Doom for Wolfenstein 3D.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
While Doom had an unquestionably huge impact on PC first person shooters,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Doom would not have had as much impact as it did without the foundation laid out by Wolfenstein 3D.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Fifth Dream says, I'd remove World of Warcraft and replace it with Final Fantasy 6. Best game ever.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Danielle R says, I would personally remove Grand Theft Auto 3 and substitute it with Mortal Kombat.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
That's just personal preference though.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
William Murderface says, I would replace The Legend of Zelda with The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Now if I could add a few, I would add Super Metroid, Final Fantasy X,

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Kingdom Hearts, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Kane.I.Am says, I wouldn't change anything, but I would add Secret of Evermore.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But that's just me, and what do I know?

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Well, what do we know either, to be fair, Kane.I.Am.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000
TigerClawnChat says, I would replace Super Mario Brothers with Donkey Kong,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
because without that game, there would not have been a Super Mario Brothers.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It was Mario's first appearance, and that's a game that should have been in the Video Game Hall of Fame.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Our buddy John B. from back in the day says, replace them all with Crysis. It's the best game ever.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Glad to see that troll's still back.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Veronica Isabel says, I would remove Pong and replace it with the cult classic Earthbound,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
a game I know I'll love when I play it later this year. I'm currently playing Earthbound Beginnings.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Degenerate Johnny says, I would replace WoW with Final Fantasy.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Hall of Fame's are about original, iconic titles that delivered inspiration and continues to do so for future generation of titles,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
not the biggest successes in the industry.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Princess Irena replied and said, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd swap Grand Theft Auto 3 with Final Fantasy 7.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:39.000
If it's for a Hall of Fame, then few games are more famous than that one, and it's still a top seller to this day for some strange reason.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Doesn't hurt that everybody be mad dick-hyped for the remake, too.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Those are Princess's words, not mine.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Rage Nator says, I'd take out WoW and put in SOCOM 2 in its place.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.000
SOCOM 2, the series as a whole, was an addicting, squad-based third-person shooter whose multiplayer basically made the PlayStation 2's online capabilities.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yes, the Xbox had Halo, but we had SOCOM, dammit.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And then over on Google+, just one answer over on the Google+, that says, from MacDeft, I'd probably take out the Oregon Trail since it's more of an American thing,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
and not that really influential on the history of video games.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
What game would I place instead of it? Metroid. It created a whole genre that's still very popular today,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
and so many great games that will probably be in the Hall of Fame in future years are inspired by it.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Whoo, those are some really good answers, you guys, and I'm gonna ask here in studio to make the same decision if you think you can.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
What game would you take off the list, and what game would you replace it with?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So, Loki, let's start with you. What game would you take off the list, and what would you replace it with?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Um, I would take... let's see, I would take The Sims off the list and replace it with... Metroid.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And why Metroid?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Because it's another classic game that really should be on there. I mean, it's kind of formed its own genre as far as, you know, Metroidvania games and everything.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Plus, again, The Sims... I mean, The Sims was alright, it was just... I don't know. I don't think it's that classic.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Fair enough.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Darsagra?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I guess that I would take off...

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I'd take off Grand Theft Auto 3.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And what would you replace it with?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
The Guardian Legend.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Of course you would!

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I would honestly, I would almost even say instead of, like, Metroid, Street Fighter 2.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Damn you, you just took my answer. I was gonna say, you bastard, but I would actually take off... I'm gonna get so much shit because nobody said this game, I don't think.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I would take off Sonic the Hedgehog and replace it with Street Fighter 2.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And look, I love Sonic. I don't like his friends, but I like Sonic.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.000
But here's the thing about Sonic. I feel that for a lot of the reasons Sonic is there, Super Mario Brothers is there.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And just so, I kind of just think they're both platformers.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And I also think later Sonic games have kind of tarnished the original Sonic.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I hate to say it, but that's just what it is for me.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Like, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 kind of diminished the original.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So, anyway, but I think Street Fighter 2 needs to be on there for what it did for the arcade scene.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I'm even saying that over Super Metroid.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Like, my heart would say, oh, Super Metroid or Civilization should be there.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
But my head says, Street Fighter 2 did so much for the arcade scene in the 90s.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.000
It's hard to dial it down to six, so, I mean, there's always the next year.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I would remove Street Fighter 2 and then replace it with Jones in the fast lane.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And Bobby Black Wolf also reminds us they can't induct every game in the first few years.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Well, dammit, why not?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I'm surprised Halo isn't on that list.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Of course, then when we get to, like, ten years from now, then we're going to be scraping for games to put on there.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000
So, all right, let's move on. We're going to go pass the football question of the week.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Let's get to, yes, thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
MissNudeWorld96, one can hope, one can hope.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Loki, why don't you go ahead with your next story?

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
That should have really been in the first year, to be honest.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I mean, that's, like, number one.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So this is kind of cool. I'm always, you know, excited when I hear about a new Volition game.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But there's a rumor that Volition and Deep Silver are working on a title called Agents of Mayhem.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I can only hope that's a working title for another Saints Row game, but I will take...

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Oh, God, do you think it's going to be an Avengers parody?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Because that's what, when you say, like, Agents of Mayhem, I don't know why, but that's, like, what pops into my mind.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
It's going to be, like, a superhero thing.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I'd be down.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I'd be down, too.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I mean, as much as I hate on later Saints Row games, I'm still going to buy every single one of them.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
So, I mean, I only hate because I love.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
If that makes sense.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I criticize because I love.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That's it.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
But, yeah.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So, hey, I'm down for anything that's coming out from Volition.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I wish it was another Saints Row game, but I'll take Agents of Mayhem.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
If they want to take some time off and do a different title, a new IP, I think that's okay, too.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Or perhaps Saints Row has gotten so far from it that it's not going to be an Avengers parody.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Or perhaps Saints Row has gotten so far from Saints Row, it should just be its own thing.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Well, and maybe that's what they do.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
They take some time off to do a new IP, and then they're going to come back and reboot Saints Row.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Because enough time will have passed, they can be like, okay, now we're going to reboot Saints Row.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So, maybe that's the plan.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I'm fine with that.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Or forget it. It'll just be Saints Row 5, and that'll be that.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
SSU100Matt says, Superhero-themed Saints Row. I'd buy it.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
You know what would be cool? Agents of Mayhem.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Because this kind of reminds me, I watched Kick-Ass 2 last night.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
But like a Kick-Ass style game.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Where you're a superhero, but a superhero without any fucking powers.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
You're just some dude dressed up that's fighting crime or something.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
What do you mean, like Watchmen?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Why not?

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Well, yeah, sort of like Watchmen, but I don't know.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Alright.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Hey, this is pretty big for some people.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I've been waiting a long time for this game.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And this is a really huge legendary series.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And that's Persona.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Atlus had a countdown that was running on their website.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And it finally ticked to the end for this Persona 5 countdown.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And what was revealed, the release date for Persona 5 in Japan.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Unfortunately, it was not revealed yet for the states.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Beyond what they said originally, which was 2016.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
But Persona 5 will be out in Japan on September 15th.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
That is coming out, remember, on the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Because they originally announced Persona 5 for the PlayStation 3.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
But it's been in development so long that it turns out they're going to put it on the PlayStation 4 as well.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Probably because so many people have moved on to PlayStation 4.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And there's no backwards compatibilities.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
They kind of have to do both. Who knows?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Anyway, there's actually a little trailer.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And if you haven't seen the trailer, you should check it out.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Because it's pretty badass.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
The whole anime, across the RPG.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Again, this series is quite legendary.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I have to admit, it's not one that I've played extensively.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I've played a little bit of Persona 4.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I really need to stop playing these fucking MMO time sinks.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And give Persona more attention than it probably deserves.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
But I will say that these games have a lot of depth.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And it's pretty impressive what they pack onto one disc for these games.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So I'm looking forward to Persona 5.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Hopefully, like the other games, you don't have to have played the previous ones to be able to pick this one up.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And I don't think it'll be the case with this game either.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So there you go, Persona 5 is going to be out on September 15th.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
No word on the release date in the States.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I'm assuming they're holding that for E3.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Hopefully it's still making 2016.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
But maybe it'll just be November as opposed to September.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We'll see though.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I can't play Stardew Valley now.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Why?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
There's new Hot to Full Boyfriend games for me to play.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Oh my god.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I cannot do these things.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I'm not even going to ask if you're going to have time to play Persona.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Because, no, I gotta get the 500th ending in Hot to Full Boyfriend instead.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Hi.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Hey.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Alright.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And Dungeon Buster reminding, yes, each Persona is pretty standalone.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And you still have time to play and finish Persona 4.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
That is true.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I need to just suck it up and do it.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
It's on my Vita.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
What else am I playing on my Vita?

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I bought it in some super sale on the Vita not that long ago.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Apparently the game's already on my wish list, so whatever.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I'll get it later.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
There you go.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I'll do it later.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I have a Finally for us.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Finally.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
We're finally getting Raiden 5.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.000
It's going to come out in the US, or North America in general, on May 11th.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And it's going to have some neat multiplayer elements, like a cheer system,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
so you feel better about yourself while you're killing things.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Anyway, basically you can buff other players, like by messages or ratings.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And you get leaderboards, and there's going to be eight stages in all,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
with of course multiple different ships and all kinds of crazy weapons.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And the Raiden series has been my big favorite when it comes to shooting games.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:55.000
And especially getting that big lightning thing that would just latch on to things

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
and take up the whole screen.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
So over the top.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I love it.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
So happy.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Dark Soccer will need to get an Xbox One so she can play this game.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Dark Soccer will be coming over to Rob's house so she can play this game.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Fair enough.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I'm going to treat it like I did Final Fantasy VII.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I didn't know the PlayStation.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I just bought the game and went to other people's houses.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
No shit.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
No, sometimes that works.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Yep.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
That's hilarious.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
All right.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
SSJ100Matt in chat asks,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Can there be a Bobby Black Wolf forever mode that reduces the number of bullets by 75%?

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Would it be as fun?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
That's asking for an easy mode in Dark Souls,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
which I'm not even going to go there with that discussion this week.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
All right.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
All right.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
So, you know, when you think of Best Buy,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
you think of the lack of Bluetooth controllers for your Android phones,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
and you also think about different experiences where they have, you know,

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
where you can go view Nintendo games and that type of thing.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Well, now they're going to also have, you know,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
where you can actually check out the Oculus Rift.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And this is going to be starting actually, well, it's already started.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
In fact, I actually saw it today.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
They had the Rift set up.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.000
But you can go to select Best Buy locations and check out the Oculus Rift.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
There are 48 locations nationwide.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Will you be taking the trip?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
No, because I was there today, and I have an Oculus Rift dev kit.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And I don't really need that.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I had a big Gear VR, so I mean, heck yeah,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I'd like to check out the retail one to kind of, you know, see what it was.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
There was someone using it today, so I didn't get a chance to do that.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And honestly, when I looked at it originally,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I thought it was just the Gear VR, but then it kind of did look different.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
So I think it was the actual Rift.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
All right.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Well, whatever.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Well, this reminds me about a 3DS game that I need to pick up

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000
because these classics are a lot of fun.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The Sega 3D Classics Collection is available on the 3DS,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
and I definitely want to check that out.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And Dark Sakura, I'm really surprised you're not all over this game,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
but actually, after this news that made the blog rounds this week,

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
there is a secret tenth game that is unlockable in the game,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and it is not advertised on the box or anything like that

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
because they actually advertise there's nine games in the collection,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
but there is a bonus tenth game.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
So here's how you unlock it.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
You go to the Extras menu where you have Maze Walker

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
and Fantasy Zone 2 Master System version,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and you tap the area next to the Back to Menu button,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
and an enemy will pop up.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And as you tap the enemy, the original Master System Fantasy Zone will load,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000
and that is the extra game, Fantasy Zone for the Master System in the Sega 3D Classics.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
You know why I care very little?

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Why?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Because I have a Master System, and I have Fantasy Zone for Master System.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
You don't want it in your pocket everywhere you go?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
No.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
All right. I tried.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Well, on top of that, I don't know.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Actually, I think I do have a couple of portable, whatever.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I sometimes do refer to that location near my pocket as the Fantasy Zone anyway,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
so it's all good.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Get ready.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Do you have a pair of boxer shorts that says,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
That's totally the name of my blog.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Oh my God, we need to.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Okay, that's going to be the first item for sale in the OLR merchandise store.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
It's going to be underwear that says, Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Or is that trademarked?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Would we get in trouble for that?

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Probably, but you know what?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
What?

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
If you go to darksakura.com, the first thing you see is my blog that starts off,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
But is it on panties?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
It could be.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I don't tell what's in my drawers.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I guess you could always do, you could bend it a little bit and do,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Welcome to my Fantasy Zone, get ready, and then it's not the same thing.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
That was used in Bayonetta.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Oh.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Welcome to my Fantasy Zone.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
That's right. God damn.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
All right, anyway.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Okay, so it doesn't say welcome.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
It just says Fantasy Zone, and it says blog de darksakura.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Seems like you need an update.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Anyway.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I do need to update my blog, though, because the last thing I posted about was Oprah.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
It was.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Well, what else do you need to post about?

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
It was about Oprah supporting Weight Watchers, which is stupid.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Do you want the queen of yo-yo dieters as your Enos spokeswoman, really?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Oprah may be fabulous.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
She's absolutely fabulous.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But she is as fallible as the rest of us.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Well, it's hard to lose weight when all you're eating is yo-yos.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Moving on, there's more with this whole Sega 3D classics thing.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So, you know, some folks are wondering, hey, what about other Sega platforms, like Saturn and Dreamcast?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Well, Yosuke Okunare with Sega says, here's the reason why you haven't gotten 3D classics.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
That has more to do with how the teams are divided amongst Sega as a company.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Up until now, M2 has been focused on 8-bit and 16-bit ports, whereas Dreamcast and Saturn titles were done by staff that were assigned to those games from teams like AM2 or Sega of China.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:18.000
The idea behind that was to make these porting lines run as efficiently as possible with the teams learning the know-how behind specific systems.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:27.000
At the time, if M2 had researched porting a Model 2 or 3 on their own and came to Sega for that, we'd have told them we had already had teams assigned to it or the market isn't right at the time.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
That said, that sort of corporate direction has ended recently, and M2 is the only port line that really exists anymore.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
There is the possibility that ports for Model 3 could continue on their side.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000
So what I'm hearing from this is there's a lot of corporate crap that they've got to cut through, so fans, you just need to bitch more.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Tweet at Sega that you want Space Channel 5 as a 3D classic, because who does not want Space Michael as a 3D classic?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Find me that person so I can tell them through their face that they're wrong.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Thank you, Lala.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is our email address, and we like to open up the mailbag every week, and DarkSakura dives in head first and finds an email or five to read for us here on air.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
How many emails do we have this week?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
One.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Just one? Fine. Do the email. Do the thing.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Where's my music?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I didn't have it ready, I'm sorry.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I cannot read emails without my music.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I do not have, unfortunately, I do not have your little cutesy theme, so tonight for the mailbag I'm giving you Enter the Gungeon.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
You've been listening to-

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Wait, that's not Enter the Gungeon.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
That's not Enter the Gungeon.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
What the hell?

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Hot mess.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
God damn it.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
This is hot mess radio.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I don't know what I have queued up.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
You'll buy what?

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Apparently I did not actually have the Gungeon song in the same location on the folder.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Fine, you can have Shovel Knight.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
By the way, Rob-

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
What?

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I've decided that our little project should be called The Hot Mess.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
For shovelry and emails!

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Yes.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Okay.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Hello, OLR.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
It's been a while since I've sent you guys an email, so here it is.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I have this feeling that the Wii U was Nintendo's Saturn.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Except for the Wii, Nintendo's last four consoles haven't really been true commercial successes.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
The same story time and time again.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
They had their share of great games, but always a lack of third party support.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
You know, that was not the Saturn in Japan.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Saturn in Japan, tons of third party support.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Namely, Capcom.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I don't think Mario and friends will continue to save Nintendo.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I truly hope the NX will not be Nintendo's Dreamcast.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Dude, but the Dreamcast was great!

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Anyway, I've finally been able to try the Oculus Rift.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
It's cool, but not $600 cool.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
It did impress me a lot, but it's missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Maybe it's the huge goggles?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Anyway, thanks for reading my email and doing the show.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Thank you, Fabrice.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I love my Dreamcast, by the way.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I was just thinking about taking out the Dreamcast the other day and playing through Rainbow Cotton.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
The thing with that email that I'm kind of like...

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I respect the opinion, of course, and all that stuff, but the thing that doesn't sit with me

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
is when you say that Nintendo's last four consoles have not done well except for the Wii.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But, like, I think you're really writing off way too fast how big the Wii was.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.000
The Wii was the biggest video game console of period, all period, time, period.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And, granted, a lot of that is because of Wii Sports and so forth, but...

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I mean, yes, when you follow up the greatest console of all time...

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Or, I'm sorry, the best-selling console of all time, because when I say the greatest, other opinions are going to get involved.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:57.000
When you sell the best-selling of all time, you follow it up with the Wii U, which, you know, next to the Wii, tanked.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Now, I still like the Wii U for a lot of the Nintendo exclusives and all that stuff, but...

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
It's getting a lot more play in my house.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Yeah, the third-party thing fucked them. That is essentially what it boils down to.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:17.000
The third-party thing fucked them, and it was too hard to port the 360 and the PlayStation games and all that, and the 1 and the 4 and all that.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000
It's too hard to port those to the Wii U, because the second screen, you know, had this whole other element to it.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And companies didn't want to invest the time, because there just weren't...

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It was one of those things that kept snowballing.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:35.000
The Wii U didn't have the games on it that people really wanted to play at first, so it wasn't selling enough units.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:42.000
So, companies didn't want to invest the time to make another game for it, because the units weren't out there, and it just kind of snowballed from there.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.000
That's why the NX is being delayed, because they're not going to launch with a weak lineup again.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:57.000
That's why they're holding Zelda for the launch of the NX, because it worked for them with the Wii, to launch the Wii with the Zelda title that everybody was anticipating.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000
And remember, the Wii was the biggest console of all time.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:13.000
So, if, and this is a big if, if the NX has Zelda, and it has the real successor to Wii Sports that Nintendo Land was not,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:20.000
and I'm not saying that game has to be Wii Sports 2, if it has something as accessible and as must-play as Wii Sports,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.000
then the NX will do awesome out the gate, and the third-party support, not a problem at all.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I guess in some ways you could say Nintendo Land killed the Wii U.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:37.000
That's essentially what it boils down to. Nintendo Land killed the Wii U. Period.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Alright, that's it for emails, right? Alright.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Then we'll get to the FUs of the week. We're going to do that right now.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And I do have the theme music for the FUs of the week. That's the good news.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Here is punishment.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
This is fucked up.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Dark soccer.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
FU to all the Star Wars games are on sale on Steam.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Also FU to having to work when Bernie's going to be in town tomorrow and I want to go to the rally,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
because I am wearing my Bernie shirt right now.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I wanted to wear my Bernie shirt just because I was walking into a Walmart.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And I wore my Bernie shirt in a Walmart doing shopping.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
At least traffic will be awful and you don't want to be in there.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Also FU to everyone at DragCon right now.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
FU with love.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Loki.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I guess just FU to the fact that I haven't mentally been able to work on my game.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Too tired.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.000
But not necessarily too tired. I did have some brain-tards the other day.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I'm still kind of just deciding how I want to look once I figure that out,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
because that's the main portion of it since it's going to be the box, the base and everything.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Then I can build the rest, but since I haven't decided on that first part because I keep changing my mind,

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
it's kind of where I'm stuck at the moment.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Soon.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that the weekend went by so fast.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I need another three-day weekend soon.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I really enjoy my job and everything, but I really enjoy weekends.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So I need another three-day weekend soon.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I actually might be taking one, because Shane is really trying to convince me.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:43.000
And you know Shane in convincing, but he's really trying to convince me to take a Friday off to go do the Mass Effect ride at Great America.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
And I kind of want to do it.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I want to, but I can't get my Friday off. I tried.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Ugh. Man.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:55.000
All right. I've got to address this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com before we get to our last couple stories here,

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000
because some folks are wanting to correct me when I'm talking about that the Wii is the biggest console of all time.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Some folks in chat saying it was the PlayStation 2, it was the PlayStation 2.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Various folks saying that.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:12.000
And to be fair, I don't have the sites in front of me, and I may be confusing the whole fact that Wii Sports is the biggest game of all time

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000
against that, so if I'm, you know, losing the numbers game there, then fine.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I would say in the context of my argument, though, ultimately it doesn't matter,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.000
because you look at what the Wii sold, especially for last generation next to the 360 and the PlayStation 3,

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000
and I still think my points are somewhat valid. It doesn't really change the context of my argument.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000
But I will, okay, maybe I made a boo-boo and the PlayStation 2 is bigger.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I thought when you factored in the US and Europe, the Wii still outsold it.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I mean, I would totally get that the PlayStation 2 outsold it in Japan, but whatever, I don't want to...

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I trust you guys, so whatever, I just want to get that out there.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Let's see, what else in chat over at live.funknetwork.com.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
There was another one I wanted to show here.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Dr. Tsuya said, I think Nintendo is definitely trying to get the NX right.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I mean, instead of releasing it now and next to nothing like they had on the Wii U,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
they're just going to forfeit this holiday and launch next spring.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, just because we hardcore don't like the system doesn't mean it wasn't massively successful.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Oh, I know the other part. Oh, this one from an anonymous user in our chat room says,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000
the Wii was the best-selling console that nobody played after they'd owned it for a month.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Yes, but you do understand in the context of things, that doesn't really matter, right?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Because Nintendo still got the money.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Without a new Excite Truck game, come on.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
You want an Excite Truck game on NX?

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Excite Truck game.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
That would actually be awesome.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Not Excite Bots. Excite Bots was totally wrong. That is in the wrong direction.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Minigames are not something that's involved in a racing game. Excite Truck was awesome.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I will say, though, to that comment's credit and so forth, and to what ultimately happened with the Wii,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:04.000
it would be nice to see really strong first-party support that is planned out through a seven-year or so life cycle

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
so that it doesn't feel like all your biggest shit was in the first couple years and then that's it.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Like, the support just kind of died off for it.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Because the Wii was kind of expected to be carried by third parties at the end there,

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.000
and because the Wii was so successful, whether it outsold the PS2 or not, the Wii was so successful,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
it had so many dumpy games on it.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:30.000
There were so many dumpy games on the Wii, especially at the end of its life cycle.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
So, hopefully less of that on the NX, but we will see.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Alright, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we will open it up for calls.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:44.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Loki.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So, there's a new Star Wars game in the works with EA, and it's being worked on by Respawn Entertainment,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
the developers behind Titanfall. That's exciting.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Speaking of which, I wanted a Titanfall game, which I should be getting, hopefully, the way I just see her.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Or maybe early next year. But they're going to be working on it.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
And it's because of the single-player campaign this time.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I thought Titanfall 2 was a given for this year's E3.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I'm hyped for that. And Battlefield 1, even though, I mean, because the trailer looked awesome.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
You know all I want out of E3, especially now the NX is out of the picture.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
All I want is that new Mass Effect game.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000
That's a thing, too. Like, I mean, it's seriously, you know, with Nintendo, they're not going to have a whole lot releasing.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
There's not a lot of focus being put on them. Like, that's why I think they...

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I mean, Zelda's good and all, but they need something to kind of like show me...

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Like, because, okay, cool. I'm excited for Zelda.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
But how's it going to look on the Wii U versus like...

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I mean, because porting the game through the Wii U that's on a PlayStation 4 is totally fucking different, you know?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
How's it going to look between those two systems?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.000
And also, what is the draw for the NX? What is it that's going to sell me this system?

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
What's the Wii Sports?

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Well, no, not necessarily Wii Sports. What's like, how does it control?

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
What exactly is the hook? What's unique about this concept?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
How does the game sell the hook? Wii Sports is a great example of how to sell the hook.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Nintendo Land, unfortunately, was a bad one. Anyway.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Although, well, here's before the angry emails and stuff, it wasn't necessarily that Nintendo or Nintendo Land was the bad one,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
but, I mean, it's just like the minigame collection thing just didn't...

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
It didn't work the same way that it did in Wii Sports.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000
And I think, I just, I don't know, like, a lot of them, I think you needed too many people to really see how it worked.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I don't know. Anyway, I don't want to get into it.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I do have one more story for you guys, though, before I open up the Skype line.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
And that is about the game Momotaru Densetsu.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Konami has announced that...

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Hey, it's the little boy who came out of the peach.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:02.000
That's right. Momotaru Densetsu is a title from Konami, of all places, so I guess this is something else they have,

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:09.000
is going to be coming out for 3DS, Wii U, PlayStation 4, 3, and PS Vita.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
This was a board game style game, if you didn't know that.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
It was last on the Nintendo DS. The last Momotaru Densetsu game was in 2012.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
In the game, you can go around by ship, by rail, by plane, and you gain wealth by buying properties.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000
And you get rivals, like the god of poverty and so forth.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:38.000
So, no idea what else with this game, but more information, I guess, is coming on a Denjin Gaka Nico Nico livestream on May 5th,

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000
which actually would have already happened, but I didn't see any additional news that came out of it from there.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I didn't see a date or anything like that.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
But there you go.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:52.000
And yes, the main character actually wears a little peach on his hat, just in case you didn't know that.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
There you go.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Alright, that's it. We're going to open up the Skype line right now. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
You all have Skype on your smartphones and your game consoles and all that.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to touch on while we wait for some calls here.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
No, slow news week is slow.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Yeah, it was a little bit slow. I mean, there were some big stories, but overall it was a little slower.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I have had time at work now since I'm doing stuff that's data entry related, so I can listen to the podcast.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
So, I have listened to all of the episodes of guys on the show.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Oh, god. When are you going to come on and guest?

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I don't know. At some point. The problem is, it's hard for me to record during the week because I have to put the kids to bed.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
So, that means I'm not available until after 8.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I understand. What was your favorite episode of guys on the show?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Let's see. I'm trying to think.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Did you hear the recent one with trolling?

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Yeah, I did listen to the recent one. The trolling episode one.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I'm trying to think. Yeah, that's tough. Let's see.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Probably the... I'm trying to think what was the most interesting one.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It was... I'll say this. My personal favorite so far was the furry one.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Yeah, that was interesting. I like that one.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I think that was the one where I was really like, okay, we learned something.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Yeah, that was pretty cool. I don't remember. There was another one. It was about...

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Maybe it was the retro gaming one. I don't remember which one exactly.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
That's fun too. We're looking forward to doing more. It's a fun show.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Unfortunately, we were out for a couple weeks between the whole thing that I was going through with the personal issues.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.000
And then with... Extover was sick one week, so we couldn't do it that week.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
We were going to do the trolling thing last week, but we couldn't do it.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
But thankfully, Parman and Princess Irene were able to reach out.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Yeah, the problem is I don't know what... If I were to be on the show, I have no idea what my special interests would be.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
We need to talk about laser tag experiences from back in the day or something.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I think we need to tell laser tag stories and how Loki would bring back the laser tag world.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I think that would be a thing.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Or building a main cab is something Bobby is saying there in chat. We'll see.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Anyway, let's get to the Skype line. We got a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
You don't know your name. All right. Raginator, what's up, buddy?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000
For a second, I heard a little feedback and was hearing my own voice for whatever reasons.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
That got me off, but...

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Sorry about that. Well, what's on your mind tonight?

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Yeah, I just want to touch on something that Dr. Sakura kind of mentioned in a brief passing during her FUs of the week.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.000
The recent Star Wars sale that's been going on.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I was wondering if any of you have bought any of the Star Wars games since they've been on sale since the 4th.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Nope.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I've glanced over the PlayStation Network stuff a few times, but I'm like, ehhhhh.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I'm just... I don't know. I'm like, I'll buy it and they won't play it.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Yeah, I've been there, done that, bought like three or four of the games from Steam already, and I haven't touched...

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Well, aside from one, I haven't touched the rust yet, so...

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000
My biggest problem, which is both bad news and good news, is that I pretty much already have them all.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
So there's nothing new for me to get suckered into buying, because I already frickin' bought them at some point.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I want to say there was a Humble Bundle not that long ago that had a lot of the Star Wars stuff in it, so...

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I have those, and I have not played any of them.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Yeah, well, in reference to what Sky just said, no, I would say Steam Horror, but that would be like the Pac-Man and the Kettle of Black, so...

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:59.000
But on a semi-related note, the same sales going on over on Good Old Games, and there's one game on there that's not currently on Steam,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:12.000
which happens to be Star Wars Shadows of the Empire, which I never knew there was a PC version, but I'm definitely familiar with the N64 version.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.000
And first thing in the morning, as soon as I put a couple bucks into my bank account, so it's not too late by then,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
definitely going to go pick that game up, if only for nostalgia's sake.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:36.000
But, yeah, I did pick up three or four games from Steam already, including Rose Quarter 3D, I've been playing that off and on all day.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Still pretty fun, exactly like how I remember on the N64.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Yeah, I like going back and visiting some of those retro classics.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
You know, on the PlayStation 4, they have Super Star Wars, and that was kind of fun to go back and replay.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Just as hard as I remember! At least I was able to clear the first couple levels, and then it all goes to shit.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000
But, yeah, it's fun to revisit some of that stuff.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Yeah, ironically though, in terms of the retro Star Wars games, especially those that were originally on the Super Nintendo,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I had Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but I never had the original Super Star Wars, though.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
This is the one that I missed out. Was that any good, though?

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Yeah, but if you've played the other ones, you kind of have a sense, it's very similar.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
They're all very similar, but obviously the first game follows a little more of the plot of the first movie.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
But if you like the other games, of course you're going to like the first one as well.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000
They're all really solid platforming games.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I will say, though, if you're doing that whole gaming on a budget thing, don't forget the Old Republic, their MMO is free.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
So, that might be a Star Wars game worth checking out, too.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:53.000
In fact, I do think it's a pretty solid MMO, and worth your time if you're into the Star Wars universe, would be the Old Republic.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Yeah, definitely keep that in mind.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Now, what to consider is, even though I'm unemployed and therefore have a lot of free time,

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I still have a considerable scheme library that's not even taking consideration to dollar services like Good Old Games, Origin, and all that.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.000
So, trying to fit all those schemes I have in is proving to be a little bit of a task.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000
That makes sense.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Alright, well, you know what? I don't know how I have the time for games sometimes.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.000
And then I find that when I do game, I'm playing the same games, which I don't think is such a bad thing.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I still love Diablo and Final Fantasy XIV, these games, but it does sometimes cut into my availability to play other games.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000
But I do try to force myself at least once a week to play something new.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
And for nothing else, so I have something to talk about on the show.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Yeah, appreciate you talking about it here, because, I mean, like I was saying, I've got a decent-sized library.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:05.000
And as you can probably see, if you're looking to steam on a regular basis, I'm usually playing the same game over and over again,

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:15.000
despite having that decent-sized library, that game being mentioned too far in 2014, so I know the feeling.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:23.000
A good game is a good game, and if you honestly like the game, you're going to return to it constantly.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
So that's pretty much a good thing.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Alright, Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Sure, have a nice night.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
You too, take care.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:40.000
1877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
And as a reminder, if you've never called before, please give Echo123 a call on Skype before you give us a call,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
just to make sure your connection's working and all that stuff.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:52.000
You'll get the nice little British lady that says, hello, welcome to Skype call testing service.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
That's not quite right.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Not quite right, I gave it my best shot.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Anyway, any other last minute stories you want to mention, Loki?

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:05.000
I guess I can mention this, it's not really that important, but apparently there's a fun little bit that's been going around

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:15.000
about how Pornhub has noticed an 800% boost in Overwatch porn searches since the beta's come out.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:20.000
What characters? Winston?

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I can only assume, yes.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Touched by a Winston.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Oh, lord, alright.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
That's something.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Does any Overwatch porn actually exist?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Rule 34, right?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Yeah, somebody drew it and it's posted on Tumblr, I'm sure.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I'm sure that there's already 3D models that have been extracted and there's gonna be...

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Has there been actually filmed porn with people dressed up in the cosplay?

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Is there like a Final Fuck X?

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And yes, that is a real thing.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Which is just basically a cosplay show where, by the way, there's fucking.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Is that a thing? No?

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Anyway, well, I guess the phones are not really ringing, so that's that for calls tonight.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Let's see, SSG100Matt says, oh god, I just searched and yes, it's a thing.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
That'll teach ya.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
That'll teach ya.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And Rama says, it's not out yet.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Probably soon.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Tigerclass says, probably images of people shipping Winston and Tracer.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
You know what, I'm not gonna judge.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Not gonna judge.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I'm not gonna look at it, but I'm not gonna judge.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I guess that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawn Tradeout.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Believe it or not, a little bit early.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Again, a little bit of a shorter show this week, but probably because the news cycle is a little bit slower, especially as we get into E3 more and more.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Especially since some of these companies aren't fucking talking about their stupid games.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Or they don't have games to come out.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
We'll try to get some interviews in the coming weeks or something to fill a little more time here.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:01.000
We have some more stuff to talk about as we wait for E3 and whatever we're gonna get out of that show.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
At least from Sony and Microsoft if nothing else.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
But anyway, that is gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawn Tradeout.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Thank you guys so much for listening.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I actually saw some new people in chat tonight or some names I didn't recognize.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
So thank you very much for being here.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I really appreciate that.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
And I hope you enjoyed being here live.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
And if you like what you heard here at the show, I always tell this every week.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Please just tell a friend or five about the show.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Help spread the word.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000
But we can't use those voices if you don't give them to us.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
So thank you in advance.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Really appreciate that.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
It's time to go around and give everybody's final thought for the night.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Dark Sakura, welcome back.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Great to have you here.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And we'll see you next time.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
What's your final thought tonight?

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I miss burritos.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
You know, we're done early enough.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Chipotle's probably still open.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I guess I could get a burrito bowl.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I have a goal.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
And it is that core set.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Ah. Good times.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I got a mic to drop at GamerX and I'll leave it at that.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
All right. Fair enough.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
My final thought for the night.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I want to congratulate my partner of the past six years, Allen.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Got his driver's license this week at the age of 37.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Which I know you guys might be thinking.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
In a row.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Isn't that a little bit late?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And my answer is it is.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
First, he grew up in a big city where you don't need a car to get around.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
And second, it's never too late.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And that just kind of proves that.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
In fact, he had said tonight.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Why don't I just drive to the store?

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Because he's home from work this week.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
He's like, why don't I drive to the store and go get Pinkberry?

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Or why don't I drive out and get Pinkberry during the show?

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
And I'm like, why didn't you?

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Why? Why?

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Because he's too busy playing Dark Souls in the other room.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
He just like randomly.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Not Dark Souls three.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Dark Souls one.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000
But I bet he will finish the trilogy by year's end.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
But I still think that's really awesome.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
And big congratulations.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
He passed it the first time.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Did you know they don't do scores now?

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Because I asked him, what was your score?

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
And he's like, I don't know.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
I'm like, what do you mean you don't know?

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
They tell you your score right at the end.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Now it's you're allowed.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
They have a checklist.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
You're allowed to make 15 mistakes.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
What?

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
You're allowed to make 15 mistakes.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Why should you be allowed to make more than five?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Right?

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.000
It's 15 mistakes you can make.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
He made two.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Which was, I guess he did one that was like too wide of a turn.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
And whatever.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
You murdered four people.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
So you had 11 more people you could murder.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
It's like Carmageddon.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
He just, he hit two things.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I mean, I would think that, that, I mean, in everyday driving, yeah, sometimes you might

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
forget to signal, which I don't.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Because I'm perfect.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
You should never forget the signal.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I said, which I don't because I'm perfect.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
And some people may speed or go a little, go a lot too slow.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
You know, people make mistakes.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Some people get in the wrong lane and they decide they, oh, I really do need to cut across

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
all these lanes to make a right turn.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
That should be an automatic fail.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
That should be an ejector seat in your car.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Instead of just like, okay, if you made the rough, you're in the wrong fucking lane, make

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000
a U-turn and then correct your mistake instead of like, oh, I need to go this way.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Why aren't you guys letting me in?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.000
That should be an ejection seat from the car with an automatic pile of manure, you know,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.000
to cushion your fall in the shittiest way possible.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Literally, literally.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
You are evil.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Yeah.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
All right.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Let's see.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I'm looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
This is awesome.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000
MXC in chat says this news inspires me to get my license finally as well.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
That's awesome.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I will pass that word along to Alan if he's not listening in the other room while he's

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000
driving.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Um, and then Dungeon Buster said, 15 mistakes.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
No wonder drivers today are garbage.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I don't need a signal.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Turns across three layers and angers traffic.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
All right.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Anyway, uh, let's see what else in chat.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, Alan is doing burnouts and parking lots.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000
He has to experience teenage driving and Raginator says, in fairness, sky, I'm 38, nearly 39

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
and I never had a driver's license.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Okay.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I saw in chat, somebody really wanted to call and for some reason it didn't show up.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
So I'm going to take care of this really fast.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
So let's get to it higher on orange on radio.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Who's this?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Hey, it's Sherlock.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Hey, you know, you're really special because I let you call in after the buzzer.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
So, um, we'll get to it fast.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
What's up, buddy?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Uh, I'm a victim of delay, I guess.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Um, um, yeah, the reason I'm calling now is because, uh, I'm kind of going to be not around

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.000
for a couple of weeks, but, uh, I wanted to talk about a very,

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000
very, very important Kickstarter that's going on right now.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Please go for it.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Uh, it's for a game called colors and basically it's a, you know,

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:51.000
turn-based RPG that is, you know, it's going to be for, you know,

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.000
it's like a normal RPG, you know, uh, everyone can play it, but, uh,

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.000
also, uh, accessibility is being built into it from the outset.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Which you would think more games would just, I don't know,

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
consider accessibility from the outset, wouldn't you think?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Wouldn't you think that should be the day and age that we live in?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Yeah. Well, I mean,

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
But I know now, now all our listeners may not be aware, but you,

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
you yourself are a blind gamer.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.000
So accessibility issues are obviously of great importance to you as a gamer.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
What kinds of accessibility thing is colors doing that makes you so enthused

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
that you have to tell us about it? Because obviously this is doing something right.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Uh, screen reader support, um, screen readers are how, you know,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
us blind people use computers basically.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
And they basically let our computers talk.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:49.000
And, uh, so basically this will enable the game to, uh,

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:55.000
interface with screen readers in a way where the text will be read, um,

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:00.000
automatically as it comes in, uh, including, uh, menus and stuff.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Um, so this is actually unprecedented for a game like this.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000
I can't believe that this is like uncharted territory.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:15.000
This doesn't seem difficult. Is somebody that's creating this have an accessibility need?

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Or is this just like, no, we just actually thought to consider more people?

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Um, yeah, no, she just, she has a lot of blind friends that play games.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And so she was just like, yeah, you know what? Um, I, I want to do this.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Actually, she started off, um, making a, an accessible port of, uh,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Pokemon, kind of built from scratch, called Braillemon.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Uh huh.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:48.000
And, um, so yeah, she was kind of well known in the, uh, audio games community.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Audio games are, you know, basically games that are designed specifically for, uh, blind people.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Uh, basically just using all sound.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:04.000
But, uh, so yeah, and now, uh, she's, uh, moved on to this, uh, colors game.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:12.000
And, uh, the, uh, see, the thing that bugs me about this is that she's using Kickstarter,

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:19.000
which if she doesn't get all her funding, you know, she doesn't get any of that money.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Right.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And she's asking for 30 grand and just like, oh man, that's a tall order.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
It's a big bar.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It's a big bar.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
It's like, you know, if it doesn't end up working out, take it over the Indiegogo or something like that.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Yeah, she can always try something else or, you know, maybe if the right, if the right eyes or ears find this, you know, um,

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
that Mighty No. 9 company did a second Kickstarter. What was that called? The Red Ace? Was that what it was called?

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Yeah, I think so.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Yeah, something like that.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Red Ash, I think it was.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
That's it. Thank you. Red Ash.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:54.000
And then a lot of people were pissed off actually at this because a company came in and was like, oh, we're just going to fund it.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
So you never know. I mean, in this case, you know, I hopefully won't piss people off, but, you know, maybe somebody,

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:06.000
if the right ears or eyes find this, then maybe she'll get what she needs. Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:13.000
All right. Well, thank you for spreading the word. And if nothing else, just reminding us, accessibility, it's important.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Yeah. Um, so hopefully this will, uh, get funded and cause RPGs are my favorite genre.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:29.000
And, uh, so this will be like the first, because the thing I really, really want to do with this is, um, you know,

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I'd like to be able to like stream it on Twitch and be able to play it with the, you know, same degree as everybody else.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.000
I think that's, uh, that's not an unreasonable request. I hope you get to do it.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Yeah.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
All right. Take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Sorry to, uh, sorry to make you bring this guy back up.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
You know what? That's okay. I knew, I knew whatever you called in would be something worth mentioning, so I appreciate it.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
All right. Thanks, man.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
All right. Take care. Bye.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Yep. Bye.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Uh, all right. Now, now the Skype line is really done because, uh, I really let that one in under the buzzer.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.000
But I know, yeah, I guess some people get delay, some don't. I think it just depends on your connection at home.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Some people get on the wifi and it ends up buffering it a little more.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
But anyway, so to recap, we were doing final thoughts. Dark Sakura wants a burrito. I wanted to congratulate Alan.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
But we didn't do Loki. Loki, your final thought this week?

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Uh, my final thought is there's all these stores that I was going to go look for a controller and are closed.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I guess they start closing game stops now at six on Sundays. So.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Really?

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Yeah. So they're all closed too.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
So much for that. So much for that.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Oh, well.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Oh, well. All right. Well, uh, good luck, Loki. Try not to break people's eardrums next week. I hope you find the controllers.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Uh, maybe fries tomorrow or something. All right. That's going to do it.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show. Really appreciate it.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Have a wonderful week. We will see you next time here on orange lounge radio. Good night.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Or fog network, but you know, they were all still true.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.000
See you next week.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Thank you.
