Agents, it's nearly time to become the very best, like no one ever was.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Put down your XMPs and Resonators, a new encounter has arrived.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Pokemon Go is a go.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, May the 22nd, 2016 with the 642nd episode of our show

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
joined here in lovely Sacramento, California, Studio N7, by my side, as she always is over a very, very, very long time.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
No shit.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
How are you, Jamie?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
I was actually floored the other day telling someone about the podcast and realizing that it's been that long.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
I mean, I'm floored every time I think about it having been that long.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Sure.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
But it's like just what we do.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's just, this is our Sunday night thing.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
It's a thing.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
It's what we do on Sundays.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Some people watch Chair of Swords.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
That's right.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
We podcast.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
That's right.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Some people join a bowling league.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
We podcast.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
There it is.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, some people walk around, you know, naked down the street with some enchanting shame after them.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Is that what you used to do?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yes.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Before O-L-R?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I used to go to the Goth Club on Sunday nights.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Then there was O-L-R.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You remember my Bachelorette party.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I do.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
We watched Barbarella and Xanadu.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Wait, what does this have to do with Goth?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And went to the Goth Club right after her.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
That's right.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
That's right.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
We did.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
We did.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
All right.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Anyway, also joining us, say hello to, I don't know how often he went to the Goth Club, but

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I think like twice.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Did you really go?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, twice.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't even remember that.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I do remember-

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You were there every single night.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
I do remember the time you entered the DDR tournament and you dressed sort of like Keanu

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Reeves from The Matrix, kind of like you had the big trench coat thing.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And you were doing Dynamite Rave.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
And I totally fucked it up.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
And you failed the song.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
In front of all those people.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
That's because they didn't practice.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
That's all right.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
You tried.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
That tourney we named Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It was the Scat Tournament.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
The Scat Tournament.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I know.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
It was awesome.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So anyway, that is us here at Orange Launch Radio.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
You guys in our chat room, if you are listening live, you should join us live in our chat

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
vognetwork.com.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
And you can chime in with comments such as Ragenator in chat who says, bowling?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Who the holy fuck bowls anymore?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Hey, hold on.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I just went bowling like two months ago.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I think a lot of people still bowl.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
There's a lot of old people who bowl.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I wouldn't mind going bowling, but I want to do glow bowling.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Bowling's fun.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
That's like all bowling is glow bowling now on like Friday and Saturday night.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Some people just like to fondle their balls.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
And throw them at things.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Right.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Gotcha.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Tigerclaw defending bowling in chat saying bowling is fine.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It's a relaxing sport.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
S2100 Matt talking about the Sunday night thing going, I honestly can't remember what

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
I used to do on my Sunday night prior to listening to OLR 10 plus years ago.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
It's probably watching TV, honestly, because TV, it has all their big shows on Sunday.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
ActDeft in chat says, heck, the Applebee's around the street opened a bowling alley.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I actually, I want to talk about bowling a little later in the show because it actually

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
ties into my gaming week a little bit and I'll hold you with that.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
But we got to get to our guests because we have some amazing guests in studio this week.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Very excited to have these guys on the show.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
Finally, after just being down the street around the corner with their own show here

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
in Sacramento, say hello everybody to the cast of Video Game Bang is joining us tonight.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Aaron, how you doing?

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
I think I'm more excited being here than you are excited to have us here because this

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
is a full loop.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
We spoke before, of course.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm a listener from back then and now I'm sitting right here with you guys like actually

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
on the show.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
It's crazy.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, I would have never imagined this is full circle.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
No, I thought that was awesome.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And you said you were listening in the all games days, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
All games days.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Interactive and stuff.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
It's not taboo.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
We're all on good terms.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
We're all friends.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
This was like high school time for me.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Okay, but now you got to stop because that dates me.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
When you talk about, yeah, that's what I used to do in high school.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, sir.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So, but no, that's awesome.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
You know, I always say, I think the biggest possible compliment you can get as a podcaster

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
is that somebody else was inspired to podcast because of what you did.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Not that I'm saying we did that for you.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh no, hands down you did.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
Yes, but like Scott and everybody at all games probably played some part in that.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
And that's fantastic.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, you guys definitely had a hand in the creative thinking behind the show.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Thank you.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And just the motivation to do the show.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You guys have been doing this for a long time.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
And I'm just like, I mean, if I can even get a quarter of what you guys have done, I think

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I'd be happy with that.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I don't know.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
These are the guys I do the show with.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You guys want to say hello to Corey.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Corey's here, everybody.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm so flabbergasted at Aaron's modesty right now because this is so new.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
If you guys knew this man in our show, he is Sir Aaron Carter.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
The man has knighted himself.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Which, was it the Queen of England knighted him?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It's a long story, seven year story.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
He's refused to tell the story.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
And that's, I mean, kind of the back behind that as well.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
On all games, there was Mayor Young.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
He had his title like that.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Like the mayor of gaming.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Like I just kind of caught being paid from that.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
There was a story there.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
I believe he had done something involving with politics at one point or somebody had

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
always said he should run for mayor or something.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
There was a story there.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I just forgot it in my advanced stage.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I mean, there's a story behind mine as well, but I mean, I'm just copying the other black

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
guy.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
That's all it is.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
That's basically what that is.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
If he's out there somewhere.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Thank you.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
That's all I had to say.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
He is awesome.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Lawrence, if you're out there, call me.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Call me, bro.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
It's been forever.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Bobby's saying that he wanted to run for mayor of Los Angeles.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh wow.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I thought there was a story there about him running for mayor of LA or something.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Of course.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Of course Bobby knows that stuff.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
So by default, Aaron, what are you trying to accomplish?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I'm trying to be the knight of Sacramento, apparently.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I don't need to be mayor or king or anything.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Knighted, knighthooded.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
That's a go for Duke.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
If you were a king, if you were a king, you'd be making millions.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
You know how much those guys make?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
The Sacramento Kings?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, no, no.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
That's a bump joke there.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
All right.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
All right.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Also, I want to make sure we introduce this well.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
We have David here also from Video Game Bang joining us tonight.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Hey guys, how's it going?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Good.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
How are you?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Good.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Good.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Awesome.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Good to be here.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
He's the real David Webb.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I have to ask a question.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I swear to God I'm not trying to start shit, but I noticed there's three of you here tonight,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
but when I download the Video Game Bang show, I see their pictures.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, see, good thing you guys don't have cameras because Webb is hideous.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
If you could see his face, he's got a giant Jewish nose.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, now, now, now.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Hold on.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Hold on.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
The neck beard.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Hold on.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Well, I mean, initially-

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Jamie's going to back him up here.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Hold on.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Solidarity.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
What?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Initially it was-

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, fine.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Fine.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Me and Cory, that's, you know, started the whole thing.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You know, like the first, what?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Most of the time.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
The first most of it.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Ten episodes are kind of just us?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
And then we kind of just start trickling everybody into the thing and became a giant family.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
And then, you know, people came in and they leave and some people have skills to help

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
us in some areas and others get busy with life, but then only a year ago?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
A year ago?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Webb joined our team and he just takes so much of the load off of our shoulders.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah, he does.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
He takes a big load.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
He takes our loads all the time.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
You're a son of a bitch.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Didn't you initially come on as a iPhone expert?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
That was the very first episode.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah, Cory, there was a new iPhone 5S or something.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
And Cory was like, hey, I know a guy who's a big Apple fanatic.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I'll have him be on the show.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So I gave a whole like tutorial on-

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Okay, are you the her of this show?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Because she is also the Apple fangirl.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
That's very accurate.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
That's very accurate.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Okay.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Look at her laptop.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
She's got a little Apple logo on it.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm a recovering Apple fanatic.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Okay.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I've made the switch.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Uh-oh.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Uh-oh.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, then I better watch how far down that road I go then.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
All right.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
But no, no, that's awesome because honestly, it's not also just you three.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I see some other faces pop up on your show too.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
So you have like-

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
We have a roster of probably like 10 people.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
It's an eclectic class of friends from childhood.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Like Aaron grew up with some of the people.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Some of them I went to elementary school with.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And we've all been gamers our entire life, so we hung out with gamers by proxy.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
So when we don't have specific expertise in a style of game, we'll bring in,

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
oh, well, a friend of mine won a tournament in that, so we'll bring him in.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
And so it keeps us fresh.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It keeps the rotation so that every episode has something new.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
The dynamic changes from week to week.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
It's fun.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's a fun deal.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Awesome.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Awesome.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
For those listening, because I know our audiences, we may not have a ton of overlap,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
tell our audience a little bit about your show.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
If I'm going to download an episode of Video Game Bang, what am I going to find?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
So we do it twice a week.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
The Wednesday shows, you can find your basic news set up, what you're playing,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
and then a lot of interviews as well.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
We do interviews with kind of anybody that we can wrangle in from the industry,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
from musicians, like video game musicians.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
We've got indie developers, people like Ashley Burch from Hey Ash, What You're Playing.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
She's come on her brother.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
That was an interesting episode.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That was your birthday episode.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
We pulled strings to get Anthony Burch for Aaron's birthday because

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That's a major gripe.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
We spent way too many hours on our show debating Roland from Borderlands.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
They killed him off in the second one.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Sorry for the spoilers.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Spoiler for like a five-year-old game.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Suck it.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
So that happened, and Aaron complained about it week after week.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It didn't sit well with me.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
It didn't.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
It didn't sit well with me.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
So we were like, well, we had Ashley like a month ago.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Let's send her a message and see if we can get her brother, who wrote Borderlands 2.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
We got him on there, and Aaron was able to confront the god of the universe.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Of Borderlands, for a second.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Were you satisfied?

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
He gave me a sufficient answer, but I'm still not happy with the choice.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I mean, I'd say that.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
He gave the answer saying that Roland was the number one played character from Borderlands 1.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
So they really wanted to make players have an emotional reaction.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
So what's the best way?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
We kill them.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
So that's what they did.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
So I was like, I understand where you came from, but there was still no point in the story to kill that character.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, well they could always change their mind on that or something like they do with Saints Row.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh yeah, everybody loves Gat.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Let's kill him.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
But he actually, he said he didn't want to do that.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
I mean, they might, because he's not working with them anymore.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
But he said he wanted to keep death permanent.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
So it was just like, this character's dead.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
This is in a game that worked in a mechanic called the New You.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Really?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So every time you die, you get a respawn.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
It's not just a respawn, they justified your respawn.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
But we've talked to them.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Katrina Law from Arrow.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
It shocks me, some of the people who will talk to us.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Really, yeah.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
They have no reason to, they probably shouldn't.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
And how humble that the gaming community, especially independent developers, really are.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Well, yeah, we'll do your show.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
You had a lot of indie developers on leading up to the Sac Indie Arcade, which is when we finally kind of connected.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
I know you had a lot of them on your show leading up to that event, and I'm sure they appreciate it.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Trust me, any indie developer I've talked to over the years, especially if Kickstarter's involved,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
something where they really have to get the word out, Greenlight especially.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
They are more than happy to do that type of opportunity and have always been very humble and gracious and all that.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I love spotlighting them.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
You get the big names, of course, out there, and you're always going to get a Madden.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
You're always going to get a Call of Duty.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You're always going to get Gears of War.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Nintendo could fart, and it's going to be all over Twitter the next day.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Some of these indie developers, and that's not a slam against Nintendo.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Well, people were talking about Star Fox, so I guess you are correct.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Shut up.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
So they could do the littlest thing.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
People are going to speculate about them rampantly, and that's trending topics on Twitter for the next 24 hours.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Hashtag campaigns and everything, but an indie developer who's really trying to push, it can be very difficult.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
And they're some of the most creative talent out there.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
They have no chains on them from somebody saying, hey, we need this game out right now.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
We need it to be like this. We need it to be the next FIFA or something like that.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
They're like, no, I have an idea. I have creativity. I want to show it through this.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And I love that.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Our show is based on the mentality that we're just going to be honest.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
No matter what, we were going to say our feelings, whether we conflict with each other or mass opinion.

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
In our first couple weeks, Aaron single-handedly pissed off the entire PC gaming master race.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
And he held to his guns. So we just have our opinions, and we highlight the indie developers.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
We ourselves are indie.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
And other indie podcasts as well. I know in the early stage we were doing cross stuff as well with other people.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
Indie, I don't know. It just needs a bigger light. So if we can help that, definitely.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Have you ever found that you've changed your opinion?

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
I know I have. The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, boring.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
But I came back a year later and played it again. I was like, what was I smoking the first time I played this?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Look at me. I'm wearing a hat. I'm up BioWare's ass now.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
By the way, happy birthday BioWare. 21 years old today. Have a drink.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
I think the only one... I don't know if I've done that with games. I've only done that now with a movie.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
I think the first time that I said about the Warcraft movie, I was like, no, that's going to be terrible.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
There's no way this movie's going to come out and do anything. But then I saw the first trailer.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I was like, okay, you might have something on your hands here.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
But the movie still hasn't come out. So you might go see the movie and then be like, you know what, I was right the first time.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And then my gut, yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Flip flopper.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Exactly.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And you own a PC now that's powerful that can do some good gaming.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But how much gaming do I do on it?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, seeing as though you play 99% of Smite.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah. I do one game.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
No, I'm not going to let you pick on him because I play a ton of like Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3 on my PC.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
There it is.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Yet I consider myself a console gamer.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
There it is.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Well, I'm both. I'm both.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I'm right with you.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Everybody wants to rule the world.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm right with you. I'm right with you. I'm both.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
All right.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
My label.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Exactly.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Where was this here?

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Oh, Kaijuto had asked this question. Video Game Bang, is this a Pornhub podcast?

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
All right. So obviously there's, is the name supposed to be tongue in cheek?

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
Because obviously, am I just a dirty pervert where I go, hee hee, gang bang, hee hee.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
What is that?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That's the first time we've heard that.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
We're a good Christian podcast.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
What did he say? A porn what?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Porn hub.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
What is that?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
I think they sponsor esports teams.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It's all well received.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
No, we are not sponsored.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, no.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
No, yeah, we definitely fully understand the correlation between the two and we embrace it.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
It's a blessing and a Christian.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, we embrace it sometimes. Well, who was it?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Jason David Frank.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Was it Jason David Frank?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It was Jason David Frank. He was giving us a shout out.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And he's like, hey, you're listening to Video Game Bang.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
And we're like, no.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Is that the Power Ranger?

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, he was the green Power Ranger and the white Power Ranger.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
And then the black one.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Black.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
He's the Power Ranger who's like 45 and still a Power Ranger.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Hanging out with teenagers.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
And the MMA fighter.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh my God.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, he couldn't say when we tried to get him to do a promo for us or whatever.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
It was just tough.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Two or three times.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah, it was definitely tough.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
You'd be really surprised how far a good name can get you.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And how far a bad name will hold you back.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm not going to say OLR is a bad name.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I love the name of the show and it comes from a very special place and so forth.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I also realize people go Orange Lounge Radio.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You're not going to think, oh, it's a video game show.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Not a lot of people make that connection in this timeframe.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
But one star, there was a significant lack of lounge music on your show.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Maybe some lounge against the machine.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Maybe.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Get some Richard Cheese on.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
In the old days.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
We just talked about Dick Cheese on our show last week.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
That's an actual thing?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I thought you guys were making stuff up.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
No, we didn't make it up.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I have no idea what Dick Cheese was.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
My favorite song to this day is the cover of Crazy.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
The Britney Spears one.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yes, that's a good one.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
We actually listened on the stream Down with the Sickness.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
It was a beautiful thing.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
But the name gives us opportunities to come up with little creative things.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Like our number one shirt is I'm here for the gang bang.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
We call our-

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Okay, that's cute. That's funny.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
We call our fans the Bang Gang.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Is that what we call them? The gang?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah, we call them the Bang Gang.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
No, I think we call us the gang bang.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Whenever I put in the descriptions, that's what the Bang Gang is talking about.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
We don't talk about it nearly enough.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
There is definitely an explosion of some kind going on.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yes, there we go.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Who was the director that did the promo for us?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm forgetting his name.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
He did Tusk. It was his last movie.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Kevin Smith.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Kevin Smith, yeah.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yes, Kevin Smith.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Whenever he did the promo for us, and he's like,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
it doesn't sound as dirty, or it's not as dirty as it sounds, everybody,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
or whatever.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
He's like, you're listening to the video game, bang,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
and it's not as dirty as it sounds.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I was like, that's awesome.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
He recognized off the cuff, and he said it right, and he plays to it.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
He's a pro.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Corey, you call you guys the Bang Bros, right?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
That's definitely not happening.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah, me and Aaron are the Bang Bros.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
We are not.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
I really feel like Bang Bros I've heard somewhere else,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
and you may actually not want to be associated with that.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, exactly.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Exactly.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That's fine.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
So the lawsuit comes in, then he'll know exactly what you're talking about.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
All right, just don't Google it, because I don't think you're going to find yourself.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
You're going to find something else.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
You should see this bus I bought us on Craigslist.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah, no.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Oh, my God.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Let's see.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
ActDeftInChat says, is this crossover episode gang bang at the Orange Lounge?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I guess.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Wow.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Actually, it's a game bang at the Orange Lounge.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
StoppyInChat says, I guess I won't name my podcast video Blumpkin.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Do what you want.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Do it.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I'd listen.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
We have a cute name for our fans, too.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
The OL Army.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
That's actually good.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
It rolls right off the tongue.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
We didn't come up with that.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Really?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
But I like that name.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
But I did make a picture of a tank.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Yes.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
That was orange.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Awesome.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
It said OL Army on it.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
We don't have any logos for our fans.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
That'd be something interesting to see.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
We need to get on that.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Take that load.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
I feel like somebody actually registered the domain, the OL Army or OL Army 1 of them at some point.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
It just redirects to Orange Lounge Radio, but I always got a kick out of that.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Now I'm just thinking though of Hook.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
You can call it the Bangarang.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh, wow.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
How much do you want for that one?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That is trademark right now.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Get me a taco.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Too late.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I already mailed it to myself.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
She'll sell it for two tacos.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Done.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
John Doe's tacos.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Ooh.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
I've actually finally been there, and I got sick.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
But it was great.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
It's the best.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
I had a kiss.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Can I have peppers?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
All right.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Before we get into the news this week, I've got to know a little more about you guys as

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
gamers for the audience.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
They probably want to know what types of games you play.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
Because I know our show here at Orange Lounge Radio started about we all played DDR together,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
believe it or not, at Roseville Golf Land.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Orange Lounge was one of the bands that was in DDR back in the day.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
So we actually all met playing DDR at the arcade.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
It was never thinner my entire life.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Well, actually, let me ask that first.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
How did you guys all come together?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
They're going to ask about our weight.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
No, no, no, no.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
We do radio for a reason.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
You said something about childhood friends.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Are you all like friends from high school and this stuff?

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Or how did you all come together and say, I'm going to do a video game podcast?

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Me and Cory worked at GameStop together.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And actually, a lot of the staff at GameStop are all members.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
We can't call them staff because we don't pay them.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Wait, wait, wait.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
How long ago was this that you were at GameStop?

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
2004, I believe.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
That was, I think, when Dan was a manager.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I think it was, yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
My husband.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
No, because I distinctly remember hearing episodes.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
And when you said that, I was like, I work at GameStop.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
And I tried to find this Dan person.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I promise you.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Like, I have no lie.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
No, no, no.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I was just like, I listened to your hot show.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
And it was crazy.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
Well, the good news is there's like 5,000 fucking GameStops in Sacramento alone.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
So the odds are...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I can name all the ones he worked at.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I was Lolo.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I was just a GA back then.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
So I had no...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
When he started, it was a Funko Land.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yes.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
You know, I came a little after all that.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
There were no Funkos.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
We had just purchased Wii.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I don't care about that.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
They had just purchased Rhino Games was the last thing that I heard from them or something like that.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
And then I kind of was deployed.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
But a lot of the people were staff at GameStop.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And now they're, you know, VGB members.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And then there's web.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yes.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
That's how that is.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
He was just here.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
But that's literally how all of us...

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Well, we did a lot of Xbox Live together.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh, yes, yes.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I wound up at GameStop because I actually had a real job.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
And then I got fired.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
And the store manager owed me a big favor from high school.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Yes.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
So I walked in and I was like, hey, time to pay the piper.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I need a job.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Hired me.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I met some pretty cool people.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Aaron was really cool.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
We made friends on Xbox.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Played.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
He got free games then.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
So we played just about everything.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And we would banter about it.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And then, you know, due to Aaron's ego, he was like, we are really funny.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
We should probably do a podcast.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And I was like, well, we're okay.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
And I have the technology because I was a drummer for many years.

23:03.000 --> 23:11.000
So I had a bunch of microphones, mixers, and the ability to build a little cheap studio.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
We did that.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
And then we locked ourselves in a room for two hours, two or three hours.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
And it was the worst piece of junk you've probably ever heard.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I was amazing.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It was terrible.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We were talking about George Zimmerman.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
One of the Glee members passed away that day.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Cory Monteith.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
And we brought that up.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
We talked about that for a little while.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Now hold that thought.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm going to bring Glee up later in the show.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Hold that thought.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Okay.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Perfect.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Because I know exactly what you're talking about.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Our show is the anti-Glee.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I think on our one-year anniversary...

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Each anniversary, a Glee member passes away.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Yeah.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
So you're welcome, internet.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
You're doing God's work.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And it's odd, because I mean, it's strange the first episode.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
We're coming for you, wheelchair kid.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
I thought we were going to be expected to bust into a rendition of a Journey song here at the end or something.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I was a little worried.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
So now all you need to get is from the Deadpool movie, and you just need to get the Deadpool up there,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
put all the Glee members, and figure out which one's going to die next.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I mean, it's strange.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
It's odd the first time, but then when it happens exactly a year the second time, you're like, all right.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Something's going on.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Are we the Madden curse?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You're on the clock, Jane Lynch.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Wow.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
This is going to a dark place.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
You guys have some real Glee issues.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Glee means happy.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
What's your problem?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
The first episode was really not video games.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
No, not at all.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The first two or three were not video games.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It was kind of pop culture and stuff.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Even today.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I mean, we still use some stuff in there.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
We do a lot of video game stuff.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That's our focus, but now we're video game and pop culture.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Yeah.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Because there's so much stuff we want to cover and talk about.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Comic books, we're massive comic book fans.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
The Marvel movement, the movies and everything, we cover all that stuff.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Tech stuff, we just did a whole episode on Google I.O.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, only Google I.O.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
I mean, even in that episode we talked about the co-op, food co-op downtown, and all the natural foods and stuff.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
So we kind of spread a giant range.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
You know what?

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
Food issues speak to us here at Orange Lounge Radio, so I understand completely what you're getting at there.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
But that's awesome.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
You know what?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And I say that for anybody who's new, starting with podcasting and so forth.

25:12.000 --> 25:19.000
Your first few episodes are likely to be terrible, or at least you're going to think they're terrible because we're our own worst critics, right?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And it's not going to necessarily be what you expected.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
But you've got to stick with it, right?

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
If you have that plan, you say, I'm going to do this every Sunday, or in your guys' case, I'm going to do this every Wednesday, every Saturday.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
You know, once you get to a certain point, it'll be like second nature, for sure.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Yeah, and it's become a part of just like everyday life now.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
How long have you guys been going now at this point?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Three years.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Wow, good for you.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
About three, three and a half years.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Congrats.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
And I say it all the time, it's like therapy for me.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Like I can come after a long, hard day's work or something like that, and then sit.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
And I've actually come from like, I came with my grandmother, passed away, came right to the show.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
That's the interesting thing about the show.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You know, it's at my house most of the time.

25:58.000 --> 26:05.000
I run the ones and twos, but I've missed a lot of episodes, you know, because we go to E3 and stuff.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
But Aaron has held it down and not missed one episode of our entire history.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Nice.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Pretty remarkable, and got to give him kudos for that one.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
You guys do an E3 this year?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Yes, sir.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
We opted not to do it, which I'm not, you know, everybody's got to do what they got to do.

26:22.000 --> 26:28.000
But I'm kind of curious because there's been a lot of talk about, is E3 losing relevance and all this stuff?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
What's your guys' take on that whole situation?

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Like, are you guys still expecting E3 to kick ass?

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Are you going in with lowered expectations or what?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
My expectations are like floor low.

26:39.000 --> 26:50.000
It seems like it is losing steam because I think the big eye-opener for me was when last year Bethesda was like the number one.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It used to be who's going to win out of the big three.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Nintendo shows, Sony shows, Microsoft shows.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
But then when a game company comes out and is like Fallout 4 mic drop and everybody for the rest of the event.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
And have you guys played that new Doom? It kind of kicks ass.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And the Doom is, I mean, all from one company.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
So it's just like, all right, they stole the show over three major companies.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
It used to be a three-way battle.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Like, what happened to that, you know, the console wars?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
I don't think the console wars are even that big of a thing anymore.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Now wait a minute, because some would, to be fair, some would argue with you,

27:25.000 --> 27:34.000
because wasn't last year also the same year where Sony like literally just like peed glitter on everybody with this whole,

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
like, we're going to give you Shenmue 3 and the Final Fantasy 7 remake. God is real.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
So we gave all the wishes and stuff like that.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Yes.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
I don't know. I talked to a couple of people and I didn't hear any of them say I walked away wanting to be a Sony fan.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Like, I can't wait for Shenmue 3.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah, there's a lot of games that they have coming out still that, like, I don't even think of, like, the names for,

28:00.000 --> 28:07.000
like that one that was kind of the, like, retro futuristic, like almost like Monster Hunter type game.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Was it the one that looked like Rogue Cyberpunk?

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah, basically where it's, you know, technology has kind of taken over and there's like dinosaur robot things.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, the main female character, right?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah, yeah. I can't remember the hell the names of the game's called.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
But yeah, it's like stuff like that that I don't even think about, you know, consciously.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But that's coming and that looks really awesome.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Yeah.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
You know, they had that stuff. But yeah, like right now this year there's, you know, Nintendo's like,

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
oh yeah, we're just going to show Zelda, which is cool. I mean.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah, this is the first time where I feel like a company's like kind of set the bar low for themselves.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Like, don't expect nothing but Zelda. That's all you're going to see here.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Thank you, Dungeon Buster, Horizon Zero Dawn. That was the game I was thinking about.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
But yeah, there's a lot of like games that they kind of show and a lot of it's just, I don't know.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
I'm excited about Crackdown.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Well, there you go.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Eventually, whenever the hell that decides to come out.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I think it's this holiday. I think they're going to do it.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I hope so.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
We'll see. I do love this comment from Stoppy though. It's in our chat, live.vognotework.com.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
It's good that our expectations are low. Wait for some surprises to show up.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Then ask us whether E3 is still relevant.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I think that's a very good. I think that's a very good way to look at it.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
That's very fair.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
That's very fair because we may walk after this E3 going, oh my God, I didn't believe.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
Oh my God. They announced it was out today. What the fuck?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Best show ever.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah, I hope they do some. Oh, and it's out today, guys. Like, I really hope.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Oh, that's all. That's that's just one more thing.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
That's the shit we live for. Because there's so few surprises in the industry anymore.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Everything's getting leaked.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Yeah. Thanks internet.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah. Internet ruined everything.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
But so it's like those genuine surprises that really can like stay under wraps.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
I think that's part of what made Sony's press conference such a big.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
I mean, in part, and I love Sony in part, it was a huge deflection from look at.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
We have no holiday lineup, but here's some. Oh my God.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
You guys, Shenmue three.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
You know, everything is it was a Kickstarter, but that shit was was secret.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
And that's what allowed that press conference to just blow minds.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
I my thoughts on E3 a little different than Aaron's. Aaron is 100 percent.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
He does not curse on our show. He does not drink any alcohol whatsoever.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
So he's our church mouse. I like to partake.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
And E3 has been some of the best parties in my life.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
And see, I still consider us, even though we're technically going as press, I still feel like we're just guys.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
Yeah. Yeah. Are super lucky. Yeah. At this point. So when we get invited to the parties, I like to just go in there and steal T-shirts.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
I like to take all the order that you're going to get into the parties to. Oh, yeah.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
The first E3 part, do you remember like the first E3 party you went to? Because I remember the first one I went to, I'm like, what am I doing here?

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
I remember I went to Nintendo's E3 party and they had who the hell do they have playing?

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
They had some big band playing. Black Eyed Peas. They had Black Eyed Peas.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
Oh, God. Oh, that year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Because we got in because I not only was there as press,

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
but I also worked in the industry. So I got invited with my co-workers and stuff to go there.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
I mean, it was lame. But, you know, I remember I got yelled at for like filming Black Eyed Peas playing.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
They're like, stop that. Stop that. Well, they were doing you a favor, Loki. Yeah.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
I'll tell you what I remember, because I was a DDR freak moderator at the time.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
DDR freak parties where we did nothing but just drink and play taboo drunk.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
But but that you but OK, but that was that was a lot more fun.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
That was an invite only private thing. Benson, that's a lot more fun than going to this industry party.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Oh, really? OK. Because I don't like to be around a bunch of people.

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
I don't know. Elbowing people, I don't know. And drinking awkwardly in the corner, looking at a bunch of people.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
I listed three of my favorite things. And I think that I love elbowing people.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
I don't know. I think that's just personality stuff for sure, because some people don't like to be in those unfamiliar situations.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
I'm kind of like I'm like kind of like on the fence. Like I do like my environment to be controlled a little bit.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
But I get what you're saying. Like, you know, sometimes you just want to be social and go meet everybody.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
And this is my time to network, network, network. And I go into solo mode at those things.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
I go into solo mode at conventions. I go into solo mode at E3 every time that I went.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
It's just I avoid every other human being and zigzag through the crowds and go to where I want to go.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
Talk to who I want to talk. And then I move on. Well, it's also hard to know, especially even though you get in as pressed.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
You're not an IGN, so we can't talk to you. I used to turn my way into conferences, though.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah. Jamie was very good. Like, even though she's talking about this whole thing, she's very good at getting what she wanted.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
Because all you have to do is just look cute and talk to the Capcom people.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Well, I tried, Jamie. I tried.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Not everyone can be me, Rob.

33:01.000 --> 33:09.000
My first one was the Wargaming party. They threw a party and it was like, you remember Blade? The first party scene?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
That's what it felt like to me.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
So people died? Is that what you're saying?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
It was full of vampires.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Did Wesley Snipes show up and not pay taxes?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
There was a dude who looked just like Wesley Snipes.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
You were crawling on the floor and everything.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
But it was the most fun I've had.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
Web, actually, honestly, the reason why Web is our solid number three is because I kind of owe him my life.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
We went to a Twitch party once, an industry party, and if it wasn't for him, I probably would have died.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
Because it came to a moment where we were with another one of our members, Jada.

33:37.000 --> 33:44.000
And there was these guys, Puerto Rican dudes from Miami, because they let us know a million times they're from Miami.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Like, bitch, you're from a suburb.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
It was like in Telltale when you see the two paths.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
And Jada and these Puerto Rican guys were going to go off into the night and do who knows what.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And then Web was like, dude, let's go back to the hotel room.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
And so life paused, I looked both ways, and I ended up going with Web.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Sure enough, next thing we get a phone call in the morning from Jada, where are you guys?

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
And I just hear, who are you talking to? Thank you, Web.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
Well, that was my first really big convention, and so I was really wanting to be professional.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
I had interviews the next day, so I didn't want to be hungover talking to the guy from XSplit.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
And this guy, that was our second party, and you had definitely partaken.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
And yeah, I was like, it's midnight, it's San Francisco, we gotta walk back, maybe we should head back.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Web will remember that.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
Oh my gosh. Okay, so before we get into like gaming weeks and everything, I just kind of want to know like you guys as gamers,

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
and I always ask new people to OLR this question, so I'll ask you guys as well.

34:54.000 --> 35:03.000
Your favorite video game, and you gotta pick one, of all time, of period, all period, time period, and why?

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
My answer never changes, it's always Tetris.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Really?

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
Hands down, Tetris. I can play that game in every different iteration.

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
And I just, since high school, to a little bit of college, to now, Tetris is just my jam.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
That's what I love about it. I mean, it's a different game each time I try it.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Huh.

35:27.000 --> 35:36.000
And it's the only game that I can think of that has kind of stayed true to its original in almost every single iteration.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Well, we'll ignore the Hatris and the Welltris.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Well yeah, there's others.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
We'll just ignore all of them.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
It's all about Blastris.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
But I get what you're saying.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I got a question from the chatroom.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
D'Artessio wants to know which Tetris? Nintendo, Tengen, Atari, or Rika?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Nintendo.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
I played it on a whole bunch of different platforms. I even played it on Mac one time.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Game Boy or NES?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Game Boy.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Okay, yeah.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I prefer Game Boy over NES.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
So did you do Tetranet?

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
No. I did not.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Is that still a thing?

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
I don't know, but I did Tetranet for like four years.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
Do you like the new Tetrises? Like, Ubisoft did one on the PlayStation 4 that's like,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Tetris Ultimate!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
No, they're kind of weird now.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
Like, there was one I played, I think, on the 360, Tetris Bubble?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Or something like that.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And I was like, what is this?

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
There was the one that I think I peeked out and just said, alright, this is the final one.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
It was Tetris on the Game Boy Advance. Tetris Advance.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And it kind of stopped.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Wasn't there a DS1?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I think the DS1 was like the best one they did.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Oh, you know what? Yes. The DS1.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I played online versus people.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
And I remember, I played on a friend's, and he was like, you're gonna play online? You're gonna get crushed.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
And I smashed everybody I went against.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
And the DS1 is like Tetranet, if I remember right.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Like, they took some good ideas from the multiplayer there.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
So if you've played multiplayer DS, you kind of know Tetranet.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
So Tetranet is still a thing, although the last update I have is from 2012.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
But it's six person multiplayer online Tetris.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Oh my god, we need to set up a server.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
Bobby, how much would a VoG server cost for Tetranet?

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
That'll get more use than the Team Fortress 2 thing, I guarantee it.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And the Minecraft server.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And the Minecraft server.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
So Tetris, that actually is a great answer.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Well, I mean, they're all gonna be great, I'm not gonna tell you.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
That's a shitty answer. Get out of my house!

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
But, you know, Tetris just, you're right.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
It's like, the game itself, the core game just hasn't changed yet.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
It's like, this story's been being told for 20 plus years now.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
And it'll all come to fruition when the Tetris movie comes out and you guys are gonna love it.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
We shall see. We'll get to that in a little bit.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Corey, how about you?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I have more of a plebe answer.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
I have a few games that impacted me major throughout my life that I just sunk so many hours into.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
Like Super Mario World, Tekken, and even like the wrestling games.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Like, you know, WCW versus NWO.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
But I have to say Halo 2 is my favorite all-time.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
You're gonna win a lot of fans here at OLR with that answer.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Well, I was like in a clan. No offense, Aaron.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, wow.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
But I was the commander of a clan as like a high schooler.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
The high wizard? Is that what you were?

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
No, we were a DoG. I had my own branch called...

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
You were a dog clan leader?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I was a dog clan leader. Decisals of gaming.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
So you were the head bitch in charge.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
That's accurate.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
That's very accurate.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Never thought of it that way.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
That's definitely very accurate.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
But it was so much fun, man. We organized tournaments.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
We brought in new members. We had to run through the do's and don'ts of being in our clan.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
You don't circle boost. You don't quit out of matches.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
You don't teabag. You don't use races. We would do all these things.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
And we'd compete against KSI.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
You don't have racism in your clan?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
No, there's no racism. We did not allow for it.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
As backwards as that sound.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Wow, yeah.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
But no, I spent a lot of time. And that kind of really pumped me up for gaming again.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Because we all play games as kids.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Then it feels like something has to happen in that transitional period.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
To where you're like, okay, I want to continue doing this and not play basketball or football or something like that.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
And it was Halo. So Halo 2 is my favorite.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
Halo 2 is such a... I mean, as much as we have the inside jokes here on OLR about why Halo is not going to be the classic game of the week.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
And Jamie's things and all that stuff.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
We all have to admit Halo 2 and the way that it pushed Xbox Live forward.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
Games are forever changed because of it.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
I mean, really. In a way, I don't want to be this direct about it, but I guess I'm going to be.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Halo 2 kind of killed the arcade. In a way.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I can see that, yeah.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Just from the soundtrack. That's the only game where I had a soundtrack.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
And I'd listen to it over and over again on my MP3. My Zoom player.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
It was like movie-style quality music.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
Oh, yeah. And then that guitar riff. I was a rock guy.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.000
When they put Steve Vai on the track, I was just bought. I was sold.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Satriani? I can't remember.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Love it.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I was going to say David, but I noticed they call you Web. Should I be calling you Web?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah, that's fine. I'm used to that.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Web! Your top game.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
Mine's similar to Quarry, but it's Halo 1. The first Halo.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
That got me... That was kind of like Quarry.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
Halo 2 was this serious game that got him into gaming, and Halo was mine.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Were you in a clan as well?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Were you in a clan as well?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Halo 1 was not live.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Well, you could LAN.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Right. Which is... I did that every weekend.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
Every Friday night after high school, we'd go grab our Xboxes, meet up at a friend's house.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
We had... His parents, for some reason, let us do that.

41:03.000 --> 41:10.000
But we had five TVs in five different rooms, and we're whispering to each other in the same room trying to like...

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Yeah.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
True story. That was my husband's bachelor party.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
That's an awesome bachelor party.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
A Halo LAN.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
That's legit.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Do you know the first time I ever got exposed to Halo?

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Because I had always kind of written it off as like... That's kind of like... It seems like more of a bro game.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I don't know if that's something I'd really be into.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
First time I ever played Halo.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Shit you not.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
I went to a wedding, and the bride and the groom came down the aisle to the music from Halo.

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
And then the reception was a bunch of TVs with Xboxes, and we played LAN Halo.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
Swear to God, to this day, one of the best weddings I ever went to.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
That's amazing.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
And I bought an Xbox not even a month later.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It's light red.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
What?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It's lightish red, it's not pink.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
But anyway, I ended up buying the Xbox not even a month later.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Because I was sold on Halo.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
And this was even before the Xbox Live and all that.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's unfortunate what's happened to the franchise.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
I mean, I fell off, you know, shortly after 3.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Because 3 was good and all, but they got rid of the clans.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
And so with that, I lost a lot of the people I played with all the time.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And then, you know, life kind of takes over.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
But man, Halo 2 with the BXRs and the super bounces is just redonkulous.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
Let me ask this quickly, since you guys are not shy for controversy.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
Let me ask a controversial question in the Halo universe.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
How do you guys feel about Destiny, which is in some ways supposed to be the spiritual successor to Halo in some ways?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
How do y'all feel about that?

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
This has been a hot topic in our show.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Yay, ratings! That means ratings!

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah, right?

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Aaron has always been anti-Destiny.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I wouldn't say always.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
99% of the time.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
The first time somebody at Bungie said Destiny, I was excited.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Just the word Destiny got you excited.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
Then, yeah, the more they revealed, before they even revealed gameplay.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
When they were talking about the story and what they wanted to do, I was all on board.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
But then when I saw what they did, I aborted that mission.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
That was done.

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
I was at the E3 right before the launch, and I got to do a meeting with Bungie.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
The outlet we go with is Nerd Reactor.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I was like, you have to give me this one, because I'm a huge Bungie fan.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
You have to put me there.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
The guy who was walking me through the game was a developer.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
He was like, so you played some of our other games?

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Of course, because these guys are like, they knew I knew who they were.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
He's like, yeah, I actually did development on Halo 2.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I was like, puppy-eyed.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
I started playing the game with him, instructing me.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
He's like, why don't you jump on that sparrow, young lad?

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
I jump on the sparrow, and I was like, wow, this thing reacts just like a ghost.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
He's like, no, no, no, no, it's not a ghost.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It's a sparrow. It's way different.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
I jump off, and I grab a shotgun, and I start blasting.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
I was like, those guys look just like elites.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
This shotgun reacts just like the shotgun.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm saying it as a compliment, because I love the game.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
He's like, no, no, that shotgun's way different.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Those are not elites. That's the fall.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
It's just thing after thing.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
I was like, bro, don't hide it. It's fine.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Are you sure this isn't a skim? Is this just DLC right here?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
That's all I expected.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
This is Halo 2, isn't it?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
That's an awesome story.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
That's a perfect E3 story, too, right there.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
That's how it is. I bought it hook, line, and sinker.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Got the game day one.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Played it pretty consistently for about four to six months.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And then just got super bored.

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
Once you beat it all, because you can beat it in a week, not even.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
It's just a few days to really hit max level.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
They still have those really passionate fans, though, for it.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
You can beat it, and you max, and you get everything you wanted, all the gear.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
But they still have those passionate fans for some reason.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
To be fair, I need to go back and probably check out Destiny at some point.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
I played it hard for a month or whatever,

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
but I was just really frustrated in the endgame that you needed light to level up.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
And I was like, what kind of fucking system is this?

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
I never knew you could single-handedly screw your entire game by messing up the endgame.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
That's where my head was at.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
But I heard they kind of went back and changed a lot of that.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Let me ask you guys how you feel about this,

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
because this is one weird trend we've had just in the past five years in gaming,

45:23.000 --> 45:28.000
is that you can fix your game with a patch.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
Because Final Fantasy XIV, I don't know if you guys are into MMOs or any of that type of stuff,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
but Final Fantasy XIV was absolute garbage when it first came out.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
It was garbage MMO, one of the worst I've ever played.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Now, probably the best one on the market.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
And I wonder how many people really went back and gave it a second chance.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Amazing.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Diablo III, not so great when it first came out.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Now I can't stop playing it.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Destiny, a lot of people have actually compared to Diablo III.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Webb, what are your thoughts on that?

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
Yeah, because I was the longest playing Destiny player in the group,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
and I kind of related to cocaine.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
Cocaine is really hard to drop, and so was Destiny.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
You speak from experience.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
I do, yeah.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
You can't see me, but I have scars on my...

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Yeah, it was really...

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Especially because I put so much money into it with the two expansions,

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
and then after I played the second expansion,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
just because I had already prepaid for it,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I was going to drop it, and then the new one came out,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Taken King, and I was like,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
okay, it looks like they fixed some stuff,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
but really they just polished a turd and make it look shinier

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
to distract you from it's still a turd.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Couple thoughts on first impressions for video games.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
They're so important, especially for me and you, I'm sure.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
We've got stuff to do. We're doing podcasts.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
We're doing appearances. We're doing articles.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
We have to stay up on what's hot.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
We have to keep playing the new games.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
You have my attention for a short time.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
The biggest example I have is Assassin's Creed Unity.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
So bad. Unplayable.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I'm sure they patched it up, and it's fine,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
but I just don't have time to go back and play it,

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
and it didn't hook me.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
The other one for me is Division, and just bad timing.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Wow.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
First time I played, of course, servers are down.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I get it the first night, and I'm excited.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
Nothing launches good anymore. I've come to realize that.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, no.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
I get it. It doesn't work.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I decide a week later, oh, let's play.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Aaron gets on. Web's on. I'm on.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I sit down to play my game.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Okay, there's an update, so I wait three hours for an update.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Get to play the game,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
and they take the servers down for maintenance.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Never tried to play the game again.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
Yeah, the whole thing of we can fix a game.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Just put it out there. We'll fix it later.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
That's definitely a trend.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
It's a very poor trend.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
But when you have to rehaul a whole game,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
like how you said they did with Final Fantasy,

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
how they did with the system for Destiny,

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
I wrote an article saying, are these just tests?

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Like, are they putting these games out just to see,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
hey, do you like that? No? Okay, then we'll just wipe it all.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And I got, first comment was like,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
you don't know what you're talking about.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
Actually, I said, was Destiny one giant test?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And, yeah, my first comment was like,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
oh, you have no idea what you're talking about.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
The game was amazing.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
And I was just like, I just want you to think.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
I didn't want you to, like, I'm not saying it was.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Besides Destiny's Horde endgame,

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
I can get around some of that, but what really killed it for me

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
was how they abused the fans monetarily.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Like, they screwed everyone who bought the game

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
and who was an early adapter when they came out with that big expansion.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
First of all, that expansion didn't come with the pre-purchase version of it.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
And then second of all, they released a full retail version

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
where if you bought the original game and the DLC,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
it was like standard price.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
But if you bought the game, you know, spent 60 bucks before,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
just for the DLC by itself, it was 40 bucks.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
Yeah, so you're well into the century mark

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
by the time you're playing the latest stuff with everybody, right?

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah, reward the people who are playing your game and making it what it is.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I can't stand when people do that.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
That was the good news about XIV when they rebooted it,

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
was that if you were an early adopter, you got the new one for free.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
So that was kind of nice.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Jamie, I thought I saw you trying to jump in on the whole Destiny stuff.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I was just more saying this way.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
I think that BioWare is doing the right thing with Mass Effect Andromeda

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
by delaying the release until they know they have a polished product.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
And honestly, it's like I've said before,

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
I would rather wait for something good than, you know, have a turd.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I mean, really enough.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Isn't it interesting, though, that most people, I think,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
will agree with you in what you're saying and they accept that,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
but yet when it comes to the Nintendo NX,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
a lot of people are having a difficulty swallowing that pill.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
What do you mean you're going to launch a console outside of Christmas?

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
What are you doing, Nintendo? You're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
Isn't that interesting? I don't know.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I've got to see what that thing does.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
It's too much of a nobody knows what it's going to be about.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
There's a whole bunch of rumors and speculations what it might be.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
I mean, I have no problem with them dropping it summer or something like that,

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
but just let me see what it is.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Yeah, tease me already.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
God.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Where's that little video they had with the Wii remote

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
where they just showed people chopping things

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and then they had all the sound effects?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
They didn't show you any graphics, any gameplay.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
They showed a remote and then people moving it,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
and they were like, just imagine, and then they left,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
and then they came back and told you what the actual remote did,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Wii Sports and all that other stuff.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
And, and I can't stress this enough, and then we'll end on this

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
and move on to our gaming weeks,

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
but Nintendo has got to have that game that sells that concept

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
because Wii Sports sold the Wii.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Tetris sold the Game Boy.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Super Mario Brothers.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Duck Hunt sold the original NES.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
If Nintendo, Nintendo Land did not sell the Wii U,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
that's how, I mean, but that, we laugh,

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
but that's how important that launch game is.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah, you could say the same, going back to Halo.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Halo is what made the Xbox one.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
But did it, was Halo a launch game for Xbox?

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
I don't even remember.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
It wasn't a launch, number one.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
It was damn close. It was the first couple months.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
It had me, me and my friends sat in Fry's until it closed playing that,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
and they never put it up again,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
and it definitely sold us on.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, by the time I got, I remember my, my original Xbox was different.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It was actually like a Halo Xbox.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
It was like green and transparent. It was all like weird, different.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Oh, yeah, that one, yeah, I remember that one.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Yeah, it was a nice looking system.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
All right, anyway, let's see, going to our comments over at Live.vognetware.com.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Bobby Blackwolf confirming,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Halo was a launch title on the original Xbox.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
It absolutely was.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Dr. Su is saying, just, Halo didn't have live support.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
It just wasn't up at the time.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
Dungeon Buster says, I'm tired of the NX rumors at this point.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
OMG, they're using colors on the case, whatever.

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
Kaijuto saying, in his perspective, Wii Sports didn't sell the Wii.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
The Wii sold the Wii.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
Wii Sports would come, people would come into GameStop all the time

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
with their scratched copies, like, do I, I need another one.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
I need my fix.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Give me another hit.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Yeah.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
I will say, Microsoft was not the first one to have multicolored systems.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Oh, no.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
The Dreamcast had that clear white one that came out in Canada.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
And the Hello Kitty one.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
The Hello Kitty ones that came out in Japan.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
And then there was also a blue one that came out in Europe.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
And...

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I guess Dreamcast would have been the first one,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
because they didn't really have, like, different colors on Super Nintendo's, Nintendo's, Genesis.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
N64 had a...

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Oh, that's right.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
I had a Pikachu N64.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Yeah, I had like a, I had a, the basic gray one,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
but then my neighbor had the blue one.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
Donkey Kong Country Bundle or whatever it was there.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And then on my Nintendo, I had a Sharpie.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Alright.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Let's get into Our Gaming Weeks.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
We're almost an hour into the show, haven't hit a single story,

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
but that's what happens here at OLR.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Oh, whatever.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Especially now it's two podcasts, so it's like, it's gotta be like,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
it's gonna be a gigantic show.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
Four hour show.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
But no, I really do want to thank you guys for being here this week

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
and bantering with us.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
It's awesome, man.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Good time, good time.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
So we'll get into the news here shortly, as well as Our Gaming Weeks.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I think it's really where we want to start off.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
So quickly, since there are so many of us this week,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
we'll just kind of hit a few highlights of Our Gaming Weeks.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
There's Sakura.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
I got a terabyte hard drive to add into my system.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
So I've moved my entire Steam library over and my Origin library.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
So I have actually played a little bit of everything,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
just to make sure it worked.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I've reinstalled Dragon Age Inquisition.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
I have to remod it.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I have to remod Mass Effect 3.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I've been playing some Danganronpa 2.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I'm still not to the second trial,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
so Shane's probably going to yell at me.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
I've played some Happy Home Designer.

53:31.000 --> 53:38.000
I have Ingress, which, oh, my God, I am so close to eight.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
I don't care what Jason said in our intro.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
I'm going to keep playing Ingress because I'm going to hit freaking level eight

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
this week, if I can help it.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Rob, you're helping me level tonight.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I've got some issues with Ingress.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
We'll talk about that a little later in the show.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Issues?

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Yeah, we'll talk about that a little later in the show.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
And also, I'm still stuck on the Dragon Age.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
Here's a Dragon Age thing on iOS.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
And I actually am going to be getting a controller for my Apple TV

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
so I can play Sonic CD on my Apple TV.

54:11.000 --> 54:19.000
I think a $64 controller that only works with my Apple TV would be worth it.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
People do crazy things to play the one game.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
People do crazy things for love.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
That's right.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
With a good soundtrack, Bobby, with the Japanese one, which is the best one.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Don't sass me.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I do that when I get a new TV.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
I have to play all the games on my consoles just to make sure they work on my new TV.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
How often do you buy new TVs, Bobby?

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh, we also had Killer Instinct on Super Nintendo today.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
This is important.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
It is very important.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
And we gave away one of our Super Nintendos, one of our six ones.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Why not me?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
We have six Super Nintendos.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
There's one.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Somewhere.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I gave you games.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
I don't have six.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Yeah, you can borrow some of our spares.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
All right.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
But we gave it to a young-

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
It doesn't have a portable game system.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
Yeah, I also have the Retron, so it's like if I want to play any of that.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
We gave it to a young person to introduce him to the history of gaming.

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
And I'm going to be buying Julian Mega Man 2 because he watched some of the playthroughs going,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
this game's cool.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Good.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Raise him right.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Good boy.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Julian is an eight-year-old boy.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Yes.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Very good.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
So we'll just go in a big circle here.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Webb, I'll go to you next.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
How was your gaming week?

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
It was slow.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
I'm in the middle of a move, so I haven't been able to play a lot.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
But I did play some Smite earlier on in the week with these guys.

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
Yeah, it was like each couple nights this week we played like two, three hours.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Just smiting about.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Just play again.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Just play again.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
You guys ever play it?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Honestly, no.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
And the reason why, well, but I have more and more friends that are getting into it.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
It's probably in my Steam library.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
I just haven't checked.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Well, it's free.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
It's free.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
It's on PS4 and Xbox One and all that.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
It's kind of like League of Legends, but my understanding is the big twist is it's more

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
like from like a Warcraft perspective where it's like over the shoulder.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Yeah, third person.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
That type of thing.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Yeah, right?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
And a lot friendlier community.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Okay, good.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
Because that's what I'm afraid of because when I play League of Legends, oh my, no,

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
like I heard better things in high school than I hear on League of Legends.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
Heroes of the Storm, I like that because I feel like it's dumbed down for someone like

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
me.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I feel like Heroes of the Storm is kind of like easy mode.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
And I think that's what Blizzard does.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
Not that Blizzard does everything easy mode, but I think Blizzard does a very good job

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
at like mass marketing a good idea.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So that's why I kind of like Heroes of the Storm.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
It's very, very like commercial and easy to get into.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
So that's kind of what's always held me back on smite is that I'm like, oh God, I'm

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
going to be terrible and they're going to eat me alive because they do emo.

56:38.000 --> 56:46.000
Yeah, no, that community is like a 180 from League and you might get one toxic person

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
every six games, but that's a very forgettable person like real quick.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Is Corey leading the smite clan where he has all these rules?

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
You're not going to do this?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
You're not going to be a respectable gamer?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Aaron would break the racism rule too quickly.

56:59.000 --> 57:04.000
No, I believe I play the most out of everybody.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
No, there's probably one other guy, Jerry.

57:06.000 --> 57:13.000
He probably plays more than I do, but definitely I play a crazy amount of that game.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
I think that the community, I think it's probably just as toxic as League, but it's

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
a lot harder to talk shit on a controller.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Yeah, there's another good point.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I think most people are using controllers.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
God.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
So you guys are playing on like Xbox one.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
I played on the PC.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Oh yeah.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
We all play on the PC.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
That's the one good thing about the game though.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
Cause Aaron always has issues with PC because there's like the skill gap between mouse and

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
keyboard typically and, and controller.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Right.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
And in smite, it really seems like that's nullified.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
Like you can do work with just a controller and throw down with people using keyboard

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
mouse.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Yeah.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Yeah.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
You can go toe to toe.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Like you can think of a first person shooter versus, you know, controls versus a mouse

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
and keyboard.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Mouse and keyboard smashes all the time.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Right.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
That's why I bought Doom on PC.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Exactly.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Yeah.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
But when it comes to smite, it's like you're on a level playing field.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Like, yeah, you couldn't tell the difference.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Yeah.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
Like the, the game I do play a lot of Fung-Hezi 14, you know, that exists on PlayStation four

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and PC and I got to say they did a good job.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
So I feel like they're figuring it out now.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Yeah.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Yeah.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
You can do PVP with the PlayStation four people.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
I'm on PC and it's there.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
It's toe to toe.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
It's, it's same, same.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Okay.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
So smite.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Awesome.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Cool.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Uh, Corey, what about you?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Well, I did play smite with them earlier in the week.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
I made some time to, uh, start playing fallout four again.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
Uh, I'm not jumping into the DLC quite yet.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
The far Harbor stuff, because I, I started a new, uh, I don't know.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Did you get a press copy of fallout four?

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
No.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Okay.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Yeah.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
So I'm in my version and we played through and it was the first time I've seen this.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
It said press copy.

58:42.000 --> 58:48.000
And as soon as the, uh, game launched, it disappeared out of my steam library.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
So that was like pretty cheesed.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
It took me a while before I got it back.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
And in, in the interim I had to redo my computer, so I lost my save file.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Interesting.

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
I thought I'd heard about that, that they like had pulled it from steam libraries and

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
stuff.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
It was kind of interesting.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Yeah.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
So it took me a while to get back.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.680
So I'm in my second play through having a very hard time getting through the story for

59:06.680 --> 59:10.560
a second time, just because it's so bad.

59:10.560 --> 59:11.560
But I'm almost there.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.200
And then once I get through that, I'll start playing the DLC.

59:14.200 --> 59:20.880
I also got to do my regular street fighter five training and then that's, that's been

59:20.880 --> 59:21.880
my week.

59:21.880 --> 59:22.880
All right.

59:22.880 --> 59:24.280
Aaron, what about you?

59:24.280 --> 59:25.400
Lots of smite of course.

59:25.400 --> 59:31.760
Um, and then I literally on my phone, I picked up this game called a color switch.

59:31.760 --> 59:34.080
I don't know if anybody's played that before.

59:34.080 --> 59:39.640
Basically you just tap the screen to have the colored ball go through the same color

59:39.640 --> 59:42.960
and it'll have obstacles in between.

59:42.960 --> 59:46.320
So it's like four colors, but you're trying to get like purple through purple, red through

59:46.320 --> 59:50.000
red and the obstacles will spin or go side to side.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.320
And if you don't hit the right color with it, it'll blow up and it's literally like

59:54.320 --> 59:57.360
flappy birds just with a different tape.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.540
But it's, it's really addicting.

59:59.540 --> 01:00:03.240
Like you can sit in a, I don't know, like an office or on your lunch break or something

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.320
and you just tap away and well, that's a phone games are really best.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320
Exactly.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320
Yeah.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.680
So I mean, I've kind of been playing the water down and becoming a phone game gamer for a

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.200
little while, but yeah, I like it.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200
It's fun.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200
So nothing wrong with that.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.640
Loki, how about you?

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.880
I played all sorts of weird shit this week.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:25.440
So um, I finally, I realized that the, Hey, there's an app on my, um, on play, the play

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.640
store that I can actually run cardboard games on my gear VR.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.980
So I kind of experimented with that.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:38.600
Next I played a little bit of Vanguard V. I tried this in mind VR and in cell VR, which

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600
are kind of neat.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.420
They're like little tech demo things.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:50.860
Um, and I'm glad that Vanguard runs, uh, well on my phone and then finally, finally I was

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.480
able to find a controller at retail.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.900
And the clouds parted and the sun shined down and the angels started singing and blessed

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.900
you.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.180
And then they started carrying Bluetooth, Android, clearly God heard last week's episode

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.020
was like, I am so sick of this shit.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.500
It was at Best Buy, which, which makes sense because I was like, dude, you guys are selling

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:18.080
gear VRs like by the boatloads and you have Minecraft out on it now.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.500
It requires a controller and you don't fucking sell the controller.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.180
I was, I was listening to that episode today and I was feeling really guilty cause I had

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:35.380
two Bluetooth controllers sitting in my office and I haven't even connected them to my gear

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.380
VR yet.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.860
I'm just looking at him.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.860
I have two.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.860
No, I got him.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.420
I got a steel series.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.380
Jamie sent me a text message earlier this week.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.660
Do you want to just go have these, get him a controller, shut them up.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:51.380
No, she didn't say that I did, but you know, but I did, I did say so because one of one

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.500
of my coworkers listens to the show and he messages me like, why doesn't he just order

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.780
it online?

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.540
Because I'm not shipping that shit.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:02.340
I just want to get it out of store and get it.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.820
We're not going to rehash last week.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.820
Just don't.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.820
Prime exists.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.580
They, yes, I understand that.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.980
But the good news is he found the controller and now he can talk about playing it.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:12.980
Yes.

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:18.620
So now I'm going to talk about playing Minecraft on gear VR and it's, it's pretty awesome.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:25.360
My only gripe about it would be that the lighting in the game during daytime, it's hard to

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.200
see the world seems very flat.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.120
Like it doesn't, the 3d doesn't seem to pop on it.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120
The earth is flat.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120
Yes.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.300
The earth is flat in Minecraft.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:41.280
But yeah, so when it hits nighttime though, or when you have like different lighting than

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.880
it actually kind of pops out a little bit more, but it's pretty fun.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.440
It's I built a, you know, mine cart and kind of a little roller coaster thing and you know,

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.760
tried that out and yeah, it was nice.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.760
I'm playing in the mode.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.760
They have two different modes.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.240
VR casual mode type thing where, Oh, this is for most people won't get sick by this

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.240
and there's one that's like, yeah, this one probably not for everybody.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.400
You're probably gonna get sick from it.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.480
So I'm playing in that mode.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.000
So VR is now in casual and hardcore.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.200
They have tolerance modes or like different tolerance levels.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.200
Actually.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200
That's probably not such a bad idea.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200
Yeah.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200
So it depends on how motion sick it gets.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.600
I'm playing in the actual one that you're probably going to get motion sick on because

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.400
you turn faster and stuff.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.280
Otherwise it segments, it turns and slower.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.320
It is a little weird though, because like I'm very used to, you can use the right analog

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.520
stick to turn and I do that to the term I look at stuff so I don't have to like just

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.880
spin around where I'm sitting, but I'll be, you know, kind of forced to have it, trying

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.720
to look up and I'm pushing up.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.800
I'm like, Oh wait, I got to move my head up.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800
Oh, okay.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800
There you go.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800
I'll just take some getting used to.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800
Yeah.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.080
It takes some getting used to, but I love it.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.080
It's fantastic.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080
It's seriously what would sell.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.800
I think this is going to sell a lot of people.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.360
Is there any multiplayer in it?

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.680
Yes, there is actually, it's basically the same multiplayer as, um, any of the pocket

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680
edition stuff.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680
So you can play with windows 10.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.360
Um, you can play with anybody that has the Android iOS, any of the, you know, pocket

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360
edition versions.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360
Hmm.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
Yeah.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360
I might have to pick that one up.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.360
So it's pretty awesome.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.980
Um, so after all that was said and done on all that angst a couple of weeks ago, it actually

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.680
ended up being awesome.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:18.480
I spent $60 to buy a fucking controller to play a $7 game, but it's, but it's great.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.480
It sounds like you're having a good time.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600
Yeah.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600
That's the important part.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600
It's great.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.600
And it runs smoothly.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600
It's just, it runs great.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600
So, and it's awesome.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.440
I mean, it didn't, yeah, the galaxy of six, the cooks sometimes when you playing different

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.440
VR games.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.600
Um, and it actually didn't really seem to bother very much.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
So that was nice.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.840
Um, the other thing I played on a completely different spectrum since I got that Coleco

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.520
a flashback console, I played some Coleco games.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.660
So Raz playing Jumpman jr bump and jump and pepper too.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.640
So loving that stuff.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.420
Totally going back to, I know Jumpman was on the Coleco.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.420
Yeah.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.420
Jumpman jr is on there.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.420
Yeah.

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.060
I need a Commodore 64 flashback console.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.100
I need it bad.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.020
So man, that's the, um, the Drake one, right?

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.020
Jumpman Jumpman.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.020
Yeah.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.020
I've played that.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.980
The only thing I didn't like though, they have like some home brew ones that were on

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980
there.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.980
Some home brew games that were made.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.460
The home brew games aren't good.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.980
They like overly complicated.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.540
They have this like mech shooter game that has like eight different buttons on there.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.380
And I'm like, dude, this is a fucking Coleco game.

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.700
I don't need eight different action buttons on this.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.140
Uh, Bobby block, Bobby block open chats is Coleco chameleon.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.220
No, no, no.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.220
The Coleco flashback.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.980
There's a, there's a little bit of a difference.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.980
Yeah.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.220
This, I mean, you could probably shove this inside of an S you know, SNES jr, which then

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:36.060
you can shove into like a Jaguar, uh, you know, console.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:42.620
It could be like a turducken of video.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.780
Are you saying that the Coleco chameleon was basically just a turducken?

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.820
Um, it was a turd.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.820
Stop.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.860
He in chat says, Loki is actually happy.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.340
Screw global warming.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:58.620
We're in for a cold summer because I also got, he wasn't that orange cream milkshake

01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.620
in the beginning.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.620
Oh, well shit.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.060
See more cream, milkshake controller.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.060
There you go.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.060
Look, he's having the best week ever.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.060
All right.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.060
Uh, my gaming week.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.500
I'm going to talk about something a little different cause as far as like console PC,

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.500
it's same old stuff.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.020
I'm still playing fall of SC 14 Diablo three, all that same stuff, but okay.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.700
So I went on a little bit of an adventure this weekend, uh, on Friday, my buddy Shane,

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.820
we talk about on the show a lot and he's here sometimes.

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.860
Uh, it's his birthday by the way.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.820
Um, which I think is actually, I'm lost track of what day it is.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.820
It's 23rd tomorrow.

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.820
Yeah.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.820
23rd tomorrow.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.820
So tomorrow's his birthday.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.700
We went for an early birthday thing, uh, Friday.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.760
So we actually went to great America because they just opened up what the new mass effect

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.760
ride at great America.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.760
Right?

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760
So we rode the ride.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.180
I would love to tell you what I thought about it, but we're teasing a video that we did.

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.500
So look for that midweek.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.060
So I can't tell you about that right now.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.380
Uh, all the details give us just the tip.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:52.420
Uh, yes, I will say, um, it was not what I expected, which was both good and bad.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.420
Okay.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:57.420
So I'm going to watch that video now.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.340
I can tell you what I will be watching the video now because of that.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:01.340
Sounds good.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:02.340
All right.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.340
Um, but here's the other exciting thing.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.740
So also in San Jose, cause, um, you know, great America's in the San Jose area is right

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.620
next door to where they had the super bowl, right?

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:15.920
So not that far away, although an eternity in Bay area traffic, Jesus, God, uh, we went

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.020
to a place called round one, which, um, I don't know if you guys have heard of this

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.020
here cause they're not everywhere.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.380
It seems like they have a lot of them in like the Texas area.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.620
There's some in California Bay area, so Cal, uh, and I think there's some in Washington.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:32.180
I think there might be one in the Chicago area, but anyway, it's basically a Japanese

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.260
arcade chain.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.780
I believe it's Japanese entertainment center, uh, that is starting to make way in the U

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.540
S uh, you can.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.580
Even it has bowling inside of it.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.740
I promise more bowling talk.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740
You have bowling there.

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.740
You can do darts.

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:46.140
You can rent a karaoke room.

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.140
Like I don't know what store this used to be at the East Ridge mall, but I'm assuming

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.780
it was something like a Kohl's or a, it was a, yeah, it was like a huge store, like a

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:59.340
JC Penny's type of thing that they have turned into an entire entertainment complex.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.540
So kind of like Dave and busters, I guess, but without the restaurant.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.540
Okay.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:04.540
It's kind of like that type of thing.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.620
Um, because I, or at least if there was a restaurant, I didn't fucking see it because

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.140
I was too distracted by what was in the arcade because the arcade was like nothing but Japanese

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.140
games.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.420
So yes, there were the ticket spitters and all that garbage, although there were actually

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.420
some really fun ones.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.780
Like there was one that was like a giant piano.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.100
And so I would just like you then literally gives you tickets for banging on the keys.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.180
So I could go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and it was like giving me what they needed

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.180
golf land.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.340
This is like this is what they need everywhere.

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.100
I had so much fun.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.180
Um, and this is the crazy thing.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:42.480
Like the arcade, I would, okay, so this show started because of things like DDR and road

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.580
trips to play things like para para paradise and games they only had in Japan.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:53.300
Do you know how much 25 year old Rob Robert shit his pants being in this place?

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.980
It was amazing.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:09:03.380
Like dark soccer, rows and rows of UFO catchers with adorable next week, little hamster plushies.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.480
We're going next week.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.080
You can take, you can take my card and spend the rest of what we didn't spend.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.080
Okay.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.860
So I got to play some music based games that like, you know, cause we still have a lot

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:18.280
of music game fans that listen to OLR and I'm very thankful for you guys, but you guys

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.280
kind of know I've, I've kind of lost touch with some of that and I haven't followed as

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.740
closely as I used to, but now I kind of got to actually play some of those games because

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.380
this round one place had them.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.320
So I played the newest BeatMania 2DX, the copula or whatever it's called, which is awesome.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.600
I played a new game called Musica.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.920
I don't know if I'm saying that right.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.920
Musica.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.920
Okay.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.800
So imagine you take, you guys know pop and music.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.200
It's got these giant buttons and you slam the buttons with the notes to make music.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.960
Basically when the little note hits the bottom, you hit these, it's like the a problematic

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.600
bubble on trouble, right?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600
That's like pop and music.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600
Okay.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:57.120
Musica is kind of like that, but instead of five buttons, it's five little turntables

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.140
and what you do, you can either slam the turntable down like a big button or you can spin it.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.820
So as the notes are coming down, it's either a note that you hit or it's something that

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.220
you spin and they decided to throw in a foot pedal.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.220
Why?

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.220
I don't know.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.220
Foot pedal.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.620
But I'll tell you, I love that game.

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:21.140
That took me back to being like 25 when this show started and I was like, I would have

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.780
drove to Arcade Infinity to play this.

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:23.780
This is a lot of fun.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:24.780
That seems very difficult.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.580
Like it would get challenging quickly.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.580
These games are.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:35.140
I've been a musician for 15, 16 years, a drummer, and that takes, you'd think it takes a lot

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.140
of coordination.

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.220
You know, there's a lot of things going on, but I look like a child, an infant when it

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.380
comes to some of these games where you're waving your hand below and on top of it to

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.380
make the music keep going.

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.380
Dance Maniacs.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.380
Is that the one I'm thinking of?

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.380
Yep.

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.380
I see it.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.380
I try it.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.380
I'm like, yeah, I'm a musician.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.380
Screw it.

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.380
Here's my quarters.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.380
Watch me kick ass.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.380
And no, it does not work.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.700
And I think that also kind of ties into like what types of genre games you just might be

01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.700
into because like, you know, you talk about the division of some of these shooters and

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.580
when I play a first person shooter, I'm like, I just run in there and get killed.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.300
I get shot in the face and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.560
You know, so I play those types of games, but music games, like because I played them

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.940
so fucking much, like when this show started and when I was around that age, like I just

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.220
kind of picked it up second nature.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.700
Like when I played the first little song and music, I'm like, this is too fucking easy.

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.700
Come on.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.780
So like I had to like amp up the difficulty and it was, it was crazy, but it was, it's

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.780
fun.

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:28.540
So like it's neon, it's bright, it's Japanese.

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.540
It's everything I love.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:35.180
Were you still like, you know, good at two DX or was that just kind of like, oh boy,

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.340
have I regressed on that shit.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.420
I failed songs.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.860
I used to be great at like, that was a very humble pie experience.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:46.540
Uh, some other games quickly I played, there's a game called cross beats, which is by Capcom.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:50.700
That's kind of like, um, DJ max technica or like elite beat agents.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.600
If you ever played that on the DS, we're like big arrows will kind of cross at one point

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.400
and that's really, that's why they call it cross beats, but sometimes it's a whole note.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.680
Sometimes it's a, what was the other one?

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.960
Oh, you flick it like a, like you would on like an iPhone or something like that.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.840
So I played that and that was cool cause it was by Capcom.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.520
So it has remixes from like Phoenix Wright and a street fighter.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.400
So yeah, you can kind of like play those songs and I was having fun with that.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.040
Um, I saw an arcade version of grooves, groove coaster, the iPhone game.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040
Yeah.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.440
Like that is crazy.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.040
Um, and another iPhone game, the sum sum, the Disney, like the little match three with

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040
the Disney's head.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.040
That's very Japanese.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.040
Okay.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040
Sue Sue.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.720
They have an arcade version of Sue Sue at round one and if you give it enough credits,

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.720
you get a little like it actually spits out a physical, like it has like the fucking amiibo

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.720
thing built into it.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.880
You get a physical Sue Sue that you can tap onto the arcade machine and you get its powers.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.040
That's where these right.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.740
That's where these arcade machines are going.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.980
They're fucking stealing everything from phones now because here's the thing.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.660
You can buy like an EMUs pass, Konami's like thing, official thing because, because round

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:04.120
one is like a Japanese thing and has a deal with Konami, you can buy an official Konami

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.120
EMUsment pass.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.620
I can just use the one I already have though, right?

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.420
If you, if you happen to have one, sure.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:13.680
And you can actually, you tap this card on the 2DX machine or on Musica or on Crossbeats

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.280
has a separate one cause it's Capcom.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.140
But on any of the Konami scenes machines, you type tap it and it saves your data.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:24.220
And of course, every time you play, you get coins and you can use coins to unlock skins

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:28.580
and new songs and bullshit, but that's what you do on the phones.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.580
Right?

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.580
Yeah.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:31.580
But that's awesome.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.580
Yes.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.580
That's why.

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.580
I was like, where was this when I was 25?

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:35.580
That's why we used to go to the arcade.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:40.020
It's like, damn, you know, max two there's, you know, the songs were so close to unlocking

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.020
those.

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.520
We just have to play more.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.860
They Akuma JP, our pal in Japan, Tumutumu, not Zoom Zoom.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860
I did not know that.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860
Tumutumu.

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860
That Disney one.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860
But that was cute.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860
I liked that one.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.620
They had a Silent Hill arcade machine.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.860
Oh my God.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:59.220
Like I saw it was just, it was being in little like anime convention heaven.

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.220
It was gigantic.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.220
Right?

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.780
It was a fucking like JC Penney's converted.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.780
It was huge.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.780
It's like a Dave and Busters.

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.380
And I don't mean Roseville, Dave and Busters.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.300
I mean like, like, I don't know if you guys have been to Great Mall, Dave and Busters.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.300
It was like that big.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.860
Yeah, the Roseville one was kind of disappointing.

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860
Yeah, no, no.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.180
That one's like, they say that one's the littlest one in the entire chain next to Times Square.

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180
That's terrible.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.180
Yeah.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.460
So anyway, I have to give credit where credit is due.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.140
I don't mean to sound like a commercial whore, but I guess I'm going to a little bit.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:27.460
I loved round one.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.420
I had a fantastic time there.

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.060
So this episode brought to you by round one.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.060
Right?

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.060
And stamp stop.

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.060
Oh my God.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.260
Just send me a $20 card every month.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.260
I'll be fine.

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.580
Just build one in Sacramento.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.720
Well they are building one in Concord, apparently.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:47.100
So it's closer in San Jose, especially remember Bay Area traffic.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.140
Thank you.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.280
So I would rather just take the 680 to little John down and go there.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.860
So they're inching closer.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:54.620
So I'm excited.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.740
So yeah, that was my gaming week.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:03.180
And I'm sure a lot of the music game fans are going to be very thankful that I finally

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.540
got to play some of these games that I'm really behind the times and playing.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.300
But yeah, man, I'm happy for that place.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.300
That takes me back.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.620
Drumscape was my game.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.980
Oh, the MTV Drumscape?

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:13.980
Yeah.

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.980
Oh yeah.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:19.580
And on the cruise beach boardwalk, I will put all the money I have in my pocket into

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.900
that game.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.820
They have another one I'll talk about real quick.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.540
So Konami used to have a series Guitar Freaks and Drummania that was kind of like what there

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.760
was before Guitar Hero.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.580
And Red Octane used to make controllers for people that imported that game and then Red

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.580
Octane made Guitar Hero.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.580
So it's kind of like, you know, it kind of evolved one way or another.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:42.620
Well now Konami kind of bit back and so they have a game, they merged it into a game they

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:46.620
just call Ghidadora and they have the five key.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.300
Now the guitar has five keys, kind of like Guitar Hero does.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:54.100
But the drum thing, okay, like back in the day it used to have only like five.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.860
But I, and I don't know drumming unfortunately.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:01.540
So all I can say is like, there was like nine thingies and there was like, like so many

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.460
thingies and a foot pedal and I didn't know what the shit was what.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:12.460
Well they have the bass, two toms, and I want to say a hi-hat and maybe a cymbal.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:13.460
Okay.

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.460
He's like, yeah, that sounds right.

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.460
Oh sure.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.180
And a Neil Peart drum cage that lifts you above and spins you around.

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.980
There was like a cymbal above the cymbal and I was like, whoa, this is like some 3D shit.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.980
Cymbalception.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.980
Yeah.

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:26.980
Crazy.

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:31.020
That's like when you get the like Rock Band 2 drum kit and you get all the extra, you

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:35.020
know, cymbals and shit that you can actually attach to this kit.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.740
Oh, the Ion drum kit?

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:41.420
No, not the Ion drum kit, the actual Rock Band drum kit they actually had additional

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.020
accessories you could add to basically additional cymbals that would, I think it would map

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:52.700
to the same buttons for like the older drum or the older Rock Band games, but the newer

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:55.460
ones would actually detect them as different things.

01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:00.100
But yeah, I actually bought those for my drum kit that I don't play that's sitting in my

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.100
garage.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.740
So you're not the only one.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.980
One of these days we're all going to have to do a giant road trip to round one.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.180
I think, I think you guys would have fun.

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.180
I'm in.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.180
Be a good time.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.620
We're going to, uh, Bree and Gabe about it from the indie, they want to go.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:15.180
I know Bree does, so we're going to have to, we'll just rent a bus.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.180
Yeah.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.180
All right.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.180
We'll call it the bang bus.

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.180
Yeah.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:27.420
But we need a giant logo on the side so everybody is aware of what.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.780
I'll drive my own car then behind you guys.

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.740
Aaron, do you have room in your car?

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.740
Cause I don't want to be on the big bus.

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:34.740
Sure.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.740
Yeah.

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.740
Okay.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.740
Be by myself.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.740
I don't care.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.300
All over random people.

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:45.100
Hey, guys, the bang bus is going around one.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.620
Would you say you'd be a master banger then?

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.700
All right.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:55.580
Uh, let's move on, uh, act after saying heck vodcon at round one, you know, they have party

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:56.580
rooms.

01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:57.580
Why not?

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:58.580
All right.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.340
Anyway, let's get, uh, just some quick housekeeping.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.100
I don't really have a lot to say except, you know, the usual follow us on Twitter, twitter.com

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.100
slash O L R.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.900
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, Google plus as well.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.620
If you're, you know, you're still doing that thing.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:15.900
Um, so yeah, and as far as upcoming shows, I don't think there's anything off that we're

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.940
going to be, uh, taking off until we get to labor day and dragon con, cause I'll be out

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.940
at dragon con.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.460
So I won't be here that week.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.400
I do want to give though a quick shout out because I think we're only just about three

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400
weeks away.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.220
A vog network is sponsoring these Southern fried game room expo in Atlanta.

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.980
Um, which, you know, talk about all these cool arcade machines under one roof.

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:34.980
Okay.

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.980
Instead of like flashy Japanese stuff, make it retro arcade and pinball.

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.820
And that's what they're going to have at this, uh, Southern fried game room expo in Atlanta.

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.820
So that'll be fun.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:46.180
They do a very, very, very similar thing in California called California extreme.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.860
If you guys don't know the details on that, I think that's in July.

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:49.860
Check that out.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:50.860
Yeah.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:51.860
That's a lot of fun.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:52.860
But that one every year.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:53.860
Yeah.

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:54.860
Oh yeah.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:55.860
So that one is a lot of fun.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:56.860
So love football.

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:00.420
Super happy if Steve Ritchie makes it again this year cause he was, he was fun.

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.020
He designed a lot of pinball tables that probably everyone grew up with.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.020
Yeah.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:08.420
And a lot, a lot of those like retro game making celebrities show up at these types

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:09.420
of conventions.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.940
So I know Southern fried game room expo has their own, um, our own Bobby Black Wolf is

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.460
going to be speaking on a couple of panels there.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.460
So check that out.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.460
That's going to be the Atlanta area.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:21.420
I think it's June 10th through 12th, a question mark on those dates cause I don't have them

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:24.700
up in front of me, but I'm sure Bobby will advise me right now if I'm wrong, but that

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.700
sounds right.

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:26.700
Oh, Rob got it.

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.700
Right.

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.420
There you go.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.980
So register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at bognetwork.com.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.940
Use the pass phrase, Archer.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.940
All right.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.340
Uh, let's get into some news for the week.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.820
And of course you guys, uh, from Video Game Bank, please, please feel free to comment

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.300
on the news as we're going over it here.

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.300
All right.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:52.300
So Minecraft is making its way to China, um, because you know, just recently they kind

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.120
of lifted the ban from all that, you know, those different game consoles and everything

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120
coming out there.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.080
I guess they're just trying to expand the China because, Hey, there's billions of people

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.960
there and why not?

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.860
So they're going to be a teaming up with NetEase to expand Minecraft into China.

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:11.000
They have a five year license to publish the game and should be coming out soon.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.400
That is going to be massive over there.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.400
I think so.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.460
You already said there's billions of people over there.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:19.880
So yeah, they were saying, uh, was it a 1.3, 5 billion?

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880
Oh yeah.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880
Most of them are smarter than us anyways.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:26.940
So you think we've designed some pretty engineered, some pretty cool contraptions.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:27.940
It's about to go to a whole new level.

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.440
And now the Chinese have their hands on it.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.800
This is cancer cured.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.680
This is following what we talked about last week, where there's those two consoles in

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.040
China that they just announced.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.640
So it's like, I really feel like, okay, we are on, like, there's going to be a game bang

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.780
in China, like in the coming, in the coming years, because like, it really feels like

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:49.300
ever since they lifted that restriction on, on the consoles, what, like a year and a half

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.840
ago or whenever it was like, now it's like, Oh boy.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.080
Now the dam's starting to burst and China's going to have gamers everywhere.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:03.040
And you say that they're smarter than us, but wait till the video games make them dumb.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.880
So is this a really, it's a giant tactic to bring them down to our level?

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.760
It's a Kim Kardashian game.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:14.360
I'd be curious to see like how much of, you know, how many, how, how big that market could

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.920
be because a lot of times, you know, you're looking at, you know, America kind of driving

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.720
the market for like the Xbox and stuff, because, you know, we sell most of the consoles here,

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.160
but like Japan kind of driving a lot of the Sony consoles and you see different kind of,

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.200
you know, landscapes because of that.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.920
So I'm wondering if, you know, you have China driving, you know, you know, a marketplace

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.560
for, who knows, one of these consoles be kind of interesting to see how that changes what

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.880
games are released or what types of games they develop.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880
Yeah.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.560
Cause right now, pretty much all your consoles, they're U S like basically Microsoft and Xbox

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.960
or they're Japan like Nintendo.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.640
And I would really argue half Sony.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:55.200
I really feel like Sony's console operations, they're Japanese company, but I feel like

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.520
it's all happening in the San Francisco Bay area where that console is.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.600
So it's kind of like halfsies with Sony.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.080
It would be very interesting if suddenly now China enters the conversation with whatever

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.720
consoles they're bringing out.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.720
Be very, very interesting.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.640
Do we want a Chinese console?

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640
We will.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.640
We just talked about two of them last week.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640
Yeah.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.360
I mean, that's the sound like, but I mean, you think it's going to bring communism?

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.320
No, I'm not saying like that, but I don't, I don't know.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.320
It's going to be competition.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320
One way or the other.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.160
Are you worried like, you know, like those, the V or like those other knockoff consoles?

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.160
That's what I'm exactly talking about.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.080
There are a lot of Chinese knockoff consoles.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.320
You're going into the mall like, Hey, this is kind of cool.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.880
It's a Nintendo with like some zapper gun.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880
It looks like a pistol.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.840
It's got like a hundred games built in.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.800
I don't think that's legit, but yeah, but I think, I think the restrictions that the

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.760
country had was what was lending to that.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.840
It was kind of like they had to make their own knockoffs cause they couldn't, you know,

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.640
they didn't, they didn't have the type of freedom that they're going to have now.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.640
There's a lot.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.200
I used to watch the YouTube reviews on them just to see what they were and it's like,

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.760
they were all, this feels plastic.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.120
I'm like, well, it's a Chinese console right now and that's all they've been producing

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.200
for the last, like, you know, like grocery store consoles, like you can go find that

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.760
at an Albertsons and it'd be in the aisle with the produce or something like that.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.880
And you just pick it up and you play with it.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:22.480
But I mean, if, if you say like the restrictions being dropped and now they're, you make it

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.920
sound like though, in my opinion, you make it sound like now technology is reaching them

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.920
and they can use mic and chips.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.920
Fair enough.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.920
Sort of.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:31.920
I don't know.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.920
They're letting them reach them now.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.440
They have Bluetooth now over there.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.440
What can they do?

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.440
The possibilities.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.480
Hey, uh, the phone, aren't there, isn't there a phone game in China, like way beyond where

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.400
we're at or am I, am I confusing it?

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.540
I wouldn't doubt it.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.440
It's like a mystery over there.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:52.400
I've been into the show Vikings, you know, so I see us as the Vikings and with them as

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400
like the English people.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400
Highly advanced Wakandians.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.400
Is that what they are?

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400
All right.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400
Uh, let's see.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:06.420
Uh, go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com uh, Akuma JP says, nah, Chinese copy stuff.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.420
That's half of their economy.

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.420
Hmm.

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:09.420
Uh, let's see.

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.900
Dungeon buster says if you walk around Beijing, communism is the last thing anyone gets an

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.320
impression of nowadays.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:19.580
So maybe things are, are changing and we'll say this, this is, this is the sign of maybe

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.140
some type of like greater shift or something.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.140
Who knows?

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.140
Who knows?

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:26.740
Anyway, let's move on and talk about, I think something that a lot of folks been talking

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:29.620
about on gaming blogs, on Twitter and all this stuff this week.

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.980
And that's that Tetris movie.

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.300
Have you all heard about this?

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.220
Uh, Tetris, not just one movie.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:42.420
Apparently they've already said, go ahead and make a damn trilogy, a trilogy of Tetris

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.460
movies, $80 million budget.

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.500
I am I being punked with this story?

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.500
I swear to God.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.740
$80 million for the first movie or all three, because that's, that's different.

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.740
Yeah.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740
It's probably going to be one of those things.

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.740
I shoot them all at once.

01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.740
That's, that's what they do these days.

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.740
Right?

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.740
Shoot all the movies at once.

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.820
I know we look at them at CG, live action.

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:01.820
What are we talking?

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:07.860
It is being promoted as a sci-fi thriller, thriller, thriller.

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.200
I don't get that feeling every time I play it's gonna be played by Vin Diesel and that's,

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.580
that's why I'm getting a little nervous about this whole lie.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.580
Am I being punked right now?

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.220
You know what other games, you know, other game was a good sci-fi thriller.

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:25.060
Somebody made their own NX and fooled the entire internet.

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:26.060
Just want to remind y'all.

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.060
I'm sorry, Loki.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.060
You had a joke.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:29.060
Yeah.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.580
I was going to say, you know what, you know what other game had a nice sci-fi thriller

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.460
movie that made, you know, out to theaters?

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.460
Battleship.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:36.460
Remember how that turned out?

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:37.760
It's the first one that came to mind.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760
The Rihanna movie.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760
Yeah.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.760
The Rihanna.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760
That's what we think of it as.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.760
The Rihanna movie.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.460
Was that the one that had Ralph Fiennes in that epic climatic scene?

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.460
You sunk my battleship.

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.980
You got to put that in there somewhere.

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.980
Yeah.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:53.620
That's why I said, if that line isn't in the movie, fuck it.

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.820
Is Tetris going to be a follow up to Pixels?

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.160
Is this like a sequel?

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.040
Like the aliens come back and they're just now all Tetris shapes.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040
So we have...

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.040
If Jack Black gets attached, I'm out.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.280
Do we have anybody attached so far or is it just, hey, we're going to make one?

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.240
I do not think there's a...

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.240
It's going to be...

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.840
They're going to actually film the first movie in China and other locations in 2017.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.840
Cheap knockoffs, huh?

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.720
Oh, the cast will be Chinese.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.320
It's a China-US co-production under Threshold Global Studios.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.280
So the cast will be Chinese.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.200
Bruno Wu and producer Larry Kasanoff are co-producers.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:33.900
Now Larry Kasanoff was actually a producer on the Mortal Kombat movie, which, say what

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:37.760
you will, that was probably one of the better video game movies probably to this day.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.760
Number one?

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.760
Part one?

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760
Huh?

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760
Part one we're talking about.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.760
There's only one anyway.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760
All right.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760
Yeah.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:45.760
Mortal Kombat one, that's it.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.760
There we go.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.560
But that has some semblance of a fucking plot to it, whereas Tetris is a puzzle game.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.600
There's some plot.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:55.000
There's some tension there when you're on level 12 and they're coming down pretty fast.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.080
So when we talk about a Chinese-US co-production thing, I think about the Crouching Tiger

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.080
Hidden Dragon.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080
I think it was kind of like that too.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080
Yeah, that was very good.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:11.640
Because you had Ang Lee that had directed that movie, but they had shot and they filmed

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:18.520
it in China and the cast was Chinese, but they ended up releasing it over here.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.240
When you say sci-fi thriller, I'm thinking it has to be some type of coding movie.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.280
They're going to make it some type of hackers, but in China.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.520
And then just surrounding the whole hacking system is Tetris.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.120
And that's what you have to do, is to break some code, you have to play Tetris.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.120
That's the only thing I can think of.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.600
I don't think they're going to actually have large physical blocks falling from the sky.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:46.600
They have to build a Tetris wall around Earth to save them from the invading shapeless things.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600
You know what?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:53.040
As much as you say that as a joke, maybe that's kind of what it is, is that the game it's

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.880
self is kind of non-important, like the Battleship movie, as much as we're kind of like laughing

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:57.880
at that.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.560
How much you want to bet they're going to have like nanomachines or something in this

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.320
where they're just going to have to like, I don't know.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.440
It sounds terrible.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.280
They have to build a wall around the Earth and they're missing the piece that they need.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.280
Wow.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.600
So they're searching the galaxy for a straight line?

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.520
I vow, here and now, not going to see it.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.640
I will see Angry Birds before I see that.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.960
Angry Birds seems okay.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.880
Angry Birds will actually have a plot because the game has a plot.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.120
Is there no lore to Tetris?

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120
Because you're a Tetris guy.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.000
Is there like a story that we don't know when you just pick it up?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Is there like...

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I, in high school, being caught playing Tetris in my computer class, my teacher made me write

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:47.120
a four page essay on Tetris and I could not research any lore behind it.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.120
It was just...

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.120
But the dude got screwed over royally.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.120
Oh, he got screwed over royally.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.800
Well, he got his upcoming, so he's good now.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.000
And then he went on to make other games.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.200
But yeah, there's no lore in the original Tetris.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.200
There may be some now in some newer versions, but...

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:07.520
As long as they don't base it off that horrible fucking PlayStation version with a little

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.960
archaeologist that would walk by.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.140
I couldn't stand that one.

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:18.600
We have Mr. Pajitnov, drunk in college on lots of vodka.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:25.600
Staring at the little pixel blips on his monochrome screen, going, you know, I think

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.680
these would fit a certain way.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.120
I will make a game instead of doing my job.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.120
And there's history.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.120
And there it is.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:39.760
And then he goes up to the Kremlin and goes, fuck you!

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760
The Kremlin.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.760
I made a game.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.320
Yes, there is no story to Tetris.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.720
Let's wait and see a trailer.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.680
Let's wait and see what actors are on it and what kind of talent is in it.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.680
Let's see.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.680
Let's see what...

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.280
Let's wait till the trailer.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.280
I'll give it that.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.280
But I just...

01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.040
The part that's really weird to me is, A, the sci-fi thriller.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.520
And B, the fact that it's already a trilogy.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520
That's a concern.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520
Yeah.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.920
Sci-fi thriller instead of romantic comedy, because that's what I see Tetris as.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.760
And then already a trilogy when it should literally be four.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.840
I mean, it's Tetris, like four is the number.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840
That's true.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.840
A quad...

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.840
A quadri...

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.840
Yeah, a quadri...

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.840
A Tetris.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840
A Tetris.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.840
Yeah.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:31.480
I just think that the producers and whoever thought this was a good idea, the same way

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.080
drunk frat boys think certain things are good ideas.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.080
Maybe, yeah.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.120
Dude, I got an idea.

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.400
There's still a Monopoly movie coming at some point.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.400
Oh, really?

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.600
And it's still a mousetrap movie, I think.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.920
They released the Ouija movie.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.040
Mousetrap could be fun.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.000
Mousetrap was kind of fucking rad, though.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.600
If it's done like a little first person mousie, like Stuart Little or something.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.720
Whoever builds those things in the Pee Wee Herman movies.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.880
You're saying like a hardcore Harry meets Ratatouille?

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.880
There you go.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.880
You've just made the movie.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.720
And just have it all from that little miniature point of view and having to get through the

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.720
mousetrap.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.680
Oh, what's the cage thing coming down?

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.080
Like the commercials were, right?

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.080
Yeah.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.080
Those would be great.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.240
That would be a crossfire movie.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240
You know what?

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.320
I would be down for that now.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.160
I want the kids, though, who are in the commercial in the movie.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.680
You know, they're probably like 40 now.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680
I think.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.760
They're pro crossfire players.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:27.600
We need to do a list list for the plot of the Tetris movie.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.000
Okay, we'll have to do that.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.600
This show is already running way too long.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.600
I know, that's right.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.600
We'll do that in a future week.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.600
All right, that's right.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.600
I want to read this quick comment from chat.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.600
Bobby Black Wolf.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.720
Tetris 1 will be the sci-fi thriller.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.140
Tetris 2 will be the romantic comedy.

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:43.260
And Tetris 3 will be the feel good kids cartoon.

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.260
There you go.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.860
Maybe some genres switch up.

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860
Yeah.

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.860
All right.

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:48.860
Let's move on.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:49.860
Dark Soccer.

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:50.860
What do you have for us?

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:52.620
Well, we knew it wouldn't end.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:57.220
We knew there would be another Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:01.500
There is a new Five Nights at Freddy's sequel.

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:04.860
Oh, that's my version of an echo.

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.500
Even after the final Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.500
Right?

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.500
Liar.

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:13.260
There was the RPG that probably should not have happened.

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.280
I want the RPG though to actually come out because I would play the crap out of that.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.280
It's out.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.280
That's the problem.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.460
No, I mean, I want it to like be fixed and come out because they took it down to fix

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.460
it.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.460
Right?

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:25.460
No, I think it's bad.

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:26.460
I think they don't.

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.660
I think he's going to re-release it for free or something.

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.860
I don't remember what the deal was, but anyway, new one.

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.340
I still have that as my ringtone thing anyway.

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:38.300
So Five Nights at Freddy's, the sequel is called Sister Location and oh my God, the

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.580
animatronics are even creepier in this one.

01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.420
Their faces like come apart.

01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.260
If it's Sister Location, is it like Francine now?

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.260
No.

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.260
Five Nights at Francine's?

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.540
Is that what they're doing?

01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:57.420
It has a new head animatronic called, I think, Dolly.

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:03.100
This little clown face, little girl with pigtails, but the way that the animatronics are is that

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:07.880
they're split down the middle and they're split over the eyes, under the eyes, and across

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:08.880
the mouth.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.940
So that parts expand and move in and out while the eyes move around.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:18.340
And I'm like, who the hell was designing these animatronics and thought this will be good

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.340
for kids?

01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:20.340
My nightmares.

01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:24.920
Well, it's not exactly made for kids, but just looking at the trailer, I'm trying to

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:31.680
see because some of the other animatronics are back.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.840
What was the white one called?

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.840
God, I can't remember.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.440
That I think became the bangle.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.400
And I think Chica was in there.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.440
Chica's the one that always, have you guys played those Five Nights games?

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.960
I played the very original first one.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:52.400
She gets me to play them on Twitch and I scream like a 12 year old girl when Chica comes out.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.720
It is an actual scary game.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:54.720
It's intense.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.280
I don't know how much the third or fourth iteration is.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.720
And Freddy's in it too, but it's like a purple Freddy, but I don't think he's the purple

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:04.720
guy.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.920
I can't call him the purple man because the purple man was in Jessica was in, no, not

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:13.120
just in the TV series, but it was alias and he was actually purple and his daughter was

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.120
purple.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:19.220
So just saying, I know my comics, but yeah, it's looking like it's going to be pretty

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:24.140
crazy and instead of being like a, in a little surveillance room where you're in the area,

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:28.500
you're like in a basement surveillance room, like a big circle thing.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.840
And like they had people going through vents and things, so maybe you have to travel in

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.840
between.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.960
It's a 360 degree thing this time.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.440
And it also had like the lights out deal like it had with the, um, the flashlight for the

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.120
little boy in the last one.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.360
We'll just put that in the pile of games.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.360
I won't be playing.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.080
No, no disrespect to the creator who is, you know what, he's made a huge success for himself

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.080
as an indie developer.

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.080
What's his name?

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.200
Thumbs up to you, bro.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:00.680
Not going to play also, also Rob, I've decided that you're now going to have what's called

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.240
the pile of nope.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.760
Well, I will apply one nope to this.

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:12.420
And just looking at these, um, you know, the, the other, you know, suggestions to watch

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.500
on YouTube for their little trailer.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.720
One of them is a Minecraft five nights.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.740
Five nights is huge.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:22.820
I mean, it's, it seems like every year you have that one indie success that like is not

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.400
going to fucking stop Minecraft.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.400
Obviously.

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.000
I think five nights was kind of like last year's game this year.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Stardew Valley.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.960
Someone still needs to buy for me.

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.560
I haven't played it myself, but I have a coworker who comes up to me once per day and has to

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.000
tell me everything that happened in the past year.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Yeah.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Of her game.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.800
It's insane how, how, uh, crazy addicted that game is.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.720
Of course they were also advertising, um, Alaska Thunderfucks last single.

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.720
What?

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.720
In my little thing.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.000
Cause it read it, read it off of my, uh, YouTube.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.880
Oh, cause YouTube spies on what you do.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.880
Cause YouTube spies on me.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.160
If you watch drag queen videos, it's going to be like, you watch five nights at Fridays.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.400
You watch, you're trying to be Lady Gaga.

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.400
Scary drag queens.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.400
All right.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400
You know what we need?

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400
It's a popular category.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.400
Category is.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.480
All right.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:13.480
So Pokemon go, um, you can actually test or sign up for the field test or beta test, whatever

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.720
you want to call it.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:25.800
For Pokemon go, um, go to Pokemon go dot niantic.com and go there to our niantic labs.com.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:26.840
That's what I meant.

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.000
Pokemon Pokemon go dot niantic labs.com to register.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.560
Uh, they are seeming to, I don't know if they're, you know, um, giving preference to people

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.800
that play ingress, but they do ask if, you know, if you play ingress, what's your agent

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.920
ID, what's your level, finally, finally, all that addiction is going to pay off.

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.800
And then of course you need a Gmail address and a mobile device to be able to play it.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.940
So I signed up for it just to see what it is.

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:55.120
I really have no interest in Pokemon, but I'll, I'll check it out.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.720
What do you guys think from what you've heard about Pokemon go?

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.920
I think it's going to be the, I, I, I, I'm going to kind of go on a rant in a minute

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.120
here, but I still think this is going to be the biggest mobile game since candy crush.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.120
I really do.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.000
I think it's going to kill people.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.280
First of all, I think like they're going to put a Mewtwo in the middle of a penitentiary

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.800
and some kids going to go try and catch a Diglett or something.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.600
Breaking and entering is going to be all time high.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.760
And then I think what's going to happen though, I think this is for reals, I'm pretty sure

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.320
like target, it's going to cut a deal where it's like, if you come to the kid's section

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.760
of target on North gate, you'll get Pikachu in a birthday hat.

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.600
Oh, that's what, that's what they do in Ingress now.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.200
Like a Jamba juices used to all be portals in Ingress.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.200
Yeah.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.200
So that'll happen.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.200
Absolutely.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.200
Yeah.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:41.400
It's going to take the world by storm big time.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.520
I mean it's bringing Pokemon to life.

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.720
I mean all they have to do is start releasing animatronic Pokemon out in the world that

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.720
randomly just walk around.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.720
That's the only thing that could be bigger.

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.000
Kids going to walk into the middle of a freeway trying to catch a Bulbasaur and then the game

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
will be over.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Yeah.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.120
Luckily I, you know, and I've played Ingress for a while now, their other game and I don't

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.480
see like portals in the middle of freeways, but they do have portals in some like, so

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.080
hopefully somebody's screening them a little bit because like I know a guy the other day

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:15.940
that went to go get a portal that's basically right on the Mexican border in the middle

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:21.440
of the desert and I don't know why there's a fucking portal there, but there was, and

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.280
he had to get it for reasons.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.480
So yeah, I, I, it would be very interesting to see where these Pokemon gyms or whatever

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480
show.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.840
A lot of them, especially in our area that just, they're not there anymore.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.280
Like it's, Oh yeah, here's a fountain for this restaurant that's closed down or Hey,

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.860
here's one for this giant mural that's not there anymore.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.560
Here's one for another mural that's was on a building that's torn down.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:43.560
Yeah.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.560
Come on.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.040
So here's my thing and I got to get this off my chest cause I mentioned I have some reservations

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.240
and so obviously I've been playing Niantic's other game Ingress for a very long time and

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.000
just within the past few days I'm starting to get really fucking irritated at something

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.600
in Ingress and I think if Niantic is going to be this and that's going to be their niche

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.920
is that we are the GPS global phone game exploration thing.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.280
They have got to figure this problem out and that problem is people spoofing their phone

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:15.540
location and being places where they really are not because I'm going to tell you it's

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.760
extremely fucking frustrating to work with other people.

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:20.760
That's not the hard part.

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:21.760
I like that part.

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.500
Work with other people to accomplish this big task where I don't know if you guys know

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:30.060
Ingress, but basically like you try to connect these real world places together to make,

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:34.780
make triangles, but no lines can cross, but sometimes you can make very large triangles.

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:39.020
Let's say a triangle that goes all the way from Hawaii to Mount Lassen to Baja, Mexico

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.580
and back like sometimes and you get like 40 people involved to me.

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.580
It's like a fucking raid.

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:44.580
I love that you mentioned Mount Lassen.

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:46.180
That's one of my favorite places in the world.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.180
Yeah.

01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:48.180
Right.

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.180
Why did you say that?

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:50.180
Because that actually happened.

01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.180
I feel like I had a Batman moment.

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.700
Why didn't you just said Martha?

01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.420
Because those are all real places that this just happened the other day and you know,

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:05.860
a lot of people worked on it to make it only to have a person spoof their location and

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:13.740
take it down right away and everybody knows that the person was lying because the team

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:19.620
that threw it in Hawaii is right there going, we are on a beach and nobody else is here.

01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.180
Like it is just us.

01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.580
This is a spoofer.

01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.900
So here's my thing.

01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:28.460
And it's not like I realize there's always going to be assholes that try to ruin it for

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.460
everybody, but Niantic has got to figure out how they're going to police their fucking

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:37.660
game better because they're not doing it well enough and it's starting to make me really

01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:38.660
not want to play that game anymore.

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.660
Well I think they are catching those people are doing it, but they're just not really

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:41.780
doing anything about it.

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.060
They're like banning them for a week and then that's it.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.060
Yeah.

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.060
And then they come right back.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.820
It's not like there's, there's no other repercussions that the game's not smart enough at catching

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.140
if somebody is doing it in the first place and if you're going to make your niche around

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.260
GPS games, you've got to figure this out.

01:40:55.260 --> 01:41:00.300
Especially with my phone, like my GPS sometimes will be like way fucked up.

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:02.380
You know, even as it is, my compass is way fucked.

01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:05.420
It's never pointing in the right direction in that game, you know?

01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:08.980
So in my GPS, a lot of times they'll be bouncing around all over the fucking place.

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:13.620
And so thank God it doesn't trigger spoofing or anything from that.

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:17.980
I can only imagine that's probably why they haven't, you know, it's hard for them to gather

01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:24.180
all that cell data and stuff that might be around as well to kind of verify their location.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:29.060
So all I have, so just, you know, just something like that happening is just incredibly demoralizing

01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:34.200
and makes you kind of sit there and go, well, why am I spending time and money and gas on

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.660
something that is not being policed effectively?

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:43.140
Like at least World of Warcraft, if I go play PvP, it's all server side.

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:46.880
They got locked down, so it is very hard to cheat on World of Warcraft and there is zero

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.980
tolerance for it, you know, in a game like that.

01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:54.340
And I just need Niantic to kind of like step it up a little bit and look at Ingress through

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:58.960
that similar kind of lens where they need to police it better if they want me to continue

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.420
to support Ingress.

01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:04.100
Because right now I'm just kind of like, I don't know, I'm like, I'm like, I'm happy

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.460
for Jamie that she's gonna be level eight and I kind of want to help her get that and

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:09.540
all sorts, but I'm just kind of like, do I really want to take another two hour road

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.920
trip only to have some little kid in their basement fake it?

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:17.500
You know, it's like, I think I'm, I think I'm kind of past that probably some 30 something

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:22.100
that's doing that and you know, the ones that are going to be excellent at Pokemon go are

01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:26.020
going to be the same retired people that play Ingress all day long.

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:29.700
Maybe it's a Nintendo property, so maybe they might take a little, little more serious.

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:33.060
They don't want to lose or have a bad relationship with Nintendo.

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:37.660
Well, I don't know like how much it is with, I don't really know the game mechanics too

01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.660
much.

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:41.980
I know that you can go to different gyms and like deploy your Pokemon there to, and you

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:46.100
go and battle those different Pokemon, but it's not like a war game.

01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:48.460
You got deploy your Pokemon battlefield.

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:52.060
It kind of is like Michael Vick like video game.

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.060
Yeah.

01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:54.060
They're child soldiers.

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:55.060
That's what the Corey Pokemon.

01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:56.060
I'm not fucking with you.

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:59.060
Pokemon go is real life.

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:04.060
If you fake your location, then I will find you.

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.580
I always, I always tell people like, cool, you want to sign up for Ingress?

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:08.580
That's awesome.

01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.860
Like you should play Ingress with me, but if you sign up for blue and attack my portal,

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:14.860
I will kill you.

01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:15.860
Cheaters in video games.

01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.860
We talked about that recently, how it could be game breaking.

01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:23.100
And we were talking about whose responsibility is it and what the outcome should be.

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:27.860
So like for Overwatch, they're doing like no tolerance, permabands, right?

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:28.860
Quickly.

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:30.660
I love that.

01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:31.660
I think that's the way to go.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:36.220
And in Overwatch, that's you, you, you wasted 60 bucks because there is no single player

01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.220
game.

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:38.220
So if you get banned from Overwatch, done.

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:39.220
Yeah.

01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:40.220
Yeah.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:44.940
They, I think they need to set an example for some of them.

01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:47.940
If some of you can't control, which I don't know how they can differentiate the ones like,

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.380
Oh, my internet connection just bailed out on me.

01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:54.940
So I couldn't even, you know, I didn't leave the game, but you know, that's just what happened.

01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:00.380
You can get some leeway on that, but the downright PC cheaters that are like, I went and got

01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.860
a third party program to aim bots.

01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:03.860
Yeah.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:09.660
They definitely need to be, you know, struck and down, smited down definitely with the

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:10.660
biggest ban hammer.

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.660
With great vengeance and curious anger.

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:14.860
Because that stuff doesn't make the game fun.

01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:16.820
And it's just like, why do you do that?

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.420
Like why do you make the game unplayable for other people?

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.420
Right.

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:22.420
Exactly.

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.980
Anyway, I got to move on.

01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:27.500
So because of time, I want to talk a little bit briefly about Nintendo, because they were

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:33.340
kind of, they were kind of turning some heads this week because they revised their incorporation

01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:34.340
articles.

01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:38.380
And I don't know if you guys saw this on Twitter and the blogs and all this, but apparently

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:43.220
Nintendo has said, we're getting into other things than just gaming.

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:47.940
They have talked about now that they are doing medical and health services, computer software,

01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.460
eating establishments, and IP licensing.

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:54.580
So we don't know like what this all involves.

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:58.180
I don't think this necessarily means that Nintendo is going to suddenly open a restaurant

01:44:58.180 --> 01:44:59.180
themselves.

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:00.180
That would be awesome.

01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.240
But what, well, what is...

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.340
They do have cafes in Spain.

01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:04.340
Do they really?

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.340
Yeah.

01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.660
Oh, I didn't even know that.

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:07.660
Okay.

01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.660
Well, so maybe that's part of it.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:09.660
Like the themed cafes.

01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:12.380
Like there's the Final Fantasy one that Square has.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:13.380
Okay.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.380
Right.

01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:15.380
Right.

01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.060
Like Mario milkshakes or Luigi latte or something like that.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.300
I'm really concerned with them starting to get into practicing medicine.

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.300
Medicine?

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.300
Yeah.

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.140
Amazing.

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.140
Point taken.

01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:29.100
But I kind of see that I don't necessarily think Nintendo is going to open up their own

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:33.180
restaurant, but like, you know, let's say we know that Nintendo Universal signed that

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:36.180
deal to do the theme park thing where there'll be a Mario ride.

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.500
Well, look, haven't just been at a theme park over the weekend.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:43.220
Let me tell you, they also make a shit ton of money off food and selling the food there.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:46.020
So what type of Mass Effect food do they have?

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.020
Okay.

01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:49.940
You got me there because they actually didn't have any.

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:55.120
But they did have, like at their gift shop, they had a ton of Mass Effect merchandise,

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:59.140
but it was mostly the stuff you get in the store because it wasn't really anything new.

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:01.740
Why did you not bring me back in Elcor?

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:04.460
Because I wanted you to go yourself and they didn't have the Elcors.

01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:05.920
Well, ew.

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.140
But anyway, yeah.

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:10.820
So maybe you'll have like a Mario pizzeria or something.

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:11.820
I don't know.

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:12.820
Wow.

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:13.820
Straight to the pizzeria.

01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.820
Coming to a Luigi.

01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:15.820
Yeah.

01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:16.820
I can see that.

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:17.820
Yeah.

01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:18.820
Just why not?

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.820
Like that'll be the thing.

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:22.860
I would be down too actually for that.

01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:26.620
But see, and that's the thing is I kind of think what's happening now in Nintendo, because

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:30.560
we all know they're under new leadership and I kind of feel like maybe the new leadership,

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:35.020
because I get the sense the new leadership was not as much of a gamer as Miyamoto was,

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.020
who was...

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.020
Satoru Iwata.

01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.020
Jesus Christ.

01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:39.020
Satoru Iwata.

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.020
My bad.

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:41.020
Sorry.

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:42.020
Hail Mario.

01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.020
Hail Mario.

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:44.020
Shame.

01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.020
Shame.

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:49.100
A lot of names spinning in my head, live radio.

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:53.780
So when Iwata was leading the company, he was in the trenches and kind of worked his

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:55.200
way up and so forth, right?

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.900
And so I think the leadership now is somebody that was more of like the business perspective.

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:04.300
And I kind of feel like, whereas there was that hesitation to really license Nintendo

01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.300
stuff out.

01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.860
Like we've heard in the past, Nintendo was like, we learned our lesson from the Super

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.500
Mario Brothers movie that starred Bob Hoskins.

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.880
Like we are not ever doing that shit again.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:17.500
So stop, stop writing your fanwank.

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:22.740
Stop writing the fanwank about the Zelda Netflix series, because that's not fucking true.

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:24.720
That was like the old Nintendo, right?

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:30.780
But now I kind of feel like I see that we have made a lot of fucking money putting out

01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:33.140
Nintendo figurines.

01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.340
Why don't we license our...

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:39.900
We just made a lot of money licensing Mario and Luigi to theme parks.

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:42.900
We are the fucking Disney of video games right now.

01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:45.620
Why don't we just license our shit everywhere?

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:46.620
They are making a movie.

01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.020
They're making a movie with Sony.

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.380
They're going to be doing animated movies.

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:50.380
Right.

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.380
And I think that is now the future of where Nintendo...

01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:55.620
Because if Angry Birds can do well, wait till Mario.

01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.820
I think a Mario movie would do fantastic in this day and age.

01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:58.820
As long as it's CG.

01:47:58.820 --> 01:47:59.820
As long as it's CG.

01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:00.820
Yeah, yeah.

01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.820
Let's not...

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.200
We're not doing live action.

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.200
Never again.

01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200
Yeah, never.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.200
Yeah.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.200
Who's the guy that...

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.200
Jack Black is Mario?

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.200
No, no.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.200
Who's the guy that plays...

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.700
I don't want Vincent D'Onofrio putting on a Mario hat.

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:12.700
That would be awesome.

01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:14.700
He's not that fat.

01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:15.700
Yeah, no.

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.420
Yeah, sure he's not.

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:19.900
I can see them branching out and everything else, though.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:21.220
You hit it right on the head.

01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:23.940
They are the Disney of video games.

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:29.100
They have that marketing appeal to where you know who Mario is as soon as somebody says

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.380
Mario.

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:32.940
He's like Mickey Mouse, yeah.

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:37.600
But I think some people are reading this to say, oh, Nintendo is contingency planning

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.940
for the NX to flop.

01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:40.180
They're no longer a game maker.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:43.660
I'm just like, no, Nintendo sees dollar signs and they'd like to chase them.

01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:48.220
I could see where they're going with that because you can't get...

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.660
Consoles lose money generally anyways.

01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:54.300
Even a decent console will lose money.

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.860
And they had one massive flop with the GameCube, I think it was, right?

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:02.620
Yeah, GameCube is considered a flop, even though it was a great console.

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:04.260
I think it eventually made its money back.

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.260
It almost broke that.

01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:06.260
Yeah, I think it made...

01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:09.460
And it was kind of the same thing with the Wii U, and it's like the gamer in me does

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:14.460
not want to call the system of Mario Kart 8 and the system of like all these fantastic

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:19.020
games that are on it a flop, but from a financial perspective, it did not live up to the expectations.

01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.580
Financially, it almost like killed them, right?

01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:23.740
And then they did the Wii as like, this is going to be the last thing, and then it like

01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:24.740
did gangbusters.

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.640
See, here's the thing, I can't say that it almost killed them because you have to remember

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.340
Nintendo is sitting on mountains and mountains of cash.

01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:35.340
Remember that.

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:36.340
Nintendo's got money in the bank.

01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:40.580
Of course they do, because they're fucking charging $10 for fucking Mario Kart or Mario

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:48.460
64, which I did buy, but I bought it so my son can play it.

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:50.420
I didn't want to pay $10 for it.

01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:52.300
I think it's fucking ridiculous.

01:49:52.300 --> 01:50:00.580
That handheld pillar that they stand on is always gold, like they rule the handheld market.

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:04.140
I got to move on to the next story, but I have to get some of these restaurant ideas

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.140
from chat.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.140
Awesome, here we go.

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:09.860
So Dungeon Buster is suggesting the House of Mario Pancakes, possibly.

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.860
I'd eat there.

01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:13.100
Stoppy, I'm sorry, wins with this one.

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:14.700
Stoppy wins with this one.

01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:15.700
Yoshi's cookies.

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.700
Oh, that just makes sense.

01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:18.700
Done.

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:19.700
Yeah.

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:20.700
Trademark it.

01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.700
Simplest thing.

01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700
Right?

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.700
Yeah.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.140
I feel like there should be an app, and I order my cookies, and they're ready for pick

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.140
up.

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:28.140
Wow.

01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:29.140
Yoshi!

01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:32.360
So if you put like three of the cookies together, do you get a discount or something like that?

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.120
As long as the cookies weren't actually shit out of the dinosaur, I'm fine.

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.320
Yeah, I bet that would be really popular, they're like around Easter, where you have

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.320
Yoshi eggs.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:43.320
Oh, man.

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.320
Cream filled eggs.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.320
They might be, setting themselves to take over the world.

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.320
And they're actually like the little white and green.

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.680
It's like the little toy Yoshi in the middle, like the Kinder Surprise.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.680
Oh, I'm sorry, we can't have those in the US.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.380
Even better with all these stupid YouTube trends, you can have it be like a giant fucking

01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:59.720
surprise egg with shit inside of it.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.720
Oh, unboxing, or un-egging or something?

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:05.760
Bullshit fucking toys that are worth nothing.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:09.040
Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:13.000
Well, this actually makes me super happy.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.880
There is an option in Uncharted 4 that makes a lot of people happy, and it's an accessibility

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:26.640
menu for people who have a physical audio or visual impairment.

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:32.100
In fact, there was a comment made by Josh Straub, who is the editor-in-chief of the

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:39.480
Disabled Accessibility for Gaming Entertainment Rating System, or DAGRS, who had a complaint

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:43.840
about Uncharted 2, that there was a series of doors that you couldn't get through unless

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.000
you button mashed through them, and his physical disability lowered his reflexes to where he

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.200
couldn't do it.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:57.120
They actually went in and rated Uncharted 4, and I'm trying to find the rating.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:02.480
This one, they pretty much gave it as perfect a rating as they could, that they found no

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:11.600
limitations to playing the game for most visually impaired, audio impaired, or physical disabilities.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600
Good for them.

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.600
Yeah.

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600
That's great.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:22.400
A lot of developers don't always think about people who may not be able to handle certain

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.680
things, have any kind of...

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:31.680
I hate to use the word disability, just because in some cases, some people don't find it to

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:41.360
be a disability, especially in terms of autism or other being non-neurotypical.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.380
But at the same time, having those differences catered to, it makes a lot of difference,

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:54.080
and it shows the company respects the people who are buying their games enough to make

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.720
it accessible to a wider market.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.840
Have you guys had...

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:02.760
I know one thing about being a podcaster for this long is that I've really had my eyes

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:07.720
opened up to not just me as a gamer and Loki as a gamer and our soccer, but the other gamers

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:08.720
out there.

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.640
I don't know if you guys ever get this, but I know we have people that call into the show.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.200
For example, just I think last week or two weeks ago, we had a blind gamer who sometimes

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.080
calls into the show pretty regularly who kind of reminds us like, oh shit, yeah, there are

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:26.840
people who like video games that if game makers don't consider these people when making them,

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.840
they're kind of shut out.

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:28.840
I don't know.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:29.840
Have you guys...

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.240
Do you guys have any fans or people that listen or talk to you guys that are kind of like,

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:37.960
oh shit, I never would have thought that this part of the game would have been a challenge,

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.200
but maybe...

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:42.520
We have one guy who's pretty consistent.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.320
He does a YouTube channel and stuff.

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:51.520
He actually had brain surgery to remove a tumor and it's messed with his reflexes in

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.520
one of his hands.

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:57.160
And he was a really good tournament level Street Fighter player.

01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:01.360
And so I started streaming Street Fighter and he'd come in and give me tips and stuff

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360
and I was like, well, let's play.

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:07.920
And he's like, I can't because I'm not good because of what happened.

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:09.400
And we started playing anyways.

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.400
I was like, dude, just play.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:15.160
Cause he still had the game at Street Fighter IV and we played and it did kind of open my

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:22.520
eyes to that there are people out there and it kind of turned into like a Rocky situation.

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.360
He'd go in my streams and be giving me all sorts of amazing tips and stuff.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.360
And I was just playing through his instruction.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.360
That's rad.

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.440
That like the fact that like, okay, maybe I can't play the game, but that's not going

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.340
to stop me from playing the theory crafting of the game and the science of the game and

01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.380
all that.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:42.180
I kind of went through some of that after I had that hand surgery twice where I couldn't

01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:45.640
play games on a console as long as I used to.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:51.620
And it made me into a PC player actually, because I wouldn't play PC games except for

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:55.020
tetranet and like Ragnarok online.

01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:58.420
And now, well, you remember when we were playing final fantasy 11.

01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:00.200
I started off with the controller.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.340
All my macros were set through my shoulder buttons and I played an entire MMO on a controller

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.660
that wasn't necessarily meant to be played on a controller.

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:11.460
And then I had hand surgery and I couldn't do it again.

01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:18.060
There's still some games I can't play because it's not something I make super common knowledge,

01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.540
but I am autistic.

01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:26.100
And so I can't play with certain levels of depth in a game.

01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:32.260
And I can't play with certain flashing because it'll be overstimulating.

01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:37.660
So I like when I can find a game that says turn off this feature, like the blur in Mass

01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:38.940
Effect.

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:39.940
The motion blur.

01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:40.940
I had to turn that off.

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.940
You could turn that off, yeah.

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:44.800
Because that would just fuck with me.

01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:45.900
Motion blur fucks with most people.

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:47.020
I hate motion blur.

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:51.040
It's the bane of my, like in Doom, I was on the multiplayer beta and there was no way

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:52.040
to turn that shit off.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:53.860
Almost killed it for me.

01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:59.140
There's some games I can take it in that has like a fraction of it, but when it's like

01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:06.180
that pronounced, it actually, it's not quite like a pain, but I feel like I get tunnel

01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:10.820
vision right away, almost like I'm about to shut down, so I have to stop it.

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:14.900
The first time I saw it, I had to close down the game until I figured out you could turn

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:15.900
it off.

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:16.900
But yeah.

01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:18.620
Well, I love this discussion.

01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:21.740
I got to keep things moving for time, though, unfortunately.

01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:26.020
But yeah, I think the additional accessibility and the fact that they tested it with a greater

01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:29.180
audience, I think that's a great thing and I hope more game makers will look to that.

01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:32.100
Well, let's travel around the world quickly and check out some release dates and some

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.340
games that will be coming out soon near you.

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:40.300
So this week we have Overwatch coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:41.300
Good.

01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:45.900
Also, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mutants in Manhattan on PlayStation 4, PlayStation

01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:49.420
3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:55.140
And that's the game that was from Platinum, so that should be pretty cool.

01:56:55.140 --> 01:57:00.500
Total War Warhammer on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.540
Omnibus on PC.

01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:07.660
And Table Trap Racing World Tour on PC.

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.460
Omnibus looks awesome, by the way.

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:14.620
Looking at Japan and the Japanese release dates, on the PlayStation 4, Guilty Gear,

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:16.860
I think that, do we say Xrd?

01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:17.860
Xrd?

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:18.860
Xrd?

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.460
I'm not sure exactly how the fans pronounce that, but Guilty Gear X.

01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:27.220
Revelator is out in a regular and a limited edition on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.500
I don't know if the Wii U has anything new this week.

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:30.500
I don't think so.

01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:31.500
I think it's kind of slow there.

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:32.500
I don't think they have anything coming out on the Wii U anymore.

01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:36.180
Yeah, even in Japan, I don't think there's anything until June when the Mario and Sonic

01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.340
Olympic stuff.

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:39.140
But yet they are still trucking along with the Vita.

01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:41.860
In fact, there's a lot of Vita games this week in Japan.

01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:44.700
Classic Dungeon Sengoku is out this week.

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:48.220
Kayokai no Shoryuki comes out in a limited edition this week.

01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:53.740
Sengoku Hime 4, Tenka Rioran, Tenmei no Koi Imaki comes out this week as well.

01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:58.900
And let's see, Koyukai no Shoryaki is in the regular edition as well.

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:02.580
So there's regular and limited edition on the Vita in Japan.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:05.420
And lastly, on the 3DS this week, nothing.

01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:08.020
Things are still pretty quiet until June the 9th.

01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:11.220
What was this on Sengoku Hime?

01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:14.020
Like Princess of the Three Kingdoms?

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:15.900
I'm not sure if that...

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.020
Yeah, it's definitely a princess game.

01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:23.580
Yeah, it looks like one of those like Romance of the Three Kingdoms type of games, but all

01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:24.580
ladies in charge.

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:25.580
I had a feeling.

01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.580
Yeah.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.580
My turn.

01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:28.580
Yes, Europe.

01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:29.580
Oh, Europe.

01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:30.580
I'm sorry.

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:33.300
You get one game and you'll like it.

01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:34.300
I think.

01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:36.380
Dungeons 2 on PlayStation 4.

01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:37.380
Safine.

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:40.340
All right, slow week in Europe.

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.340
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:46.060
A dozen indie developers are like, hey, what about me?

01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:49.220
We'll tell Eurogamer to start listing your shit.

01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:53.300
A great time to catch up on indies or like the 500 other games in your backlog.

01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:54.300
Yeah.

01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.940
All right, just a couple more quick stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the

01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:58.260
classic game of the week.

01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.260
Loki.

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:04.620
So this is, I guess, a good demonstration of how YouTube's kind of broken.

01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:11.020
Apparently a recent episode of Family Guy had featured a clip from a YouTube user Switched

01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:17.580
with one instead of an eye, featuring a glitch from Double Dribble.

01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:24.900
And what's kind of funny is, so first they borrowed the footage and used it in the episode,

01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:28.980
I'm assuming without licensing it from the original user that made it.

01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:34.580
And then on top of all that, after it did air and everything, Content ID said, hey,

01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:38.580
hey you with the original clip that was on YouTube, we're going to fucking Content ID

01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:44.020
claim your fucking video because it's our video now.

01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:51.480
So Fox Content ID claimed the video that they borrowed for the episode of Family Guy.

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.820
Which I'm sure they never contacted the guy to get permission because in a way they kind

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:57.260
of don't have to because it's really Konami's game.

01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.260
Right.

01:59:58.260 --> 02:00:00.740
Did they contact Konami for license?

02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:04.660
And I mean, I guess it could be kind of, I don't know if you want to call it fair use

02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:09.260
because they're talking over it and stuff and it's kind of transformative in that way,

02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:12.740
which I really wish something like that would go to court because then that would set precedents.

02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:14.440
But who knows?

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:17.340
Of course, you know, Seth MacFarlane, you know, on Twitter said, hey, you know, he's

02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:23.700
kind of aware, you know, I don't run Fox, but stop tweeting me, but I will look into

02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:24.700
the issue.

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:29.620
Apparently the video did get put, you know, the DMCA strike was lifted and it was back

02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:30.620
up.

02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:34.260
But still though, I mean, they didn't ask permission for that guy's clip.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:39.540
I mean, it's kind of, kind of lame that they can just steal that off the internet, especially

02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:44.620
when, you know, if I were to steal a Family Guy clip, obviously we get content ID strike.

02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:51.620
YouTube needs to fix this content ID fuckery soon because Amazon is right behind them,

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:53.300
ready to pounce in for the kill.

02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:57.220
And this is the type of thing that's going to send people somewhere else.

02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:01.220
And you guys might remember just what last week, Amazon said they're launching their

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:05.460
own thing that is essentially going to compete at least with like the premiere stuff on YouTube,

02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:10.460
where basically they're going to open up Amazon Prime, where anybody can put their show on

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:11.740
Amazon Prime.

02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:15.140
And that's going to even, you know, we're not in the business of doing video, but now

02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:20.420
even I'm sitting here going, if I did make a video show, because Dark Soccer and I have

02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:24.920
talked about it before doing something, you know, inspired by some other things we follow,

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:32.800
like if we did do a video show, would we put it on YouTube or should we go to Amazon?

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.920
You know, these, I think as long as YouTube continues to show that they're going to side

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.320
with the corporations long before they side with the people creating the content, I kind

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.760
of think it just inspires people to run the other direction.

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:45.760
I've said this before.

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.320
You should go to Vimeo.

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.960
But then see, but then here's the problem, Vimeo is kind of, it's still kind of niche.

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:55.880
Vimeo hasn't really, Vimeo is not an app on your PlayStation 4.

02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:58.040
You know what I mean?

02:01:58.040 --> 02:01:59.040
What?

02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:00.040
Bianca Del Rio goes through Vimeo.

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:04.280
Oh, well, if it's good enough for her, then it's good enough for us.

02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:08.720
I'm just saying the problem is there's no Vimeo app on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:09.720
there is Amazon Prime.

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:10.720
You know what I mean?

02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:12.540
That's why I think there is Twitch.

02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:16.200
That's why I think Amazon entering this market is finally, somebody's going to fucking give

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.400
YouTube some competition.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:20.920
I'm excited.

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:25.860
YouTube has kind of been in some weird space, especially with their major users and stuff

02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:26.860
like that.

02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:34.520
They're very popular Twitch creators, or YouTube creators, and they've been very vocal about

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.480
it too, how they're not happy with the state of YouTube.

02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:45.120
I think if one of them, I don't know, who's like a real big one out there that's PewDiePie?

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:49.720
Like if a PewDiePie said, hey, Amazon's doing their thing, I might have to go over there

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.720
for a second.

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:54.720
Then they can probably get a big draft of people just be like, well, I mean, PewDiePie's

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:55.720
over there.

02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:56.720
I'm over there now, you know?

02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:59.840
And then you have this giant civil war or something like that, that just people are

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:00.840
choosing sides.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:01.840
Oh, man.

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:02.840
It's going to be just like the movie.

02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:03.840
I'm on T-Putes.

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:04.840
T-Markiplier.

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:05.840
Yeah, see?

02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:07.840
Yeah.

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.840
He's my friend.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.840
Yeah.

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.920
So was I. Yeah, you're going to get some of that type

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:12.920
of stuff.

02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:15.840
I mean, it'll draw some lines, definitely.

02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.680
But Amazon, you're right, they have their prime to pounce on this type of thing.

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:22.680
Nice.

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:23.680
Nice.

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:27.440
I wasn't even thinking about that, too.

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.580
For once, I actually really agree with Kaijuto on this comment.

02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:33.800
All joking aside.

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:37.200
What shocks me the most out of this story is that Family Guy is still on the air.

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:40.240
That was the reaction I had.

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.920
I thought it was only in repeats.

02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.000
I thought it was just that thing that's always on the stoner television.

02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.160
That's true.

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.160
New episodes, yeah.

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.160
I haven't watched it.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.160
Have you seen the clip of the Double Dribble?

02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:50.160
Because I've watched it.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.360
Luckily, somebody filmed it with their iPhone and put it on YouTube so that it wouldn't

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.360
match content ID.

02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:56.360
So yes, I did see it.

02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.200
Yeah, it's a pretty funny clip.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:02.560
I thought they were talking about another clip, because they did the same one for a

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:03.920
football game, too.

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:08.240
But it's such like, I guess this is kind of typical of Family Guy, and they're really

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:12.920
long references or very obscure references.

02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.160
Most people aren't going to know what the fuck that is.

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:18.160
They're like, Double Dribble, what?

02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:21.380
Is that a real game?

02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:26.040
They're targeting a very specific audience here, and it's just like, I don't know.

02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.120
People are going to be kind of pissed off about it.

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.760
Since you guys at Video Game Bang do more of the video than we do here at OLR, you guys

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.240
actually do broadcasting.

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:36.360
Have you ever gotten hit by the copyright thing?

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.360
Oh yeah.

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360
Oh yeah.

02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.360
We've been hit.

02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.000
We've been hit by different type of stuff to get banned, too.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yeah.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
We get banned for weird things.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.360
Luckily, they're not as strict as YouTube, because YouTube, there's like three strikes

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.360
and you're out.

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.360
Yeah.

02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:54.480
For us, we use some music that has gotten caught.

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.480
Yeah, muted.

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.480
Yeah.

02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:57.480
We get to mute it.

02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:58.480
They'll mute it out.

02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.480
They'll just mute the audio.

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.480
We've gotten banned only twice.

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.480
Once, because idiot over here broke NDA.

02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.480
Because I didn't read an NDA.

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.480
Excuse me.

02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:04.520
Yeah, you got to read your damn NDA's.

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.640
He didn't read NDA's, and it wasn't even a very good game.

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:07.640
What was it?

02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:09.640
Nightwatch?

02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.640
I don't remember.

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:11.640
Something.

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.640
No.

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:13.640
It was something by...

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.640
2K, wasn't it?

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:16.640
I can't remember.

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:20.640
It was one of those zombie horde games where you build...

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.640
Oh yeah, yeah.

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:25.640
The Unreal 4 one.

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:28.640
I could have swore people were streaming it, so I was like...

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:29.640
Well, they had permission.

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:31.640
I was like, well, then I'm going to stream this thing.

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:32.640
Oh, yeah.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:33.640
That is some bullshit, too.

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.640
You know, where, oh, these people can have permission to stream this.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.640
Yeah, but you can't.

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:38.640
All these other people know about them dollar bills.

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.640
So I got 30 minutes of that, and then they shut me down, and I was like, what happened

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:43.640
to the game?

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:44.640
And, yeah, it's gone.

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.640
Our other ban was for nonsense, because...

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:48.640
So this idiot...

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.640
It was April Fools.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:52.640
Watch Dogs had just come out.

02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:56.640
I was like, hey, I'm going to make this article saying that there was a hot coffee mod in

02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:01.640
Watch Dogs on Nerd Reactor, you know, as a joke article, and link it to a Twitch.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.640
And then when they get to the Twitch, it was just going to be a picture, like a video of

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.640
my dogs in their crates all day.

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:07.640
Watch Dogs.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:08.640
Get it?

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:09.640
Funny.

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:10.640
Yeah.

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:11.640
Okay.

02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:16.640
Twitch didn't think it was funny either, so they banned us for like 48 hours.

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:17.640
Over some dogs?

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:18.640
Over some dogs.

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:19.640
Over some Watch Dogs.

02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.640
It would have been great, though, if you actually had a cup of coffee in front of the dog.

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:23.640
There you go.

02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.640
See?

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.640
That's why I needed to be here.

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:26.640
Then it would have been accurate.

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:27.640
Yeah.

02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:29.640
Well, thank God you met us.

02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:31.640
Watch out.

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:32.640
Watch out.

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:33.640
I think about this stuff regularly.

02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:34.640
Coffee and dogs.

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:35.640
Yeah.

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.640
The SSJ100Matt says, that was a good troll.

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.640
Thank you.

02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:40.640
Some folks appreciate that.

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:41.640
They do.

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:42.640
Now, thank you.

02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:43.640
SSJ100Matt also reminding me.

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:46.640
I promised I would bring up Glee later in the show.

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:47.640
Okay.

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:52.640
So Fox is obviously the one that has the Uber clamp down content ID thing.

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:55.640
Let's not forget, Fox has stolen shit in the past.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:01.640
Do you remember when they did Baby Got Back on Glee and they totally stole Jonathan Colton's

02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:02.640
version?

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:03.640
Borrowed.

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:04.640
Borrowed.

02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.640
Borrowed.

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:07.640
And didn't even credit the guy.

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.640
They sold that version on iTunes.

02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:10.640
Really?

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:11.640
Not even a fucking...

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:12.640
No, that's so cool.

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:13.640
They probably totally credited the guy that made the YouTube video, too.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.640
Oh, wait.

02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:16.640
No, they fucking didn't because they're Fox.

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:18.640
See, here's the weird thing about it, though.

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:20.640
But at the end of the day, that was...

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:24.640
If I remember right, the original gameplay clip was like nothing but footage from Konami's

02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:25.640
game, right?

02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:26.640
Yes.

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:29.640
So I'm kind of like, do they really have to get the guy's permission?

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:33.640
I don't think they do because it's Konami's fucking game and the guy's face wasn't in

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:34.640
it.

02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:37.640
His commentary wasn't in it as far as I know.

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:38.640
So...

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:40.640
They only have to get someone's permission because...

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:47.640
Well, I think, okay, no, they would not need to get his permission to use footage of Double

02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:53.640
Dribble, but being that it's his footage of Double Dribble, they didn't just make footage

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:54.640
up.

02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:56.640
Then, yeah, I think they do need to get permission from him.

02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:01.640
And how hard would it be to reach out to this guy and there's no way he'd be like, oh, no,

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.640
I don't want my stuff on your show.

02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:04.640
Yeah, right.

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:05.640
He's gonna give up his stuff.

02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:06.640
I equate it to a photograph.

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:12.640
Like, you have to ask permission to use a photograph on something.

02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:13.640
That's true.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.640
Ask the guy.

02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:16.640
I'm literally sure he's gonna be like, yeah, I would love it.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:19.640
Sure, they could have just been like, hey, just a heads up.

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:21.640
We're gonna air your stuff.

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:24.640
Here's some free tickets to Megyn Kelly's upcoming talk show or something.

02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:25.640
Yeah, there you go.

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:26.640
There you go.

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.640
Whatever.

02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:28.640
And he'll gladly take that.

02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:33.640
Megyn Kelly, what the fuck?

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:35.640
All right.

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:38.640
Let's talk about Resident Evil 7.

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:42.640
Apparently it's happening, which, good, I thought 6 had killed the whole series, honestly.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:43.640
It almost did.

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:44.640
So I think a lot of us were thinking...

02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.640
Where do you go from giraffe fellatio?

02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:49.640
Where do you go from giraffe fellatio?

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:50.640
Which 6 was that?

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:51.640
Oh, the symbol.

02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:52.640
The box art?

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:53.640
Yes, the actual 6.

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:55.640
Now you'll never unsee it.

02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.640
I literally was thinking in the game, I'm like, I don't remember seeing giraffe.

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.640
It was done so artistically.

02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:05.640
It's like the old Red Bull logo.

02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:07.640
You can never forget it and never unsee it.

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.640
The Red Bull logo?

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.640
Sold Red Bull logo.

02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.640
Don't ruin that now for me.

02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:12.640
I don't even want to think.

02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:15.640
Now I'm gonna have to go and Google search the old Red Bull logo.

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:22.640
Or if you ever go to Final Fantasy XIV's Mog station, it's supposed to be like a little Moogle hat or something like that.

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:25.640
It looks like the Moogle is bending over and showing you his butthole.

02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:30.640
And you'll never, now you will never unsee that when you go to look at the Mog station.

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.640
All right. Anyway.

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:38.640
Resident Evil 7, apparently a thing that is gonna happen and you are gonna see it at E3.

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:46.640
Apparently some tweets from a Tokyo-based analyst, Dr. Serkan Toto mentioned that it will be shown at E3.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:57.640
The Resident Evil 7 team hired Jordan Amaro, a designer who had worked on Metal Gear Solid 5 and PT at Kojima Productions.

02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:03.640
So, well, it's not Del Toro and it's not, you know, Hideo Kojima.

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:07.640
But it's like we're trying to narrow down the degrees of Kevin Bacon type of thing.

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:14.640
Like so, we got a dude who worked with those guys, maybe like assimilated some of the good ideas.

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:24.640
But the problem is that like Resident Evil, the newer games now seem to be more in line with like the Resident Evil movies which are like ridiculously action-based.

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:30.640
I mean, I want to say that, you know, being that I never actually played Resident Evil 6, just kind of watched different gameplay.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.640
But they had a scene where I think where one of the characters jumped an explosion with a motorcycle or something like that.

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:49.640
Which, that doesn't seem like survival horror to me. I mean, it's not the same like as Resident Evil 1 where you're in a mansion and there's like jump scares and zombies and monsters and shit.

02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:52.640
It's just like, I don't know.

02:10:52.640 --> 02:11:04.640
They've drastically moved away from one now. Like it's night and day. Like one, you can even kind of be like, oh, it's survival horror and there's puzzle elements to the game as well, you know.

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:11.640
There are no puzzle challenges whatsoever in Resident Evil anymore. It's run, shoot this, blow that up, and that's it.

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:15.640
I want the terrible voice acting back. I want the terrible, terrible voice acting back.

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:20.640
Just know what you are, you know. There's always a place for a bad horror movie.

02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:32.640
Alright, there's always a place on this show for the classic game of the week. Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that is ten years older or more that she thinks,

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:39.640
hey, you little brats, stop blowing giraffes and go play this classic video game.

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:42.640
Break out your ethernet adapter for your dreamcast.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:48.640
I love this pick. This is one of my very favorite games. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.640
Phantasy Star Online.

02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:51.640
Yes!

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:54.640
Did you choose that because you knew he was going to be on here?

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.640
Exactly, like if I had to choose a second one.

02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:57.640
Divine Intervention.

02:11:57.640 --> 02:11:58.640
Exactly.

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.640
Well, I did an MMO last week. I figured I'd do another one.

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:01.640
Great.

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:09.640
And it's also one that I super love that actually I've been sort of in this rut of MMOs right now because I'm getting kind of bored with Final Fantasy XIV.

02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:14.640
Kind of thinking about going back to WoW and then I was like, wait, I could just re-patch Phantasy Star Online 2.

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:20.640
And I could play it in partial Japanese and badly translated English.

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:23.640
But you've probably played it so much that you know how to navigate through that.

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:24.640
Yeah.

02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:25.640
No problem, yeah.

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:28.640
I did play Phantasy Star Online 2 for a while actually.

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:34.640
So anyway, Phantasy Star Online 2 came out on December 21st, 2000.

02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.640
So get this.

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.640
16 years old.

02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:40.640
No.

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.640
15 years old and change.

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:44.640
So, still.

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:46.640
You don't really think about it, right?

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:50.640
So this one is a full hack and slash.

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:59.640
And it's different than a lot of MMOs in the fact that where you have certain quests to do, you're not in a huge open world.

02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:01.640
You're in a sectional world.

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.640
So you're navigating through these different planes.

02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.640
I mean, you can freaking memorize entire levels.

02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:09.640
I used to just have a pile of them memorized.

02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.640
But you could get your little...

02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.640
Crap, now I forgot the names of them.

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:14.640
Your little floaty things.

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:15.640
Your mags.

02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:17.640
Mags, yes. Thank you.

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:24.640
I ran around with an Oppa Oppa for the longest time because my first favorite game is the Guardian Legend.

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.640
My second favorite is Fantasy Zone.

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:32.640
And I ran around with an Oppa Oppa forever and my friend had a Dreamcast and another friend of mine had a Master System.

02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.640
And it was amazing.

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:45.640
So when we got it in the US, I think that we started with the Phantasy Star Online 1 and 2 which came out in 2002.

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:48.640
In Japan, you had each individual one.

02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:56.640
And then we had... There was an Episode 3 which was the card revolution that came out on GameCube in 2003.

02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.640
That was terrible.

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:06.640
And so that's where Blue Burst comes from as the fourth installment in the series.

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:09.640
That came out in 2004. So we're still 12 years back.

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:12.640
This video is so crazy because it's a speedrun or something.

02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.640
I'm going to switch it up a little bit.

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.640
I did find one that had music.

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:18.640
How about this? Because this is from the soundtrack.

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:20.640
The soundtrack was amazing.

02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.640
I love the music in this game.

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:28.640
And of course, a lot of us played Blue Burst on PC.

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:34.640
Because after a while, new systems came out. They didn't put out a new one.

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:37.640
But the PC version kept getting updated until...

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:42.640
This was funny. They were allowing people when the US servers closed down,

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:47.640
they were giving them their character data to import into private servers.

02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:48.640
Wow.

02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:53.640
So Sega was fully cool with people continuing the game with their characters.

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:55.640
They just weren't going to support the server.

02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.640
Wow. Take a note, Blizzard.

02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.640
I'll let you do that.

02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:04.640
And it did have an offline mode.

02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.640
Which you can just play through everything and work on the story.

02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.640
Take note of everybody that has an MMO.

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:11.640
Exactly.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:17.640
I still, to this day, have a Red Ring Riku on my desk at work.

02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:18.640
Wow.

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:20.640
From a little capsule thing.

02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:23.640
I used to have the Sega Ladies one.

02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:25.640
My Sarah Bryant's leg fell off.

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:28.640
Who was the other one that I had?

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:31.640
I still have Arl from P.O.P.O.

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.640
But I can't remember the other one I had that broke.

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:39.640
I got that game before it came out in America.

02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:43.640
In 2002, I had no system.

02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:47.640
And I was like, okay, I'm getting a GameCube because I read up on this game called Fantasy Star.

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:49.640
Whatever this is.

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:53.640
And I remember setting my desktop thing, or my background,

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:57.640
so that picture that's literally on this YouTube playing soundtrack.

02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.640
And I was like, I'm getting this game no matter what comes out.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.640
I buy four controllers, two memory cards.

02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:08.640
We play, me and my three friends play all night long.

02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:12.640
Like chuggy graphics, split screen on the GameCube.

02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:15.640
Did not matter. We failed so hard for that game.

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.640
And it was just, it was amazing.

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:22.640
I didn't actually play online until two years after buying that game.

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.640
We couldn't get it to play online because the ethernet adaptor wasn't supported by the U.S.

02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.640
One on Dreamcast. And then I played it on Xbox.

02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:34.640
In fact, I will actually say that playing on Xbox,

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:37.640
this is before I had a reliable cell phone.

02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:41.640
This was back in the Nokia phones that I had my Batsmaru cover on.

02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:44.640
You know, the one that everyone had.

02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:49.640
I actually had an instance that I needed to go to the hospital.

02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:54.640
And I was playing with one of my friends, a local friend thankfully,

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.640
who came and got me and took me to the hospital

02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:00.640
because I told her in the game, I think something's wrong

02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.640
and I need someone to take me to the hospital.

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:05.640
And that's with that little dinky headset.

02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:08.640
And so next thing I know, her character beeps out

02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:12.640
and I get a call, I'm on my way.

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.640
They're saving lives.

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:18.640
Yeah, it turned out to not be anything majorly crazy, but it could have been worse

02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.640
had I not gone.

02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:23.640
It was just interesting.

02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:27.640
And now we hear stories all the time about how people are talked down from suicide

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.640
and everything through their online games

02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:33.640
or how this one guy logged off from his online games saying that that was it.

02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:36.640
And because one of his online friends knew where he was,

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.640
they called the police and then prevented him from hanging himself.

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.640
I'm sorry though, nothing will top the Domino's Pizza

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:49.640
where the guy was ordering a pizza every other day for forever

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:51.640
and he didn't order a pizza for 11 days.

02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.640
So Domino's Pizza called the cops, sent him to the guy.

02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:58.640
Yep, the guy had a fall, was on the ground, needed medical intervention.

02:17:58.640 --> 02:17:59.640
Wow.

02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:00.640
Crazy.

02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:02.640
Did he get free pizza for the rest of his life then?

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:05.640
He'll be in the commercials, you know it.

02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:10.640
If that crazy guy can be in the Subway commercials, this guy can get a Domino's commercial.

02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.640
Anyway, oh yeah, Fantasy Star.

02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.640
I'd like to go into a little bit of the development of this

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:17.640
because I do think it's pretty interesting.

02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.640
At the time, the Sega chairman was Okawa Isao

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.640
and he said the internet gaming was going to be important.

02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.640
It was the future, you know.

02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:33.640
And he was very curious about bringing the PC online element into consoles in Japan.

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:36.640
Because I mean, and he also looked back at Sega.

02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.640
You had, you know, the Sega channel.

02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:40.640
Oh yeah.

02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:44.640
You had, you know, even that whole satellite thing came out in the US for a short while.

02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:50.640
I mean, of course, Nintendo had the Satellaview, but they had really embraced it, I think.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:58.640
And so, right after Sonic Adventure was completed, Sonic Team was tasked with making a network game.

02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:01.640
They didn't quite know what it was, but it was going to be a network game.

02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:05.640
And so, they had a working title called Third World

02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:12.640
and they wanted to do science fiction and fantasy combined with realistic 3D graphics.

02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:17.640
And so, the first piece of concept art was a dragon.

02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:21.640
And he showed it to Yuji Naka, the director of Sonic Team.

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:24.640
Who my husband got to meet. He's a really cool guy.

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:30.640
Anyway, he immediately got the feeling of Phantasy Star with it.

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:33.640
And so, that's how it came to be called Phantasy Star Online.

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:39.640
And they actually took a big cue from Diablo for how the game would work.

02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:41.640
For basic mechanics.

02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:49.640
And pretty much, they went with some of the design staff from Phantasy Star IV.

02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.640
And now we have it.

02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:59.640
That's why I also think that it has such a stylistic tie-in with the Phantasy Star series.

02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:03.640
Just because it went immediately with the designers from...

02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:04.640
What?

02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:05.640
Loki?

02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:06.640
Nevermind.

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.640
He has a VR thing on his face and I was distracted.

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:15.640
And so, our first review of Phantasy Star Online came with a demo disc for Sonic Adventure 2.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:18.640
And then, it came out.

02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:21.640
This is the game I bought a Dreamcast for, really.

02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:25.640
This is my first MMO before I even knew what an MMO was.

02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.640
I was like, whoa, there's other people on the same game.

02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:31.640
Yeah, that game was amazing.

02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:35.640
Bobby and some of the people in chat are talking about that it's not really an MMO.

02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:38.640
I'm kind of on the fence.

02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:41.640
I think it has MMO characteristics and I think it's definitely like...

02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:43.640
There were roleplay channels.

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:46.640
I definitely think there is a bridge here.

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:47.640
You know what I mean?

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:50.640
So, it's not EverQuest, but it's...

02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:53.640
It's a massively multiplayer online game.

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:54.640
MMO.

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:57.640
Isn't Guild Wars the same type of setup?

02:20:57.640 --> 02:20:58.640
Don't you kind of get into a...

02:20:58.640 --> 02:20:59.640
It's an actual roleplay.

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:00.640
The original was.

02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:01.640
You're right.

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:02.640
The original was a very similar type of setup.

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:07.640
I would say Phantasy Star Online was the console's first attempt

02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:10.640
at replicating what the PC was doing in the MMO space.

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:13.640
Anyway, but technicalities.

02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:17.640
At any rate, the whole basis of the game is that you're trying to find a planet to settle on

02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:20.640
and so the Pioneer 1 is sent to check it out

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:22.640
and then you have the Pioneer 2 later on.

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.640
They go to this planet, Raghul, to investigate.

02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:28.640
I will tell you this.

02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:32.640
My friend, Julie, has a Rappy.

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:33.640
Like a plush one or something?

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:38.640
A plush Rappy that she paid 120 bucks for that is like...

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:41.640
That's it? Bitch got a deal.

02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:43.640
Four feet tall and it's huge.

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.640
It's like the size of a toddler.

02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:46.640
What color? Yellow?

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:47.640
A really fat toddler.

02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:48.640
Yellow one?

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:49.640
Yeah.

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:51.640
I remember they had those special events where you would go in

02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.640
and they had different color Rappy.

02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:57.640
They were like a blue one and then you'd have to try to get it

02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:59.640
to get a secret item or something like that.

02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:00.640
Those were pretty cool.

02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:01.640
We did all those.

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:05.640
And then the episodes pretty much keep continuing.

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.640
The gameplay pretty much stays a lot of the same.

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:11.640
You had your offline mode which had your stories and everything in there as well.

02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:14.640
Your different side quests that you get through the Hunter's Guild and everything.

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:16.640
And then of course your online.

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:20.640
You can keep working, but you can get up to level 20 for hard mode,

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:22.640
40 for very hard and 80 for ultimate.

02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:28.640
And then for blue burst it was actually broken down into series of separate missions.

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:31.640
And then you had special missions coming for the principal's office.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:32.640
It was pretty cool.

02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.640
You had symbol chat as well.

02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:40.640
Which I liked because I would every so often play with Japanese players.

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:42.640
And so it was just really nice.

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.640
You could just put out your symbols and boom there you were.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:46.640
And it was universal for everyone.

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:52.640
The game, I don't know, everybody that played, at least at my house,

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:54.640
because I played on the GameCube,

02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:57.640
everybody that made a character, they felt unique.

02:22:57.640 --> 02:22:59.640
And I think that was one thing I really liked about it.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:03.640
I had a friend who he was just hardcore type of manly type of guy.

02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:07.640
And he made this robot and he made them all tall and he had them all black.

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:13.640
And then you pick your name that you go through and it assigns you the color and everything.

02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:16.640
So he was all hardcore black.

02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:20.640
And then he had Pinkle right in the middle of his chest.

02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:22.640
And I was like, you better own that dude.

02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.640
Just take it.

02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:24.640
And he was like, whatever.

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:28.640
I always played the Newman Mage.

02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:29.640
The Newman Mage?

02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:30.640
Yeah.

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:31.640
That was the other thing.

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.640
I guess you could say that was how I always thought it was an MMO.

02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:37.640
And that was my first experience with one.

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:43.640
So going from that to WoW, I picked a warrior thinking,

02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:46.640
oh, I can do a little bit of, you know, I can use any weapon.

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:49.640
I can do a little bit of magic up to a certain point.

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:51.640
That's what I thought a warrior was going to be when I played WoW.

02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:52.640
Totally different.

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:55.640
And I was like, this is a terrible fantasy star and I'm playing that again.

02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:58.640
And remember, I still have a paladin named Rebecca Black.

02:23:58.640 --> 02:23:59.640
Wow.

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.640
Who I got to level 85 during Cataclysm.

02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:03.640
Wow.

02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:04.640
Oh, no.

02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:07.640
There was one time I got followed around by someone just making up words to Friday,

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:09.640
following me around in one of the levels.

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.640
I was like, dude, you're cool, but I'm not going to be your friend.

02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:14.640
Because that's creepy.

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.640
You're not that cool.

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:17.640
You're cool, but.

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:20.640
I do have screenshots of it.

02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:26.640
So with Blue Burst, the other cool thing about that is that it came with the episode one

02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.640
and two side story quests.

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:29.640
So it was pretty neat.

02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:34.640
You also had, you know, your actions or your gestures that you could do and everything.

02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:35.640
Like, come on.

02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.640
Hi.

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:38.640
You know, all the little cute stuff.

02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:44.640
And then, of course, we got Fantasy Star Online version two.

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.640
That was the we had the PC one.

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:51.640
And you also that was the one that introduced the ultimate mode.

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.640
GameCube and Xbox had episode one and two that came out in 2002.

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.640
And it had quite a bit more role play element to it with that version,

02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:05.640
because it needed to be a more robust game for people who couldn't play it online.

02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:12.640
And then Blue Burst, again, came out for Windows in 2004,

02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:17.640
which I think it actually kind of works because, I mean, with Fantasy Star,

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:21.640
keep in mind that the Dreamcast ran on Windows CE.

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:26.640
So, well, almost every Dreamcast game ran on a version of CE.

02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:30.640
In fact, with every game that comes on a Dreamcast,

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:37.640
it loads a version of CE before it runs the game so that it's running its OS first.

02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:41.640
And then the game is tailored to that build of CE.

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:47.640
And so that was, I think, what made it easier for it to come out on, of course, PC,

02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.640
because you're pretty much translating from one Microsoft OS to another.

02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:53.640
And the same, of course, for Xbox.

02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:56.640
As for GameCube, well, they're a special snowflake.

02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:03.640
Then, of course, we got Fantasy Star Online 2, of course, much after that.

02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:05.640
But this is focusing on the original.

02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:08.640
Now, you know, this wasn't my first MMO, though, I must say.

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:10.640
You know what my first was?

02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.640
What are you writing it on?

02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:15.640
Gemstone 3 on AOL, text-based MMO.

02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:19.640
And I played a crapload of Ragnarok Online.

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:20.640
And that's it.

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:21.640
So, Fantasy Star.

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.640
In fact, you know what?

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:26.640
I think I might just have to go back to Fantasy Star Online 2.

02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:27.640
Who's with me?

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:28.640
Me, I love Fantasy Star.

02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:30.640
I wish we'd get the sequel.

02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:31.640
I really do, too.

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:34.640
I understand that it may not be as good and maybe, like,

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.640
the whole rose colored glasses thing, but it just depends on you.

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:39.640
I want to try it for myself.

02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:40.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.640
Let's just find a private server for Fantasy Star Online, Blue Burst.

02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:44.640
And do it.

02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:46.640
Just message me at DarkSakura on Twitter.

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:47.640
All right.

02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:48.640
We'll make this happen.

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:53.640
So, this week, we need a server for Minecraft VR, Tetranet, and PSO Blue Burst.

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.640
PSO Blue Burst gets the focus, though.

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:56.640
We'll work on that.

02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.640
All right.

02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:58.640
That'll be my task.

02:26:58.640 --> 02:26:59.640
We're going to take a break.

02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:03.640
I believe we are now at the point where we're at the halfway point of our show,

02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:06.640
and it's already longer than the entirety of last week's show.

02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:07.640
But that's all right.

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:10.640
We're having a good time here with our pals from Video Game Bang.

02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.640
We're going to come back after this quick break with your phone calls here shortly,

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.640
1877-GameOLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:21.640
and Fugu Question of the Week, as well as maybe the mailbag.

02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:23.640
I don't know if we got emails this week.

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:24.640
No emails.

02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.640
Never mind.

02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:26.640
We won't do the mailbag.

02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:27.640
But we will do more news when we come back.

02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:28.640
It's a Quota Classic movie.

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:30.640
We ain't found shit.

02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.640
Well, we hope you will find us again here after a quick break.

02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:35.640
We'll be right back.

02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:44.640
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:52.640
Live tonight with episode number 642 of our show for this May the 22nd of 2016.

02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:58.640
Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, all here in studio with our pals from Video Game Bang,

02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:01.640
another Sacramento-based video game podcast joining us here in studio tonight.

02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:05.640
We got Aaron, Corey, Webb, all here.

02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.640
And I'm going to be crashing their show on Wednesday, so make sure you tune in.

02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:10.640
That'll be a lot of fun.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:13.640
I realize, horrible host I am.

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.640
I never let you guys, like, tell people where to find your show.

02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:18.640
I mean, I figure people know how to use Google.

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:22.640
But where can we find and follow all the good stuff for Video Game Bang?

02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:27.640
So the usual places, iTunes, just search Video Game space bang.

02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.640
We're also on Google Music, so if you have an Android device,

02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:33.640
that's probably the easiest way to find it.

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:36.640
Facebook.com slash Video Game Bang bang.

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:39.640
Twitter at Video Game Bang.

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.640
And then we're actually going to be launching our website June 1st.

02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:48.640
And that will be VGBstudios.com as well as Video Game Bang.com.

02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:51.640
Nice. Wow, you got a whole empire going on over there.

02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:52.640
Slowly but surely.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:53.640
Nice.

02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:56.640
And only we know about it.

02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:57.640
All right.

02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:02.640
We're going to pick up some rapid fire news and get into all the rest of the gaming news.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.640
And we want to get into as well our Skype line.

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.640
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.640
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.640
We'll be opening that in just a little bit.

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:13.640
But we do want to run through at least this rapid fire news here first.

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:15.640
We'll start with Loki.

02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:16.640
All right.

02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.640
So unfortunately this isn't going to really save this game,

02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:24.640
but there's a nice little Easter egg from Home Front Revolution.

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:27.640
And it's featuring Time Splitter 2 levels.

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:30.640
Apparently there's an arcade machine in the game

02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:33.640
where you can actually play the first two levels of Time Splitters 2.

02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:38.640
Which, that's awesome, but it also pisses me off

02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:43.640
because I don't have Time Splitters 2 or even a new Time Splitters game.

02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:47.640
Are they upping the graphics on the HD remake for at least the two levels?

02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:49.640
It doesn't appear so.

02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:52.640
I don't know, maybe that's a sign?

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:53.640
Missed opportunity.

02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:55.640
That would be pretty cool.

02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:57.640
But yeah, you get to play Siberia in Chicago.

02:29:57.640 --> 02:29:58.640
So check it out.

02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:01.640
Oh, Siberia Arrow, I played that level so many times

02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:04.640
trying to beat it without being detected.

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:06.640
Oh my gosh, that's...

02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:08.640
Time Splitter is a good one, yeah.

02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:09.640
That's awesome.

02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:10.640
That needs to come back.

02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:11.640
All right.

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:15.640
And then, so Rockstar apparently has some new projects in the pipeline.

02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:18.640
They're seeming to be revealed soon.

02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:21.640
The thought is another Red Dead game,

02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:24.640
being that it's been hinted at several times

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:27.640
through different social medias, Reddit and Twitter and stuff.

02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:30.640
Also, possibly something else coming out.

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:34.640
I guess E3 might be a good place for them to announce that

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:36.640
since I want to say that they're supposed to be there.

02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:39.640
My thought is maybe another Red Dead game

02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:43.640
being that they are getting the compatibility working for Red Dead Redemption

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:46.640
and that would be something that I could see them announcing

02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:49.640
during Microsoft's press conference

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:52.640
and then doing, hey, by the way, it's going to be a Games for Gold game

02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:54.640
and it's backwards compatible now.

02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:55.640
That would be awesome.

02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:56.640
Games for Gold?

02:30:56.640 --> 02:30:57.640
Yeah.

02:30:57.640 --> 02:30:59.640
So that would be something I could see.

02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:00.640
I don't know.

02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:02.640
Well, I guess we'll find out soon.

02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:05.640
And then, last but not least,

02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:09.640
Destiny had some leaks regarding the new expansion.

02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:12.640
And this is going to be called Rise of Iron.

02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:18.640
And I guess it's leaked from a new poster or key art for some poster

02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:20.640
that was said to come out.

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:23.640
So, no idea.

02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:27.640
They're saying that I guess some people familiar with Bungie

02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:30.640
are saying that I guess it's going to feature a new raid.

02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:37.640
And they said loosely based on the earlier Fallen themed one

02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:41.640
of initially planned for House of Wolves DLC in year one.

02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:42.640
But I guess crap.

02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:44.640
I don't know.

02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:46.640
Neat artwork, though.

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:47.640
That's pretty cool.

02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:50.640
I still yet, I bought Destiny

02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:52.640
like day one when I got my PlayStation 4.

02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:54.640
Still have not played it.

02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:56.640
That and Watch Dogs.

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:59.640
Both games still in their case, not played.

02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:01.640
Have you actually watched Dogs?

02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:05.640
I have not watched Video Game Bang's Twitch story.

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:08.640
But there are dogs on this poster.

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.640
Wolves, I guess.

02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:12.640
Watch Wolves, the sequel.

02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.640
Alright, speaking of sequels,

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:16.640
if you're looking forward to The Witcher 4,

02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:18.640
you might be waiting a little while.

02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:21.640
The Witcher 3 was pretty damn good.

02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:23.640
And maybe it's time that CD Projekt

02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:25.640
wants to move on to some other things.

02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:27.640
And based on some comments this week

02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:29.640
from the co-founder over at CD Projekt,

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.640
Mark and Iwinski,

02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:33.640
they're not really actively working on A Witcher 4.

02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:35.640
They're not denying that it's ever going to happen.

02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:37.640
But they're just saying that they're focusing

02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:39.640
on some other stuff right now.

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:41.640
Saying there won't be any Witcher anytime soon

02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:42.640
if there ever will be one.

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:44.640
And I would really like to see how people feel about it

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.640
if they will enjoy it.

02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:48.640
Speaking about some other stuff they're working on.

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:50.640
Witcher 3 Blood and Wine

02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:53.640
is the upcoming expansion there for Witcher 3.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:56.640
However, the CD Projekt is working on some other games

02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:00.640
including Cyberpunk 2077.

02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:02.640
That is supposed to come out in the next couple years.

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:05.640
There's also a mysterious AAA role-playing game

02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:07.640
between 2017 and 2021.

02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:10.640
But apparently it is not The Witcher 4.

02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:11.640
It's something else.

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:13.640
And I think they've earned the ability

02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:15.640
to do some other stuff if they want.

02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:18.640
Another role-playing game I know has lots of people's attention

02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:20.640
Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon.

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:23.640
You kids into Pokémon over at the Game Bang?

02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:25.640
Eh, on and off.

02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:28.640
I mean, to the Pokémon GO when that comes out.

02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:29.640
I know I'll be into that.

02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:31.640
But I haven't purchased...

02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:33.640
The last one I played was Silver.

02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:37.640
So I haven't been into Pokémon in quite some time.

02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:38.640
I'm notorious.

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:41.640
I'll play them up through the first gym.

02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:43.640
And then the OCD in me gets really overwhelmed

02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:45.640
at everything I'm not catching and I quit.

02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:47.640
It just happens without fail every time.

02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:50.640
Back in my day there was 150 of them and we liked it.

02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:51.640
That's right.

02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:52.640
151.

02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:53.640
Whoa!

02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:54.640
No.

02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:56.640
He didn't catch them all clearly.

02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:57.640
152.

02:33:57.640 --> 02:33:58.640
You forgot Missingno.

02:33:58.640 --> 02:33:59.640
Alright.

02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:00.640
Oh yeah.

02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:01.640
Glitch.

02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:05.640
Anyhow, I know a lot of people are very excited about Sun and Moon.

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:08.640
You can get more information on that apparently on June 2nd.

02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:10.640
Because remember, Nintendo ain't bringing it to E3.

02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:12.640
So they're kind of dumping the information a little early.

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:13.640
Allegedly.

02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:14.640
Allegedly.

02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:16.640
So we don't know if it's gameplay footage.

02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:19.640
Maybe the evolutions of the starting characters they've already revealed.

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:20.640
Who knows?

02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:25.640
But if you're a Pokémon fan, you probably already took June 2nd off of work.

02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:27.640
Also, World of Warcraft.

02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:29.640
You know that little movie that's coming out?

02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:30.640
The Warcraft movie.

02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:32.640
Not World of Warcraft movie, but Warcraft movie.

02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:34.640
Because it's early on in the lore.

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:38.640
But as many people were speculating may happen,

02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:42.640
you will have a chance to get World of Warcraft by seeing Warcraft.

02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:43.640
Wow.

02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:49.640
If you see the Warcraft movie, it's through a promotion at certain regal cinemas.

02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:52.640
United Artists Theatres or Edwards Theatres,

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:56.640
which is a whole chain that are kind of related here in the States.

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.640
If you actually go see Warcraft through this promotion,

02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:03.640
you will get a free, full copy of World of Warcraft.

02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.640
Not the restricted version, but the full version of World of Warcraft.

02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.640
Which, they just recently announced,

02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:13.640
includes all expansions through Draenor.

02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:15.640
The latest one they just released.

02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:19.640
Now, it doesn't include Legion, the one they're about to release in August.

02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:21.640
So they'll make some money there.

02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:23.640
And yeah, those monthly sub-fees I think is what they're...

02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:25.640
That's what they're going to make their money once they get you there.

02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:28.640
They also, though, just gave out Warlords of Draenor for free,

02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:29.640
because that's how I have it.

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:30.640
Right, right.

02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:34.640
To people who own base Warcraft, you now have that for free.

02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:36.640
So all you have to do is just wait?

02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:37.640
Yeah, apparently.

02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:39.640
You didn't use to be that way, man.

02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:41.640
You would have to, like, I remember when...

02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:44.640
I bought every expansion in between so I could get to Cataclysm.

02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:47.640
I think when Cataclysm was the newest one,

02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:52.640
I think you still had to buy Lich King and Cataclysm to catch up.

02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:54.640
Like, you didn't just get it all for free.

02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:56.640
And I said for the longest time, I used to do a WoW-focused show

02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:59.640
and I was playing more often, and I said for the longest time,

02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:02.640
you know, Blizzard needs to just include everything up to the latest expansion,

02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:04.640
because that's the only way you're going to get people on board.

02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:06.640
That's the way they do it with Final Fantasy XI,

02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:08.640
and I'm assuming they do it with, you know,

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:10.640
because I've already bought that a few times now,

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:12.640
but each time it's always with the additional expansions.

02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:16.640
Oh, and I'm sure with Final Fantasy XIV 4.0, whatever their next expansion is,

02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:17.640
they're just going to have a base game.

02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:18.640
And it's always dirt cheap, too.

02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:21.640
Like, five bucks or something for the whole thing.

02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:23.640
Actually, they just announced with Final Fantasy XIV

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:28.640
that their free trial is going to go now from level 20 up to level 35,

02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:31.640
so you can actually experience the job system that kicks in at level 30.

02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:34.640
So, that's kind of cool that they're expanding that out.

02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:36.640
So, there you go.

02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.640
Anyhow, so, yeah, if you've always been curious about World of Warcraft,

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.640
I guess if you see the movie, this will be your chance.

02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.640
How nice of them to give me something to spend a bunch of money on.

02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:47.640
That's right.

02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:48.640
That's right.

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:49.640
How nice.

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:51.640
Exactly. It's drug, it's hood logic.

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:53.640
That's right. It's the first hit.

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:54.640
Yeah.

02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.640
After you've seen the pretty movie.

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:58.640
All right, Dark Soccer, what do you have?

02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:02.640
Well, the thing that everyone on the internet ever has been linking to me for the last week

02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:10.640
is there is a fan movie for R-Type that's made by OdaKing 77077,

02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:17.640
aka Paul Johnson, who basically animated a little short movie

02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.640
about some guy who gets sucked into a copy of R-Type.

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:23.640
Yeah, I watched that one.

02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:24.640
It was pretty neat.

02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:25.640
Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:30.640
It was weird. They put a Not Safe for Work sign on it,

02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:32.640
and I was like, what's not safe for work?

02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:36.640
I guess they meant the language, but I'm like, there are people that curse everywhere.

02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:38.640
I don't understand what's not safe for work.

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:43.640
Just what's baffling is how can anyone ever not know about the safe point

02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.640
when you're fighting the first level boss.

02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:47.640
Oh.

02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:49.640
How?

02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:52.640
It's just beyond me how people don't know about that now.

02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:53.640
What?

02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:58.640
Almost every fight in that game has a sweet spot that you can stay in

02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:00.640
where nothing can hit you.

02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:03.640
Honestly, I just haven't played R-Type.

02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:07.640
It was well done because it was done by mainly one guy, basically, right?

02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:08.640
Yeah.

02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:10.640
Yeah, it was very well done.

02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:14.640
The music was done. Actually, I loved the remix of the music in there

02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:21.640
because the first level of R-Type has probably my favorite piece of video game music ever.

02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:25.640
And it was a really good homage to it. I thought it was great.

02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:35.640
So, also, for folks out there who have some concerns, concerns about,

02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:38.640
you know, it would also help if I didn't close the wrong window.

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:43.640
Anyway, there's actually some, for people who had concerns about Yooka-Laylee,

02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:48.640
there's some screenshots out, and it's pretty. It's so pretty.

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:50.640
And that's what's really important.

02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:52.640
That's what I look for first in video games.

02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:53.640
Exactly, right?

02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:54.640
It's pretty, yeah.

02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:55.640
Is it pretty?

02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.640
Nope.

02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:57.640
Okay. Gotta move on.

02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:01.640
It is prettier than a little girl and her Sunday best. Is that pretty?

02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:03.640
No comment on that one.

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:04.640
You know what?

02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:07.640
Yeah, you're wise to just leave that alone.

02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:13.640
No jerk photo moments happening on this podcast.

02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:20.640
So, in other news, we have some sales that are on until tomorrow.

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.640
For the PlayStation Store, a bunch of games got knocked down to five bucks.

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:30.640
One of them being Journey, which that means I should probably go buy it tonight,

02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:38.640
Borderlands, Max Payne, Manhunt, Shin Megami Tensei, Persona 3 Portable,

02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:42.640
the Jackbox Party Pack 2, and the Banner Saga.

02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:47.640
I only care about the one in there I have not yet played, which is Journey.

02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:51.640
And that's it. That's it.

02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:56.640
So, I will, though, there's a little thing on here that did grab my attention,

02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:00.640
which is, alright, did any of you guys ever see Perfect Blue?

02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:01.640
No, I don't think I have.

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:02.640
Yes.

02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:05.640
It is a crazy anime. Like, completely wild.

02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:10.640
Well, it looks like apparently the other thing that the director did,

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:15.640
Millennium Actress, is streaming for free, I think, but I can't find where.

02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:18.640
Look it up for yourselves if you care.

02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:19.640
Alright, you got Google.

02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:21.640
Alright, let's get to the foogle question.

02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.640
Speaking of Google, let's get to foogle.

02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:25.640
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together,

02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:34.640
and you get foogle.

02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:37.640
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities,

02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:40.640
and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:43.640
And this one is about, I don't know if you guys saw,

02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:49.640
there's a leaked prototype that just released this week for a Snow White NES game.

02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:52.640
Not that it was based on the movie, but I think it was kind of like a sequel,

02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:55.640
whatever they, it was called Happily Ever After.

02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:57.640
Sometimes it was like spiritual successor to Snow White.

02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:02.640
And apparently, the joke is, the game is fucking hard.

02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:05.640
So for something like based on Snow White,

02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:11.640
it's apparently like ghosts and goblins level like tough.

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:14.640
So anyway, we asked our listeners this week,

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:18.640
what is a difficult video game that frustrated you,

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.640
but you stuck with it to accomplish what you wanted in the game,

02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.640
whether that was like beating it, 100% collection.

02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:26.640
How did you make it through all the frustrations?

02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:27.640
That's what we asked this week.

02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:29.640
What was the game and how did you push through?

02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:32.640
Degenerate Johnny starting us off on Facebook saying,

02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:37.640
the one game that was difficult but maybe pushed through is Catherine on the hardest difficulty.

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:40.640
If it wasn't for my intervention worthy trophy addiction,

02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:43.640
I don't think I ever would have made it through that amount of torture.

02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:47.640
However, my determination and perseverance to brag about this accomplishment

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:50.640
allowed me to break through this near suicidal ordeal.

02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:53.640
Don't believe me? Look me up on PlayStation Network.

02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:58.640
It's amazing what those stupid little achievements and trophies will motivate you to do.

02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:03.640
Yeah, that was a bomb whenever Microsoft came out with achievements.

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:04.640
Yeah.

02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:06.640
And he's like, I don't need this, but I'm going to do it.

02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.640
Which is funny because I know I'm going like really old school and showing my age here,

02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:14.640
but way back in the day when I was a kid during the Atari 2600 era,

02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:18.640
Activision, if you sent them like a Polaroid of your score in like Pitfall or something,

02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:22.640
they would mail you a patch that you could put on a jacket or something like that, right?

02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:25.640
And of course, I'm sure it signed you up for some mailing list

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:30.640
to send you all the stuff to show mom for Christmas.

02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:33.640
But that was truly the first type of achievements.

02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:37.640
And I really think somebody at Microsoft thought of that idea and was like,

02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:39.640
what if we just gave them a virtual patch?

02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:41.640
Why don't we get some physical ones out here?

02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:42.640
Right?

02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.640
That's a great idea. We can do that to our games too.

02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:50.640
Back in the day when, and I'm surprised there have been no Activision collection

02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.640
where those patches are the achievements.

02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:54.640
That seems so logical.

02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:55.640
They've done that actually.

02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:56.640
Did they?

02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.640
I want to say they have.

02:42:57.640 --> 02:42:58.640
With the full achievements? Maybe they did.

02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:01.640
I want to say, I don't know.

02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:03.640
It sounds like something.

02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:06.640
I want to say they have had an Activision collection with patches.

02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:09.640
All right. Fifth Dream on Facebook says Jet Grind Radio.

02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.640
I had so much trouble with the fast pace and the controls,

02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:14.640
but I liked the game a lot, so I kept playing.

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:18.640
I attempted some levels 20 to 30 times before I finally beat them.

02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:21.640
I think the fact that I got a little better each time tried to push me to not give up.

02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:24.640
I was so proud when I won the game.

02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:27.640
Brad B., our buddy from Pod Culture, said BioShock.

02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:30.640
But the scenery and soundtrack alone are worth it.

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:33.640
Sometimes you push through because it's pretty.

02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.640
Fat Cylon. I love that name.

02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:37.640
Fat Cylon replied Witcher 3.

02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:40.640
The trick was to not play anything else.

02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:42.640
I learned this the hard way by having breaks and coming back,

02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:45.640
only to have my ass handed to me by all and sundry.

02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:50.640
So it became my one and only and slowly but surely opened its hearts and legs to me.

02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:53.640
All this to make sure Ciri got her happy ending.

02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:56.640
Well, congratulations to you, Fat Cylon.

02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.640
RageNator says the original Super Mario Brothers.

02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:02.640
Got it as a separate game alongside my NES and Christmas of 87.

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:04.640
I got fairly far in it but could never beat it.

02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:07.640
I ultimately gave up on trying to beat it.

02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:10.640
Well, then you didn't really push through, did you?

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.640
You're a quitter.

02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:12.640
You're a quitter.

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:15.640
You know what? You need to go back and kick that game's ass.

02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.640
Winston H. says I love this game but would have to say Persona 3.

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:21.640
For the following reasons.

02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:24.640
Teammates leave after X battles due to fatigue.

02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:27.640
Elemental weaknesses work both ways so it can wipe your party out.

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:30.640
Maps randomly generate so finding checkpoints are difficult.

02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:32.640
No real quick way to level up.

02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:39.640
And ultimate boss with game facts and save state still requires many hours of preparation than I care to admit.

02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:41.640
Sometimes you will just do that grind.

02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:43.640
Just, again, to say you did it.

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:46.640
And Dark Tetsuya says La Mulana.

02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:48.640
Would you expect any different answer from Dark Tetsuya?

02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:49.640
I sure wouldn't.

02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:55.640
But no, seriously, the first time I made it through the game after 60 hours of exploration, tricky enemies and tough bosses,

02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.640
I can't think of any other game that has quite made me feel like that.

02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:05.640
And lastly, ActDeft over on Google Plus says Tetris Evolution on the Xbox 360.

02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:08.640
It's actually not a difficult game because it's Tetris.

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:13.640
But there's an achievement called Dirty South Style Back to Back.

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:15.640
I'm not going to look that up on Urban Dictionary.

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:18.640
It's the name of my sex tape.

02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:21.640
But it's an achievement on Tetris Evolution.

02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:24.640
It asks you to do three Tetrises in a row.

02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:27.640
It's not something you can do by skill alone.

02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:29.640
It also requires a lot of luck.

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:32.640
Yeah, to get three Tetrises in a row, you have to get three of those pieces.

02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:34.640
You also have to set it up.

02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:36.640
You have to set it up and just pray.

02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:38.640
That's the only way to do it.

02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:41.640
It made it all the more frustrating when you filled the screen

02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:45.640
and didn't get at least two long Tetrominos.

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:51.640
I spent weeks trying to get that achievement back in the day until I finally got it.

02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:53.640
That is a pain in the ass. Good for you.

02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:55.640
Good answers, all you guys.

02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:01.640
Anybody in the room care to give us a very difficult game that you just sucked it up and persevered?

02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:04.640
Mischief Makers on the 64.

02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:06.640
Oh, nice treasure game.

02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:11.640
Yeah, that game I borrowed from a friend because he was like,

02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:14.640
this game is terrible. It's crap. I don't want it here.

02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:17.640
So he actually just gave it to me now that I think about it.

02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:22.640
And so I just played it one day because it sat there for the longest and I didn't play it.

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:25.640
I put it in and I was like, this game is fun.

02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:30.640
Like shaking everything the whole time and then all of a sudden it was just like an addiction.

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:34.640
And I just got into that game and I hadn't played until I beat it.

02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:36.640
And it got difficult, definitely.

02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:42.640
But it was one of those games that it's so fun that you don't really care how hard it was.

02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:45.640
You kind of still went through it.

02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:46.640
Jamie?

02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:50.640
Level 37 Lavos fight.

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:56.640
Because I was determined to get the first of the special endings for Chrono Trigger.

02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:57.640
Good answer.

02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:58.640
And I freaking did it.

02:46:58.640 --> 02:46:59.640
You have to see every single ending?

02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:02.640
I think we've had 10 out of the 14 cartridge endings.

02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:07.640
Was it? No, 14 was the PlayStation one.

02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:10.640
The cartridge had 12.

02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:12.640
10 or 12. Yeah.

02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:14.640
We're like too short of all of them.

02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:20.640
Because Dan and I went through and did another few rounds of Chrono Trigger together to add on to what I already had.

02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:24.640
I would say for me, the original Mega Man.

02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:27.640
Just because I remember that game.

02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:29.640
I mean all of those games really are just about muscle memory.

02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:31.640
Like you just have to learn the patterns.

02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:33.640
You know when the enemies are going to come out.

02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:35.640
What weapons work on what boss.

02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:39.640
Like a lot of the great old NES games, it's all about muscle memory.

02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.640
And you just push through because, I don't know, it's Mega Man and Mega Man's Red.

02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:47.640
The music! I wanted to hear all the music in the game. That's why.

02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:50.640
Alright. Any other answers in studio?

02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:52.640
Alright. I was going to say VVVV.

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:56.640
Oh yeah. I still never finished it though.

02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:00.640
Because I got tired of playing the one level.

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:02.640
That game is hard.

02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:06.640
I'm trying to remember the actual name.

02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:08.640
It's like...

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:10.640
Let's see here. I'm just looking up the achievements right now.

02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:14.640
It was called...

02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:18.640
I guess it wasn't its own thing.

02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:24.640
It was the one that they had you where you had to flip through five different screens and then bounce back.

02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:26.640
And then get it and then bounce back again.

02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:28.640
It was a pain in the fucking ass.

02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:31.640
Yeah. No. That game is difficult.

02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:32.640
For sure.

02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:35.640
Alright. We're going to do just a few more stories here.

02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:37.640
Since we are after 9 o'clock, I think we'll do just one more round.

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.640
We don't have emails this week.

02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:43.640
But if you want to send emails to the show, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:45.640
if you want to participate in a future episode of the show.

02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:47.640
I think we'll do one more rotation here in the room.

02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:50.640
And then we'll probably dump the rest of those stories while we wait for some phone calls.

02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:52.640
So we'll do one more round here. So, Loki?

02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:55.640
Alright. Let's see.

02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:59.640
Well, let's just talk about there's a needle exploit that they have on the PlayStation 4.

02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:02.640
I guess they've already got it running Linux, which I guess makes sense.

02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:07.640
But you can possibly run Steam games on the PlayStation 4.

02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:09.640
How is that possible?

02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:12.640
Well, it involves installing Linux.

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:21.640
Basically, I guess, through a jailbreak, you install Arch Linux and then some software libraries.

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:26.640
And once you have that done, you can install Linux version of Steam.

02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:33.640
And, yeah, they've got at least running the Steam interface, showing some video of that.

02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:36.640
I'm not sure if they've run any games.

02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:41.640
Let's see the spoilery video here. See if they've pulled it up.

02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.640
Yeah, I don't know if they've run any games.

02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:49.640
Oh, actually, they are running...

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:51.640
Is that Bastion?

02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:53.640
They're running Bastion.

02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:56.640
Which is already available on the PlayStation 4.

02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:58.640
But, hey, hackers gonna hack.

02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:00.640
It's still pretty cool.

02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:07.640
However, you're not gonna be able to do it unless you've really kept an old version of the operating system.

02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.640
You need 1.76 to jailbreak it and install Linux.

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:14.640
And, of course, they're up to 3.5 or something now.

02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:17.640
So you have to find an old one on the shelf somewhere.

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:20.640
You have to find one that's never been updated.

02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.640
Alright, well, I don't know about you guys. I don't know if you guys like to gamble.

02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:29.640
But if you are a gambler, this news may excite you, especially if you're a video gamer and a gambler.

02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:32.640
Or it may really get you scared.

02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:43.640
Because, apparently, the governor of Nevada and the gambling commission of the state are considering allowing casino bookmakers to accept bets on professional gaming events.

02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:49.640
So just like you can bet on, what, horse racing and professional sports. You can bet on professional sports in Nevada, right?

02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:51.640
That's why Nevada doesn't have any professional teams.

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:54.640
You can bet on literally anything in Nevada.

02:50:54.640 --> 02:50:56.640
Can you bet on salty bets?

02:50:56.640 --> 02:50:58.640
Maybe.

02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:00.640
That's so meta.

02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:09.640
I don't really want to do that because, yeah, you don't normally win, but it's interesting.

02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:14.640
But get this, the casinos are looking into it because they want to keep sports books fresh.

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:19.640
I guess this is a way to hook a whole new generation on gambling.

02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:22.640
Very clever, but dangerous.

02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:39.640
I feel like the esports community, while I love watching the FGC events, like Street Fighter and Killer Instinct, I feel like for such a small and young sport, it's already gone through so much controversy.

02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:46.640
There's PED usage in esports that people are cracking down on. Sponsors like, what was it called?

02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:47.640
Pornhub.

02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:49.640
Yeah, that's the one. I have no idea what that is.

02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:51.640
Of course, of course.

02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:57.640
That has spawned controversy. So now this is just going to get worse. People are going to be throwing matches.

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.640
PED usage? What's that?

02:51:58.640 --> 02:52:00.640
Yeah, there's PED usage.

02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:01.640
Performance enhancing drugs.

02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:03.640
Oh, what Red Bull? Too much Red Bull?

02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:05.640
I read about that on the internet.

02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:07.640
They're pissing hot.

02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:14.640
Adderall, they say that it's a performance enhancer and they do testing for it now on the esports level.

02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:19.640
Isn't Adderall what they give like extreme ADD, ADHD type of stuff?

02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:21.640
They say it helps you focus.

02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:22.640
It does, actually.

02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:30.640
It does, but if the doctor prescribes it to you, you're not supposed to take it unless the doctor knows you're taking it.

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:34.640
Or unless the coach for the esports prescribes it to you.

02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:47.640
Well, if they're not medical school, then that's not a good thing. Anyway, apparently the committee who has set up this whole esports, or gambling on esports thing, they did get feedback from Fatality.

02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:51.640
Oh, well I'm glad they got him. Thank god he's involved.

02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:54.640
The voice.

02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:59.640
I'm glad he can speak for all of esports. At least they talked to somebody, whatever.

02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:07.640
I feel like gamer culture kind of takes things that are popular already and then just does them worse. Like celebrities, for example.

02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:09.640
Twitch celebrities are the worst.

02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:11.640
Really? Oh, those are fighting words.

02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:12.640
They are so bad.

02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:14.640
They can be very bad, yes.

02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:18.640
They get real life celebrities and interview them and stuff and they're amazing people.

02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:27.640
The scandal and just the general mentality of YouTube stars, typically, and Twitch streamers are just some of the worst people.

02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:34.640
I think it just has to be like, a lot of it has to do with, I think, their personality because of the audience that they're trying to attract.

02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:40.640
It's the age range is really immature, so a lot of times they're kind of personally very immature.

02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:51.640
Whereas there's some personalities like, I can think of John Bain, TotalBiscuit, who seem very mature and just kind of with it.

02:53:51.640 --> 02:53:59.640
Whereas there's just some that they like to do let's plays for Minecraft and Scream. So, I mean, it just depends.

02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:00.640
Do you guys go to TwitchCon?

02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:02.640
Yes, the two of us do.

02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:08.640
I feel like there's a story here because I went TwitchCon for a day even though I was like, I'm not really interested in going because I don't really do a lot with Twitch.

02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:14.640
But then my buddy Jason who does the voiceovers for the show was like, dude, I got an extra ticket. It's in San Francisco. Just come.

02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:20.640
And I was like, you know what? I do need to stop being such a stubborn old man. This is where things are trending. I need to kind of look into it.

02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:27.640
And it was actually kind of refreshing because they had all of these celebrities there. I didn't know who the fuck any of them were. Any of them were.

02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:28.640
Great feeling, wasn't it?

02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:36.640
I guess, but at the same time, you know, I didn't expect that any of them knew who I was because I knew I was the old podcasting dude. So, like, nobody's going to know who I am.

02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:41.640
The only one I think I've ever enjoyed was Lady Insanity because she does Bioware games.

02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:51.640
And I'm not to say that like all Twitch celebrities are bad. I'm not saying that at all. It was just kind of like, yeah, there are certainly some and then some are going to ruin it for the rest that do have the diva attitudes.

02:54:51.640 --> 02:55:03.640
Yeah. And so I think it's like reaching over to the same deal in esports. Like, I just don't understand it. You're nobody still. Keep your humbleness. You know, you're just famous on the internet.

02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:15.640
They've tried so much to like really make it like a thing. I remember like one time I got invited or it wasn't even, I don't know if I got invited or I had like an invite and there's no way I could go to it.

02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:26.640
It was like to the Playboy Mansion for they were doing a draft for like some sort of esports team or so. I know how the fuck I got the invite, but I couldn't go and I was extremely disappointed by that.

02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.640
Why could this? There's no, you couldn't go. It's the Playboy Mansion.

02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:32.640
I think it was the trap, brother.

02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:34.640
Being married with children, though, unfortunately, there is no way.

02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:35.640
You take the family, then.

02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:42.640
It was literally like the day before it was going to happen. It's like, okay, I can't do this. You know, arrange work.

02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:47.640
I take the whole family. We pack up and we show on Hef's door right there.

02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:58.640
I'm going to take you way back to the show that preceded OLR that I was on. Way back in the day, 2001, I was co-hosting a show called Understadation Live with my buddy Travis Donovan, who has now since retired.

02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:09.640
And one day on a whim, we called the Bunny Ranch. We got Dennis Hoff on the line interviewing with us for a good 45 minutes because nobody knew what the fuck internet radio was.

02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:19.640
Just like, this is the big fucking thing right now, right? He fucking invites us to the Bunny Ranch to hang just at some celebrity thing, right? We didn't go.

02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:20.640
What the hell?

02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:21.640
Opportunities.

02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:32.640
And I swear to God, I don't really have regrets because I was like, there was a part of me that was like, well, first off, I'm gay, so there's probably not a lot for me at the Bunny Ranch. Let's be real.

02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:34.640
There's tits, come on.

02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:36.640
I still love boobies. Who doesn't love boobies?

02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:43.640
But, and I'm sure Dennis would have found something for me, but that's kind of past the point.

02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.640
You serve food there, how are there cheese sticks? Because that's really what I meant.

02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:54.640
That's right. How's the food? How's the food? I just, there's that little voice in the back of my head going, you're walking into a situation you don't really want to be in, Rob.

02:56:54.640 --> 02:57:04.640
That one, you dive head on and then you tell people, you tell us now, the 15 years later or whatever, you tell us now.

02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:08.640
Tell my grandkids, my gay ass went to the Bunny Ranch.

02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:10.640
Was that one of those telltale situations?

02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:13.640
A and go this way or B and go this way.

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:17.640
Yeah, Dennis will remember that. That was the last time we ever spoke to him.

02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:29.640
Anyway, let's see. Where were we? Oh, yes. More stories. Dark soccer, I care to follow up the Bunny Ranch story.

02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:34.640
Good lord. I started watching a Yo-kai Watch games anyway.

02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:36.640
Were you there during that episode when that happened?

02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:37.640
What?

02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:38.640
That was a long, because you used to guess.

02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:40.640
Yes, I was, actually.

02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:41.640
I used to guess on Education Live all the time.

02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:44.640
Was it, I was either a guest or filling in for Jessica?

02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:46.640
I feel like Jess was there.

02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:48.640
I was sitting in the stereo chair.

02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:49.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:50.640
That was it.

02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:51.640
Anyway.

02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:54.640
So yeah, because I think I've been like a guest on that show like more than anyone.

02:57:54.640 --> 02:58:05.640
So anyway, we had brought this up a few episodes ago about concerns about Miitomo, about what happens with all those weird questions they ask you.

02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:08.640
Who in here other than me is still playing Miitomo?

02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:10.640
Every day they go to the NSA.

02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:15.640
Every day. I missed one day. The day I went to Great America this week was the first Miitomo day I've missed.

02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:17.640
That was the thousand coin day.

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:25.640
You get it the next day.

02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:29.640
You're never going to get your Miitomo Sojourner that way.

02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:36.640
Well, Nintendo released a statement and I'm just going to read it because they sum it up pretty nicely.

02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:44.640
The goal of our Miitomo questions is to spark fun conversations with your friends and for you to discover new facts about them as they answer the questions being posed.

02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:48.640
In your dreams, how many blooming flowers do you see? What the fuck question was that?

02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:50.640
That's how many people do you want to fuck?

02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:51.640
Yeah, which is, it's code for...

02:58:51.640 --> 02:58:53.640
Let me finish reading it.

02:58:56.640 --> 02:59:00.640
That's why Miitomo generally avoids yes or no questions.

02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:12.640
As to the answer information our customers provide through the Miitomo app, it is only used to provide a better experience for Nintendo consumers and to support the application.

02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:17.640
Neither Nintendo or any of its partners sells or shares that answer information for any other purposes.

02:59:17.640 --> 02:59:20.640
However, Nintendo knows.

02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:25.640
Now, one of my friends on the app just said fuck it to their questions and started asking his own.

02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:29.640
I'm taking over.

02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:31.640
He numbers them so you know which one's which.

02:59:31.640 --> 02:59:36.640
Yeah, because you have the little chat threads and I didn't really realize that until you pointed it out.

02:59:36.640 --> 02:59:38.640
They're like, no, we have conversations on Miitomo, Rob.

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:44.640
I'm like, oh yeah, I guess because you can leave comments and the comments will usually go completely off track.

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:48.640
Yet you get alerted whenever somebody posts a new comment.

02:59:48.640 --> 02:59:51.640
It's basically LiveJournal for the modern era.

02:59:51.640 --> 03:00:01.640
This same friend, by the way, is an excellent maker of Miitomo photos that involve spread legs, open mouth kisses and buttholes.

03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:04.640
Three of my favorite things.

03:00:04.640 --> 03:00:06.640
On the next episode of OLR.

03:00:06.640 --> 03:00:09.640
He's actually pretty cool, but he's also hilarious.

03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:15.640
My coworker is trying to get me to play Miitomo because she doesn't have any friends that play that.

03:00:15.640 --> 03:00:18.640
And so she's like, well, the only way you can play it is if you have friends.

03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:22.640
I'm like, I'll add your sad friend if you want.

03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:26.640
No, no, no. You add the friend and then they make friends with all your friends and then they talk shit about you.

03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:29.640
If they're not following me on Twitter or Facebook, I don't add them.

03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:31.640
I've added a few people.

03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:33.640
Am I being a Twitch celeb?

03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:34.640
Yep.

03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:35.640
Let's go.

03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:36.640
I've added a few people.

03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:37.640
What's that?

03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:38.640
I've added a few people.

03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:40.640
Just a bunch of actually random people.

03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:43.640
Some have gone like, oh, this is so-and-so.

03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:44.640
Oh, OK.

03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:45.640
But yeah.

03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:52.640
I figured if they're friends of my friends, they have to be OK because I don't hang out with shitty people.

03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:56.640
And if they turn out to be, you know, shit stains, they get wiped.

03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:59.640
I'm easy.

03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:00.640
That's what bleach is for.

03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:03.640
I will end you.

03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:07.640
I won't just cut you. I will dismember you.

03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:09.640
Wow, the wonderful world of Miitomo.

03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:13.640
I want to know from this comment because, you know, we're talking about LiveJournal and throwback and all that.

03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:16.640
I want to know when the first Miitomo hookup is going to happen.

03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:18.640
If it hasn't already, it probably has, right?

03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:21.640
Like we met in Miitomo and then day one, I'm sure.

03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:26.640
Tonight on Channel 10 News.

03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:27.640
Did you guys get in Miitomo?

03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:28.640
Would you check it out at all?

03:01:28.640 --> 03:01:29.640
I have not.

03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:32.640
I literally just looked it up right now to see what's all.

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:33.640
And you're the phone guy, too.

03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:35.640
It's like five million.

03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:37.640
Five million downloads right now for it.

03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:42.640
Eleven year old Stacy was drawn across state lines.

03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:46.640
So you've got Miitomo?

03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:52.640
Someone in here who I'm not already friends with needs to have Miitomo so I can get the face to face challenge met.

03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:55.640
I downloaded it for, I think I had it for a week.

03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:57.640
I played it the first day.

03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:04.640
I bought like new clothes and then I go, I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with this app.

03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:06.640
And then so I just kind of left it and then I needed space on my phone.

03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:08.640
So I deleted it.

03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:10.640
I don't understand it.

03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:11.640
I don't know.

03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:16.640
It's like for me, I get more useful information on my friends out of Miitomo than I do on Facebook.

03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:19.640
Because Facebook is just like, here's this clickbait article.

03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:24.640
Here's this picture of my friends and I at something you weren't invited to.

03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:26.640
Like all this stuff.

03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:30.640
And then Twitter is just like, random, random, random again.

03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:32.640
Twitter is like, hi everybody.

03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:33.640
I'm on this place.

03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:34.640
Look, this bathroom looks shitty.

03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:37.640
P.S. I want X person to adopt me and be cool.

03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:42.640
Thank you Facebook app for telling me every single time there's a new view on Orange Lounge page.

03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:44.640
Like, I don't need to know this.

03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:50.640
And the things, I do love Twitter, but the things people post are like, you guys have to try the new burger at Red Robin.

03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:52.640
Or, hi, I'm pooping.

03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:55.640
Like, you know, it's just people write, you know, sometimes like weirdly weird stuff.

03:02:55.640 --> 03:02:58.640
I am pooping after trying the brand new burger at Red Robin.

03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:00.640
I tweeted that once, okay guys?

03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:02.640
It was once.

03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:05.640
Alright.

03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:07.640
Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.

03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:09.640
I'm not going to keep it open very long though, you guys.

03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.640
So if you want to get in, you should probably do that now.

03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:15.640
If you have a question for us, or possibly for our friends from Video Game Bang, you can do that.

03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:16.640
Call us now.

03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:18.640
1-877-GAME-OLR.

03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:20.640
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:21.640
All one word.

03:03:21.640 --> 03:03:26.640
If you want to give us a call, Skype line is open right now for you to call in.

03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:28.640
So, let's get to it.

03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:30.640
We've got calls already coming in.

03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:32.640
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:34.640
Hey, this is RagingNator.

03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:36.640
Hey, RagingNator. How's it going, buddy?

03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:38.640
Oh, pretty good.

03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:42.640
I'll try to make this short and sweet just in case someone else wants to call in.

03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:44.640
Yeah, we're pretty popular.

03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:56.640
Yeah, I don't know if you heard the story, but apparently there's been a leak regarding an upcoming steam sale.

03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:05.640
Supposedly, the next major steam sale is going to be the final week of June leading up until July 4th.

03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:07.640
Don't they do like a big summer?

03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:08.640
Yeah, it's usually around then.

03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:12.640
Yeah, I feel like, cue the whole Gaben.tv, the whole,

03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:14.640
How do you believe in miracles?

03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.640
The whole thing, because there's going to be a steam sale. It's going to come raining down and everything you've been wanting will be on sale.

03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:20.640
They've correlated it with E3 the past couple of years.

03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:24.640
I feel like every time an E3 and then Humble also usually comes out with something really cool.

03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:28.640
Yeah, because steam's got a lot more competitors these days, I feel like.

03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:32.640
Everything I see on sale, it's just all in your library, in your library, in your library.

03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:35.640
I don't remember purchasing that, but it's in my library. Okay, cool.

03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:40.640
Yeah, I guess that wouldn't really surprise me. I'll be curious about two things.

03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:43.640
Do they put any of the new stuff on sale? That's the first one.

03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:48.640
Are they going to knock 10%, 25% off Doom or something? That's always the big question.

03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:54.640
And then, is there going to be a mini game? Because sometimes steam does these meta games for the sales that are really fun.

03:04:54.640 --> 03:05:02.640
That last one was ridiculous. They did their own version of Cookie Clicker or whatever that just went fucking nuts.

03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:15.640
One thing that I noticed in previous sales though is that the particularly old, old games that are on steam.

03:05:15.640 --> 03:05:22.640
Let's say, just to pick something off the top of my head, Everyday Shooter.

03:05:22.640 --> 03:05:33.640
It's not very likely to be marked down. Now, you're kind of hoping that something like that would be marked down.

03:05:33.640 --> 03:05:37.640
It probably seems to say it's not going to happen.

03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:44.640
Yeah, if there's something on your wish list you very badly want to go on sale, that is going to guarantee that it will not go on sale.

03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:59.640
But on the semi relay though, is there like a top three games that you definitely want to go on sale in?

03:05:59.640 --> 03:06:04.640
If they do go on sale, you're going to jump on those like Hungry Dog jumping on steak.

03:06:04.640 --> 03:06:15.640
Well, I do keep a steam wish list going on and steam is very kind enough to email me every other day when a game on my wish list is on sale for 10% off or 20% off.

03:06:15.640 --> 03:06:21.640
So, I'm pretty sure that will come into play. I still haven't picked up Final Fantasy 9, that little remake, so I think I want to pick that up.

03:06:21.640 --> 03:06:27.640
I ended up buying Doom, that was on my wish list, but I was just like after I heard all the positive feedback on it.

03:06:27.640 --> 03:06:29.640
It was like 15% off on some of the websites right now.

03:06:29.640 --> 03:06:38.640
God, don't fucking tell me that. Let's see, I'm trying to think of what else is on my wish list that I want. I don't know, there's some other stuff too, Raginator.

03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:41.640
You should play Danganronpa.

03:06:41.640 --> 03:06:46.640
Okay, I'll just put that in the queue with the 500 other games I have to catch up on.

03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:51.640
What about you? What's your number one thing you want to see go on sale, on sale, on sale, Raginator?

03:06:52.640 --> 03:07:00.640
Kind of hard to say, and honestly I should slow down on my game purchases, because my God, do I already have a backlog.

03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:04.640
Sell that stuff in your closet that the cat keeps getting into.

03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:18.640
Yeah, seriously though, I kind of want to get some of the Final Fantasy games that I'm still missing, like I'm missing 9.

03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:20.640
Square Enix has taken over.

03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:23.640
Yeah, 4, 5, and 6.

03:07:23.640 --> 03:07:32.640
I will say this, I did think of a new answer. The game that I would most like to see go on sale during the summer sale would be Half-Life 3.

03:07:32.640 --> 03:07:36.640
Yeah, that's probably not going to happen.

03:07:36.640 --> 03:07:42.640
Raginator, you're ruining my dreams. You're ruining my dreams, buddy. Alright, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls. Take care, my friend.

03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:44.640
Alright, you too. Bye.

03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:47.640
1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, orange lounge for you.

03:07:48.640 --> 03:07:52.640
They need to put Darius Burst on sale soon, because I want that game.

03:07:52.640 --> 03:08:00.640
Do you guys have disgusting Steam backlogs like the rest of us, or do you really stick to console? Because I know you give Aaron a hard time about being a PC guy.

03:08:00.640 --> 03:08:03.640
No, I play PC mostly. These guys are the console dudes.

03:08:03.640 --> 03:08:05.640
Oh, did I get it switched around? I'm sorry.

03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:09.640
Yeah, no, I give him crap because he always comes back to Papa.

03:08:09.640 --> 03:08:12.640
I go everywhere. I'm a gaming whore.

03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:16.640
Alright, we got another call coming in. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:18.640
What's up, everybody? It's Ranma.

03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:24.640
Hey, Ranma. Your connection's a little fuzzy tonight, but we'll try to push through it. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:29.640
Sorry about that. My headset is kind of like when it's last stages of dying, so it's got to be replaced soon.

03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:33.640
Well, stay in whatever position you're in and don't move because it's working fine. What's up?

03:08:33.640 --> 03:08:40.640
Well, I slightly adjusted the mic, so a couple of things, then I'll be on my merry little way. So, Rob, I have a question for you.

03:08:40.640 --> 03:08:42.640
Well, I have an answer for you, I hope.

03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:50.640
The guests that are on your show, Video Game Bang, you said earlier that they were inspired by your show O.L.R.

03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:52.640
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:54.640
Wait a minute, what?

03:08:54.640 --> 03:08:58.640
I don't want to sound like a Twitch celeb. I didn't quite say that.

03:08:58.640 --> 03:09:06.640
I think what I said was that Aaron was listening to the all-game shows, and all of those shows kind of inspired in part,

03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:10.640
but I really think All Games Interactive was probably the big one that really, you know...

03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:11.640
Forefront, yeah.

03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:15.640
No, so I'm not, like, my head isn't that big, Rama. Knock it off.

03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:23.640
Okay, because I wanted to know, because if that was the case, O.L.R. has another sibling, and since I am the half-sibling,

03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:30.640
we talk about something different, we might have to call Maury and find out who the parents are, figure out why this podcast isn't doing video games.

03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:34.640
Cue Aaron's happy dance, you know, when they find out he's not the father.

03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:40.640
Am I correct that you just called O.L.R. to demand that Video Game Bang take a paternity test?

03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:42.640
Wow.

03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:43.640
Wow.

03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:47.640
But I have been taking notes, so I do have a couple other things I do want to talk about.

03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:48.640
Okay, all right, go for it.

03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:50.640
You don't even look like me.

03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:54.640
Well, Rama, I do agree with you about Miitomo, so I'm there with you on that.

03:09:54.640 --> 03:09:58.640
If I don't know who they are, I do not add them. I don't have time for it.

03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:00.640
Thank you! Am I just being a diva?

03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:01.640
No.

03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:04.640
I only accept people in my life that I clearly inspire.

03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:08.640
If I can't speak, what's your Facebook connection, who you are?

03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:18.640
No, simple as that. I've actually had to say no to some people, and I've had some people actually ask me if I've actually accepted their friend request,

03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:25.640
or I got them just like, um, let me get back to you on that, you know, so, yeah.

03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:31.640
The worst is when I know I've sent somebody a friend request, and I see them posting pictures on Twitter from Miitomo,

03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:36.640
and I'm like, I know you're checking that fucking app, and you still haven't accepted my friend request. What did I do to you?

03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:37.640
Jason.

03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:40.640
Oh, shit, naming names.

03:10:40.640 --> 03:10:41.640
Shot fired.

03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:48.640
I wasn't thinking about Jason, but I think he'd added me, but you have to remember to check that.

03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:54.640
So just a friendly reminder, be sure to check your friend requests on your Miitomo app, especially if your name is DJ.

03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:03.640
Um, by the way, darktosuyu in chat says, I thought the pod father was Travis Donovan, since Undersedation Live inspired our show.

03:11:03.640 --> 03:11:09.640
Travis Donovan would actually be retired grandfather at this point. He has gone off to the home.

03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:21.640
Rob, that makes you the new Don, okay, because you are the made man, and you've learned everything from him, so you are currently at the helm, pod father.

03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:27.640
I'll be appearing at TwitchCon 2016 in San Diego, but do not look directly at me.

03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:35.640
It is pretty safe to say, like, we all were very aware of Orange Land Radio. Aaron was an avid listener.

03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:42.640
When we started getting into it, I of course started researching, like, who's in the area doing this? What do they do? How could we learn from them?

03:11:42.640 --> 03:11:46.640
You know, what's the do's and don'ts? You know, what makes a successful show?

03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:48.640
Did you find some don'ts?

03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:52.640
Uh, nothing specific from Orange Land Radio. No way. No, okay.

03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:54.640
I was going to say, I can name some names, just don'ts.

03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:56.640
Oh, there's some podcasts out there?

03:11:56.640 --> 03:11:59.640
We like to support all indie podcasts, so we won't go there.

03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:02.640
This was back 15 years ago. I don't even think they're around anymore.

03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:03.640
Well, that's why.

03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:05.640
Except you game and talk, Joey Ferris.

03:12:05.640 --> 03:12:07.640
Wow, he's a regular on the show.

03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:08.640
We love him.

03:12:08.640 --> 03:12:10.640
His show is good, too.

03:12:10.640 --> 03:12:17.640
But no, no, no. There were some podcasts in my experimental days that really I would listen to.

03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:20.640
And like I said when I first got here, they were like 30 minutes long.

03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:27.640
And, like, they would kind of quickly shoot past every single little detail, bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, and then bye.

03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:28.640
And that was it.

03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:32.640
And they just had no room for, I don't know, casual banter sometimes.

03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:34.640
And, you know, it didn't feel, it just felt like a spreadsheet.

03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:39.640
I do agree that, you know, if you're going to do a video game podcast, don't just read the news to people.

03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:43.640
Because people that have seeked out a video game podcast are already reading the news kind of thing.

03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:48.640
Although, I do think there is a niche that a couple people feel very well at.

03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:54.640
If you do want to be the, you know, CNN and that journalistic side of it, then I think there is a little room there.

03:12:54.640 --> 03:12:55.640
You know what I mean?

03:12:55.640 --> 03:13:01.640
But, yeah, you're right. For the most part, like, people that download gaming podcasts already kind of know what's going on in the gaming industry.

03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:06.640
True. And, like, for us, one of the big moments, I was a fan of gamertag radio.

03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:09.640
That's the one I listened to and actually became a fan of.

03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:14.640
So, I met them at an E3, exchanged information, and had Danny Pena on our show.

03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:16.640
He was on our show a long time ago.

03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:22.640
We did a holiday special one year where we got, like, we just invited a ton of, like, indie broadcasters on the show and he was there.

03:13:22.640 --> 03:13:26.640
But I met him at, like, Penny Art. One of those shows I met him at. He's a good guy.

03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:27.640
Super solid dude.

03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:35.640
And, actually, we didn't even plan it, but the day he was on our show, maybe he did because he's smart, but it was International Podcast Day.

03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:36.640
Oh, get out.

03:13:36.640 --> 03:13:39.640
Yeah, so we had him on our show on International Podcast Day.

03:13:39.640 --> 03:13:41.640
We got to just nerd out about podcasting.

03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:47.640
He told us about the good old days, you know, of recording on Xbox and his first time recording, like, in a pickup truck.

03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:52.640
Yeah, and his jeep in the middle of the snow with his brother, like, on a laptop he recorded, he said.

03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:57.640
Like, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, the rough times.

03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:00.640
Oh, yeah, we did all that, too.

03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:13.640
Yeah, and everybody scratches a different itch. Like, for us, we do kind of cater to more of a urban, you know, we have a lot of pop culture references, you know, like, on our show.

03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:15.640
Urban? Is that what you're going with?

03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:16.640
I'm trying to be PC here.

03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:17.640
Wow, okay.

03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:20.640
I mean, people on our show come from so many different backgrounds, though.

03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:21.640
Yes, yes.

03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:23.640
We have, you know.

03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:27.640
We have a rainbow of characters that definitely come on the show.

03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:28.640
And so do we.

03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:29.640
Religions.

03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:35.640
Yeah, we don't exclude anybody, definitely, and try to include everybody.

03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:36.640
I agree.

03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:37.640
Except terrorists.

03:14:37.640 --> 03:14:38.640
Wow.

03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:41.640
So, no, yeah, we have terrorists on the show as well.

03:14:41.640 --> 03:14:43.640
I mean, they have a point, right?

03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:44.640
Great.

03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:46.640
Hey, Rama, you're still there, right?

03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:48.640
Yes, two more things, I'm getting out of here.

03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:50.640
Oh, sorry. I thought you were there.

03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:52.640
I think they forgot a collar was on the line.

03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:55.640
The last guy had video, Rama, you're gonna have to get that back.

03:14:55.640 --> 03:14:58.640
All right, anyway, sorry, go ahead, what was your other thought?

03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:03.640
I wanna tip my hat to Jamie about her PSO talk tonight,

03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:06.640
because I remember our good old days of playing Blue Burst.

03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:07.640
Yes.

03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:08.640
It was a very good pick.

03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:11.640
I think everybody can agree that was a solid pick.

03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:12.640
Very good.

03:15:12.640 --> 03:15:14.640
We'll have to revive that.

03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:15.640
I'm down.

03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:17.640
We'll have Blue Burst night.

03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:19.640
We'll burst something blue.

03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:22.640
I'll get a case of Blue Moon.

03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:27.640
Blue Moon and Blue Burst, that's so much fun.

03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:29.640
There's better beer, I wouldn't do that to you.

03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:34.640
I'll tell you this, anything is better than Budweiser.

03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:35.640
True.

03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:39.640
Aren't they renaming to, like, America, or was that just a fucking Facebook prank?

03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:44.640
They're renaming to America as a little homage to what's going on, and then there's another-

03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:51.640
I won't drink it, I won't drink it, unless the very bottom or, like, under the thing says fuck yeah.

03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:53.640
I'll put it this way, I wouldn't drink it if it were free.

03:15:56.640 --> 03:15:58.640
Because I have something called self-respect.

03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:03.640
You can't get in trouble for drinking in public, because are they gonna arrest you for drinking America?

03:16:03.640 --> 03:16:05.640
You drunk off America?

03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:08.640
What, you a terrorist for arresting me?

03:16:09.640 --> 03:16:17.640
And you know what? I have been so good that I'm gonna entertain myself with a Guinness tonight.

03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:19.640
And y'all can't have any.

03:16:20.640 --> 03:16:21.640
Because that's my shit.

03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:27.640
Actually, believe it or not, I still have some of the buffalo sweat that, um, that Code Man sent us.

03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:28.640
Sent me, really.

03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:30.640
I just love some of these comments in chat.

03:16:30.640 --> 03:16:32.640
Act deft, I'm drinking freedom.

03:16:32.640 --> 03:16:35.640
Uh, Scoppy says, uh, DWA, driving with America.

03:16:36.640 --> 03:16:37.640
Alright, anyway.

03:16:37.640 --> 03:16:38.640
Uh, alright.

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:42.640
There is an indie brew called Morica that's out.

03:16:42.640 --> 03:16:43.640
Fuck yeah.

03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:44.640
Uh, anything else, Rama?

03:16:45.640 --> 03:16:46.640
Um, the Tetris movie.

03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:53.640
It should be based off of the YouTube video, The Complete History of the Soviet Union, as a range to the melody of Tetris.

03:16:54.640 --> 03:16:58.640
I will be upset if the theme from Tetris, which I realize is like a classic song-

03:16:58.640 --> 03:16:59.640
Isn't that an excerpt from Troika?

03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:00.640
Yeah, it is.

03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:01.640
It is.

03:17:01.640 --> 03:17:03.640
But it's the- I'm sorry, it's the Tetris theme.

03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:08.640
It's one of those things where, like, they've just taken over the song and now it's theirs.

03:17:08.640 --> 03:17:10.640
It's like when Johnny Cash covered Hurt.

03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:13.640
Like, I love Nine Inch Nails, but, like, now that's Johnny Cash's song.

03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:14.640
Like, sorry, it's just- it's done.

03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:17.640
So, that is the Tetris song.

03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:21.640
And if that song is not in the movie, we're not- I'm not- I can't handle it.

03:17:22.640 --> 03:17:23.640
Heads will roll.

03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:24.640
Alright.

03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:25.640
That's right.

03:17:25.640 --> 03:17:27.640
Alright, take care of my friend, we're gonna let you go.

03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:28.640
Alright, take care.

03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:29.640
Alright, bye.

03:17:29.640 --> 03:17:30.640
Alright.

03:17:30.640 --> 03:17:31.640
Alright.

03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:34.640
I am so sorry, guys, we are gonna close up the Skype line because we are- we're starting

03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:39.640
to run a little bit long and we gotta wrap things up here in studio because it's about

03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:42.640
9.30 and, you know, it's about time for the show to be done.

03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:46.640
So, I wanna go around and get everybody's final thought here before we say goodnight.

03:17:46.640 --> 03:17:51.640
I do wanna say, though, first off, a big thank you to the crew from Video Game Bank for being

03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:52.640
here tonight.

03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:53.640
We had a really good time tonight.

03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:54.640
This was a lot of fun.

03:17:54.640 --> 03:17:55.640
Lots of fun.

03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:56.640
I thought 6 was gonna be a lot of people, but we made it work.

03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:57.640
This is good.

03:17:57.640 --> 03:18:00.640
And I do wanna say, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, first off,

03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:02.640
support indie podcasting.

03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:06.640
Just, you know, download our show, download Video Game Bank, download other shows at VOG

03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:10.640
Network, download other shows at Nerd Reactor, download- just download indie stuff and support

03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:13.640
indie stuff because God knows we need it.

03:18:13.640 --> 03:18:16.640
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two

03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:17.640
about the show.

03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:18.640
Help spread the word.

03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:21.640
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't air those voices if they're not

03:18:21.640 --> 03:18:24.640
here to use them, so please spread the word.

03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:25.640
Spread the word.

03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:29.640
A nice 5 star review wherever you found this show, such as iTunes or Google Podcasts or

03:18:29.640 --> 03:18:30.640
what have you.

03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:33.640
Those go a long way and are appreciated as well.

03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:36.640
Video Game Bank, thanks so much for being here tonight.

03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:38.640
We'll do this again sometime if you guys are down.

03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:40.640
I know it's long, but we'll do this again sometime.

03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:41.640
So, yeah.

03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:45.640
I'm looking forward to coming on your show on Wednesday, so we'll have to- what are we

03:18:45.640 --> 03:18:47.640
gonna talk about Wednesday?

03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:49.640
You can expect a mixed bag.

03:18:49.640 --> 03:18:51.640
A lot's gonna happen between now and Wednesday.

03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:52.640
That's true.

03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:54.640
In this beast that we call video game.

03:18:54.640 --> 03:18:55.640
Yeah.

03:18:55.640 --> 03:18:57.640
But lots of laughs.

03:18:57.640 --> 03:18:58.640
We can guarantee the laughs.

03:18:58.640 --> 03:19:00.640
Alright, I'll try my best to be funny.

03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:01.640
Alright.

03:19:01.640 --> 03:19:03.640
I'm gonna go down the line.

03:19:03.640 --> 03:19:05.640
Aaron, thank you so much for being here.

03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:06.640
Appreciate it.

03:19:06.640 --> 03:19:08.640
And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:09.640
Any party words?

03:19:09.640 --> 03:19:12.640
Vote with your dollars when it comes to video games.

03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:13.640
You know?

03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:15.640
They won't make crappy games if you don't buy them.

03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:16.640
That is solid advice.

03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:18.640
You gotta vote with your wallet.

03:19:18.640 --> 03:19:19.640
Very true.

03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:20.640
Corey.

03:19:20.640 --> 03:19:21.640
It's just been great being here.

03:19:21.640 --> 03:19:25.640
This is like a 15 plus year institution of podcasting, right?

03:19:25.640 --> 03:19:26.640
Not quite that old.

03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:29.640
Don't over age us.

03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:36.640
But actually, funny enough, next month, June 26th, happens to be my birthday and OLR's

03:19:36.640 --> 03:19:37.640
14th anniversary show.

03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:38.640
Geez.

03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:39.640
14 years of podcasting.

03:19:39.640 --> 03:19:41.640
That's podcasting before podcasting.

03:19:41.640 --> 03:19:44.640
Yeah, technically it wasn't a podcast when it started.

03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:48.640
We were just on Live 365 doing a live show, but we've carried that into podcasting.

03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:54.640
It's been an honor to be here and I'm so glad we met at that convention because it's

03:19:54.640 --> 03:19:56.640
like we gotta work together.

03:19:56.640 --> 03:19:57.640
So thanks for having us.

03:19:57.640 --> 03:19:59.640
Thanks to Sac IGDA for bringing us all together.

03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:02.640
Yeah, those dudes were super awesome in putting that together.

03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:04.640
So yeah, it's been an honor.

03:20:04.640 --> 03:20:05.640
Thanks for having us.

03:20:05.640 --> 03:20:06.640
Thank you.

03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:07.640
It's been an honor to have you.

03:20:07.640 --> 03:20:08.640
Webb.

03:20:08.640 --> 03:20:09.640
Yeah, it's been awesome being here.

03:20:09.640 --> 03:20:13.640
You guys have a really cool show and it's cool being able to hear from the audience

03:20:13.640 --> 03:20:15.640
and yeah, it was a lot of fun.

03:20:15.640 --> 03:20:16.640
It's very cool.

03:20:16.640 --> 03:20:17.640
Thank you very much.

03:20:17.640 --> 03:20:18.640
Thank you guys all so much for being here.

03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:19.640
Check them all out.

03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:22.640
Google, iTunes, just video game.

03:20:22.640 --> 03:20:23.640
Bang.

03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:24.640
How can you forget that name?

03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:25.640
Jesus.

03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:27.640
Just go out, Google it and follow them on everything.

03:20:27.640 --> 03:20:31.640
All right, let's go around and get the final thoughts here in studio.

03:20:31.640 --> 03:20:32.640
I'll do my final thought.

03:20:32.640 --> 03:20:37.640
My final thought is I'm going to try to forgive Ingress, but it may take me a little.

03:20:37.640 --> 03:20:39.640
Jamie, you gotta help me find the love again.

03:20:39.640 --> 03:20:40.640
Just help me level.

03:20:40.640 --> 03:20:41.640
All right, we'll see.

03:20:41.640 --> 03:20:42.640
We'll see.

03:20:42.640 --> 03:20:43.640
Maybe.

03:20:43.640 --> 03:20:44.640
I will give you the love.

03:20:44.640 --> 03:20:49.640
I'm only going to continue to be on them because I really want that Pokemon Go invite.

03:20:49.640 --> 03:20:51.640
I really want the beta invite.

03:20:51.640 --> 03:20:53.640
I put in for it.

03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:56.640
I'm going to cry if I don't get in.

03:20:56.640 --> 03:21:00.640
What will be the absolute worst, this is my nightmare, if Shane gets in and I don't.

03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:04.640
I will be so, like don't call me if that happens.

03:21:04.640 --> 03:21:06.640
You know what would be awful though?

03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:11.640
Given his absolute love of all things Pokemon, if you got in and I got in.

03:21:11.640 --> 03:21:13.640
I would love that.

03:21:13.640 --> 03:21:14.640
He did not get in.

03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:19.640
Or better yet, if I got in, I just don't give a crap about Pokemon Go.

03:21:19.640 --> 03:21:21.640
Yeah, that would be the worst if Loki got in.

03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:22.640
Like, Loki, tell us about the game.

03:21:22.640 --> 03:21:25.640
I don't know.

03:21:25.640 --> 03:21:27.640
Spot on impression.

03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:29.640
It's like your guys' impression of me.

03:21:29.640 --> 03:21:32.640
Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:37.640
Well, since we didn't have last minute stories, I thought I'd just leave everybody with this nice little story to piss you off.

03:21:37.640 --> 03:21:42.640
So, thank you Nintendo for pulling another Nintendo.

03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:44.640
They decided that, hey, guess what?

03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:47.640
You know that really awesome Minecraft thing that we put out?

03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:49.640
That has all the Mario levels in it?

03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:57.640
Guess what? Even though Minecraft videos are really awesome and Mojang and 4J studios are totally allowing you to put it on there.

03:21:57.640 --> 03:22:00.640
We're going to copyright claim all that shit because it has our fucking music in it.

03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:02.640
And we're assholes, by the way.

03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:05.640
So disable the music if you're going to do it.

03:22:05.640 --> 03:22:10.640
Apparently, yeah, they're being copyright claimed because you got to be that Nintendo partner in order to post those Nintendo videos.

03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:13.640
God, is that really a thing? I thought it was a joke.

03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:20.640
And we're hearing, basically they tweeted out, we're hearing reports copyright strikes on Super Mario mashup videos.

03:22:20.640 --> 03:22:24.640
We're sure this wouldn't happen. We're following up with Nintendo.

03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:26.640
Thank you, Nintendo.

03:22:26.640 --> 03:22:27.640
Thank you, YouTube.

03:22:27.640 --> 03:22:30.640
Coming soon to Amazon Prime Minecraft videos.

03:22:30.640 --> 03:22:35.640
Lastly, but not leastly, ladies last night, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

03:22:36.640 --> 03:22:44.640
I'm a little bit too obsessed right now with making my face look not like my face.

03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:48.640
But you have a very pretty face, but you also do very pretty makeup work.

03:22:48.640 --> 03:22:49.640
Thank you.

03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:50.640
It's art.

03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:55.640
It's all practice, practice, practice, because you know it's coming in the beginning of October.

03:22:55.640 --> 03:23:00.640
I just, I literally can't believe like you are, you are, you are having your life changed by drag queens.

03:23:00.640 --> 03:23:04.640
Well, you know my love of cosplay.

03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:11.640
And you know I've been wanting to change up what I do because it's gotten stale and everyone does the same shit that I've never seen.

03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:14.640
I've seen drag queens do character perfect cosplay.

03:23:14.640 --> 03:23:19.640
I have seen normal cosplayers do regular cosplay.

03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:23.640
I have not yet seen drag cosplay and I'm going to make that happen.

03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:29.640
All right. Well, but about the face, Dark Soccer, remember, remember what, what, what is said every week.

03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:32.640
If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love anybody else?

03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:36.640
I already love myself and enough to love everybody else and myself some more.

03:23:36.640 --> 03:23:37.640
All right.

03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:41.640
We love all of you out there in OLR and VOG Network.

03:23:41.640 --> 03:23:42.640
Thank you so much for listening.

03:23:42.640 --> 03:23:46.640
We will be back in seven days to do it all again during Memorial Day weekend.

03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:48.640
Oh boy, a Memorial Day show.

03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:49.640
That should be fun.

03:23:49.640 --> 03:23:50.640
That means three day weekend.

03:23:50.640 --> 03:23:51.640
That means I don't work Monday.

03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:53.640
Should we break out the liquor?

03:23:53.640 --> 03:23:55.640
We'll find out in seven days.

03:23:55.640 --> 03:23:56.640
Have a good one.

03:23:56.640 --> 03:23:57.640
Good night.

03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:00.640
