0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17620	This week EA and BioWare are continuing the drip of Mass Effect Andromeda news and they've
17620	21160	confirmed that we will see more at E3 which is now less than one month away.
21160	24600	There's more news on things that will be in our hands before 2017 and we'll tell you about
24600	27520	them right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27520	31520	Orange Lounge Radio
31520	34520	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34520	40520	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 641
40520	48320	for this May the 15th of 2016. My name is Rob Roberts here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento,
48320	55120	California. You might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me are my co-hosts.
55120	58120	Here with me every week, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58120	60120	I'm not a happy bunny anymore, am I?
60120	67120	I'm like the spiteful leftover from Mary Kay Makeup Testing Factory bunny.
67120	70120	For like the first four years of the show I think I used to introduce you as like the
70120	73120	happiest bunny on the farm or something like that. That was when you were obsessed with
73120	77120	the little happy bunny cartoons. I think I still see them on Hot Topic once in a while.
77120	81120	They're not funny anymore. They just got mean.
81120	84120	And they ran out. I think they just ran out of good ideas at some point.
84120	91120	Yeah, but I feel kind of too crusty to be a happy bunny anyway.
91120	97120	You're getting a little too, I don't want to say too old, but too...
97120	98120	Jaded.
98120	100120	Jaded, I think is a good way to put it.
100120	103120	You know what I am? I'm cynical.
103120	107120	Yes. Although, you are certainly a happy bunny, and I don't want to spend too much time on
107120	110120	this because it's a video game show, but you are certainly a happy bunny on Friday night.
110120	114120	Dark Soccer and I don't get to hang out a lot a lot outside the show just because of
114120	118120	our conflicting schedules, but we went out to the club on Friday with Alan. We went to
118120	121120	go see drag queens because you know Jamie and I love drag queens. So we went and saw
121120	125120	like the drag queen of the now, Kim Chi. It was a lot of fun.
125120	132120	I have to fan myself now. I literally just pulled out my fan because oh my god. And like
132120	134120	she gave me this big bear hug.
134120	139120	Yeah. I was going to ask her what her favorite Pokemon was because that's what I asked
139120	143120	Trixie when I met her. But I just, you know, in the moment you forget things.
143120	150120	Well, I had spent like most of the afternoon trying to memorize how to say thank you in
150120	155120	Korean, which now I haven't memorized. But I said that she's like, Oh my God, thank you.
155120	161120	And let me sneak out my phone for a selfie. And then we and then like right before I left,
161120	163120	she just says, just gives me this huge hug.
163120	165120	I'm like, Oh, she's such a sweetheart.
165120	168120	She's a sweetheart. So you were a very happy bunny on Friday.
168120	170120	I was. I've been touched by greatness.
170120	173120	All right. Also here in studio, someone who could care less about all these drag queens
173120	175120	say hello to tech master Loki.
175120	178120	I don't have any sort of opinion.
178120	180120	Just neutral. Just very neutral. That's fine.
180120	184120	If he could care less than he could care less. Anyway, he couldn't care less.
184120	187120	How are you doing, Loki? Do you have a good week?
187120	188120	All right.
188120	195120	Yeah. So last week, you hurt some of our listeners like physically when you started screaming.
195120	198120	Come on. How many years have you been listening to this show?
198120	202120	You don't know what you're in for. I mean, seriously,
202120	207120	I'm keeping my finger near his volume slider just in case because I'm about to ask this.
207120	212120	But I notice in studio tonight you brought in you bought yourself this flashback console.
212120	217120	I can see through the bag. Yeah, because no one sells Android Bluetooth gaming controllers.
217120	223120	Yes, I could get extremely angry about that. But I have food today that was a somewhat
223120	230120	try to absorb some of Jamie's happiness. Try to just promise like an end.
230120	236120	And I complained about it on Twitter because that's kind of like teasing the show type thing.
236120	241120	But, you know, active said, you know, we told you that last week, you know, you should just order it online.
241120	245120	Yes, I know perfectly well that I can get it online.
245120	250120	This I feel like this is becoming a thing for you, like this is the dude who won't stop and ask for directions.
250120	255120	No, it's not that I won't ask for directions. It's listen.
255120	259120	Oculus is trying to be a gaming platform.
259120	263120	OK, you want me to take this platform seriously?
263120	267120	So the Gear VR, which is, you know, I think it's a pretty great device.
267120	270120	And now it has Minecraft for which is really major.
270120	274120	I mean, you Minecraft on VR is awesome.
274120	277120	You sell these devices in stores with the phones.
277120	283120	So I, you know, theoretically, I could go there, purchase a phone, purchase a Gear VR,
283120	287120	but I can't play Minecraft because they don't sell the controllers.
287120	291120	Is it something because I feel like a lot of the listeners are going, you are literally crazy, Loki.
291120	296120	And yes, I said literally because people don't have problems in their areas.
296120	300120	It seems like it seems like something like this weird, like it's like local or something that you have.
300120	304120	Do you just think about maybe just driving a Reno?
304120	307120	No, I'm not wasting time driving the Reno.
307120	312120	You can go have Steak and Shake in Reno. It's never a waste.
312120	316120	But no, seriously, I've been to almost all the major retailers around here.
316120	320120	I went to Fry's today. I went to even Toys R Us is where I got this.
320120	328120	But Fry's like electronic store that literally carries everything like things that you don't even know you need.
328120	331120	They have it there. They have everything.
331120	337120	But they don't have one single goddamn controller for an Android or even iPhone device.
337120	342120	I mean, they carry a billion different iPhone case covers and headphones and all the stuff,
342120	347120	but not one, millions of different tablets, but not one of them.
347120	351120	Like somebody out leaning in towards the volume slider.
351120	359120	Somebody out there has to like seriously have some sort of inkling of wanting to play a game with a game, you know, gaming controller.
359120	367120	Honestly, if Oculus and Samsung want me to take this platform seriously, it's like going to the store and saying,
367120	371120	okay, I'm gonna go purchase an Xbox One. Oh, but I'm sorry, they don't sell the controllers at the store.
371120	377120	You can order those online. If I'm going online to order something, I'm not going to your store.
377120	381120	You're trying to get me into the store. Best Buy is like terrible at this.
381120	384120	They're selling these in their own store.
384120	389120	But yet they do not have a gaming controller for which half the games use.
389120	392120	It's like, does it make any sense? It boggles my mind.
392120	401120	All right. We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
401120	406120	And if you are listening live, you can participate with the show in our chat room live.vognetwork.com
406120	410120	where SSG100Matt says, this is Loki's white whale. He won't give up.
410120	414120	Just like winning the DeLorean or building an arcade machine.
414120	418120	He'll never give up trying to buy a controller in a retail store. Yes.
418120	421120	No, it's seriously like I think it's a terrible excuse.
421120	427120	I mean, let's look at this way. GameStop. I went to GameStop and that was one of the first places I went to because, you know, they should have controllers.
427120	432120	They carry Android devices. It makes sense that they should have that.
432120	436120	I went there and they're like, sorry, we don't carry it, but we carry it on our website.
436120	443120	So you're telling me you have this in a warehouse somewhere. You get regular shipments from that warehouse.
443120	448120	They can't throw a controller into that package and send it to your store.
448120	454120	They want me to go online to order from their website, which I won't go to their website to order it. I'll go to a different website.
454120	458120	SSG100Matt, he won't admit it, but you're absolutely right.
458120	462120	StopianChat says, the world too. Loki zero.
462120	467120	Alan Alchemy trying to remind you of happier times based on some things you were posting on social media.
467120	472120	Loki is full of Brazilian cooked meats that were fed to him for hours. That is something that happened.
472120	475120	It wasn't hours. I got full after 30 minutes because I didn't pace myself long enough.
475120	478120	And I had too much pizza earlier in the day, so it just...
478120	483120	No, never eat. If you know you're going to the Brazilian grill, you starve yourself for three days in advance.
484120	486120	You have like a granola bar.
486120	491120	I could have, but my body digested extremely quickly. So like, had I known that, I would have just sat there a little longer.
491120	496120	We ran out of time. I knew we had to pick up the kids because, you know, they have to go to bed at some point.
496120	501120	But it was good. I also pet a cow, so there's that.
501120	502120	You pet a cow.
502120	503120	I pet a baby cow.
503120	505120	Congrats. That's an accomplishment.
505120	507120	And then like an hour later, I went and ate a hamburger.
510120	512120	That's farm the fork right there.
513120	518120	Not if it wasn't the cow you just pet.
518120	520120	That's true, but it's symbolic.
520120	526120	Because, well, you know, in a similar thing, my aunt and uncle raised pigs for a living.
526120	534120	When the swine flu went around, my uncle was on the news saying, don't stop eating pork, it's safe, and that whole thing, right?
534120	541120	And I remember like as kids, we used to go to where they lived, the farm or whatever, and we would go pet the baby pigs and all that.
541120	546120	And then we would come in the house and there would be like ham dinner, bacon, like everything.
546120	552120	And like it didn't hit me when I was younger until like I hit a certain age where I kind of look back on it.
552120	554120	And I went, that was like incredibly fucked up.
554120	562120	I had to take my son to like a field trip. They took it to a farm, which is awesome because that farm had portals that no one can access until October.
562120	564120	Because the farm's not open to the public until October.
566120	567120	Anyways, so.
567120	569120	Did you get keys? We need to anchor fields off of them.
569120	578120	Keys, yes. So anyways, they had a bunch of baby animals for the kids to pet, and all the kids were like super excited, myself included, to pet the animals.
578120	581120	And my son's like, I'm not touching those dirty animals.
581120	585120	I mean seriously, that's what he says, he's like, I'm not touching them. I'm like, why aren't you petting the animals?
585120	587120	He's like, they're dirty and germy.
587120	589120	I'm like, that is my wife.
589120	597120	You are channeling my wife right there. In fact, it's funny, like I mentioned, I'm like, yeah, he didn't want to pet any of the animals.
597120	600120	And she's like, yeah, because they're dirty and germy.
600120	606120	And I asked him, so why isn't they even petting the animals? Because they're dirty and germy. I'm like, where'd you learn that one?
606120	608120	What have you done to him?
608120	614120	SSG100Matt says, Loki taking his kids to fun places for portals. Yeah, I wondered why you volunteered for that trip.
614120	615120	Now I know.
615120	616120	I volunteered for all of his field trips.
616120	618120	No, that's true. He does.
618120	621120	I missed the one in downtown Sacramento because that would have been nice.
622120	630120	All right. Let's get into video games. It's what you guys are here to hear about, not just farm to fork and all this other stuff.
630120	634120	We want to talk about video games. We usually do a kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.
634120	640120	I want to ask a little bit about this because, you know, and I got into this just a tiny bit on Bobby's show,
640120	643120	because you were talking about like upcoming games we're going to play and all that stuff.
643120	647120	And we're kind of getting into a period of the year that's going to get a little bit slower.
647120	650120	I mean, yes, I know Overwatch is coming out and I know there's some big games.
650120	653120	I know a big game just came out this week and we'll talk about that in a minute.
653120	659120	But for all practical purposes, things are starting to slow down a little bit until we at least, you know,
659120	662120	hit E3 when we're going to get whatever surprises out of E3.
662120	664120	And then the holiday period is when things will ramp up again.
664120	669120	So now seems like a really good time to catch up on gaming backlogs.
669120	671120	So I post this to all of you in the chat room.
671120	676120	And those of you here in studio as well, over the next, you know, six months, let's say,
676120	678120	until the holidays get here in full force.
678120	685120	What is the game that you feel like you've been putting off way too long that you need to play already?
685120	690120	For example, if this was like three years ago, Mass Effect would have been a great answer for Jamie.
690120	693120	But now that she's played it, we'll have to think of a new answer.
693120	696120	So what is the game in your backlog that you really need?
696120	701120	And I realize Loki might have like 400 games in his Steam library that is his backlog.
701120	703120	But I want to know, like, what's the game?
704120	706120	Four hundred and sixty-something games.
706120	709120	What's the one game you really need to make a point to play?
709120	711120	And it might not even be a game from this year.
711120	715120	This could be a game from like four years ago, five years ago, just something where it's like,
715120	718120	I need to shut up and play this game.
718120	719120	Uh, Darcyra?
719120	721120	I still need to finish Link Between Worlds.
721120	724120	Oh, that's a good one on the 3DS.
724120	732120	I'm just looking at my list on here. I have, like, Lift Razors on here and Never Alone, which I really wanted to play.
732120	736120	Um, Nihalumbra. I'm actually looking at my list right now.
736120	738120	Okay, but you can't just read your whole list. What's the one game?
738120	740120	No, I'm picking the best of them.
740120	745120	Um, I still need to finish The Shiva as well. It was a good game.
745120	751120	And, um, yeah, I just got a bunch of shit on here that I might have started or never finished.
751120	753120	Um, I thought it would be great.
753120	757120	Um, I apparently have The Witcher 2. I don't even remember buying that.
757120	759120	That happens all the time on Steam.
759120	765120	Actually, The Witcher 3 would be a great answer for me, because I played, like, a little bit of it, but I never finished it.
765120	769120	And I think that's one I really need to sit my ass down and finish.
769120	771120	Um, because, you know, everybody loved that game.
771120	775120	I was interested in it until I found out you couldn't play as a woman.
775120	777120	I thought you did for a little bit.
777120	779120	I want to play the whole game as a woman.
779120	781120	I thought it was, um, I mean-
781120	783120	I didn't think you could choose your gender.
783120	791120	Uh, well, I think the character is not, like, it's not like Skyrim where the character, like, the character is based on, like, a book character.
791120	793120	So there's only, like, one imagining of it.
793120	796120	It's like, it's like a, it's like a third person as opposed to a first person.
796120	800120	Yeah, but I still don't care. I didn't, that just sort of was a game breaker for me.
801120	802120	So.
803120	808120	Okay. But you'll, you'll play Zelda even when you can't play a woman, right? I mean, I don't-
808120	809120	Because it's a different kind of game.
809120	815120	I know. Don't get me wrong. Like, I don't, because I totally understand that, yes, there needs to be more representation in games. I totally get that.
815120	823120	But at the same time, like, if your story is a book type story and stuff, like, sometimes in the narrative, you know, I agree.
823120	827120	But there should also be a game, like Witcher 3, where maybe that has a woman character.
827120	832120	I think it was the concept of playing a male character with a romance option.
833120	834120	Hmm.
834120	843120	Because, I mean, I don't mind playing a female character with multiple romance options, but it just made it kind of uncomfortable for me because I can't put myself in the mindset.
843120	845120	Hmm. Interesting.
845120	846120	So I didn't do it.
846120	851120	Well, and I suppose at the same time, you can kind of look at a story and go, that's not a, that's not a book I want to read.
852120	853120	That happens.
853120	859120	Maybe, maybe I will find the books and read those. See, it would be different reading the books, but playing a game that's supposed to be immersive.
859120	860120	Yeah.
860120	861120	That's different.
861120	863120	Maybe that's a way, maybe that's a way to find out.
863120	864120	Yeah.
864120	865120	Yeah. Okay. Cool.
865120	869120	Uh, Loki, what about you? What's, what's something in your backlog where you're like, oh, I gotta play this.
869120	874120	Well, I already, you know, tell you when I'm playing over the summer, it's going to be No Man's Sky.
875120	879120	So there isn't going to be touching any of the backlog. It's going to be No Man's Sky.
879120	884120	Okay. But you got a good month before No Man's Sky. What is the, what is the game in your backlog you've got to catch up on?
884120	893120	Well, I've already kind of started, uh, um, you know, mainly, I guess I'd be playing more Fallout 4 because the new expansion is coming out this week, I think.
893120	895120	So I'll be playing that.
895120	897120	Alan could tell you all about that one.
897120	908120	Yeah. So I'm playing that. I mean, I haven't really been playing too much of it lately. I haven't played any of the new expansion or new update, I guess, or DLC or whatever you want to call it.
908120	917120	And then they have the actual physical expansion that's going to be coming out, um, that I'm looking forward to playing, but I still haven't finished the game once yet.
917120	924120	So, I mean, and I'm, I don't even know how many hundreds of hours in the game. So I'll play that.
924120	928120	No, it's just stuff that's probably on my PlayStation 4. Not really Steam so much.
928120	935120	I mean, I'm just purchasing games on there and just kind of throwing money away. I mean, even stuff that I have on console, like,
936120	939120	At least when it's Humble Bundle and you know a lot of it's going to charity.
939120	945120	No, this isn't even Humble Bundle. Like, last week, you know, during the show, I was like, man, my wife never lets me play on the TV. She's always watching her shows.
945120	949120	When she got into another Shonda Rhimes series, I'm like, ah, crap.
949120	954120	By the way, there's another one coming out on ABC this fall. There's yet another one. Like, didn't Shonda already have a whole entire night?
954120	959120	Well, she has, like, this new series called How to Get Away with Murder or something like that.
959120	960120	Oh, yeah.
961120	965120	She's like, yep, I'm going to be watching this. So I'm like, ah.
965120	970120	So I got entered into the Gungeon on PC now so I can actually play that.
970120	975120	It doesn't run that well on my PC, but whatever, it's enough. I'll play that.
975120	979120	Okay. All right. For me, there's a lot of stuff in my backlog.
979120	988120	I almost want to say, like, The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls are two games from PlayStation 3 that are on PlayStation 4 that I really need to play.
988120	995120	But I do think the game that most of all, like, I really need to sit down and play, which, not to say I don't need to play those two games because I still do,
995120	998120	I really need to play Life is Strange. That's the one I really want to play.
998120	1002120	No, you really need to play Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 5.
1002120	1003120	I do. I do.
1003120	1004120	Grand Theft Auto 5.
1004120	1006120	I need to play Grand Theft Auto 4.
1006120	1008120	No, just skip the 5.
1008120	1009120	Just skip 4 and go to 5.
1009120	1011120	You don't really need to play 4.
1011120	1014120	What if I play Saints Row 4, which is on the Xbox One?
1014120	1017120	That's fine. Saints Row 4 is pretty good. You'd probably like that, actually. It's pretty funny.
1017120	1024120	I downloaded that as the free games of gold or whatever, and I haven't really played that yet.
1024120	1029120	I watched you play it, or maybe I saw Alan play some of it too, but I have not played it myself.
1029120	1031120	And I hear the opening is hilarious like it was in 3.
1031120	1038120	It's okay. The opening isn't as good as 3, I think. I don't know. It's all right.
1039120	1043120	Stobby in chat is confirming skip to Grand Theft Auto 5.
1043120	1048120	Kaijuto says, wow, 2016 and everyone is excited about playing old-ass games.
1048120	1050120	Now, hold on, because this question was about backlogs.
1050120	1053120	I am playing new games and stuff, but there's...
1053120	1059120	Again, unless you do gaming all day every day, you can't play everything.
1059120	1061120	You're going to miss something.
1061120	1066120	And, you know, contrary to popular belief, we don't do OLR for a living, and we don't make money off this show.
1066120	1070120	We don't make a dime off this show. In fact, we pay money to do it, which is fine.
1070120	1074120	We love the community and everything and the people that turn out for it and everything.
1074120	1076120	It's like a hobby.
1076120	1083120	But some people think that because this is what it is, like we can play games during the week all day.
1083120	1088120	No, we all got to work. We all got jobs, 40 hours or more.
1088120	1093120	So, yeah. But we play when we can, when we can.
1093120	1099120	Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1099120	1102120	Some people talking about Shonda shows in chat now.
1102120	1109120	S2100matt says, I really want to buy Firewatch, but I'm forcing myself to at least play, beat five other games for my Steam library.
1109120	1118120	At least the thing about Firewatch, you can kind of beat that in like a night, or if you're a little slower like me, two or three nights tops.
1119120	1124120	Firewatch is not a very long game. It's like, it's like sitting down to watch a really long movie.
1124120	1129120	So that's the good thing about Firewatch is that at least that's when you could beat quick.
1129120	1134120	It's, you know, it's another one of those games. It gets put in that, they call it walking simulator,
1134120	1139120	but I don't, I kind of feel like that genre title is meant to kind of demean that genre.
1139120	1145120	I don't really like it. It's more, I would say it's just more of a story heavy type of game.
1145120	1148120	It's just a first person adventure game.
1148120	1155120	Yeah, something like that. I don't know. It's just, it's, you know, it's more of a very narrative driven type of game,
1155120	1159120	which, you know, Gone Home fits in that category, but that's definitely worth playing if you never have.
1159120	1163120	Just, just, you know, at least one time play through the story. It's great.
1163120	1168120	Although I worry it's, it's a little hyped up now all these years later, but I think it's worth your time.
1168120	1174120	I really think my, my absolute favorite and I've made no surprise or made no secret to this was everybody's gone to the rapture.
1174120	1178120	And I think that one just came out on PC. I want to say I read somewhere.
1178120	1184120	So I played it on PlayStation four, but somebody in chat named Tiger Claw told me to tune in.
1184120	1188120	Well, thank you. And thank Tiger Claw said, I need to start on Rise of the Tomb Raider.
1188120	1192120	I bought it when it came out on Steam a few months ago, but never got around to it.
1192120	1195120	That's a really, yeah, you are correct. It's 20 bucks on Steam.
1195120	1199120	Thank you. Appreciate that. And Rise of the Tomb Raider is also on my list.
1199120	1203120	And I feel really bad saying that, but that's true. I just, so many games.
1203120	1206120	Stopy says, I need to finish Metro Last Light.
1206120	1211120	Trying to look at a couple more here in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1211120	1216120	S.G.O. 100 Matt says, I just beat Roundabout this week, which was a silly and fun game.
1216120	1219120	That game was one of those games that's like so stupid. It's kind of funny.
1219120	1223120	I have, that's something I haven't played that I haven't and I've played some of it.
1223120	1230120	I just haven't finished it. It's so stupid. But I say that in a John Waters movies are stupid and I love them type of way.
1230120	1235120	Rob, you must play Danganronpa.
1235120	1241120	Oh yeah. You and Shane both talk about that a lot. Shane especially. You know how he is.
1241120	1244120	Well, you can blame me for that.
1244120	1248120	I do blame you and I blame him. I got plenty of blame to go around.
1248120	1251120	One of these days, but you've just heard like 800 hours.
1251120	1253120	I thought you Undertale and you played what, five seconds of it?
1253120	1255120	I played at least the beginning.
1255120	1260120	Okay. Did you play Stardew Valley yet?
1260120	1261120	No one's bought it for me yet.
1261120	1265120	Well, there we go. All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks.
1265120	1271120	Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week instead of the ones that we still need to.
1271120	1275120	Going around the room talking about what games we've been playing this week and what we thought. Dark Saga.
1275120	1282120	I played like five seconds of Final Fantasy 14, which I'm still on the fence about going back to World of Warcraft,
1282120	1287120	especially since they gave out Warlords of Draenor for free.
1287120	1296120	So I nabbed that while I could. Words, making things, saying words.
1296120	1306120	I played Danganronpa too. I played some at work because I wanted to show Shane the magical girl Usami mode.
1306120	1310120	And he's like, oh, that's so cute. But it sucks without a controller.
1310120	1320120	And then I played some Animal Crossing, Happy Home Designer a little bit and Ingress, a ton of Ingress.
1320120	1326120	And I'm so close. I'm so close that a little bit more to the left and I'll be there.
1326120	1329120	That's the that's the that's when the real game begins.
1329120	1336120	And then. Oh, yeah, a little Heroes of Dragon Age, still me, Tomo.
1336120	1340120	So, yeah. All right. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
1340120	1347120	I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I played a little bit of Ingress. I did play Earth Defense Force 4.1.
1347120	1353120	So I played that a little bit last night, actually. I don't know. That was pretty much it.
1353120	1361120	I mean, I haven't played a whole ton. I've thought about buying things. I've stopped myself from almost buying things.
1361120	1367120	And then I bought a ColecoVision flashback, which, funny enough, I'm looking at the games on the back here like a lot of these.
1367120	1371120	I don't even remember some of these. I do. So I'm looking forward to playing those again.
1371120	1381120	But some of these I'm like wondering if these are like independent games that someone made that they ported to the ColecoVision like they did with the Atari flashbacks and stuff.
1381120	1386120	Because, like, I don't remember Mecha eight or anything like that.
1386120	1394120	But they have Bump and Jump and Jumpman Jr., so that's pretty awesome. I don't remember Ms. Space Fury.
1394120	1400120	Well, I know those flashback consoles did have some, like, late homebrew type of stuff that came on them.
1400120	1407120	Like, the Atari one definitely has, like, indie titles, basically, that were made after the fact that they include on there.
1407120	1412120	I like that they have Pepper Tookes. Sad that they don't have Mr. Do. Mr. Do is awesome.
1412120	1418120	I thought Mr. Do was by Data East, so the rights to it are probably somewhere else.
1418120	1426120	Like, I'm surprised, like, if it's something that old, it's like, dude, just license it. I mean, seriously, what the fuck are you doing with that property right now?
1426120	1431120	Okay, it's like the Atari 2600 would be so much better if the Activision stuff could be included.
1431120	1438120	Because Activision, you know, say what you will about the company now, but back in the 80s, you know, especially in the Atari age,
1438120	1443120	they were making games that many times were even better than what Atari was making themselves in-house.
1443120	1446120	It was really kind of the birth of the third-party game makers.
1446120	1452120	And so, you know, that's why Activision will usually do their own collections, basically.
1452120	1460120	But, you know, Atari did that Atari Vault recently on PC, which is on Steam, and it has the iPad, you know, and all that.
1460120	1466120	And there's a lot of great Atari games in there, but on the forums, it's just non-stop people bitching.
1466120	1474120	Where's Pitfall? Where's Kaboom? Where's Keystone Capers or anything like that? Those are all Activision games.
1474120	1475120	They don't have the rights to them.
1475120	1482120	I just don't understand why you wouldn't want to license this stuff out. It's like, why hold that stuff, like, get money?
1482120	1486120	Well, because Activision did a shitty iPad thing of their own, I think, at some point.
1486120	1489120	But, you know, I don't know. It wasn't as good.
1489120	1496120	Okay, I understand Activision, but, like, Data East. I mean, dude, Data East, what the hell are you doing with this stuff? Nothing.
1496120	1502120	I want to say, on Xbox, they did something. Not like the ColecoVision, but some of their arcade titles.
1502120	1504120	Like, I feel like Bad Dudes and all that sort of-
1504120	1506120	Well, they had that on Wii. They had a collection on Wii.
1506120	1507120	Was there? Okay.
1507120	1508120	There was a Data East collection, but-
1508120	1509120	That's right.
1509120	1515120	I just don't understand why you wouldn't, like, you're sitting on those properties, like, shit, we're making nothing off of this.
1515120	1517120	You want to license it? Cool. Okay, money.
1517120	1518120	Yeah.
1519120	1524120	Alright, my gaming week. I played a lot of the same old standby stuff.
1524120	1529120	You know Final Fantasy XIV, can't get enough of that. Still playing Diablo III here and there as well.
1529120	1538120	But I did play a new game this week. On the PC, I think a lot of you were excited on Friday that Doom came out on the PC, as well as consoles.
1538120	1544120	I opted to get the PC version because I felt, alright, if I am going to play a first-person shooter, I think I'm going to do this with keyboard and mouse.
1544120	1549120	Even though, I don't know, like, some days I feel like I'm better with controllers, some days I feel like I'm better with keyboard and mouse.
1549120	1555120	But I was like, okay, well the old-school Dooms I remember on PC, so somehow in my mind, it worked.
1555120	1558120	It justified and I said, alright, I'm going to get it on PC.
1558120	1562120	And if I wanted to do the controller thing, I can always play it on Steam Box.
1562120	1566120	And I think that's what really sold it for me, was that I would really be able to do both.
1566120	1571120	So I bought Doom, and although I haven't played a ton of it, so I can't tell you about, like, the entire game,
1571120	1575120	I think I've played enough of it to get a pretty good sense of the game.
1575120	1578120	I like the graphics, first off, are really good.
1578120	1586120	Especially, you know, my computer, I had like a top-of-the-line computer two years ago, but it still runs Doom very, very well.
1586120	1589120	So I'm very happy for that. It looks great.
1589120	1592120	In fact, I don't even think I have the graphics turned all the way up.
1592120	1596120	I think it's just on whatever the defaults are, and some folks in chat are saying, you should turn it up to Ultra.
1596120	1602120	I'm like, alright, it's not on the GeForce Experience thing yet that tells you what's best for your cards.
1602120	1605120	I'm kind of waiting for that. But I'll tinker with the settings later.
1605120	1607120	It looks good enough for me right now.
1607120	1610120	I will say, I noticed the game is very fast-paced. That is one thing I noticed.
1610120	1619120	It's very fast, which is what I liked about the old PC games like Quake and Doom and stuff, was that they were always very fast.
1619120	1621120	And these games are definitely no different.
1621120	1624120	And I don't even play on a very difficult skill level.
1624120	1635120	I play on a pretty easy one because I'm not good at first-person shooters, even though I enjoy the occasional one, especially the old-school ones, which is what kind of possessed me to get Doom in the first place.
1635120	1640120	So they did change some things. You can upgrade the weapons now.
1640120	1643120	When you find things in the level, you might get weapon upgrades.
1643120	1647120	So for example, your shotgun, you could charge it with the right mouse button.
1647120	1650120	You can pick what type of charge you want it to do.
1650120	1653120	Like the one I did, you charge it and it goes tick, tick, tick.
1653120	1657120	And then when you do your next blast, it does three rounds all at once, which is kind of awesome.
1657120	1659120	Do all the old codes work?
1659120	1661120	I doubt it. I haven't tried.
1661120	1666120	Well, the ones to try, remember? IDDQD.
1666120	1669120	Yeah, and then there was what? What's the one that lets you walk through walls?
1669120	1671120	IDQFA.
1671120	1673120	IDQFA. IDBFG.
1673120	1675120	IDBFG is to get the BFG.
1675120	1678120	I hope that's in the game. It's gotta be. It's gotta be.
1678120	1682120	I mean, you still have blue key cards like you had in the old games. A lot of the weapons.
1682120	1688120	The suit that you wear, you see in the very beginning of the game is just like the old ones.
1688120	1691120	And you find these little, they look like little Funko toys.
1691120	1695120	Little collectibles you find in the levels that are old Doom characters, basically.
1695120	1699120	So that's cool. I just can't believe I still remember all those codes.
1699120	1702120	The ones I don't remember are the level skip codes.
1702120	1705120	Because I used to just skip right to the Castle Wolf and Steam levels.
1705120	1708120	Bobby Black Wolf is reminding us of some of the good old codes.
1708120	1710120	Black Wolf says IDCLP.
1710120	1712120	The wall one.
1712120	1715120	Yeah, and IDSPISPOPD is the wall one.
1715120	1717120	So, nice.
1717120	1720120	So yeah, I'm enjoying Doom. I haven't really played the multiplayer yet.
1720120	1724120	I played the beta a while ago, but I've just been trying to get through the single player campaign.
1724120	1730120	And I think if you like a really fast paced first person shooter, I think you're gonna enjoy Doom.
1731120	1733120	If you like the old games as well.
1733120	1736120	If you like something that was fast paced like Quake was back in the day and all that.
1736120	1738120	I think this is really right up the same alley.
1738120	1746120	And Alan Alchemy says there are also hidden doors that you can open that let you play in original Doom hallways but with new enemies.
1746120	1748120	Yeah, I haven't found any of those yet.
1748120	1750120	But I haven't exactly really been looking for them either.
1750120	1752120	So, yeah.
1752120	1755120	So I think Doom, if that sounds like it's up your alley, might be worth it.
1755120	1757120	60 bucks is a lot of money though.
1757120	1759120	I think a lot of you guys are probably gonna wait for a Steam sale.
1759120	1765120	Although, you know, the people who made the game do deserve to make a little money because they worked very hard on it.
1765120	1767120	So you'll have to decide how soon you need it, I suppose.
1767120	1770120	But that was otherwise it for my gaming week.
1770120	1773120	Just a little bit of Doom over the weekend after it came out.
1773120	1777120	In addition to all the standby other stuff I've been playing all the time.
1777120	1779120	Hopefully catching up on my backlog soon.
1779120	1784120	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1784120	1786120	And then we'll get into the news this week.
1786120	1789120	I don't have a lot to say for housekeeping.
1789120	1792120	We're still gonna be here for the upcoming shows and so forth.
1792120	1798120	I believe next weekend, I still have to cross all the T's and dot all the I's so stay tuned to Twitter.
1798120	1800120	And you guys don't even know this, surprise!
1800120	1805120	Next weekend is when we're gonna be joined by another podcast here in Sacramento.
1805120	1806120	Oh yeah.
1806120	1812120	At the SAC Indie Arcade, the Video Game Bang guys are gonna be here in the studio next week.
1812120	1814120	We're gonna do a crossover episode so that'll be fun.
1814120	1818120	I don't know if we play the same types of games.
1818120	1822120	They're probably playing a lot more Doom than I have and we'll see.
1822120	1826120	I think they're more like Call of Duty guys and I don't really play that a lot.
1826120	1830120	And I don't know if they know necessarily music games but we'll see.
1830120	1831120	So we're gonna have fun.
1831120	1834120	That should be next week but don't hold me to that.
1834120	1835120	You know what would be great?
1835120	1836120	What?
1836120	1838120	Is if there was an anti-Doom game called Mood.
1839120	1844120	And it was just walking through flowers and little birds chirping.
1844120	1846120	But you still have to explore.
1846120	1851120	You want like a whimsy Shire level in Doom or something where it's rainbows and kittens and unicorns.
1851120	1853120	Not really but I just think it would be funny.
1853120	1855120	So is that like Chick's Quest?
1855120	1857120	Wasn't that something in like Hexen?
1857120	1860120	Wasn't there like a secret level in one of those games that was like silly?
1860120	1862120	I don't know, I don't know why.
1862120	1864120	Maybe it was probably a mod.
1864120	1867120	It's probably the whole game of Rise of the Triad.
1867120	1869120	And confusing mods for reality.
1869120	1876120	No, the best mod they ever did for one of those old school games was in Wolfenstein 3D.
1876120	1879120	When you could download the Mortal Kombat one.
1879120	1883120	And it would turn like the little mecha Hitler into like Sub-Zero.
1883120	1887120	And like all the end bosses and all this would become like Mortal Kombat characters.
1887120	1889120	That was the best.
1889120	1890120	So anyway.
1890120	1894120	Alright, let's get into some news and talk about some things that are happening here and now.
1894120	1896120	And not mods from the 90s.
1896120	1898120	Loki, starting us off.
1898120	1902120	So there's been some updates to backwards compatibility on Xbox One.
1902120	1907120	Now they have figured out a way to enable support for multi-disc games.
1907120	1910120	So that's pretty awesome.
1910120	1913120	And that will open the doors for a lot of different games.
1913120	1920120	Such as Mass Effect or L.A. Noire, Red Dead Redemption, Lost Odyssey hopefully.
1921120	1928120	They also announced that this week they're going to be having DSX Human Revolution Director's Cut.
1928120	1930120	As one of the free games.
1930120	1936120	And actually that will be the first game supported by the new updates to that.
1936120	1938120	And then yeah.
1938120	1940120	That should be it right now.
1940120	1942120	So that's pretty cool.
1942120	1946120	I mean because there was a lot of multi-disc games on the 360 being that it was on DVDs.
1946120	1949120	And they couldn't really cram the content in there.
1949120	1951120	So I'm looking forward to it.
1951120	1954120	I feel like we should have a counter in studio.
1954120	1960120	Like one of those tote boards that says number of days we've had backwards compatibility without Lost Odyssey.
1960120	1964120	And every week we're going to check in on the board until they finally give us Lost Odyssey.
1964120	1969120	But this is a really good, especially because I swear we were just talking about this on last week's show.
1969120	1972120	Or two weeks ago, but really recently.
1972120	1975120	But this is a really good sign that it's coming.
1975120	1979120	And not just Lost Odyssey, but Mass Effect 3 was on multiple discs right?
1979120	1985120	So I mean there's a lot of good games that are on multiple discs that I'm looking forward to.
1985120	1990120	Red Dead wouldn't be such a problem because single player was on one disc and multiplayer was on the second disc.
1990120	1992120	So it wasn't such a big deal.
1992120	1996120	But yeah I mean I can understand where you'd want that for other games.
1996120	1998120	Well the multiplayer servers are still up.
1998120	2003120	So hypothetically if the backwards compatibility you ought to be able to play multiplayer still.
2003120	2004120	So.
2007120	2010120	Do you think maybe they're going to sit on a bunch of these big ones until E3?
2010120	2012120	Because I kind of think that's what's going to happen.
2012120	2013120	Probably.
2013120	2015120	I think especially like Red Dead Redemption.
2015120	2016120	Yeah I can see that.
2016120	2020120	And then because you're telling us the sequel is coming at E3 right?
2020120	2023120	Well Rockstar is supposed to be there.
2023120	2025120	It's been hinted at quite a bit.
2025120	2027120	Rockstar hasn't had a booth in a long time.
2027120	2030120	Well they're not going to have a booth. They're going to be at E3 though.
2030120	2031120	Oh then they've got something to show.
2031120	2032120	Yeah something to show.
2032120	2033120	During one of the press conferences.
2033120	2036120	So it's either going to be like an expansion to Grand Theft Auto.
2036120	2037120	Maybe both.
2037120	2040120	I think it's probably going to be another Red Dead game.
2041120	2045120	Pre-order now and get the first game free on backwards compatibility.
2045120	2046120	Bang.
2046120	2047120	That's what they'll do.
2047120	2049120	That's the big thing to do now.
2049120	2051120	Well that's what they can do on Xbox One.
2051120	2053120	Not so much PlayStation 4.
2053120	2055120	I really wish that would change.
2055120	2058120	Who knows what Sony could have up their sleeve.
2058120	2060120	You're going to get it on PlayStation now.
2060120	2061120	For free.
2061120	2062120	You could.
2062120	2063120	Hypothetically.
2065120	2070120	ST100Matt says yeah they will say Red Dead Redemption will be available right now kind of deal.
2070120	2076120	I'm pretty sure with this backwards compatibility they're sitting on something big that they'll unveil at E3.
2076120	2081120	If it's not this then it's going to be Skyrim or something that people have really really been asking for a lot.
2081120	2083120	Backwards compatibility for Final Fantasy XI.
2083120	2084120	Oh damn.
2085120	2086120	Oh wait.
2086120	2087120	Wait a minute.
2087120	2088120	Maybe not.
2089120	2090120	Alright.
2090120	2095120	Kaijuto in chat says if they waste E3 talking about backwards games they're going to lose big time.
2095120	2097120	Dude, it would take like 15 seconds.
2097120	2100120	It's like an update on backwards compatibility.
2100120	2103120	It now will do 50% of the games.
2103120	2105120	It doesn't even have to be about that.
2105120	2110120	It could just be like hey we just rock stars there to present a trailer for Red Dead.
2110120	2111120	Exactly.
2111120	2116120	And then hey by the way as an added bonus we're going to have this all available now.
2116120	2117120	Exactly.
2117120	2120120	Or Mass Effect Andromeda you can now get 2 and 3 are available.
2120120	2122120	It would take literally 15 seconds.
2122120	2124120	I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying.
2124120	2125120	Alright.
2125120	2126120	Moving on.
2126120	2129120	Talking about the future of another series.
2129120	2131120	I was very excited this week.
2131120	2135120	You know I was very very excited when this series gets talked about.
2135120	2140120	And I want to say I speculated not that long ago that this was a likely thing for E3 this year.
2140120	2144120	And sure enough Civilization VI was announced this week.
2144120	2145120	Yay!
2145120	2148120	Civilization VI is coming out on October 21st.
2148120	2150120	They even dated it already.
2150120	2151120	It's ready to go.
2151120	2153120	60 bucks is what it's going to cost you.
2153120	2156120	Civilization not games that really show up on consoles.
2156120	2158120	I mean yes there was Civilization Revolution.
2158120	2161120	Speaking of backwards compatibility I'd like to have that one.
2161120	2164120	But Civilization is more of a PC game.
2164120	2166120	You've just got to have a keyboard and mouse to play.
2166120	2167120	There's too much to do with it.
2167120	2171120	So Civ VI is going to be a game and you can pre-order it now on PC.
2171120	2173120	And it's going to be out on October 21st.
2173120	2177120	I was reading a little more about what they're actually changing with it.
2177120	2179120	And I think they're sitting on most of it until E3.
2179120	2184120	I'm pretty sure they'll have a theater or something at E3 where you can watch some of the gameplay.
2184120	2188120	I remember that's what they did with Beyond Earth when I went to E3 at one point.
2188120	2195120	But with Civ VI they're keeping the hexagon format.
2195120	2197120	So they're keeping that from 5.
2197120	2201120	They are I guess changing a bit with city management.
2201120	2203120	So now instead of just staying in your city like,
2203120	2207120	Oh I want to build a coliseum in my city.
2207120	2212120	Now it's what grid or what square on the grid do you want to put the coliseum on.
2212120	2216120	Because it's going to change possibly the characteristics of that square.
2216120	2222120	Which in older Civilization games you use settlers to do different things to squares.
2222120	2226120	Like build a railroad or irrigate them to make more food.
2226120	2232120	You could do a variety of things but it sounds like that's really going to expand with the city management.
2232120	2236120	So very very curious to see where that goes.
2236120	2238120	So I'm looking forward to E3.
2238120	2243120	I'm not a big fan of what I'm hearing about this city stuff.
2243120	2245120	But I need to see it in motion before I can really be critical.
2245120	2248120	Let's face it, it's a Civ game. Of course I'm going to buy it.
2248120	2250120	Of course.
2250120	2253120	And then I'll stay up until 6 in the morning playing a game.
2253120	2255120	Because that's what happens with Civilization is that,
2255120	2257120	Oh woah where did the time go?
2257120	2260120	It's actually 4 o'clock in the morning all of a sudden.
2260120	2264120	Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2264120	2267120	Bobby Black Wolf says, Civilization Revolution was great.
2267120	2271120	I agree. A lot of hardcore Civ fans shit on that game.
2271120	2276120	But again I think it's because it's a game that's geared a little more towards dirty casuals and that's okay.
2276120	2283120	I think Civ Rev was the most like the original Civilization but on consoles.
2283120	2285120	I mean it wasn't exactly like the original Civ but it was close enough.
2285120	2290120	And I think they did a really good job making it available for consoles.
2290120	2296120	I didn't bother with the iPhone Android version they did of it. I didn't bother with that one.
2296120	2299120	And Rage Nator says, Wasn't the original Civilization on the Super Nintendo?
2299120	2304120	I believe it was but Civ was less complicated back then.
2304120	2308120	I even want to say on the Super Nintendo it was a little bit, they had to cut some corners.
2308120	2310120	It wasn't quite the same.
2310120	2313120	Let's move on DarkSakura.
2313120	2317120	Well it's finally happening. I kind of saw this happening.
2317120	2320120	And then I was actually kind of surprised and then sort of not.
2320120	2323120	It's kind of a weird mixed feeling about this.
2323120	2328120	But Disney is finally ending Disney Infinity.
2328120	2331120	They're shutting down Avalanche Software.
2331120	2333120	There will be no more Disney Infinity.
2333120	2336120	I think they're going to do like two more sets and then that's it.
2336120	2342120	So yeah, according to Bob Iger, the Disney CEO.
2342120	2354120	They said that they thought that they had a really good opportunity to do something along the lines of what Skylanders and all that were doing.
2354120	2360120	And they thought it was doing pretty well but the business is changing and they don't want to keep up with it.
2360120	2362120	That's the official word.
2362120	2366120	It is what it is.
2366120	2369120	You now have plenty of cute little toys.
2369120	2372120	I've never played the game ever.
2372120	2375120	But I have a Rocket Raccoon and I have a Quora.
2375120	2377120	Thank you Loki.
2377120	2381120	So take it as you will.
2382120	2389120	I think that they might look into more like outsourcing or something.
2389120	2396120	But I think that the series is kind of a difficult market to play.
2396120	2399120	Because how much do you produce?
2399120	2401120	What type of market are you going to go to?
2401120	2404120	Are people going to keep playing it and stay interested in it?
2404120	2413120	What new can you do to keep it something that's going to draw people in or convince them that when you have a new iteration of it that it's worth it to buy?
2413120	2417120	Well and I think Disney at some point is just more...
2417120	2420120	I wouldn't say so much outsourcing but just licensing.
2420120	2427120	They would just much rather, hey somebody wants to pay us a shit ton of money to make a Star Wars Battlefront game and it's actually really good.
2427120	2431120	Or well, whether it's good or not it doesn't matter. It sells a lot.
2431120	2438120	Sure, why not. Or hey, Square wants to throw us a lot of money to use Disney characters in Kingdom Hearts 3. Sure.
2438120	2442120	I also think it's absolutely hilarious and I'm going to call them on this.
2442120	2444120	It has nothing to do with the article.
2444120	2447120	Polygon, you got a typo on your webpage.
2447120	2450120	Skylanders does not have a J in it.
2450120	2453120	Just saying. Just saying.
2453120	2455120	Jai-landers.
2455120	2460120	It's Skylanders. It's like S-J-Y-L-A-N-S-D-E-R-S.
2460120	2467120	I had to screenshot it and I'm going to email it to them because I'm just that person.
2467120	2479120	Oh boy. So I think it's surprising a little bit that this went away because I thought Disney Infinity was doing relatively well.
2479120	2488120	But then when you read the thing about, oh well they have to put one million Hulk things back in a storage bin somewhere because they didn't sell enough of them.
2488120	2494120	You kind of go, well it sounds like their expectations kind of did them in. They couldn't find that happy balance.
2494120	2499120	There wasn't enough toys in the first go around and there's way too god damn many of them in the second go around.
2499120	2507120	Like they couldn't find that happy medium and it just kind of, I don't know, it just kind of sucks that the whole series gets done in by a series of bad decisions like that.
2507120	2519120	So hopefully whoever wants to get into the physical toys and games business next considers that. Although I doubt there will be many more players in that realm.
2519120	2526120	Isn't there another, like even though, and this is the thing that gets me, and I haven't heard a lot about this.
2526120	2534120	When I go to Target and I see Disney Infinity on the shelf, I notice it's by Skylander, it's by Amiibo, but it's by this other one.
2534120	2542120	And I don't remember the name of it but somebody in chat probably does. It's like a direct to your TV thing and it's all Marvel characters.
2542120	2547120	So Disney is actually competing against itself in this space.
2547120	2554120	And that's kind of where I go, well what did you think was going to happen?
2554120	2562120	So I kind of, I really blame some higher ups at Disney for these types of planings.
2562120	2569120	Because when I saw the one that was the plug direct into the TV, and it's taking up a lot of shelf space at Target too.
2569120	2570120	I don't know if there's some type of arrangement.
2570120	2579120	That one is a little bit different if it's the same one I'm thinking of because they have some that have characters, but then you also have actual costume stuff that you wear.
2579120	2581120	It's Playmation, thank you Tigerclaw.
2581120	2590120	Yeah, exactly. So you have like shields, like you can have Iron Man's gauntlet or something and you're actually shooting the characters and stuff.
2590120	2594120	Okay, again, how is that not Disney competing against itself?
2594120	2600120	It's more of a toy than it is Disney Affinity. It's a little bit different. It's less complicated as a game.
2600120	2606120	It's more of like those, they've had them before where toys interact with infrared things and stuff like that.
2606120	2610120	Yeah, I guess. Now did the plug get pulled on that series?
2610120	2611120	No.
2611120	2613120	Isn't that interesting?
2613120	2615120	Just saying.
2615120	2626120	I don't know, like when I was at the different stores today, I mean they still have a very big section of Disney Affinity, so their figures are marked down to $9 at Toys R Us. I almost got some.
2626120	2629120	Were they? Because I need to get the core out of Complete My Tron collection.
2629120	2631120	All the figures are $9.
2631120	2634120	I might need to look for that. I'll send Shane help for me.
2634120	2639120	I almost got some today, but I was like, yeah, I'm gonna get yelled at by the way if I bring any more of those home.
2639120	2640120	You can keep them here.
2641120	2645120	Yeah, I don't really want any more anyways. They don't really add anything.
2645120	2648120	I just want the core out of Complete My Tron collection, then I'm good.
2648120	2649120	You want the core?
2649120	2650120	Yeah.
2650120	2651120	Wait, don't give me yours.
2651120	2652120	Too bad?
2652120	2653120	Don't give me yours. Just, you know.
2653120	2655120	Did you hear what I said?
2655120	2656120	What'd you say?
2656120	2657120	Too bad.
2657120	2663120	Too bad. Yeah, funny. No, I looked on Amazon the other day and they were still up there and I'm sure I can find one.
2663120	2664120	They're like everywhere.
2664120	2667120	Need to do it sooner rather than later, that's all. Not put it off.
2667120	2668120	You know what?
2668120	2669120	Huh?
2670120	2672120	I just forgot what I was going to say, so never mind.
2672120	2674120	You're right tonight.
2674120	2675120	No.
2675120	2677120	You're having a hard time functioning.
2677120	2678120	No.
2678120	2679120	You need more coffee.
2679120	2683120	Well, no, I don't need more coffee. It's just I got things I'm worried about.
2683120	2685120	Well, I hope everything's all right.
2685120	2697120	Sure, they can have a whole giant section of those toys and a whole giant section of those race car things that we were talking about last week that were there with all the iPads and everything.
2697120	2705120	But God forbid we could carry one fucking controller. Like one single controller for that stuff.
2705120	2709120	Oh, we'll carry a billion of these things that no one's buying, but one controller that is asking too much.
2709120	2711120	Do you want a Hulk figure? Because we got plenty of those.
2714120	2715120	Dear Loki.
2717120	2719120	Internet. Can you use it?
2719120	2722120	He already went into why he's not going to buy it online.
2722120	2726120	Too bad. Buy it online if you want it. If you don't want it bad enough, you're not going to go for it.
2726120	2735120	Well, then they don't want to treat it as an actual platform then because, you know, all the other gaming platforms that I see out there in the marketplace have their fucking accessories in retail stores.
2735120	2739120	If you don't have your accessories in retail stores, then I'm sorry you're not a gaming fucking platform.
2739120	2742120	Dungeon Buster in chat says, Captain Loki, controller war.
2747120	2752120	I think we just need to pool the money together, buy one online and just have it sitting on the couch next week for him.
2753120	2756120	Oh, and don't get me started about how-
2756120	2758120	With the card attached, it says shut up.
2758120	2759120	Exactly.
2760120	2768120	And don't get me started on how expensive those controllers are too. It's like, you do realize I'm trying to give you $60 to play an $8 game.
2768120	2770120	Oh my god, nevermind. They're $60? Keep talking.
2770120	2771120	That's cool. That's $30 each.
2773120	2775120	There's so many few people making those things.
2775120	2778120	$30 could buy like dinner at Benihana.
2778120	2779120	You want to go to Benihana and stuff?
2779120	2780120	Fuck yeah.
2780120	2784120	Alright, let's do it. Let's go to the grill place, the church screen.
2784120	2785120	Alright, alright.
2785120	2787120	Alright, we're gonna go get-
2787120	2789120	We're gonna spend your controller money on beef.
2789120	2790120	Yeah, we're gonna go-
2790120	2791120	I support that.
2793120	2794120	Alright.
2794120	2795120	It's a plan.
2796120	2797120	Let's see.
2797120	2802120	Ragenator in chat says, Loki went Amish and refuses to internet for controllers at a spike.
2802120	2808120	Or here's an idea if you don't want to sell me a controller, how about you just fucking make the Dual Shocks work with the stupid-
2808120	2810120	Wait, Loki, this is right up your alley.
2810120	2815120	Doesn't Steam have that thing where you can like download how to make your own damn controller?
2815120	2818120	Like I thought that was a thing or is that only a Steam controller that won't work?
2818120	2823120	I think you're thinking of the Ouya and you can print your own shells for the Ouya, but no one's gonna buy an Ouya.
2823120	2829120	I swear to god we had a story on the show a couple weeks ago where you could like download the schematics to make your own Steam controller or something.
2829120	2832120	Can you? You still have your Ouya, right?
2832120	2833120	Fuck no, I don't.
2833120	2835120	Okay, well then nevermind.
2835120	2837120	I was wondering like if they could network.
2837120	2844120	Loki, my point is, if you can't find one, you're gonna have to build one. If you build it, they will come.
2844120	2849120	I'm not gonna build a control- I probably could build it cheaper anyways, but I'm just saying to you, I'm not gonna-
2849120	2852120	If you build it, they will come.
2853120	2860120	Just sell a fucking controller. There's so many controllers out there that are available. You can carry one fucking controller.
2861120	2863120	Stoppy in chat says you can even 3D print it.
2863120	2864120	I'll tell you what-
2864120	2866120	If you print it, they will come.
2866120	2874120	Hey, how about you buy one less iPhone case? You'll carry 199 iPhone cases and one controller.
2877120	2885120	And then here's the other thing. It's a Bluetooth controller for fucking- they have Bluetooth controllers for iPhone, but they're not compatible with Android.
2885120	2890120	It's Bluetooth! It's supposed to be compatible with everything. That doesn't make any sense to me.
2890120	2895120	Loki, Loki, before you get the engines revved up again, I think I'm gonna need you to do the next story.
2898120	2899120	Fine.
2900120	2915120	So, Warren Spector, who kind of worked on the whole Epic Mickey series, says that there's some sort of unreleased Disney property that was gonna become a game that he would like to get his hands on.
2915120	2922120	Basically saying, hey, now that you're out of games, can I have the IP I created at Junction Point back? You're never gonna do anything with them.
2923120	2933120	And since Disney acquired Junction Point, they own my near future action modern day ninja and epic fantasy concepts. It'd be nice to get them back.
2934120	2938120	So he's basically like, can I get my dress back? Because you're not gonna wear it.
2941120	2943120	You're too fat for the dress anyway.
2943120	2945120	I loaned you those shoes last year.
2946120	2953120	So the games that he was working on, one of which was called Necessary Evil, and it's like a game that's supposed to be similar to Deus Ex.
2954120	2957120	And then, I'm not really sure what the other one was.
2958120	2966120	I'm kind of surprised what these are have been put out there, because now if he does get ahold of these IPs by some miracle, it's already out there what it is. It's kind of surprising.
2967120	2978120	I don't know. I mean, I'm fine with them licensing their properties. It'd be kind of cool, though, if they could license Marvel to Lego Dimensions.
2979120	2986120	I'm sure they're gonna license the shit out of their characters. They're not gonna stop doing that. Kingdom Hearts 3 isn't gonna suddenly not happen.
2987120	2989120	So, I mean, they're gonna continue to license out the Disney stuff.
2990120	2992120	Kingdom Hearts 3 with the Avengers would be fucking amazing.
2992120	3001120	My assumption is they're still doing fine in the mobile marketplace. I didn't hear anything about what's happening in the mobile development area, which is still pretty big for Disney.
3002120	3004120	So I think this is just the console space.
3005120	3013120	Yeah, it's just they decided to not make a game, because they really only have a game coming out each year, and they're just gonna make money by licensing their properties.
3014120	3020120	Kind of like how LucasArts was gonna be licensing their properties instead of actually making games themselves.
3021120	3031120	Alright, well, even though there may be no more physical Disney toys, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Nintendo fills the space with physical versions of these toys.
3032120	3039120	Pokemon! Did you guys hear there's some big Pokemon news this week? And it actually has nothing to do with toys. I'm just forecasting the future.
3040120	3048120	But what we know for a fact is going to happen is that Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon will be launching for the Nintendo 3DS on November 18th.
3048120	3052120	Dude, that's awesome! But where are the Wii U games?
3053120	3061120	I was like, no, no. Loki doesn't just say that's awesome with something like that. There's a hidden joke or a punchline.
3062120	3065120	They only have the new Paper Mario game, which looks pretty cool.
3066120	3069120	Haven't you heard? Zelda! And that's all we're gonna show at E3 this year.
3070120	3074120	Zelda's coming out this year? Oh, wait, it's not fucking coming out this year. That's right.
3074120	3081120	No, it's not. Yeah, it's not. Maybe NES Remix 3 just to hold you up. Maybe there'll be NES Remix 3 to hold you up.
3082120	3083120	Maybe not that.
3084120	3085120	We should get the first one.
3086120	3088120	We'll get some new skins in Mario Maker.
3089120	3090120	Don't we always get that?
3091120	3098120	Hey, the baby metal thing? That was pretty rad. Like, an unexpected. So, you know what? Baby metal is endorsed by Rob Zombie.
3099120	3101120	You know who's playing Mario Maker now? My son's playing Mario Maker now.
3102120	3103120	Good for him!
3104120	3106120	He just builds levels and then, like, that's it.
3107120	3109120	He just draws bricks everywhere. I did it. Funny.
3110120	3120120	By the way, also huge, huge, big news that started all types of Twitter wars that I may or may not have been involved in directly over the new starter Pokemon.
3121120	3127120	You have this, oh my god, this adorable fat little owl with a little leaf bow tie named Rowlet.
3127120	3137120	It, oh my god, does it look like, yes, you should sing show tunes like the old WB frog does in a top hat and a cane.
3138120	3143120	Well, this is like the old, um, uh, Mooney Tunes owl. The family.
3144120	3149120	Okay, so I like Rowlet. Rowlet is really cute. And Litten, adorable.
3150120	3151120	The best!
3151120	3157120	Yes, little fire kitty. Looks very sassy, looks very mean, but also adorable at the same time.
3158120	3163120	Uh, that's Litten. And I think I'm gonna be Team Litten, because it seems like the rest of the internet is Team Rowlet.
3164120	3167120	Um, and, uh, you know, fire type beats grass type, so that makes sense.
3168120	3171120	So those are, those are the two starter types you have to look forward to in Pokemon.
3172120	3175120	Oh, yeah, there's another one. It's, um, Pooplio.
3176120	3177120	Like, Shane is after the seal.
3178120	3180120	I think it's Pooplio that looks like a derpy clown dog seal.
3181120	3183120	It's probably gonna be like a crazy ass sea lion.
3184120	3190120	Oh, Pooplio! Yes, Pooplio. Sorry, I just, my eyes. Can't read.
3191120	3193120	It's just the derpy visuals.
3194120	3195120	I'm sure it dooshed.
3197120	3203120	So, uh, there you go. No, in all seriousness, Rowlet, I'm just, I'm just waiting for act after somebody starts screaming at me in chat.
3204120	3207120	Uh, Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio are the three starter Pokemon.
3208120	3209120	So what do those evolve into?
3209120	3215120	They haven't shown those yet. We only know what the starter types look like, so we can only kind of guess.
3216120	3223120	I would imagine Rowlet is gonna be a very, you know, kind of bird, like a full bird type of thing, like a hawk type of thing, probably.
3224120	3226120	How does an owl evolve into a hawk?
3227120	3234120	It never made sense. Uh, and Litten will probably be like a big lion, like a fire lion, and then Lord knows what the Popplio's gonna turn into.
3235120	3236120	That's an even dumber looking seal.
3236120	3239120	Stop. Maybe, maybe a whale or something, I don't know.
3240120	3241120	A beached whale.
3244120	3247120	Like a magic carp. It'll just lie there. It has splash.
3248120	3253120	Uh, this is how I know Shane's not listening right now because my phone isn't blowing up with hate.
3255120	3257120	You know, is Ash still in these games?
3258120	3260120	Uh, no. He was, Ash was technically never in the games.
3261120	3263120	No, it was red and blue the first time.
3263120	3264120	Yeah, fine, you know.
3265120	3266120	The character is you. You can name whatever it is.
3267120	3271120	Okay, well whatever. So I'm gonna use Sea World on Popplio, and it was very effective.
3276120	3285120	Alright, let's move on, cause just, I already know I'm gonna get a three hour hate monologue from Shane later when he hears this. Hopefully he won't.
3286120	3287120	So let's move on. Dark Sakura, what do you have?
3287120	3293120	Well, I seem to have this theme of stuff just closing or quitting or not doing things anymore.
3294120	3298120	So Microsoft has thrown in the towel for Project Spark.
3299120	3304120	Project Spark was supposed to be a game making tool for Xbox One and for Windows PC.
3305120	3311120	It is no longer available to download as of two days ago, May 13th.
3312120	3319120	Online services, including the ability to download and upload, will be unavailable after August 12th.
3320120	3325120	So finish your shit by then, get it up, cause you will be done after that.
3328120	3337120	It was supposed to be there to let different game designers create things that they want to and then play homemade games on a community level.
3337120	3349120	And there were people who used it for all kinds of things, including a Conker series. A little episodic adventure type thing.
3350120	3354120	Yeah, didn't they put Conker out as an asset you could get in Project Spark at one point?
3355120	3356120	But now it is no more.
3357120	3358120	It conked out.
3359120	3365120	What? Did nobody else see the easy pun that just writes itself? Come on.
3365120	3371120	Out of all the places that they should have put Conker, Project Spark was probably the dumbest thing they could have done.
3372120	3376120	It's like, hey, we've got Conker. Everyone's like, new Conker game? It's going to be in Project Spark. Oh, fuck.
3378120	3382120	Look, I'm not going to hate on Project Spark, cause I know there are fans and stuff.
3383120	3388120	I feel like this is another one of those things that Microsoft kind of killed, maybe a little too soon.
3389120	3392120	Yeah, they were jumping on the little big planet bandwagon like five years late.
3393120	3396120	I feel like it was a little more than just a little big planet.
3397120	3398120	Well, we can't help you, Mario Maker.
3399120	3400120	But I guess it's done now.
3401120	3403120	Stoppy says, Spark is such a dumb name. This is from our chat room.
3404120	3408120	If it's a versatile and easy to use tool set, they should have named it Spork.
3410120	3412120	Good night, everybody. Thanks for listening.
3413120	3415120	KFC presents Project Spork.
3415120	3423120	All right, I'm done. I'm done packing up my computer. I'm going the fuck home.
3424120	3427120	Actually, fuck that. I'm going to go get cheesecake and drink until I get over this.
3428120	3429120	Extra crispy edition.
3431120	3434120	Let's travel around the world to check out some release dates.
3435120	3436120	Seriously, balls.
3437120	3441120	Check out what games are coming out in a store near you, Loki, here in the US.
3441120	3444120	It's a store near me. Well, Homefront The Revolution.
3445120	3449120	That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
3450120	3455120	Also on PlayStation 4, Shadow of the Beast and Valkyria Chronicles Remastered.
3456120	3460120	And then we also have Shadwin on PlayStation 4 and PC.
3461120	3465120	And then later in the week, Last Fight on PC.
3465120	3469120	If you're a fan of... what is it?
3470120	3473120	Fuck me, I can't remember the name of the series now.
3474120	3475120	It'll come back to me.
3476120	3477120	Let's take a fighting game.
3478120	3484120	And then finally, Time Machine VR coming to PC for the Vive and the Rift.
3487120	3488120	And that's it.
3489120	3494120	Okay then, we'll travel over to Japan and check out what's going to come out over there.
3495120	3497120	Starting on the PlayStation 4.
3498120	3499120	You know, it's been kind of a slow couple weeks in Japan.
3500120	3502120	I think Golden Week was just recently.
3503120	3505120	Power Stone, that was the game I was thinking of.
3506120	3507120	Last Fight is very similar to Power Stone.
3508120	3509120	But things are picking up again in Japan this week.
3510120	3514120	And we have Doom coming out in Japan this week, getting its release there on the PlayStation 4 on May 19th.
3514120	3516120	Battleborn also making its way to Japan this week.
3517120	3519120	And Homefront the Revolution arrives in Japan this week.
3520120	3522120	Again, all of that on the PlayStation 4.
3523120	3527120	Seeing if there's anything on the PlayStation 3, because we're still seeing some stuff from that generation.
3528120	3533120	No, we don't really have any releases until the 26th when Guilty Gear XRD comes out.
3534120	3542120	So I guess I can skip ahead to the PlayStation Vita and tell you that Period Cube, Torikago no Amadeus is out this week in a regular and limited edition set.
3542120	3546120	I can't help but think of Intelligent Cube, but I don't think those games have anything in common.
3547120	3554120	And then on the Nintendo DS this week, Boku no Hero Academia Battle for All comes out this week from Bandai Namco.
3555120	3558120	This is My Hero Academia comes out.
3559120	3561120	Which looks like, I think it's a fighting game.
3562120	3568120	Yeah, it's a little fighting game, little anime boom boom wham, kind of looks like Batman with the big explosions and stuff.
3569120	3571120	So that is what you have to look forward to on the 3DS.
3572120	3574120	How about Europe Dark Sakura?
3575120	3582120	There's some stuff. There is Shadwin on Mac coming out, Valkyria Chronicles remaster for PlayStation 4, those are all on the 17th.
3583120	3592120	On the 19th we have Time Machine VR for PC, and on the 20th Fire Emblem Fates for 3DS, Homefront the Revolution for everything else.
3593120	3598120	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
3599120	3602120	Alright, so this is kind of neat, there's new game consoles coming.
3603120	3608120	And these are both coming out of China, so there's a couple different things being announced.
3609120	3616120	One was the Tencent TGP Box, that's being announced at CES Asia.
3617120	3624120	And that is going to be running off of an Intel Core processor, and it runs Windows 10.
3625120	3640120	And also something called TGP Box Mode, and they're basically saying that the console can download and stream games, including League of Legends, FIFA Online 3, NBA 2K Online, Monster Hunter Online, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Tournament.
3641120	3648120	So a console that plays League of Legends, that's kind of a big deal. But that sounds like a Steam Machine, the way you describe it.
3648120	3653120	It's almost like a PC, but it's got some sort of special mode in it or something that runs those.
3654120	3666120	Interesting. Let's steam big picture. I'm just saying, it kind of sounds similar, I mean, it sounds more like this is actually just a computer that hooks up to your TV than necessarily a dedicated gaming console.
3667120	3668120	Yeah, it sort of looks like that.
3669120	3674120	To be fair, gaming consoles and PCs, the line is getting more and more blurred, maybe this is just a further example of that, I don't know.
3675120	3681120	Yeah, they basically said it's basically a Windows 10-powered gaming console with smart features designed to transcend traditional gaming.
3682120	3691120	Okay, that sounds like a bunch of marketing PR buzz crap hype. But there's that. So, interesting, I guess. We'll have to see if that ever makes it out anywhere else.
3691120	3704120	Also, the Fuse Tomahawk F1. And this game system looks like it's sort of like, I guess they're saying it's like an Android console.
3705120	3709120	But here's the thing though, it's got quite a lineup of different titles that are supposed to be coming out for it.
3710120	3725120	Including Assassin's Creed Chronicles, Dynasty Warriors X Extreme Legends, BlazBlue, Chrono Phantasma Extent, Mighty No. 9, and the, once Kickstarted but dropped from Kickstarter, Red Ash.
3726120	3731120	Red Ash is going to be coming out to it. That's one that's supposed to be like Mega Man Legends.
3732120	3750120	Also, other things that they're talking about, other titles, Saints Row IV and Saints Row Gata out of Hell, Salt Android Cactus, I mean, they got quite a lineup of titles on there. I mean, that's pretty interesting. And I guess that is the company that funded Red Ash.
3751120	3756120	Okay, when I first heard about this, I was like, okay, so it's basically the Ouya in a bigger box. But, I mean...
3756120	3757120	It sounds like they got quite a bit of titles on there.
3758120	3760120	Some of those games you would think, like Saints Row IV is at least going to take an Xbox...
3761120	3762120	I don't think that runs on Android yet.
3763120	3764120	No, no, it's going to take a little more punch to...
3765120	3767120	I mean, that's at least, you know, Xbox...
3768120	3769120	360 level stuff.
3770120	3771120	You know, level graphics, so...
3772120	3782120	Well, this is going to be very interesting if China starts to get into the market like this. Like, you know, I don't think that Windows box, you know, because again, that first one you talked about sounds like it's just basically a PC that hooks up your TV.
3782120	3788120	Yeah, and the controller is basically a rip-off of an Xbox 360 controller. I mean, it looks almost identical.
3789120	3793120	And then the actual console itself looks like a rip-off of the PlayStation 4, so...
3794120	3795120	It's an interesting combination.
3796120	3801120	If there's a good idea, why change it? But that would be interesting if you get a console like this that, you know, becomes highly desirable.
3802120	3806120	You would have to wonder if maybe one day consoles may come from China.
3806120	3822120	I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow or this year even, but it could be very, very, very interesting if a company like Tencent or something starts to join Sony and Nintendo and some of these other companies in this console space that's already kind of crowded.
3823120	3828120	Yeah, I mean, definitely looks interesting. I'd be curious to see...
3829120	3832120	Oh, here's another one. Grid Autosport also runs on it as well.
3832120	3843120	Dungeon Buster brings up a good point that I do believe is worth correcting, Loki. Red Ash was funded by a Chinese company, but they ended the Kickstarter early. Not that the Kickstarter was doing all that well to begin with.
3844120	3847120	Well, yes, that's what I'm saying. They ended the Kickstarter because it got funded by a company.
3848120	3854120	I thought they still ran it for stretch goals, I thought was the thing. I could be thinking of something else on Kickstarter these days.
3855120	3856120	There's several of those games that do that too.
3856120	3861120	And Bob Coffey in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, better launch lineup than the Wii U.
3862120	3866120	Well, I don't know if all those games are necessarily the day it launches, though.
3867120	3875120	Well, that's true, but I mean, you basically have an Android console, you know, theoretically. So they're saying, okay, here's some price points to kind of give you an idea of how much this is going to cost.
3875120	3882120	And it's pretty impressive, actually. So they're saying the Play Edition of the console will launch for 899 yen, which is just about $140.
3883120	3889120	And it's considerably cheaper than everything else that's on the market right now. They're saying that it even has VR support for it later on.
3890120	3904120	The specs on it, Nvidia Tegra K1, 4-core processor. They've also got 4GB of RAM. It's got 32GB of on-board storage, or 500GB if you have an Elite console.
3905120	3912120	And then HDMI USB 3.0, and then it runs some Fuse OS, which is Android, and then OpenGL 4.4.
3913120	3916120	Which looks a lot like the Sony crossbar, if you've seen the pictures.
3916120	3931120	Exactly. But think about this, though. This is a $140 console that basically runs games that are graphically similar to an Xbox 360 or even a Wii U, which is pretty impressive.
3932120	3942120	It'll be interesting to see what happens, especially what this is going to do for gaming in China, because we look at this and go, okay, well, this is a bunch of kind of last-gen games for the most part.
3942120	3947120	I mean, there's some current stuff in there, especially Mighty No. 9 and stuff, but nothing that's really pushing the envelope and so forth.
3948120	3953120	But you have to remember, China is a very big place. There's a lot of people in China.
3954120	3960120	And, you know, they just lifted that whole ban on making consoles in the first place. Like, what? Not even two years ago.
3961120	3965120	What do you think? Most of these consoles are manufactured anyways. I mean, a lot of this stuff comes from China and Hong Kong.
3965120	3972120	Yeah, but you couldn't sell them within the country for a long time. So now you can. So it's going to be very, very, very interesting to see, like, what this does.
3973120	3982120	I mean, this, I feel like a lot of people are just kind of writing this off as, oh, this console, you know, something we'll never see here, and it looks like it's shit anyway compared to what we have.
3983120	3987120	But hold up, because as gaming continues to grow in China, it could be very interesting.
3987120	3996120	Let's put it this way. The lineup of titles that they're talking about coming to it right now is already more impressive than what the Ouya had with several million dollars worth of funding.
3997120	4004120	I mean, it sounds like these guys are at least, you know, more on board with that. And I guess the leaked version of the console, which has the larger hard drive and everything, is like $230.
4005120	4008120	But that's still not bad. It's still cheaper than you can get a Wii U for.
4008120	4018120	I wonder if that's something people over here will try to get just to have. I mean, I don't know, because again, the games are all kind of things you can play other places anyway.
4019120	4023120	But I'd be very curious to see, like, what maybe kind of exclusives they get and if they're any good.
4024120	4025120	Well, Red Ash, I mean, that's...
4026120	4027120	Yeah, but we're going to see that here.
4028120	4029120	I don't think we... I don't know if we are.
4030120	4031120	Nothing's been said so far.
4032120	4037120	When the Kickstarter ended, it got funded for the base consoles. We'll see it. We're going to see Red Ash here. Believe it.
4038120	4039120	I mean...
4040120	4041120	Am I going to believe it like I'm going to see Mighty No. 9 here?
4042120	4044120	It might be six years from now, but you'll see it eventually.
4045120	4051120	Alright, we got one more story for you guys here and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
4052120	4055120	This is about a modern classic, however, and I think Dark Sakura would agree.
4056120	4063120	Mass Effect. Mass Effect Andromeda, in fact. More information, a little bit more, out this week about what to expect at E3.
4063120	4068120	And yes, you will get an update on Mass Effect Andromeda at EA's press conference this year.
4069120	4074120	In fact, many people kind of fully expecting this is the full fucking reveal this year.
4075120	4078120	You're going to see the gameplay footage. You're going to get everything this year.
4079120	4083120	Kind of similar to a couple years ago when they first showed Dragon Age Inquisition, right? And then it came out that holiday.
4084120	4088120	Well, unfortunately, Mass Effect Andromeda also confirmed this week it's not going to be a holiday.
4089120	4090120	It's going to be 2017.
4090120	4093120	CFO Blake Jorgensen said to investors,
4094120	4098120	As we've been playing the game in the studio recently, it's showing us that we're taking the game in the right direction.
4099120	4103120	But we also know we need the right amount of time to make sure we deliver everything the game can be and should be.
4104120	4110120	That's our commitment from all of us to all of you. Because of that, Mass Effect Andromeda will now ship in early 2017.
4111120	4112120	Thank. God.
4113120	4114120	Yeah, don't rush it.
4115120	4116120	Seriously, I want a good game. I don't want a rushed piece of crap.
4116120	4119120	Even if that's now going to be, what, how many years since Mass Effect 3?
4120120	4122120	I still don't care if it's going to be worth it.
4123120	4125120	Mass Effect 3 came out in March, I think.
4126120	4131120	Yeah, and it came out in the March window as well. It'll be fine. I'm not really worried about the timeframe.
4132120	4135120	And if that's what they need to make it right, then I will shut up.
4136120	4140120	So, there you go. Excited to see more of that at E3, except that I'm not going.
4141120	4144120	But I wouldn't really have to go to E3 anyway. I just have to go to the EA Play event.
4144120	4149120	Which, I'm assuming they're going to have some type of playable little thing there.
4150120	4152120	I mean, that's a huge assumption, but why wouldn't they?
4153120	4154120	Especially if multiplayer is going to be back.
4155120	4159120	I would think a great thing to show at E3, or this EA event, would be the multiplayer.
4160120	4162120	And just let people play that a little bit to get a little bit of the action.
4163120	4164120	We'll see.
4165120	4168120	Anyhow, let's travel back to a time when things were a little bit simpler.
4168120	4179120	Every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you little shits, you should be playing this instead.
4180120	4187120	This is a very interesting pick this week. Remember, the rule for what a classic game should be is it has to be at least ten years old or more.
4188120	4194120	And this is one that is ten years old or more. But it's one that is kind of still a thing for a lot of people, right?
4195120	4197120	I balanced on the technicality.
4198120	4201120	Fair enough. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4202120	4203120	Classic game of the week is World of Warcraft.
4205120	4207120	How could you pick World of Warcraft?
4208120	4209120	Because it's all this shit.
4210120	4211120	It kind of is, though.
4212120	4213120	And I did find the first sign-in music.
4214120	4215120	Yeah.
4216120	4217120	So that was pretty cool.
4217120	4222120	It was a game that took me a long time to finally get into because I've played for every expansion, remember?
4223120	4224120	And then I quit.
4225120	4226120	And then I'd get the next expansion and then I'd quit.
4227120	4234120	And finally I really liked it around Cataclysm and have several 85s and then I quit after Pandas.
4235120	4236120	Fucking Pandas.
4237120	4238120	I still have a level 90.
4238120	4247120	But World of Warcraft is an MMORPG that was released in 2004 by Blizzard, now owned by Activision.
4248120	4254120	It was a pretty much direct sequel to Warcraft III, The Frozen Throne.
4257120	4261120	And it was set about four years after the events of that game.
4262120	4267120	It is pretty much still an entity.
4268120	4275120	We make fun of it for still existing and I may have called you an addict for years and years.
4276120	4279120	But the people who love it really love it.
4280120	4282120	And it took me a while and I really loved it.
4283120	4286120	In fact, I'm actually considering quitting Final Fantasy XIV to go back to it.
4287120	4288120	Just because it's been so long.
4288120	4294120	And I have a bajillion friends that play, but every time I log into Final Fantasy XIV, no one's freaking on.
4295120	4304120	And pretty much you get the opportunity, I think in the vanilla version you had humans.
4305120	4315120	On the Alliance side you had humans, dwarves, elves, night elves, and gnomes.
4316120	4317120	Just the four, right?
4318120	4319120	I don't think so.
4320120	4326120	And then on the Horde side you had orcs, you had trolls, you had...
4327120	4328120	Taurens.
4329120	4331120	Taurens, yeah. Remember I had cowgirl for a while?
4332120	4333120	Yes.
4334120	4335120	Undead, that's right.
4336120	4340120	I kept thinking of the goblins as the counterpart to the gnomes.
4341120	4342120	Yeah, some of that came later.
4343120	4344120	Yeah, blood elves.
4345120	4346120	The pretty ones.
4346120	4347120	We had our twinsie blood elves.
4348120	4349120	I do.
4350120	4351120	That was great.
4352120	4353120	Rob, you should rejoin with me if I do it.
4354120	4355120	One MMO a few months.
4356120	4357120	I tried World of Warcraft already.
4358120	4359120	I wasn't really interested in going back.
4360120	4361120	I mean, there's some cool people playing, but I'll see them on Twitter.
4362120	4363120	Yeah, I'm still deciding.
4364120	4365120	I haven't done anything yet.
4366120	4367120	But you have all kinds of different play modes as well.
4368120	4370120	You have normal questing and doing stuff.
4371120	4372120	And you've got your roleplay server still.
4373120	4374120	Some of them.
4374120	4375120	You have PvP, player versus player.
4377120	4379120	You have all kinds of different stuff you can do.
4380120	4381120	You can travel around.
4382120	4384120	There's plenty of hidden, really weird shit in the game.
4385120	4389120	Like if you follow the children into the village where they stand in a pentagram
4390120	4391120	and then they run off and weird things play.
4392120	4395120	All kinds of neat little Easter eggs in there.
4396120	4399120	And even for people who are clip masters, you can find content
4400120	4403120	and complete dungeons and everything and explore them.
4404120	4405120	A lot of that's up on YouTube.
4406120	4411120	And then you have your holiday things like Children's Week and Halloween and all that.
4412120	4414120	And there's an auction house.
4415120	4416120	It's just World of Warcraft.
4417120	4418120	I mean, if you don't know what it is by now, then...
4423120	4425120	But it's been an ongoing story.
4426120	4427120	I really like the lore for it.
4428120	4429120	I couldn't get into the turn-based strategies, but this was pretty fun for me.
4430120	4432120	And it's still pretty much going strong.
4432120	4441120	We've maybe lost some subscribers, but it is still, I think, have the Guinness World Record for it.
4442120	4444120	It's still the biggest MMO out there, even to this day.
4445120	4449120	I see some folks in the chat going, you know, WoW's not a classic.
4450120	4451120	Hold up. Hold up.
4452120	4455120	Because WoW kind of changed it all for MMOs.
4456120	4457120	There's been nothing like World of Warcraft.
4457120	4462120	I would even argue World of Warcraft was probably one of the most impactful games.
4463120	4465120	I felt like we talked about this at the end of the last decade.
4466120	4472120	I feel like between Xbox Live and World of Warcraft, those are two of the biggest things in gaming in the past decade.
4473120	4477120	That's why I picked it as a classic, especially since we've got the movie coming out.
4478120	4480120	Yeah, it's timely, the movie and the expansion.
4481120	4487120	But I think that it's just, yeah, it's still being updated and kept new and everything.
4488120	4496120	But if you look at when it came out, and the fact that it's a 12-fucking-year-old game, and a million people are still playing it.
4497120	4498120	More than a million.
4499120	4500120	I know what you mean. Lots.
4501120	4504120	Millions are playing it. That has to count for something.
4504120	4509120	I think it would be the same as if I had mentioned Lineage or EverQuest.
4510120	4513120	But I think that World of Warcraft has actually surpassed them.
4514120	4519120	It depends on what you're into, but I think on a commercial level, for sure.
4520120	4524120	But also, something to consider is how did the game make it for 12 years?
4525120	4529120	It's basically innovated itself every few years by adding new features and things of that sort.
4529120	4534120	And you look at, you know, classic World of Warcraft is not the same game that it is today.
4535120	4538120	So in some ways, when you look back at Vanilla Warcraft, yeah, it is a different game.
4539120	4544120	In fact, and this is also timely because you have a lot of people talking about, we miss Vanilla WoW.
4545120	4546120	Remember that pirate server that got shut down recently?
4547120	4551120	Now there's all these people that are hammering the blizzard about, bring that back.
4552120	4557120	We want vanilla servers. We want to play the game like it was in 2004 when it first came out.
4557120	4566120	Because that game will never exist again otherwise, even though I kind of go, it wasn't as good as it is now.
4567120	4568120	I mean, the game gets better, I think.
4569120	4570120	People beg to differ though. It's all that we like.
4571120	4576120	And it's that certain retro charm. I get it. Why do we go back and play Atari 2600 games?
4577120	4579120	Well, it's the same reason why I go back and play Ragnarok Online.
4580120	4585120	You know, I love freaking Ragnarok Online. I'd even say that that is my favorite MMO of all time.
4585120	4590120	But I really do like World of Warcraft enough to consider going back to it.
4591120	4596120	Even against my, you know, husband's desires because he just doesn't want me to play any of them.
4597120	4598120	But still.
4599120	4602120	AkumaJP with a good point in our chat room, can't play in Japan.
4603120	4607120	Yeah, somehow World of Warcraft, for some reason, never crossed over to Japan.
4608120	4610120	It went to China, but it never went to Japan.
4610120	4615120	It went to, I mean, obviously it's been in Europe. I'm trying to think of other Asian countries it's been to.
4616120	4619120	But yeah, somehow it always skipped Japan.
4620120	4626120	I think it really did just innovate and bring something new.
4627120	4633120	And really, I think, also introduced a wider market into the concept of an MMORPG.
4634120	4636120	It really did break a lot of ground.
4636120	4645120	And even if, you know, you've never touched a video game, most people, when you say World of Warcraft, they go, oh, that's that time sink game, right?
4646120	4647120	So, just saying.
4648120	4653120	Yeah. And even though, you know, you guys know I kind of prefer Final Fantasy XIV these days.
4654120	4656120	You know, Final Fantasy XIV owes a lot to World of Warcraft.
4657120	4661120	In fact, even the producer of Final Fantasy XIV has said that some of the influence came from World of Warcraft.
4661120	4669120	And when they re, after the horrible fucking 1.0 Final Fantasy XIV, the idea to nuke the world, yeah, did come from cataclysm.
4670120	4674120	And kind of showed that, you know, you can push the reset button on a living world like that.
4675120	4677120	And for the better, thank God.
4678120	4679120	So, anyhow.
4680120	4684120	Even though I think Final Fantasy XIV now innovates in ways that World of Warcraft should.
4685120	4687120	But that's the fun thing about competition now.
4687120	4693120	Well, maybe later tonight, if someone is going to be awake after I've cheesecaked, we might have to play some XIV.
4694120	4695120	We'll see. I should, I should.
4696120	4697120	Vince me why I should stay.
4698120	4699120	I should be around.
4700120	4701120	Alright. Anyhow.
4702120	4706120	I think I am right and I'm standing by my decision and y'all don't judge me because this is our show and not yours.
4707120	4708120	I couldn't help that.
4709120	4712120	Well, no, and I don't think you need to defend that World of Warcraft is not a classic game.
4713120	4714120	It's ludicrous.
4715120	4716120	It's ludicrous to say it's not.
4717120	4720120	I honestly believe, in my opinion, it's ludicrous to say that World of Warcraft is not a classic game.
4721120	4722120	It's more of a classic than fucking Halo.
4723120	4725120	Well, now I don't know if I go that far.
4728120	4730120	Fucking more of a classic than Halo.
4731120	4732120	Halo is never.
4733120	4743120	If Halo is going to be on the Sam show, someone in this room who does not have a vagina is going to be the one putting it on the list.
4744120	4745120	Hey, she said if.
4745120	4756120	I said, if I, who is the queen of classic game of the week, I will not choose Halo.
4757120	4758120	I would, I, you know, what's funny.
4759120	4769120	I don't know if I would necessarily pick Halo before I would pick Halo 2 anyway, because I think Halo 2 was the real one that kind of innovative, especially for Xbox Live and everything.
4770120	4771120	She's starting to give a little bit, you guys.
4772120	4773120	That doesn't mean, no, no, no.
4774120	4775120	I can say something.
4776120	4777120	All right, girl.
4778120	4779120	Where's the fan?
4781120	4782120	All right, you ready for this?
4783120	4784120	Yes.
4785120	4789120	I never once said that Halo is not a good game.
4790120	4795120	I never once said that it doesn't deserve recognition.
4796120	4800120	I just said that I'm a stubborn bitch and I'm never going to put it on the list.
4803120	4811120	And Bobby says, for the record, I think World of Warcraft is a totally acceptable classic game.
4812120	4814120	I also think that EverQuest would be a good candidate as well.
4815120	4820120	I almost did EverQuest, but I figured I would do World of Warcraft given that the movie's going to be out whenever.
4821120	4822120	A lot of people are talking about it right now.
4823120	4829120	But I also am considering Lineage and I think I've done Ragnarok online though.
4829120	4839120	But yeah, I've got my eyes on those other two, so probably you'll see them come up in a future classic game.
4840120	4841120	All right, fair enough.
4842120	4843120	But not Halo.
4844120	4845120	All right. We are going to take a break though, you guys.
4846120	4850120	We're going to take a rest and stuff and relax our voices, get some water and all that good stuff.
4851120	4858120	But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come, including rapid fire news as well as we're going to get into the mailbag.
4859120	4864120	Your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4865120	4870120	We will get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4870120	4889120	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on this May the 15th of 2016 with episode number 641 of our show in progress.
4890120	4891120	Thank you very much, by the way, DarkSakura.
4892120	4896120	She gave me her fortune cookie with her meal because I guess for whatever reason she doesn't want to eat the cookie.
4896120	4903120	So I actually read the fortune here, DarkSakura. It says, happy events will take place in your home.
4904120	4905120	Aw, like this show.
4906120	4907120	Exactly.
4908120	4913120	Of course, if you were to add embed to that, happy events will take place in your home in bed.
4914120	4917120	Happy endings will take place in your home in bed.
4918120	4919120	Let's hope.
4920120	4926120	Anyway, by the way, also, I kind of failed tonight because I forgot to do a FUGO Question of the Week.
4927120	4929120	I know, God, I'm sorry guys, I've been slacking.
4930120	4932120	We will do some Ask Orange Lounge tonight instead.
4933120	4936120	So if you want to send a question for Ask Orange Lounge, since I forgot to ask you, you can ask us.
4937120	4940120	It's cool if it's gaming related, but if it's not, that's alright too.
4941120	4944120	So you can ask Orange Lounge right now while we do these rapid fire questions.
4945120	4946120	I put the instructions there in our live chat.
4946120	4949120	You can also tweet them to us at OLR. I have the Twitters up.
4950120	4955120	So if messaging us in chat is too damn hard, you can tweet us at OLR right now.
4957120	4963120	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Africa.
4964120	4967120	While we wait for those questions to come in, let's do some rapid fire news.
4968120	4972120	Alright, so this is cool if you're still in the market for a 2DS or a 3DS.
4972120	4978120	Instead of 2DS, they have dropped the price, or they will be next week, to $79.99.
4979120	4981120	Actually, it's already been dropped in certain locations like today at Toys R Us.
4982120	4985120	It was actually less than that. It was $60 something, $68.
4986120	4988120	So, keeping an eye out for that.
4989120	4992120	I almost purchased one, but then I didn't.
4993120	4997120	Because, I don't know. I don't need it.
4998120	5000120	There's a new Dead Island game coming out.
5001120	5005120	And it's kind of a throwback, a retro game.
5006120	5008120	It's a Dead Island Retro Revenge.
5009120	5011120	It's a 16-bit style beat-em-up.
5012120	5015120	And it will be a part of the Dead Island Definitive Collection.
5016120	5024120	And you can purchase both games in the collection digitally for $19.99 or $39.99 for the retail price.
5024120	5027120	And, yeah. That's pretty cool.
5028120	5030120	So, I guess check it out when it comes out.
5031120	5032120	May 31st.
5033120	5036120	And then, Grand Theft Auto Online is getting some more updates.
5037120	5042120	I think they've kind of taken note that a lot of people like to make really crazy racetracks in that game.
5043120	5045120	Doing all sorts of stunt jumps and that type of thing.
5046120	5051120	So, the newest set that they're including a lot of stunt driving options.
5051120	5055120	Different vehicles, gear, and different props for creators.
5056120	5061120	Including, like they have in this picture here, these giant metal tube cage things.
5062120	5065120	That you could basically create this giant tube that you could drive through.
5066120	5067120	Which looks all sorts of awesome.
5068120	5074120	So, I really do need to go back and play some more Grand Theft Auto Online since it's been years since I've done that.
5075120	5079120	And I haven't really done much in Grand Theft Auto 5 on my PlayStation 4.
5079120	5080120	I need to go back.
5082120	5084120	Is this a reason enough to go back for you?
5085120	5086120	Yeah, actually I think it'd be pretty fun.
5087120	5091120	The problem is a lot of the friends, a lot of the people I used to play with that were like,
5092120	5095120	Oh yeah, we're totally gonna play all the time.
5096120	5097120	They just don't.
5098120	5101120	So, I just need to go back and try it.
5102120	5105120	Alright. Well, moving on to something a little less violent.
5105120	5110120	Minecraft is, believe it or not, celebrating its four year anniversary on consoles.
5111120	5115120	Microsoft and Mojang did some birthday DLC to celebrate.
5116120	5118120	There's a new skin pack out to celebrate the birthday.
5119120	5120120	It looks very bright.
5121120	5122120	So you can check that out.
5123120	5127120	And all of the previous skin birthday pack bundles are also available now for a limited time.
5128120	5130120	This is on Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
5131120	5134120	You can download all four of them through tomorrow.
5135120	5138120	But if you haven't gotten on that, you might want to hurry up and get on that.
5139120	5140120	You have through May 16th or tomorrow.
5141120	5144120	Which is probably today for many of you folks listening on the podcast.
5145120	5149120	Also, Minecraft on the Wii U also getting a pretty big update.
5150120	5152120	And yeah, the Super Mario Mashup Pack.
5153120	5154120	It's happening. That's right.
5155120	5160120	Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess, now gonna be characters in Minecraft.
5161120	5163120	And get this, it's a free update.
5163120	5167120	So they're really trying to make Minecraft Wii U something you want to check out.
5168120	5170120	Even though it's been four years since Microsoft came out on other consoles.
5171120	5173120	My son is totally stoked about that DLC.
5174120	5176120	I told him about it, I'm like, you're gonna like this.
5177120	5179120	He's like, oh, can I play it now? Can I play it now? No.
5180120	5185120	Fifteen pieces of Super Mario music, item textures, forty skins,
5186120	5190120	and a pre-made, I guess, Mushroom Kingdom world is gonna be there.
5190120	5194120	They say the inspiration comes from Super Mario World, Super Mario 64,
5195120	5197120	and yes, even Super Mario Sunshine.
5198120	5202120	You can get a retail version June 17th for $29.99,
5203120	5206120	and that includes the Super Mario Mashup content.
5207120	5210120	The eShop game, by the way, will set you back $29.99,
5211120	5214120	which I swear is more expensive than Minecraft on other consoles, am I right?
5215120	5216120	I think so.
5217120	5218120	That's the Nintendo premium.
5218120	5221120	No, that's $29.99 is what it normally goes for.
5222120	5223120	Alright, fair enough.
5224120	5228120	Citizens of Earth is a game that has also now been delisted from the Nintendo 3DS eShop.
5229120	5230120	Oh, it's in that bundle too.
5231120	5233120	It was, it was just in that Nintendo Humble Bundle,
5234120	5235120	but now it is unavailable for purchase.
5236120	5238120	Now, here's the thing, it's temporary, it's not permanent.
5239120	5241120	This is similar to why VVVVV was removed recently,
5242120	5247120	because there is an exploit in the game which will let hackers run unsigned code on the 3DS,
5248120	5249120	God forbid we let them do that,
5250120	5254120	which is pretty hilarious considering this game just was in that bundle.
5255120	5256120	However, this was also the game where you got to pick,
5257120	5259120	you could get it on the 3DS or the Wii U.
5260120	5266120	You didn't get both, so hopefully you opted for the 3DS if you like to run unsigned code.
5267120	5270120	The demo, also unavailable on the 3DS,
5271120	5274120	so no word yet when they're going to be back up, but I would think soon.
5275120	5277120	But if you did get these as part of the bundle, you're not affected.
5278120	5279120	You just can't buy them yet.
5280120	5285120	Music game fans, I'm sure, are excited to hear that DJ Max is going to get a new title coming out.
5286120	5289120	It's coming out for the PlayStation 4 in January 2017,
5290120	5292120	according to NeoWiz and developer Rocky Studios.
5293120	5294120	It is DJ Max Respect.
5295120	5296120	There will be a local two-player mode.
5297120	5299120	You're going to be able to play online against other players, that's pretty cool.
5300120	5302120	And I guess the track list is kind of like a greatest hits thing.
5302120	5308120	DJ Max Portable 1 and 2 and 3 and Clasiquy and Black Square, Technica and Technica 3.
5309120	5315120	So I'm assuming this is kind of a way to reintroduce DJ Max to people that may have missed it.
5316120	5323120	I know that Technica was out on the Vita and stuff, but it kind of came and went.
5324120	5327120	If you weren't really looking for music games, I don't know if you ever saw it.
5328120	5330120	So hopefully they're going to give this one a little more exposure.
5330120	5332120	I'm actually looking forward to this.
5333120	5337120	As a music game fan, and especially I like BeatMania 2DX,
5338120	5340120	and I feel like this is the closest thing we're ever going to get,
5341120	5343120	even though it's not going to have a BeatMania controller.
5344120	5346120	You use the controller to do it instead.
5347120	5348120	I think it'll work okay. So I'm looking forward to it.
5349120	5352120	So check that out. DJ Max Respect coming in January,
5353120	5355120	which is not the greatest time to release a new game,
5356120	5358120	but we'll see how that strategy plays out for him.
5358120	5359120	Dark Sakura.
5360120	5363120	Well Sega is doing a little bit of investigation.
5364120	5368120	They are looking into seeing if they are going to do Shenmue remasters.
5369120	5375120	They put out a fan inquiry from Sega Europe saying that it's something that the company would like to do,
5376120	5377120	but it's not a simple process.
5378120	5383120	So they're looking into it, and of course Shenmue 3 is currently in development by Eastnet,
5383120	5385120	which is Yu Suzuki's studio.
5386120	5388120	So hey, that'd be pretty cool.
5389120	5391120	There's also found footage now.
5392120	5395120	It's from a group that I really like, which is Unseen 64.
5396120	5398120	I think it's the same people who have to do Beta64.
5401120	5407120	A cancelled Akira game that was supposed to be on one of the 16-bit systems.
5408120	5412120	It looks like both Genesis and SNES.
5413120	5419120	So, I mean it would have been cool, but I'm looking at the intro of it right now,
5420120	5424120	but there's like, yeah, the footage is basically from some kind of trade show.
5425120	5428120	Although some of this I have to say, just with cutscenes and whatnot,
5429120	5431120	kind of reminds me of TurboGrafx. You know, PC Engine stuff.
5432120	5435120	Oh well. Looks like it was a neat little platformer.
5436120	5442120	And then, last but not least, something I'm kind of excited about is the World of Warcraft cookbook.
5443120	5445120	And it actually, I did find it on Amazon today.
5446120	5450120	It says it's supposed to be released in October, but the Amazon pre-orders are up.
5451120	5455120	And there are some pretty neat recipes in there.
5457120	5462120	There's a variation of bear claws called Rylak claws,
5462120	5465120	which are basically, you know, cinnamon buns in the shape of claws.
5466120	5474120	There is a cherry grog, which basically, it's a sangria, but it looks pretty yummy.
5475120	5476120	You know, all kinds of different stuff on there.
5477120	5483120	Even a complete roast and several casseroles and a really good chili.
5484120	5489120	So, I think I might actually end up buying that one because I could use some new ideas for cooking.
5489120	5497120	Yes, and I will happily volunteer to eat all the food that you cook, provided that it's safe.
5498120	5509120	Alright, well, let's get to it. We didn't get a ton of questions for this, but we got enough to do a little segment here for Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
5509120	5521120	Since I failed in doing a Fugu Question of the Week, instead we will provide answers to your questions.
5522120	5523120	You also failed with playing the music too.
5524120	5526120	In this segment, maybe I changed it.
5527120	5535120	Alright, let's get to it. If you still want to send one, because I see Dark Tetsuya going, oh dang, I just had one, hurry up and get it in.
5536120	5537120	We still got time because I only have a couple questions here.
5537120	5545120	Let's get to it. Tonight from Stupi, Stoppi, not Stupi, Stoppi, two P's.
5546120	5552120	Stoppi asked our first question tonight saying, what do you think about fans wanting a new Crash game?
5553120	5559120	I think the fact that they want a return of Crash is a sign that reboots have gone too far and need to stop already.
5559120	5566120	What's next? Hashtag bring back Bubsy? Well didn't the Bubsy thing already happen?
5567120	5572120	And that turned out to be that it actually was in no way official and like a big scam sort of thing?
5573120	5574120	I don't know.
5575120	5577120	It was a mess. So be careful what you wish for, Stoppi.
5578120	5588120	As far as Crash goes, see, I don't know. Early in the show, at the beginning of the show, I talked about Doom, which in some ways is a relaunch of an old franchise.
5589120	5593120	It's kind of good. I'm enjoying it more than I enjoy Doom 3, to be quite honest.
5594120	5603120	So I don't necessarily think that all reboots are bad. And I think Crash Bandicoot is one of those platformers, like if you were playing in the PlayStation era, you remember Crash Bandicoot.
5604120	5607120	And so I think there's people that would really like to see what that would turn into now.
5608120	5614120	I just, at the same time, I also understand that innovating new IPs is a great thing too.
5615120	5618120	And that's how you get things like Splatoon. So it's a difficult little line to walk.
5619120	5630120	But I really would mind, like if they came out and announced at E3 that we're going to do a new Crash Bandicoot game and all the rumors are true, he's back, here it is, I would check it out for sure.
5631120	5634120	I'd be into that. Because I love the Crash Bandicoot games on the original PlayStation.
5635120	5637120	What about you guys? Loki, Dark Soccer, would you be into a Crash reboot?
5638120	5639120	I never played the first one.
5640120	5641120	Really? Yeah, I wasn't really a fan of Crash Bandicoot.
5642120	5643120	Wow. So I don't really care.
5644120	5648120	Alright. I'm sure people want it. Good for them. I hope you get your reboot someday.
5649120	5655120	Someone in chat says, bring back Jak and Dexter in Spyro the Dragon. Isn't Skylanders kind of a Spyro the Dragon spinoff?
5656120	5658120	Yeah, Skylanders is the continuation of the Spyro story.
5659120	5664120	I mean, it's kind of, you know, another universe. But I mean, it's what it is.
5665120	5668120	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying the Crash remake is Frog Fractions 2.
5669120	5673120	Whatever happened to Frog Fractions 2? Where is it?
5674120	5675120	I think we've asked this last week.
5676120	5677120	That frog now rides a unicycle.
5677120	5679120	Maybe that's the joke all along. Who knows?
5680120	5693120	William Murderface asks Orange Lounge Tonight, we have seen the RTS, the FPS, and no, the MOBA experience long periods of extreme success over the last 16 years.
5694120	5700120	What do you think the next genre is that will experience such a sudden and robust burst of popularity?
5701120	5705120	Well, shit, if I knew that, I'm going to be a fucking millionaire because I'm going to make that game.
5705120	5712120	This is the twerk controller. You have to control it with your ass and the faster that you twerk, the further your car goes along.
5713120	5714120	Twerk Racer! There we go.
5715120	5721120	I was going to make the easy joke, well, whatever brings us one step closer to the holodeck because that's what gaming is, right?
5722120	5733120	But that leaves the easy answer to be VR. So my thought is maybe there's something in the VR space that can't be done in the regular space.
5733120	5742120	And that's going to be the next big genre of gaming. I know that's a really vague answer, but again, if I knew the answer, I'm going to go make that game and make a ton of money.
5743120	5748120	You can't really just create new genres. I don't know about that.
5749120	5751120	Well, I mean, it's hard to come up with something completely different.
5751120	5759120	It's hard, but you can do it. I mean, the MOBA came from somewhere, right? MOBAs came from the Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3.
5760120	5769120	So they haven't been around since the dawn of time. There's no MOBAs on Atari 2600. So the genre got invented at some point. It's just, yeah, who knows where it's going to come from, right?
5770120	5771120	Combat was the first MOBA.
5771120	5785120	Combat. Do you want to be the blue tank or the red tank? Let's see. William Ritterface potentially suggesting you can have existing genres experience sudden popularity booms.
5786120	5794120	So, okay. So like maybe there's an existing genre that will suddenly get lifted up. Well, you know, our hearts are going to say music games. They're going to make a comeback.
5794120	5803120	They're going to make a comeback. They're going to, they're going to make that DJ Max will do it y'all. I don't know. I don't know. I wish. I hope. Maybe in VR.
5804120	5819120	Um, I don't know. I just don't see anything really changing anytime soon. They've tried a lot of things and there are things that like last for a few years, like the whole Toys Life stuff, but like eventually it just kind of goes away.
5819120	5830120	So, you know, I think we're going to get a lot of those different gimmicky types of gameplay, but I don't really know what exactly is going to be just there.
5831120	5841120	I don't know. Um, okay. Let's see. How about like more kind of, uh, you know, interaction with your phone.
5841120	5857120	So basically a lot of those games, like just dance, like all the Jackbox games are basically your phone is the controller. You know, you're able to just, you know, just load up the game on your TV and all your friends in the house can play because they have phones or something.
5858120	5867120	I don't know exactly how you would, you know, narrow that down to a genre. Maybe that'll take off more party games, I guess. Yeah. All right. Fair enough. Phone enabled party games. How about that?
5868120	5879120	All right. Jackbox is onto something a little early. All right. Uh, last question here from dark Tetsuya. So I was planning a best hits three, and I think that means a compilation of great OLR moments from the past.
5880120	5891120	Um, I'm just missing episode 169 for one more clip and I seem to recall it aired on VOG sometime ago. Maybe you can hook a brother up, um, for you, of course, if I, if I have it in my archive somewhere.
5891120	5903120	Uh, 169 sounds like around the time we would have been airing the repeats on DDR freak, which happened for a very short time. You guys might not remember, but OLR was on DDR freak radio.
5904120	5917120	Like in repeats, I think it was like probably a year or two before the, the all games thing. And one didn't have anything to do with the other. It's just DDR freak kind of closed at one point or they closed DDR freak radio at some point.
5918120	5927120	Probably. I think when we got off live 365, they got off like 365. I think is what happened. I think that's a, that was the whole deal. How is live 365 doing nowadays?
5928120	5936120	Actually, you know what? It's fucking funny. You ain't, well, not funny, but it's interesting. You asked that because I was curious about that same question. They closed this year.
5936120	5951120	They are gone as of, I think January 31st was their last day running. So life is five ended. Uh, yeah. So it was kind of, I, I remember making a tweet about it going, wow, I just found out like three weeks after the fact that life is five is done.
5952120	5968120	Um, in fact, I know, uh, there's a lot of websites out there that sell like radio streaming stuff, um, that are actually catering to former live 365 broadcasters saying, Hey, come host your stuff with us and all that. So life is five went away.
5968120	5980120	Um, and I don't know all the reasons that went into it, but you know, it's just, I guess with all the laws and everything, it got too expensive to do things the way they wanted to do them. So there you go.
5981120	6002120	Uh, all right. Let's see, uh, dark Tetsuya in chat says that was the last episode before you guys switched to the podcast and discontinued the to go technically. Was it really? 169 was that episode. So that would have been the one cause it wasn't, wasn't that the last time mistress Tia was here on the show before she moved to New York.
6002120	6016120	I almost positive. It was, I feel like she was on the very, very last show, uh, before we merged the live show and the podcast and all that. Ah, the history of orange lounge radio. At one point we were doing a three hour live show and a one hour podcast.
6016120	6028120	So if you weren't here for the three hour live show, you didn't hear it, but anybody could hear the podcast. But then suddenly we all kind of sat here going, you know, four hours is a long time to be here.
6029120	6043120	So we changed things a little bit and I think it worked out all right. Anyway, thank you for the questions tonight. Appreciate that. And I apologize for failing on the football question. Uh, but you know, ask orange lounge is fun to do once in a while too. Let's get back into some more news. Loki.
6044120	6065120	All right. So there's some, it's another week. So you know what that means? More NX rumors. Yay. So this week we have that the rumor that the NX is not going to be using x 86 architecture and that, um, if you're expecting the graphics to be blowing away the PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6066120	6083120	Yeah, that's not going to be the case. So, you know, what they're saying is that it might be, you know, graphics wise, it might be a little bit closer to like the Xbox one instead of the PlayStation four. Um, but it's not going to be anything like, you know, two times as powerful as the PlayStation four or anything like that.
6083120	6095120	There's basically the NX has a very, like a custom made chip. The overall design is very modern. Um, it's not going to be, you know, based off of like the Polaris chip or Polaris architecture.
6097120	6109120	And you know, basically, you know, um, everything that, you know, this person's heard Emily Rogers is indicates that the NX isn't going to blow away any of the consoles on the market today, except for the Wii U.
6109120	6138120	Well, that's a little bit of a disappointment, but whatever. I'm so sick of NX rumors. Show me the fucking console already. I don't like, I don't know. I just, I hear NX rumors. No, no offense to you, Loki. It's just, just in general on the internet, on Twitter, I hear NX rumors and my eyes just kind of glaze over and I'm just like, the other thing, the other rumor I had, which wasn't necessarily a part of that story, but I was gonna bring it up later anyway. So I just figured this right about the same time. Um, this is coming from, let's see here.
6140120	6164120	Uh, Kimishima and basically saying that, you know, the NX, it's not going to be a successor to the Wii U nor the 3DS. It's going to be something different. And basically saying that since it's neither a successor to the Wii or 3DS, it's a new way of playing games, which I think will have a larger impact than the Wii U, but I don't feel that it's a pure replacement for the Wii U.
6165120	6179120	I don't know what that means. Once again, we still don't know what the hell this is. And I think they really should come out and say what it is because right now we are having all these like crazy expectations and then they're going to reveal it and it's gonna be like, oh.
6179120	6199120	Well, gamers start now, set that bar really low. That way, when this is announced, it can exceed your expectations. So I'm just gonna tell y'all, set the bar low. So maybe I am okay with rumors that, well guys, the chipset in it isn't very good. That way the bar is set pretty low.
6200120	6216120	And even still, I mean, you know, look at like the Wii U and how they, you know, first showed off. Hey, we've got this like tech demo that's gonna show you the equivalent, you know, of the graphics that you're gonna see on the Wii U with Zelda and is like, no, we never really saw that.
6217120	6227120	I love this. Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says, I remember when they said the DS was not a successor to the Game Boy. Yet it was fully backwards compatible with Game Boy games.
6227120	6236120	You can play Game Boy games, yes. So just props to Nintendo for at least being backwards compatible for the previous generation. So I will give them that.
6237120	6245120	Well, except for GameCube, of course, obviously I didn't play Nintendo 64 controllers or, you know, cartridges, but so far they've been not bad.
6246120	6254120	Tigerclaw in chat says, what can Nintendo possibly do that hasn't been done already? Have sex with me.
6254120	6261120	I don't know. They had, what can they possibly do that hasn't been done already? They did that with the Wii, so I think there's lots that they can do.
6262120	6268120	Well, but even with the Wii, it wasn't necessarily that motion gaming had never been done. It just had never been done well or on that level.
6269120	6272120	And to be honest, it did it okay. I mean, it wasn't great.
6273120	6279120	Which is why I was afraid that the NX might have been virtual reality at first. I don't think it is at this point.
6280120	6287120	But, you know, when these, you know, when the hype first started, that's why I was kind of like, I wonder if they're going to try and get into VR things since this is where everybody else is.
6288120	6292120	And yeah, go ahead and make all the Virtual Boy jokes you want, but it's different now. It's different now.
6293120	6294120	I think it could be pretty cool if they did that.
6295120	6296120	Yeah.
6297120	6299120	I mean, who wouldn't want to see Nintendo games in VR?
6299120	6301120	Ooh, depend on the Nintendo game, but yeah.
6302120	6307120	It would be, but like, imagine if like their controller wasn't like just a normal controller, but I'm not saying like a power glove.
6308120	6314120	I can't wait for them to put F-Zero in VR so I can just throw up every projectile vomit everywhere because that's what would happen.
6315120	6316120	Oh, you can play that in VR now.
6317120	6320120	I know, and I have, and I've been like, okay, this might be a bit too fast.
6321120	6322120	There's no such thing.
6322120	6331120	TigerKlon chat says, maybe the NX is a system that you jack into like the Matrix and you're in the game.
6332120	6341120	I mean, realistically, like if they could do something that would like, I want them to surprise me in a way that's like, holy crap, that is an amazing idea.
6342120	6348120	I just, right now, my expectations are so low with them and it's, it's like they do the bare minimum to get by.
6348120	6355120	It's not going to help, especially if they're going to make a system that's going to be on par with the Xbox One.
6356120	6361120	That may work for a while, but now all these other consoles are getting upgrades and now their games are going to be compatible.
6362120	6363120	You're going to be in the same fucking position again.
6364120	6365120	Yeah, I do worry about that for sure.
6366120	6370120	Moving on to talk a little bit about EA and their comments on the Nintendo NX.
6371120	6374120	They have actually told the BBC in an interview this following quote.
6374120	6380120	I personally and the company are huge fans of Nintendo. They're the reason why I started making games.
6381120	6386120	We're in constant communication with them and when they come to market something, and if it makes sense for us, we'll be there.
6387120	6395120	So, kind of a, I don't know, very walking the line type of response where they're not committing to developing for the NX, but basically saying,
6395120	6403120	if we see dollar signs, we're going to go chase those dollar signs, which, duh, that's how it works.
6404120	6410120	And for whatever reason, they didn't see dollar signs on the Wii U, probably because of the not so great sales in the first year, so everybody ran away.
6411120	6415120	And also the fact that most of their engines, everything was like in frostbite, so that didn't run on the Wii U.
6415120	6427120	True. Which is, although, again, as a reminder, which is why everybody ran away, or which is why, excuse me, why the NX got pushed back,
6428120	6435120	was because I think they're trying to attract more of these third parties and have that stronger launch so that out the gate they sell a ton of them.
6436120	6442120	Interesting though, since we're thinking EA, we just had that story earlier on about Mass Effect is coming out in the first part of 2017.
6442120	6451120	We know that Mass Effect Andromeda is a new story, it's not going to tie to the original trilogy really,
6452120	6458120	certainly the save games are not going to import, so could we see Andromeda on the NX?
6459120	6462120	Or whatever Nintendo ends up calling it. I hate that we still call it the NX to this day.
6463120	6468120	Well, because we don't know anything because Nintendo's not telling us anything, and I find that very frustrating.
6468120	6477120	Alright, well, yeah, so EA just basically saying if it makes money then we're going to go get some of that money. Yep, makes sense.
6478120	6479120	DarkSaga!
6480120	6489120	Well this makes me super happy because Dan, first of all, super freaking loves the crap out of this game.
6490120	6494120	And I super love the crap out of this game too, but not to the extent that Dan does.
6494120	6502120	Natsume is rebooting an old SNES game called Wild Guns for Playstation 4.
6503120	6515120	The original Wild Guns came out in 1994 and it had a shooting gallery style of gameplay with these,
6516120	6523120	well I guess the only good word to describe it is anachronistic weapons, so just things that didn't belong at that time.
6524120	6532120	But now Natsume is going to be working on Wild Guns Reloaded and they're bringing back the original characters, Clint and Annie.
6533120	6537120	And who knows, we might have some more characters, but they're going to be revealing something at E3.
6538120	6539120	I mean, how many of you guys remember this game?
6540120	6543120	Wild Guns? I don't think I ever played it. Yeah, I never played it.
6544120	6549120	I didn't. It was good. I mean, there were better games, but it was good.
6549120	6555120	I knew you'd be into this when you heard about this though, because I figured this was a game that was more up your alley.
6556120	6558120	Well, it's an actual classic as opposed to Halo.
6559120	6564120	Stop. Stopeianchat says, I haven't played the first, but looking forward to the new Wild Guns.
6565120	6566120	Yeah.
6567120	6569120	Alright. Well, moving on. Loki.
6570120	6571120	Alright.
6572120	6578120	You know, I want to say I think I played Wild Guns at the arcade a long time ago.
6579120	6586120	You know, something that actually is kind of interesting, and I hate reading this news because I so wanted them to fail with this,
6587120	6595120	but apparently Konami has had profits go up since they decided to not make console games anymore.
6595120	6605120	And yeah, I mean, I guess that's cool. They're saying that the mobile and fitness revenue has gone down 2.8%,
6606120	6612120	and I guess Pachinko fell 17.8%, but the gambling division climbed to 1.4%.
6613120	6615120	I'm trying to see where they're making up all their money.
6616120	6623120	Company-wide though, the revenue is up 14.6%, and with a major jump in operating income.
6625120	6632120	So don't expect console stuff from Konami in the future. What about, how does Metal Gear Solid 5 play into that?
6633120	6638120	Yeah, I kind of wondered that as well, and they're saying, you know, despite the successes in fiscal year 2016,
6639120	6641120	Konami expects revenues to decline in the new year.
6642120	6648120	So I want to see, is that like, could they be up because of like, you know, Metal Gear Solid 5?
6648120	6657120	I mean, are they talking about that they're down as far as operating costs because they don't have to pay for the development of Metal Gear Solid 5?
6658120	6661120	Well, yes. Yes, actually, I'm pretty sure is part of it.
6662120	6668120	I don't know. I'm not a financial analyst, but we'll see. We'll see how they actually do in the long term,
6669120	6671120	because right now, I mean, it's too early, I think, to see.
6672120	6677120	And especially when they're talking about, you know, that their mobile and fitness and Pachinko has gone down,
6678120	6680120	that doesn't sound good if that's all you're going to be relying on.
6681120	6687120	So we'll see what happens from Konami in the next year, but it doesn't seem like they're going to really be developing a whole lot of games.
6688120	6692120	Although, I mean, we talked about one last week. It was a small one, but it was like that Japanese, you know, board game.
6693120	6698120	So there's little things here and there, but it's just, it's not going to be what it was. Those days are gone.
6699120	6702120	Could you maybe license out Dance Dance Revolution to somebody else?
6702120	6705120	Dream on. Dream on.
6706120	6709120	All right, well, hey, I know a lot of you guys are looking forward to Overwatch.
6710120	6715120	Overwatch is going to be coming out at the end of the month on May 24th, but don't cheat.
6716120	6721120	Don't be a dick and cheat at Overwatch. And there is no single player mode in Overwatch, which, you know, I have my issues with.
6722120	6725120	So if you're cheating in the game, you're really only doing it to hurt other people.
6726120	6730120	And so Blizzard is going to fuck you up if you try to cheat in Overwatch.
6730120	6735120	A community manager for Blizzard actually posted on the Battle.net forum saying, quote,
6736120	6741120	If a player is found to be cheating or using hacks, bots, or third-party software that provides any sort of unfair advantage,
6742120	6745120	that player will be permanently banned from the game. Full stop.
6746120	6749120	Not only does cheating undermine the spirit of fair play that all of our products are based on,
6750120	6752120	but it works to diminish the fun and enjoyment of others.
6753120	6757120	This goes on to say, basically, first-time offenders will be permanently banned.
6757120	6761120	There's not going to be a cheater island or anything like that.
6762120	6764120	Not even going to be a temporary ban. Just buy.
6765120	6770120	Which is going to be very interesting considering if they ban you from Overwatch, you just spent $60 on a turd,
6771120	6774120	because there is, again, no single player campaign.
6775120	6777120	So you will have nothing left to play if you get banned from Overwatch.
6778120	6781120	So I'm really waiting to see how this whole,
6781120	6786120	Oh, that was my little brother that played on my account that did that and got me banned.
6787120	6789120	Please unban me. Although, honestly, my response would be,
6790120	6792120	Well, you shouldn't have let your little brother play on the fucking game then.
6793120	6797120	But you know people are going to be, quote, unquote, falsely banned,
6798120	6800120	and this could come back to bite Blizzard.
6801120	6803120	So I wonder how strong they're really going to be.
6804120	6809120	But we'll see. They're saying they're going to ban them the first time, but I don't know.
6809120	6810120	We'll see.
6812120	6814120	You wouldn't cheat at Overwatch online, would you, Loki?
6815120	6817120	I know sometimes you use hacks and mods, but you wouldn't use it in Overwatch, would you?
6818120	6819120	I wouldn't even play Overwatch again.
6820120	6821120	I guess that works.
6822120	6823120	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
6824120	6829120	Every week you guys send us emails over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
6830120	6836120	and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and she will pull out some emails to read here.
6836120	6837120	Or one.
6838120	6839120	Just one email to read live on here?
6840120	6841120	Just one.
6842120	6843120	Alright, well let's get to tonight's emails.
6850120	6852120	First one and only one. Hi, OLR.
6853120	6859120	I recently enjoyed your gaming stories about your mothers and grandparents in the Mother's Day episode and just wanted to share my own.
6860120	6861120	This is about my grandmother.
6861120	6866120	She was the big gamer and the one who got myself and my sister into gaming.
6867120	6872120	I remember summer days when school was out and Grandma would just watch us while my parents were at work during the day.
6873120	6874120	She had the NES, the SNES, and the Sega Genesis.
6875120	6880120	When it was too hot and humid to play outside, she would let us sit on her bed and we would all take turns playing the game systems.
6881120	6882120	She had basically every game you could dream of.
6883120	6885120	She bought my sister and I the N64 when it came out.
6886120	6889120	She had an ulterior motive. She wanted to play Yoshi's Story.
6889120	6895120	And I will always cherish the memories of sitting in her room on rainy days watching her play Echo the Dolphin.
6896120	6901120	When she passed away my freshman year of high school, I couldn't bring myself to game for two years.
6902120	6906120	Final Fantasy X and some time to heal finally pulled me back into the gaming hobby.
6907120	6911120	And I came to realize how much I could honor her memory just by doing this thing we both love so much.
6912120	6917120	She left my sister and I, bad grammar, sister and me, the SNES and Genesis.
6917120	6923120	All her save files were still there and all her manuals had level codes written in the back under the notes.
6924120	6926120	And we could hear her in our minds saying, don't mess with my save.
6927120	6928120	That's lovely.
6929120	6935120	So much from my mom in gaming. She had a Game Boy and played so much Tetris. So. Much.
6936120	6940120	Thanks so much for making my Monday mornings at work so much more bearable, Megan.
6941120	6943120	Or I think I'm Megantron on your forums.
6943120	6946120	Well, thank you, Megantron, for the email. I appreciate you sharing the story.
6947120	6949120	And I give everyone crap for bad grammar, so don't worry about it.
6950120	6952120	And Akuma JP in our chat says, wow, cool grandma.
6953120	6954120	Seriously.
6954120	6955120	Agreed.
6955120	6958120	Mine would be like, Jamie, turn that down. I'm trying to read the Bible.
6960120	6962120	Something like that anyway. I don't know.
6963120	6970120	All right. Well, if you want to email us some cool stories, do it. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6970120	6974120	In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.
6974120	7003120	FU to a particular intersection and a particular camera that lies
7005120	7008120	lies. I'm an L.A. lies. Video doesn't lie.
7009120	7010120	What?
7011120	7012120	Take video.
7013120	7014120	There's no video attached to mine.
7015120	7016120	They usually do. Lies.
7017120	7022120	That's my story and I'm sticking to it. So I got to go stick it to the man tomorrow.
7023120	7025120	Maybe he likes getting sick. I don't know.
7026120	7027120	Loki.
7028120	7030120	Yeah, because I see like I got one of those two making a right turn.
7030120	7033120	I'm like, ah, you know, I stopped in time.
7034120	7035120	Were they going to link to the vehicle?
7036120	7037120	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
7038120	7039120	Enough of that.
7040120	7045120	I guess just F.U. to do my headache right now and, you know, in general F.U.
7046120	7051120	I really I don't understand why they can't carry Android gaming consoles or controllers.
7052120	7056120	I mean, not like just even as a supply and demand thing.
7056120	7064120	I mean, you'd think that if like you pass by, for example, that sells both the phones and tablets and the Samsung Gear VR,
7065120	7070120	you think that they would want to carry a controller that because a lot of the games do use especially Minecraft,
7071120	7074120	which my fucking God is like one of the biggest games out there that requires a controller.
7075120	7076120	You're reiterating everything you said.
7077120	7082120	I understand that. I'm just saying I don't I don't understand why they don't just this is something we don't care.
7083120	7084120	You're still mad two hours later.
7086120	7089120	You do want me to come into your store, right? Because that's the only reason I was coming in there.
7090120	7094120	All right. My F.U. of the week goes to the fact that the weekend wasn't long enough.
7095120	7098120	I went to San Francisco recently yesterday to see a friend that was missing from Hawaii.
7099120	7102120	And it's like, oh, my God, the night just like flew by like we got into the city at like five.
7103120	7105120	And then like I turn around and it's nine o'clock like already it's crazy.
7106120	7108120	So, yeah, the weekend just flew by.
7109120	7113120	But I'm actually thankful because I took Friday off.
7114120	7115120	Why?
7115120	7118120	Because I can go ride that new Mass Effect ride.
7119120	7120120	And I'm hoping that it's so good.
7121120	7122120	Jamie will go back.
7123120	7125120	They won't let me get off on Friday.
7126120	7127120	Don't. Well, we're going to we'll go another time.
7128120	7129120	Saturday.
7130120	7131120	All right. I'll go back the next day.
7132120	7134120	Exactly. But I'm very excited.
7135120	7137120	So on the next episode of the show, I'll be able to tell you all how that was.
7138120	7139120	Oh, shoot. Next Saturday.
7140120	7141120	What?
7142120	7143120	I'm going shopping for makeup.
7143120	7144120	Oh, gee.
7145120	7146120	No, no, no. Not just any makeup.
7147120	7148120	Not not just any makeup.
7149120	7154120	I'm going to this place in an old Sacramento called Evangeline's Closet Man.
7155120	7156120	Yeah, I know that costume and costume mansion.
7157120	7158120	Yeah. Why does he closet?
7159120	7161120	Tell everybody where you're going to be so the fans can find you.
7162120	7167120	I'm going to be buying my makeup for my very first drag cosplay.
7168120	7169120	Fun.
7170120	7171120	And it's specifically drag cosplay.
7171120	7173120	OK, because this is something you're doing for GamerX.
7174120	7175120	It is. All right.
7176120	7177120	Oh, I know what you're doing, too. It'll be fun.
7178120	7180120	Yeah. Yeah. So but I've got to Jamie does elaborate cosplay.
7181120	7182120	She doesn't like she doesn't do it.
7183120	7184120	I don't fuck around.
7185120	7190120	Fair enough. And from here forward, I've decided that all of my cosplays are not going to be conventional.
7191120	7194120	And just for the record, I am not cosplaying when I go to Green America to ride the ride.
7195120	7197120	But I will wear the hat and I'll have the red beard.
7198120	7199120	So like, I'll be casual Joker.
7199120	7201120	OK, you'll be Joker's day off, is it?
7202120	7203120	You'll be shore leave Joker.
7204120	7207120	And that's exactly what it is to shore leave Joker, shore leave Joker.
7208120	7209120	So there you go.
7210120	7223120	All right. I would I would love to do a nice little video like Bobby does, because, you know, Bobby takes a road trip and suddenly there's a Tesla road trip video on Vogue that people are finding and commenting on, which, by the way, he just recently did one, if you didn't know.
7223120	7230120	And it's it's cool. Like, if you like to see parts of America that you might actually not drive on yourself someday, these videos are a lot of fun.
7231120	7233120	And he talks about some of the little Easter eggs and stuff in the Tesla.
7234120	7235120	So he he just put one of those videos on Vogue Network.
7236120	7241120	If I had the kind of camera he had, I would just I don't think they'll let you film the ride because it is a movie.
7242120	7243120	But you could see the show building.
7244120	7245120	You could see the queue.
7246120	7247120	You could see if they have any characters.
7247120	7256120	Like, I would try to get you an immediate reaction. I try to show you everything but the actual movie itself, which is probably illegal to film, although it'll probably turn up on YouTube soon enough anyway.
7257120	7262120	But yeah, I don't have those same toys, sadly.
7264120	7269120	Bobby Blackwolf, though, says if I use my phone camera and send him the files, maybe maybe we can work something out.
7270120	7271120	We'll try to I'll see what I can do.
7272120	7273120	All right.
7273120	7278120	There we go. So that's it for the FUs of the Week. Let's go on to Loki.
7279120	7287120	All right. So Capcom has promised that they're going to be giving their games a little bit more polished time.
7288120	7289120	They're not in a hurry to release them.
7290120	7296120	Apparently, you know, Street Fighter V was plagued with a number of issues and they promised that they're not going to do that again.
7296120	7297120	They're going to give it more time.
7298120	7305120	It's trying to release the game so that it can make it for fighting game tournaments and get some extra money out.
7306120	7307120	I don't know.
7308120	7320120	They say this now, but then, you know, I want to say that both PlayStation and Xbox have talked about having those early access type games available.
7321120	7324120	So it makes me wonder if they're not just going to release this shit anyways.
7324120	7328120	And they also promise this now, but doesn't mean that that shit's not going to come out un-bolish anyways.
7329120	7333120	Act. Or Ubisoft. Looking at you.
7334120	7345120	You know, I don't know if this is true or not, but there was a story float around the interwebs this week that, um, Pokken Tournament has sold more than Street Fighter V has at this point.
7346120	7349120	Now, that strikes me as one of those, like, Facebook memes that isn't really true.
7350120	7352120	But I just thought I'd throw that out there because I see that float around everywhere.
7352120	7358120	And it's one of those things where it's like, I kind of could see it. Like, it does make sense.
7359120	7363120	But I don't know. I really need to see the cold hard facts first.
7364120	7365120	Let's see here.
7366120	7368120	This is apparently early April NPD numbers. Or something.
7369120	7371120	Early April. Well, they don't have numbers anymore. They just have ranks.
7372120	7375120	Because they don't give out the full breakdowns of those anymore.
7376120	7377120	Interesting.
7378120	7380120	They just do, like, here's the top ten selling games of whatever.
7380120	7389120	Somebody tweeted it. But it would, for the month of April, it wouldn't matter anyway because Pokken came out a month before.
7390120	7394120	So you're not going to be able to see, like, it's not going to be the same month.
7395120	7398120	Well, you should see, like, we'll see right now. Let's take a look.
7399120	7400120	Alright, alright.
7400120	7404120	So, April. Okay, so the global top sellers. Let's see here.
7407120	7412120	I don't even see Pokken on there. Was this in all regions or were they just talking about US?
7413120	7414120	I don't know.
7415120	7421120	Let's look at US. Okay, that's... I need more than just the top ten here.
7422120	7423120	Let me dig and see what I can find.
7424120	7425120	Alright, fair enough.
7425120	7432120	Okay, so meanwhile, I'm surprised you didn't do this one Dark Sakura, but I guess we saved this one for the very, very end.
7433120	7434120	We saved the best for last Dark Sakura.
7435120	7439120	And that is that the Five Nights at Freddy's series is getting remade for consoles.
7440120	7445120	That's right, you can poop your pants all over again playing Five Nights at Freddy's, but this time on consoles.
7446120	7450120	Just wait for the avalanche of Let's Play videos on the PlayStation 4.
7450120	7455120	Not that I'm one to make fun because that was probably the last Let's Play I did, was Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
7456120	7462120	So, yeah, the original Five Nights at Freddy's games, Scott Cawthon has said on the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Steam forum,
7463120	7469120	Yes, it will happen. I'm talking with a few companies who are interested in doing console remakes of the original games.
7470120	7475120	Assuming that original games means no Five Nights at Freddy's World, but I don't think anyone's gonna miss that.
7476120	7477120	So, there you go.
7477120	7485120	Remember, Five Nights was made in Clickteam Fusion and it's not exactly something you can just, it's not like Unity where you can just pretty easily port it over to the consoles.
7486120	7488120	So, they may have to rebuild these games.
7489120	7493120	So, you may not get the exact same Five Nights games that we had before.
7494120	7495120	So, these are looking to be maybe a full-on remake.
7496120	7500120	I wonder if a company isn't just gonna make one giant game that's all four games kind of in one.
7501120	7503120	I wouldn't doubt that that's gonna end up being the thing, but we'll see.
7503120	7511120	We'll see. Possible E3 announcement? Wouldn't Sony or Microsoft love to say that they got that one? Coming out this Halloween?
7512120	7513120	We'll see.
7514120	7518120	We will see. Alright. That is it for Stories tonight.
7519120	7526120	So, let's go to our Skypline 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7527120	7531120	And while we wait for the Skypline ring, we can do some last minute stories.
7531120	7534120	I don't know if you have any, Loki. I know I got one real quick.
7535120	7536120	I am still looking at the chart.
7537120	7538120	Oh, you're still trying to figure out that whole chart thing?
7539120	7546120	Well, Alan had actually sent me this one that he talked to me about, and I forgot to mention this earlier in the show, but we were kind of laughing about this the other night.
7547120	7555120	EA was on a phone call with investors this week and said that they are making an action game, that they have an action game in the works.
7555120	7561120	And I guess it's supposed to be an Assassin's Creed style game, which is interesting because that's an Ubisoft game.
7562120	7569120	But EA is doing it, and it is slated for fiscal year 2020 or 2021.
7570120	7571120	Who cares at this point?
7572120	7577120	So, we're talking about games that are four to five years out already.
7577120	7586120	Well, I mean, we kind of laugh and all that, but at the same time, dude, high definition games and all that, they take a long time to make sometimes.
7587120	7593120	And, you know, it's an interesting follow up to your whole fact that Capcom is saying they need to spend more time on the development cycle and so forth.
7594120	7600120	That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm spending more time on my development cycle, which is why I don't have any progress whatsoever on my game.
7601120	7609120	Alan Acme in chat says, why talk about it? Who cares? I guess the investors, I guess investors want to know. We got plans to keep us fiscally...
7610120	7614120	We got first person shooter game coming out in five years. Whoa, that's totally unique.
7615120	7620120	William Murderface says, that is the same year we will finally see Kingdom Hearts 3.
7623120	7626120	Sadly true. Very, very, very true.
7627120	7631120	Alright, so we'll have that to look forward to, I guess.
7632120	7638120	They could show the trailer for this mysterious game and then release it in five years. I mean, shit, look at Final Fantasy XV.
7639120	7646120	When was that first shown? Is Final Fantasy XIII vs. 2004? I don't remember. It was a while ago.
7647120	7653120	Anyway, again, 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
7653120	7658120	Meanwhile, Loki, are you alright over there? No, IRC keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. It's annoying.
7659120	7660120	Well, that's not nice.
7661120	7672120	Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, hey, there's that movie with John Malkovich where they said they released the trailer and said it wasn't going to be shown until 2115.
7675120	7679120	Yeah, but you expect that at an art film. That type of thing is going to happen.
7679120	7687120	Although, hey, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't they have their releases calendared through at least, like what, 2019 at least, right?
7688120	7693120	If not 2020. How far does the Marvel schedule go out? At least 2019.
7694120	7698120	It's not that far. I mean, I guess, yeah, 2019 is not that far, all things considered.
7698120	7709120	Yeah, the rumor is Street Fighter V sold 670,000 units and Pokken Tournament was 680,000.
7710120	7717120	But they're saying, you know, that's what VG charts says. I looked at VG charts, they don't have numbers for those.
7718120	7721120	So I, that's a whole load of shit.
7721120	7727120	That's what, when I read that, I'm kind of like, I'm taking it with a grain of salt. Not that I think it's impossible and can't be true, but it just, it does seem kind of steep.
7728120	7733120	And they're saying that's just on PlayStation 4, you know, so if you add the PC numbers, that puts it over your Pokken Tournament.
7734120	7740120	And I, that seems awfully high for Pokken Tournament too, to be honest. I just don't see it selling that well.
7741120	7749120	Alan Alchemy pointing out to my Marvel example, yes, the Marvel and DC timelines go to 2020 and 2021, but we know their names and logos already.
7750120	7754120	Even though, you know, that is a difference. This EA thing, we don't even know that.
7755120	7766120	SHO 100 Matt is pointing out some random Bimani DDR news. Apparently a few classic licensed DDR songs are going to be removed from DDR A, according to Bimani style, and then links us to the story.
7766120	7777120	Yeah, I heard about that. Dark Tetsuya had posted somewhere about that. And yeah, I read like some of the, some of the old DDR songs, like If You Were Here With Me and what, Bad Girls, all this stuff that's like licensed.
7778120	7787120	Well, not all of it, but a big chunk of like licensed classic songs. I'm assuming the license just kind of ran out. So that's why those are going away, I suppose.
7787120	7795120	All right. I'll put out one more call for calls 1-877-GMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7796120	7803120	Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I just looked it up here at the individual tiles and that's where they're showing. I, it's still, I don't, I'm not buying it.
7804120	7809120	And also I don't know if these are complete figures because that's not, I don't know if this is including digital sales as well.
7810120	7811120	So there's a lot of stuff that we don't know.
7812120	7820120	Well, good for you fact checking before you just reblog it or re Tumblr it or, or what do they call it on Facebook? Share it.
7821120	7829120	Here you go. All right. Well, the phones, the phones are not lining up tonight. People are, people are being shy or I, I know Rama's not in chat.
7830120	7835120	So some of our, I don't think I see ActDeaf either. So I think some of our frequent callers are away tonight. Are they Game of Thrones fans?
7836120	7837120	Yeah, that's on tonight.
7838120	7839120	Sharing of swords.
7839120	7845120	I guess. All right. Well, that's going to do it. I guess, I guess we're a little early, but I'm not going to drag the show out. We're done with the news and everything.
7846120	7851120	So that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show and sticking with us.
7852120	7856120	Hope we were able to entertain you either on Sunday night or Monday or whenever throughout the week you listen to this.
7857120	7861120	And thank you, by the way, for checking out OLR. Thank you for spending some of your week with us. We appreciate it.
7862120	7866120	Hey, we don't ask for your money. All we ask, help us spread the word. Tell a friend or five about the show.
7866120	7873120	Spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio, because as you can see, if we don't get some of your friends here, nobody's going to call us.
7874120	7877120	This was kind of cool. One thing, one last-minute story.
7878120	7882120	We didn't mention it. There's a new Dreamcast game that's being developed.
7883120	7887120	Xenocider is a game that they're developing right now for PC, 3DS, and Dreamcast.
7888120	7889120	And Dreamcast?
7890120	7892120	And it's a similar game to like Sin and Punishment. It's an on-rails shooter game.
7893120	7894120	And Dreamcast?
7894120	7895120	And Dreamcast.
7896120	7900120	I love that they're still making Dreamcast games in 2016. That warms my cold, black little heart.
7901120	7905120	Alright, I need to get out my Dreamcast, play some Space Channel 5 and then some NES emulators.
7906120	7907120	Let's do some Power Stone.
7908120	7909120	Good times.
7910120	7911120	Powerful!
7912120	7922120	Alright, well, that is really going to wrap it up. I already gave you the spiel about telling a friend or five about the show, but I didn't say a nice five-star rating on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast goes a long way.
7922120	7925120	We're going to go around and give everybody's final thought for the night.
7926120	7927120	Dark Soccer, you get to go have cheesecake early.
7928120	7929120	I'm going to get some cheesecake.
7930120	7931120	Final thought for our listeners tonight?
7932120	7940120	Um. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh.
7941120	7943120	I think you broke. We broke Dark Soccer, everybody.
7944120	7950120	My final thought for the night is I am looking forward to Mass Effect and roller coasters on Friday.
7950120	7955120	And Bobby has worked out a plan where, yes, we can do video. Bobby Black Wolf saves the day.
7956120	7960120	I don't like to say that a lot. I'm not going to say that phrase a lot on the show, but it's true in this case for sure.
7961120	7962120	Uh, Loki, your final thought?
7963120	7964120	Maybe I'll work on my game tonight.
7965120	7966120	You say that every week.
7967120	7969120	Maybe I'll go learn to skydive tonight.
7970120	7972120	Don't do it, Lodi.
7973120	7977120	Skydiving is really not that hard. You just kind of let gravity take you and not die.
7978120	7979120	I hope you don't have holes in your parachute.
7980120	7983120	Especially the indoor skydiving. They have a new thing in Roseville, like indoor skydiving.
7984120	7985120	They do in Roseville?
7986120	7987120	I would do that shit.
7988120	7990120	Oh well, our team building day, you guys. Let's all go indoor skydiving.
7991120	7994120	And then we'll film it. That could be another thing that I'll film and send to Bobby.
7995120	7998120	Guess what? I'm going to fill up your inbox, Bobby.
7999120	8001120	Indoor skydiving. That'll be fun.
8002120	8004120	Alright. Look forward to it.
8005120	8008120	In the meantime, happy gaming, you guys. Whatever you're going to play this week, whether it's Doom or catching up on your backlog.
8008120	8012120	Have a great week and we will see you in seven days, hopefully with some more guests in the studio as well.
8013120	8015120	Looking forward to another fun OLR next week.
8016120	8017120	Thanks for listening. See you next time.
8038120	8045120	You may not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
8048120	8049120	See you next week.
8068120	8080120	See you next time.
