31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, May the 22nd, 2016 with the 642nd episode of our show
45000	49000	dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
49000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E
53000	62000	joined here in lovely Sacramento, California, Studio N7, by my side, as she always is over a very, very, very long time.
62000	64000	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
64000	66000	No shit.
66000	67000	How are you, Jamie?
67000	73000	I was actually floored the other day telling someone about the podcast and realizing that it's been that long.
73000	76000	I mean, I'm floored every time I think about it having been that long.
76000	77000	Sure.
77000	78000	But it's like just what we do.
78000	79000	Yeah.
79000	81000	It's just, this is our Sunday night thing.
81000	82000	It's a thing.
82000	83000	It's what we do on Sundays.
83000	84000	Some people watch Chair of Swords.
84000	85000	That's right.
85000	86000	We podcast.
86000	87000	That's right.
87000	88000	Some people join a bowling league.
88000	89000	We podcast.
89000	90000	There it is.
90000	94000	Yeah, some people walk around, you know, naked down the street with some enchanting shame after them.
94000	95000	Is that what you used to do?
95000	96000	Yes.
96000	97000	Before O-L-R?
97000	98000	Oh, okay.
98000	100000	I used to go to the Goth Club on Sunday nights.
100000	101000	Then there was O-L-R.
101000	103000	You remember my Bachelorette party.
103000	104000	I do.
104000	107000	We watched Barbarella and Xanadu.
107000	109000	Wait, what does this have to do with Goth?
109000	111000	And went to the Goth Club right after her.
111000	112000	That's right.
112000	113000	That's right.
113000	114000	We did.
114000	115000	We did.
115000	116000	All right.
116000	118000	Anyway, also joining us, say hello to, I don't know how often he went to the Goth Club, but
118000	119000	say hello to Techmaster Loki.
119000	120000	I think like twice.
120000	121000	Did you really go?
121000	122000	Yeah, twice.
122000	123000	I don't even remember that.
123000	124000	I do remember-
124000	126000	You were there every single night.
126000	133000	I do remember the time you entered the DDR tournament and you dressed sort of like Keanu
133000	136000	Reeves from The Matrix, kind of like you had the big trench coat thing.
136000	138000	And you were doing Dynamite Rave.
138000	139000	And I totally fucked it up.
139000	140000	And you failed the song.
141000	142000	In front of all those people.
142000	144000	That's because they didn't practice.
144000	145000	That's all right.
145000	146000	You tried.
146000	149000	That tourney we named Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.
149000	150000	It was the Scat Tournament.
150000	151000	The Scat Tournament.
151000	152000	I know.
152000	153000	It was awesome.
153000	155000	So anyway, that is us here at Orange Launch Radio.
155000	159000	You guys in our chat room, if you are listening live, you should join us live in our chat
159000	165000	over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific,
165000	170000	nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,
170000	171000	vognetwork.com.
171000	177000	And you can chime in with comments such as Ragenator in chat who says, bowling?
177000	179000	Who the holy fuck bowls anymore?
179000	180000	Hey, hold on.
180000	182000	I just went bowling like two months ago.
182000	184000	I think a lot of people still bowl.
184000	185000	There's a lot of old people who bowl.
185000	187000	I wouldn't mind going bowling, but I want to do glow bowling.
187000	188000	Bowling's fun.
188000	192000	That's like all bowling is glow bowling now on like Friday and Saturday night.
192000	194000	Some people just like to fondle their balls.
194000	195000	And throw them at things.
195000	196000	Right.
196000	197000	Gotcha.
197000	200000	Tigerclaw defending bowling in chat saying bowling is fine.
200000	202000	It's a relaxing sport.
202000	206000	S2100 Matt talking about the Sunday night thing going, I honestly can't remember what
206000	210000	I used to do on my Sunday night prior to listening to OLR 10 plus years ago.
210000	217000	It's probably watching TV, honestly, because TV, it has all their big shows on Sunday.
217000	221000	ActDeft in chat says, heck, the Applebee's around the street opened a bowling alley.
222000	225000	I actually, I want to talk about bowling a little later in the show because it actually
225000	229000	ties into my gaming week a little bit and I'll hold you with that.
229000	233000	But we got to get to our guests because we have some amazing guests in studio this week.
233000	235000	Very excited to have these guys on the show.
235000	241000	Finally, after just being down the street around the corner with their own show here
241000	247000	in Sacramento, say hello everybody to the cast of Video Game Bang is joining us tonight.
247000	248000	Aaron, how you doing?
248000	254000	I think I'm more excited being here than you are excited to have us here because this
254000	257000	is a full loop.
257000	259000	We spoke before, of course.
259000	265000	I'm a listener from back then and now I'm sitting right here with you guys like actually
265000	266000	on the show.
266000	267000	It's crazy.
267000	269000	Yeah, I would have never imagined this is full circle.
269000	270000	No, I thought that was awesome.
270000	272000	And you said you were listening in the all games days, right?
272000	273000	All games days.
273000	274000	Interactive and stuff.
274000	275000	It's not taboo.
275000	276000	We're all on good terms.
276000	277000	We're all friends.
277000	280000	This was like high school time for me.
280000	283000	Okay, but now you got to stop because that dates me.
283000	286000	When you talk about, yeah, that's what I used to do in high school.
286000	290000	Wait a minute, wait a minute, sir.
290000	292000	So, but no, that's awesome.
292000	297000	You know, I always say, I think the biggest possible compliment you can get as a podcaster
297000	302000	is that somebody else was inspired to podcast because of what you did.
302000	303000	Not that I'm saying we did that for you.
303000	305000	Oh no, hands down you did.
305000	310000	Yes, but like Scott and everybody at all games probably played some part in that.
310000	311000	And that's fantastic.
311000	317000	Yeah, you guys definitely had a hand in the creative thinking behind the show.
317000	318000	Thank you.
318000	320000	And just the motivation to do the show.
320000	321000	You guys have been doing this for a long time.
321000	326000	And I'm just like, I mean, if I can even get a quarter of what you guys have done, I think
326000	328000	I'd be happy with that.
328000	329000	I don't know.
329000	330000	These are the guys I do the show with.
330000	332000	You guys want to say hello to Corey.
332000	333000	Corey's here, everybody.
333000	337000	I'm so flabbergasted at Aaron's modesty right now because this is so new.
337000	342000	If you guys knew this man in our show, he is Sir Aaron Carter.
342000	344000	The man has knighted himself.
344000	346000	Which, was it the Queen of England knighted him?
346000	349000	It's a long story, seven year story.
349000	351000	He's refused to tell the story.
351000	356000	And that's, I mean, kind of the back behind that as well.
356000	359000	On all games, there was Mayor Young.
359000	360000	He had his title like that.
360000	361000	Like the mayor of gaming.
361000	365000	Like I just kind of caught being paid from that.
365000	366000	There was a story there.
366000	370000	I believe he had done something involving with politics at one point or somebody had
370000	372000	always said he should run for mayor or something.
372000	373000	There was a story there.
373000	375000	I just forgot it in my advanced stage.
375000	376000	Yeah.
376000	379000	I mean, there's a story behind mine as well, but I mean, I'm just copying the other black
379000	380000	guy.
380000	381000	That's all it is.
381000	383000	That's basically what that is.
383000	384000	If he's out there somewhere.
384000	385000	Thank you.
385000	387000	That's all I had to say.
387000	388000	He is awesome.
388000	390000	Lawrence, if you're out there, call me.
390000	391000	Call me, bro.
391000	392000	It's been forever.
392000	395000	Bobby's saying that he wanted to run for mayor of Los Angeles.
395000	396000	Oh wow.
396000	398000	I thought there was a story there about him running for mayor of LA or something.
398000	399000	Of course.
399000	400000	Of course Bobby knows that stuff.
400000	401000	So by default, Aaron, what are you trying to accomplish?
401000	404000	I'm trying to be the knight of Sacramento, apparently.
404000	405000	Yeah.
405000	407000	I don't need to be mayor or king or anything.
407000	408000	Knighted, knighthooded.
408000	409000	That's a go for Duke.
409000	412000	If you were a king, if you were a king, you'd be making millions.
412000	413000	You know how much those guys make?
413000	414000	The Sacramento Kings?
414000	415000	Oh, no, no.
415000	416000	Yeah.
416000	417000	That's a bump joke there.
417000	418000	All right.
418000	419000	All right.
419000	421000	Also, I want to make sure we introduce this well.
421000	423000	We have David here also from Video Game Bang joining us tonight.
423000	424000	Hey guys, how's it going?
424000	425000	Good.
425000	426000	How are you?
426000	427000	Good.
427000	428000	Good.
428000	429000	Awesome.
429000	430000	Good to be here.
430000	431000	He's the real David Webb.
431000	432000	Okay.
432000	433000	I have to ask a question.
433000	434000	I swear to God I'm not trying to start shit, but I noticed there's three of you here tonight,
434000	437000	but when I download the Video Game Bang show, I see their pictures.
437000	441000	Well, see, good thing you guys don't have cameras because Webb is hideous.
441000	446000	If you could see his face, he's got a giant Jewish nose.
446000	447000	Oh, now, now, now.
447000	448000	Hold on.
448000	449000	Hold on.
449000	450000	The neck beard.
450000	451000	Hold on.
451000	452000	Well, I mean, initially-
452000	454000	Jamie's going to back him up here.
454000	455000	Hold on.
455000	456000	Solidarity.
456000	457000	What?
457000	458000	Initially it was-
458000	459000	Well, fine.
459000	460000	Fine.
460000	465000	Me and Cory, that's, you know, started the whole thing.
465000	467000	You know, like the first, what?
467000	468000	Most of the time.
468000	469000	The first most of it.
469000	470000	Ten episodes are kind of just us?
470000	471000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
471000	472000	Yeah.
472000	477000	And then we kind of just start trickling everybody into the thing and became a giant family.
477000	481000	And then, you know, people came in and they leave and some people have skills to help
481000	487000	us in some areas and others get busy with life, but then only a year ago?
487000	488000	Yeah.
488000	489000	A year ago?
489000	490000	Yeah.
490000	491000	Yeah.
491000	494000	Webb joined our team and he just takes so much of the load off of our shoulders.
494000	495000	Yeah, he does.
495000	497000	He takes a big load.
497000	500000	He takes our loads all the time.
500000	503000	You're a son of a bitch.
503000	506000	Didn't you initially come on as a iPhone expert?
506000	507000	That was the very first episode.
507000	511000	Yeah, Cory, there was a new iPhone 5S or something.
511000	514000	And Cory was like, hey, I know a guy who's a big Apple fanatic.
514000	515000	I'll have him be on the show.
515000	517000	So I gave a whole like tutorial on-
517000	520000	Okay, are you the her of this show?
520000	523000	Because she is also the Apple fangirl.
523000	524000	That's very accurate.
524000	525000	That's very accurate.
525000	526000	Yeah.
526000	527000	Okay.
527000	528000	Look at her laptop.
528000	529000	She's got a little Apple logo on it.
529000	532000	I'm a recovering Apple fanatic.
532000	533000	Okay.
533000	535000	I've made the switch.
535000	536000	Uh-oh.
536000	537000	Uh-oh.
537000	539000	Well, then I better watch how far down that road I go then.
539000	540000	All right.
540000	544000	But no, no, that's awesome because honestly, it's not also just you three.
544000	546000	I see some other faces pop up on your show too.
546000	547000	So you have like-
547000	549000	We have a roster of probably like 10 people.
549000	553000	It's an eclectic class of friends from childhood.
553000	555000	Like Aaron grew up with some of the people.
555000	558000	Some of them I went to elementary school with.
558000	563000	And we've all been gamers our entire life, so we hung out with gamers by proxy.
563000	568000	So when we don't have specific expertise in a style of game, we'll bring in,
568000	572000	oh, well, a friend of mine won a tournament in that, so we'll bring him in.
572000	573000	And so it keeps us fresh.
573000	576000	It keeps the rotation so that every episode has something new.
576000	579000	The dynamic changes from week to week.
579000	580000	It's fun.
580000	581000	It's a fun deal.
581000	582000	Awesome.
582000	583000	Awesome.
583000	587000	For those listening, because I know our audiences, we may not have a ton of overlap,
587000	590000	tell our audience a little bit about your show.
590000	593000	If I'm going to download an episode of Video Game Bang, what am I going to find?
593000	596000	So we do it twice a week.
596000	601000	The Wednesday shows, you can find your basic news set up, what you're playing,
601000	603000	and then a lot of interviews as well.
603000	607000	We do interviews with kind of anybody that we can wrangle in from the industry,
607000	610000	from musicians, like video game musicians.
610000	616000	We've got indie developers, people like Ashley Burch from Hey Ash, What You're Playing.
616000	619000	She's come on her brother.
619000	620000	That was an interesting episode.
620000	622000	That was your birthday episode.
622000	623000	Yeah.
623000	625000	We pulled strings to get Anthony Burch for Aaron's birthday because
625000	626000	That's a major gripe.
626000	632000	We spent way too many hours on our show debating Roland from Borderlands.
632000	634000	They killed him off in the second one.
634000	635000	Sorry for the spoilers.
635000	637000	Spoiler for like a five-year-old game.
637000	639000	Suck it.
639000	641000	So that happened, and Aaron complained about it week after week.
641000	642000	It didn't sit well with me.
642000	643000	It didn't.
643000	644000	It didn't sit well with me.
644000	647000	So we were like, well, we had Ashley like a month ago.
647000	651000	Let's send her a message and see if we can get her brother, who wrote Borderlands 2.
651000	656000	We got him on there, and Aaron was able to confront the god of the universe.
656000	657000	Of Borderlands, for a second.
657000	658000	Were you satisfied?
658000	664000	He gave me a sufficient answer, but I'm still not happy with the choice.
664000	665000	Okay.
665000	666000	I mean, I'd say that.
666000	672000	He gave the answer saying that Roland was the number one played character from Borderlands 1.
672000	676000	So they really wanted to make players have an emotional reaction.
676000	677000	So what's the best way?
677000	678000	We kill them.
678000	679000	So that's what they did.
679000	685000	So I was like, I understand where you came from, but there was still no point in the story to kill that character.
685000	689000	Yeah, well they could always change their mind on that or something like they do with Saints Row.
689000	691000	Oh yeah, everybody loves Gat.
691000	692000	Let's kill him.
692000	693000	Yeah, exactly.
693000	696000	But he actually, he said he didn't want to do that.
696000	699000	I mean, they might, because he's not working with them anymore.
699000	702000	But he said he wanted to keep death permanent.
702000	705000	So it was just like, this character's dead.
705000	708000	This is in a game that worked in a mechanic called the New You.
708000	709000	Really?
709000	712000	So every time you die, you get a respawn.
712000	715000	It's not just a respawn, they justified your respawn.
715000	716000	But we've talked to them.
716000	718000	Katrina Law from Arrow.
718000	722000	It shocks me, some of the people who will talk to us.
722000	723000	Really, yeah.
723000	725000	They have no reason to, they probably shouldn't.
725000	731000	And how humble that the gaming community, especially independent developers, really are.
731000	733000	Well, yeah, we'll do your show.
733000	738000	You had a lot of indie developers on leading up to the Sac Indie Arcade, which is when we finally kind of connected.
738000	742000	I know you had a lot of them on your show leading up to that event, and I'm sure they appreciate it.
742000	748000	Trust me, any indie developer I've talked to over the years, especially if Kickstarter's involved,
748000	751000	something where they really have to get the word out, Greenlight especially.
751000	758000	They are more than happy to do that type of opportunity and have always been very humble and gracious and all that.
758000	761000	I love spotlighting them.
761000	765000	You get the big names, of course, out there, and you're always going to get a Madden.
765000	766000	You're always going to get a Call of Duty.
766000	768000	You're always going to get Gears of War.
768000	773000	Nintendo could fart, and it's going to be all over Twitter the next day.
773000	777000	Some of these indie developers, and that's not a slam against Nintendo.
777000	780000	Well, people were talking about Star Fox, so I guess you are correct.
780000	781000	Shut up.
781000	785000	So they could do the littlest thing.
785000	791000	People are going to speculate about them rampantly, and that's trending topics on Twitter for the next 24 hours.
791000	797000	Hashtag campaigns and everything, but an indie developer who's really trying to push, it can be very difficult.
797000	800000	And they're some of the most creative talent out there.
800000	805000	They have no chains on them from somebody saying, hey, we need this game out right now.
805000	809000	We need it to be like this. We need it to be the next FIFA or something like that.
809000	813000	They're like, no, I have an idea. I have creativity. I want to show it through this.
813000	815000	And I love that.
815000	820000	Our show is based on the mentality that we're just going to be honest.
820000	826000	No matter what, we were going to say our feelings, whether we conflict with each other or mass opinion.
826000	834000	In our first couple weeks, Aaron single-handedly pissed off the entire PC gaming master race.
834000	841000	And he held to his guns. So we just have our opinions, and we highlight the indie developers.
841000	844000	We ourselves are indie.
844000	850000	And other indie podcasts as well. I know in the early stage we were doing cross stuff as well with other people.
850000	856000	Indie, I don't know. It just needs a bigger light. So if we can help that, definitely.
856000	859000	Have you ever found that you've changed your opinion?
859000	864000	I know I have. The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, boring.
864000	869000	But I came back a year later and played it again. I was like, what was I smoking the first time I played this?
869000	873000	Look at me. I'm wearing a hat. I'm up BioWare's ass now.
873000	876000	By the way, happy birthday BioWare. 21 years old today. Have a drink.
876000	882000	I think the only one... I don't know if I've done that with games. I've only done that now with a movie.
882000	888000	I think the first time that I said about the Warcraft movie, I was like, no, that's going to be terrible.
888000	893000	There's no way this movie's going to come out and do anything. But then I saw the first trailer.
893000	896000	I was like, okay, you might have something on your hands here.
896000	900000	But the movie still hasn't come out. So you might go see the movie and then be like, you know what, I was right the first time.
900000	902000	And then my gut, yeah.
902000	903000	Flip flopper.
903000	904000	Exactly.
904000	907000	And you own a PC now that's powerful that can do some good gaming.
907000	909000	But how much gaming do I do on it?
909000	912000	Well, seeing as though you play 99% of Smite.
912000	914000	Yeah. I do one game.
914000	918000	No, I'm not going to let you pick on him because I play a ton of like Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3 on my PC.
918000	919000	There it is.
919000	921000	Yet I consider myself a console gamer.
921000	922000	There it is.
922000	923000	Well, I'm both. I'm both.
923000	924000	I'm right with you.
924000	926000	Everybody wants to rule the world.
926000	928000	I'm right with you. I'm right with you. I'm both.
928000	929000	All right.
929000	930000	My label.
930000	931000	Exactly.
931000	936000	Looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Where was this here?
936000	940000	Oh, Kaijuto had asked this question. Video Game Bang, is this a Pornhub podcast?
940000	944000	All right. So obviously there's, is the name supposed to be tongue in cheek?
944000	952000	Because obviously, am I just a dirty pervert where I go, hee hee, gang bang, hee hee.
952000	953000	What is that?
953000	955000	That's the first time we've heard that.
955000	957000	We're a good Christian podcast.
957000	960000	What did he say? A porn what?
960000	963000	Porn hub.
963000	964000	What is that?
964000	968000	I think they sponsor esports teams.
969000	970000	It's all well received.
970000	971000	No, we are not sponsored.
971000	973000	Yeah, no.
973000	979000	No, yeah, we definitely fully understand the correlation between the two and we embrace it.
979000	980000	It's a blessing and a Christian.
980000	983000	Yeah, we embrace it sometimes. Well, who was it?
983000	984000	Jason David Frank.
984000	985000	Was it Jason David Frank?
985000	987000	It was Jason David Frank. He was giving us a shout out.
987000	990000	And he's like, hey, you're listening to Video Game Bang.
990000	991000	And we're like, no.
991000	992000	Is that the Power Ranger?
992000	996000	Yeah, he was the green Power Ranger and the white Power Ranger.
996000	997000	Okay.
997000	998000	And then the black one.
998000	999000	Black.
999000	1001000	He's the Power Ranger who's like 45 and still a Power Ranger.
1001000	1002000	Oh, yeah.
1002000	1003000	Hanging out with teenagers.
1003000	1004000	And the MMA fighter.
1004000	1005000	Oh my God.
1005000	1006000	Yeah.
1006000	1007000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1007000	1010000	Yeah, he couldn't say when we tried to get him to do a promo for us or whatever.
1010000	1011000	It was just tough.
1011000	1012000	Two or three times.
1012000	1013000	Yeah, it was definitely tough.
1013000	1016000	You'd be really surprised how far a good name can get you.
1016000	1017000	Yeah.
1017000	1020000	And how far a bad name will hold you back.
1020000	1022000	I'm not going to say OLR is a bad name.
1022000	1026000	I love the name of the show and it comes from a very special place and so forth.
1026000	1028000	I also realize people go Orange Lounge Radio.
1028000	1030000	You're not going to think, oh, it's a video game show.
1030000	1033000	Not a lot of people make that connection in this timeframe.
1033000	1040000	But one star, there was a significant lack of lounge music on your show.
1040000	1043000	Maybe some lounge against the machine.
1043000	1044000	Maybe.
1044000	1045000	Get some Richard Cheese on.
1045000	1046000	In the old days.
1046000	1048000	We just talked about Dick Cheese on our show last week.
1048000	1049000	That's an actual thing?
1049000	1051000	I thought you guys were making stuff up.
1051000	1052000	No, we didn't make it up.
1052000	1053000	I have no idea what Dick Cheese was.
1053000	1056000	My favorite song to this day is the cover of Crazy.
1056000	1058000	The Britney Spears one.
1058000	1059000	Yes, that's a good one.
1059000	1063000	We actually listened on the stream Down with the Sickness.
1063000	1064000	It was a beautiful thing.
1064000	1068000	But the name gives us opportunities to come up with little creative things.
1068000	1070000	Like our number one shirt is I'm here for the gang bang.
1070000	1071000	We call our-
1071000	1072000	Okay, that's cute. That's funny.
1072000	1074000	We call our fans the Bang Gang.
1074000	1076000	Is that what we call them? The gang?
1076000	1078000	Yeah, we call them the Bang Gang.
1078000	1081000	No, I think we call us the gang bang.
1081000	1084000	Whenever I put in the descriptions, that's what the Bang Gang is talking about.
1084000	1085000	We don't talk about it nearly enough.
1085000	1088000	There is definitely an explosion of some kind going on.
1088000	1089000	Yes, there we go.
1089000	1093000	Who was the director that did the promo for us?
1093000	1094000	I'm forgetting his name.
1094000	1098000	He did Tusk. It was his last movie.
1098000	1099000	Kevin Smith.
1099000	1100000	Kevin Smith, yeah.
1100000	1101000	Yes, Kevin Smith.
1101000	1103000	Whenever he did the promo for us, and he's like,
1103000	1106000	it doesn't sound as dirty, or it's not as dirty as it sounds, everybody,
1106000	1107000	or whatever.
1107000	1108000	He's like, you're listening to the video game, bang,
1108000	1109000	and it's not as dirty as it sounds.
1109000	1111000	I was like, that's awesome.
1111000	1116000	He recognized off the cuff, and he said it right, and he plays to it.
1116000	1117000	He's a pro.
1117000	1120000	Corey, you call you guys the Bang Bros, right?
1120000	1121000	That's definitely not happening.
1121000	1122000	Yeah, me and Aaron are the Bang Bros.
1122000	1123000	We are not.
1123000	1128000	I really feel like Bang Bros I've heard somewhere else,
1128000	1130000	and you may actually not want to be associated with that.
1130000	1131000	Yeah, exactly.
1131000	1132000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
1132000	1133000	Exactly.
1133000	1134000	That's fine.
1134000	1136000	So the lawsuit comes in, then he'll know exactly what you're talking about.
1136000	1139000	All right, just don't Google it, because I don't think you're going to find yourself.
1139000	1140000	You're going to find something else.
1140000	1141000	You should see this bus I bought us on Craigslist.
1141000	1144000	Yeah, no.
1144000	1146000	Oh, my God.
1146000	1148000	Let's see.
1148000	1152000	ActDeftInChat says, is this crossover episode gang bang at the Orange Lounge?
1152000	1153000	I guess.
1153000	1154000	Wow.
1154000	1156000	Actually, it's a game bang at the Orange Lounge.
1156000	1161000	StoppyInChat says, I guess I won't name my podcast video Blumpkin.
1161000	1162000	Do what you want.
1162000	1164000	Do it.
1164000	1165000	I'd listen.
1165000	1168000	We have a cute name for our fans, too.
1168000	1169000	The OL Army.
1169000	1170000	That's actually good.
1170000	1171000	Yeah.
1171000	1172000	It rolls right off the tongue.
1172000	1173000	We didn't come up with that.
1173000	1174000	Really?
1174000	1175000	But I like that name.
1175000	1177000	But I did make a picture of a tank.
1177000	1178000	Yes.
1178000	1179000	That was orange.
1179000	1180000	Awesome.
1180000	1181000	It said OL Army on it.
1181000	1183000	We don't have any logos for our fans.
1183000	1184000	Yeah.
1184000	1185000	That'd be something interesting to see.
1185000	1186000	We need to get on that.
1186000	1187000	Yeah.
1187000	1188000	Take that load.
1188000	1194000	I feel like somebody actually registered the domain, the OL Army or OL Army 1 of them at some point.
1194000	1197000	It just redirects to Orange Lounge Radio, but I always got a kick out of that.
1197000	1199000	Now I'm just thinking though of Hook.
1199000	1201000	You can call it the Bangarang.
1201000	1202000	Oh, wow.
1202000	1203000	Oh.
1203000	1206000	How much do you want for that one?
1206000	1208000	That is trademark right now.
1208000	1209000	Get me a taco.
1209000	1210000	Too late.
1210000	1212000	I already mailed it to myself.
1212000	1213000	Yeah.
1213000	1215000	She'll sell it for two tacos.
1215000	1216000	Done.
1216000	1217000	John Doe's tacos.
1217000	1219000	Ooh.
1219000	1222000	I've actually finally been there, and I got sick.
1222000	1223000	But it was great.
1223000	1224000	It's the best.
1224000	1225000	I had a kiss.
1225000	1226000	Can I have peppers?
1226000	1227000	All right.
1227000	1230000	Before we get into the news this week, I've got to know a little more about you guys as
1230000	1231000	gamers for the audience.
1231000	1233000	They probably want to know what types of games you play.
1233000	1238000	Because I know our show here at Orange Lounge Radio started about we all played DDR together,
1238000	1240000	believe it or not, at Roseville Golf Land.
1240000	1243000	Orange Lounge was one of the bands that was in DDR back in the day.
1243000	1245000	So we actually all met playing DDR at the arcade.
1245000	1248000	It was never thinner my entire life.
1248000	1250000	Well, actually, let me ask that first.
1250000	1251000	How did you guys all come together?
1251000	1253000	They're going to ask about our weight.
1253000	1255000	No, no, no, no.
1255000	1259000	We do radio for a reason.
1259000	1260000	You said something about childhood friends.
1260000	1262000	Are you all like friends from high school and this stuff?
1262000	1266000	Or how did you all come together and say, I'm going to do a video game podcast?
1266000	1270000	Me and Cory worked at GameStop together.
1270000	1274000	And actually, a lot of the staff at GameStop are all members.
1274000	1276000	We can't call them staff because we don't pay them.
1276000	1277000	Wait, wait, wait.
1277000	1279000	How long ago was this that you were at GameStop?
1279000	1282000	2004, I believe.
1282000	1284000	That was, I think, when Dan was a manager.
1284000	1285000	I think it was, yeah.
1285000	1286000	My husband.
1286000	1290000	No, because I distinctly remember hearing episodes.
1290000	1293000	And when you said that, I was like, I work at GameStop.
1293000	1296000	And I tried to find this Dan person.
1296000	1297000	I promise you.
1297000	1298000	Like, I have no lie.
1298000	1299000	No, no, no.
1299000	1301000	I was just like, I listened to your hot show.
1301000	1303000	And it was crazy.
1303000	1307000	Well, the good news is there's like 5,000 fucking GameStops in Sacramento alone.
1307000	1308000	So the odds are...
1308000	1310000	I can name all the ones he worked at.
1310000	1312000	I was Lolo.
1312000	1314000	I was just a GA back then.
1314000	1315000	So I had no...
1315000	1317000	When he started, it was a Funko Land.
1317000	1318000	Yes.
1318000	1320000	You know, I came a little after all that.
1320000	1321000	There were no Funkos.
1321000	1323000	We had just purchased Wii.
1323000	1325000	I don't care about that.
1325000	1330000	They had just purchased Rhino Games was the last thing that I heard from them or something like that.
1330000	1332000	And then I kind of was deployed.
1332000	1335000	But a lot of the people were staff at GameStop.
1335000	1337000	And now they're, you know, VGB members.
1337000	1339000	And then there's web.
1339000	1340000	Yes.
1340000	1341000	That's how that is.
1341000	1342000	He was just here.
1342000	1343000	Yeah.
1343000	1345000	But that's literally how all of us...
1345000	1347000	Well, we did a lot of Xbox Live together.
1347000	1348000	Oh, yes, yes.
1348000	1351000	I wound up at GameStop because I actually had a real job.
1351000	1352000	And then I got fired.
1352000	1355000	And the store manager owed me a big favor from high school.
1355000	1356000	Yes.
1356000	1360000	So I walked in and I was like, hey, time to pay the piper.
1360000	1361000	I need a job.
1361000	1362000	Hired me.
1362000	1363000	I met some pretty cool people.
1363000	1364000	Aaron was really cool.
1364000	1366000	We made friends on Xbox.
1366000	1367000	Played.
1367000	1368000	He got free games then.
1368000	1370000	So we played just about everything.
1370000	1372000	And we would banter about it.
1372000	1376000	And then, you know, due to Aaron's ego, he was like, we are really funny.
1376000	1378000	We should probably do a podcast.
1378000	1380000	And I was like, well, we're okay.
1380000	1383000	And I have the technology because I was a drummer for many years.
1383000	1391000	So I had a bunch of microphones, mixers, and the ability to build a little cheap studio.
1392000	1393000	We did that.
1393000	1397000	And then we locked ourselves in a room for two hours, two or three hours.
1397000	1400000	And it was the worst piece of junk you've probably ever heard.
1400000	1401000	I was amazing.
1401000	1403000	It was terrible.
1403000	1405000	We were talking about George Zimmerman.
1405000	1408000	One of the Glee members passed away that day.
1408000	1409000	Cory Monteith.
1409000	1410000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1410000	1411000	And we brought that up.
1411000	1413000	We talked about that for a little while.
1413000	1414000	Now hold that thought.
1414000	1415000	I'm going to bring Glee up later in the show.
1415000	1416000	Hold that thought.
1416000	1417000	Okay.
1417000	1418000	Perfect.
1418000	1419000	Because I know exactly what you're talking about.
1419000	1420000	Our show is the anti-Glee.
1420000	1421000	I think on our one-year anniversary...
1421000	1423000	Each anniversary, a Glee member passes away.
1423000	1424000	Yeah.
1424000	1426000	So you're welcome, internet.
1426000	1428000	You're doing God's work.
1430000	1432000	And it's odd, because I mean, it's strange the first episode.
1432000	1434000	We're coming for you, wheelchair kid.
1434000	1441000	I thought we were going to be expected to bust into a rendition of a Journey song here at the end or something.
1441000	1442000	I was a little worried.
1442000	1446000	So now all you need to get is from the Deadpool movie, and you just need to get the Deadpool up there,
1446000	1449000	put all the Glee members, and figure out which one's going to die next.
1449000	1450000	I mean, it's strange.
1450000	1456000	It's odd the first time, but then when it happens exactly a year the second time, you're like, all right.
1456000	1457000	Something's going on.
1457000	1458000	Are we the Madden curse?
1458000	1459000	You're on the clock, Jane Lynch.
1459000	1460000	Yeah.
1460000	1461000	Wow.
1461000	1462000	This is going to a dark place.
1462000	1465000	You guys have some real Glee issues.
1465000	1466000	Glee means happy.
1466000	1467000	What's your problem?
1467000	1469000	The first episode was really not video games.
1469000	1470000	No, not at all.
1470000	1472000	The first two or three were not video games.
1472000	1474000	It was kind of pop culture and stuff.
1474000	1475000	Even today.
1475000	1476000	I mean, we still use some stuff in there.
1476000	1477000	Yeah.
1477000	1478000	We do a lot of video game stuff.
1478000	1480000	That's our focus, but now we're video game and pop culture.
1480000	1481000	Yeah.
1481000	1483000	Because there's so much stuff we want to cover and talk about.
1483000	1485000	Comic books, we're massive comic book fans.
1485000	1486000	Yeah, yeah.
1486000	1489000	The Marvel movement, the movies and everything, we cover all that stuff.
1489000	1491000	Tech stuff, we just did a whole episode on Google I.O.
1491000	1492000	Yeah, only Google I.O.
1492000	1493000	Yeah.
1493000	1498000	I mean, even in that episode we talked about the co-op, food co-op downtown, and all the natural foods and stuff.
1498000	1501000	So we kind of spread a giant range.
1501000	1502000	You know what?
1502000	1507000	Food issues speak to us here at Orange Lounge Radio, so I understand completely what you're getting at there.
1507000	1508000	But that's awesome.
1508000	1509000	You know what?
1509000	1512000	And I say that for anybody who's new, starting with podcasting and so forth.
1512000	1519000	Your first few episodes are likely to be terrible, or at least you're going to think they're terrible because we're our own worst critics, right?
1519000	1521000	And it's not going to necessarily be what you expected.
1521000	1522000	But you've got to stick with it, right?
1522000	1527000	If you have that plan, you say, I'm going to do this every Sunday, or in your guys' case, I'm going to do this every Wednesday, every Saturday.
1527000	1531000	You know, once you get to a certain point, it'll be like second nature, for sure.
1531000	1534000	Yeah, and it's become a part of just like everyday life now.
1534000	1536000	How long have you guys been going now at this point?
1536000	1537000	Three years.
1537000	1538000	Wow, good for you.
1538000	1539000	About three, three and a half years.
1539000	1540000	Congrats.
1540000	1543000	And I say it all the time, it's like therapy for me.
1543000	1547000	Like I can come after a long, hard day's work or something like that, and then sit.
1547000	1554000	And I've actually come from like, I came with my grandmother, passed away, came right to the show.
1554000	1556000	That's the interesting thing about the show.
1556000	1558000	You know, it's at my house most of the time.
1558000	1565000	I run the ones and twos, but I've missed a lot of episodes, you know, because we go to E3 and stuff.
1565000	1569000	But Aaron has held it down and not missed one episode of our entire history.
1569000	1570000	Nice.
1570000	1573000	Pretty remarkable, and got to give him kudos for that one.
1573000	1575000	You guys do an E3 this year?
1575000	1576000	Yes, sir.
1576000	1582000	We opted not to do it, which I'm not, you know, everybody's got to do what they got to do.
1582000	1588000	But I'm kind of curious because there's been a lot of talk about, is E3 losing relevance and all this stuff?
1588000	1590000	What's your guys' take on that whole situation?
1590000	1593000	Like, are you guys still expecting E3 to kick ass?
1593000	1596000	Are you going in with lowered expectations or what?
1596000	1599000	My expectations are like floor low.
1599000	1610000	It seems like it is losing steam because I think the big eye-opener for me was when last year Bethesda was like the number one.
1610000	1612000	It used to be who's going to win out of the big three.
1612000	1615000	Nintendo shows, Sony shows, Microsoft shows.
1615000	1621000	But then when a game company comes out and is like Fallout 4 mic drop and everybody for the rest of the event.
1621000	1624000	And have you guys played that new Doom? It kind of kicks ass.
1624000	1627000	And the Doom is, I mean, all from one company.
1627000	1633000	So it's just like, all right, they stole the show over three major companies.
1633000	1636000	It used to be a three-way battle.
1636000	1639000	Like, what happened to that, you know, the console wars?
1639000	1642000	I don't think the console wars are even that big of a thing anymore.
1642000	1645000	Now wait a minute, because some would, to be fair, some would argue with you,
1645000	1654000	because wasn't last year also the same year where Sony like literally just like peed glitter on everybody with this whole,
1654000	1659000	like, we're going to give you Shenmue 3 and the Final Fantasy 7 remake. God is real.
1659000	1664000	So we gave all the wishes and stuff like that.
1664000	1665000	Yes.
1665000	1672000	I don't know. I talked to a couple of people and I didn't hear any of them say I walked away wanting to be a Sony fan.
1672000	1674000	Like, I can't wait for Shenmue 3.
1674000	1680000	Yeah, there's a lot of games that they have coming out still that, like, I don't even think of, like, the names for,
1680000	1687000	like that one that was kind of the, like, retro futuristic, like almost like Monster Hunter type game.
1687000	1690000	Was it the one that looked like Rogue Cyberpunk?
1690000	1697000	Yeah, basically where it's, you know, technology has kind of taken over and there's like dinosaur robot things.
1697000	1701000	Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, the main female character, right?
1701000	1704000	Yeah, yeah. I can't remember the hell the names of the game's called.
1704000	1708000	But yeah, it's like stuff like that that I don't even think about, you know, consciously.
1708000	1710000	But that's coming and that looks really awesome.
1710000	1711000	Yeah.
1711000	1715000	You know, they had that stuff. But yeah, like right now this year there's, you know, Nintendo's like,
1715000	1718000	oh yeah, we're just going to show Zelda, which is cool. I mean.
1718000	1724000	Yeah, this is the first time where I feel like a company's like kind of set the bar low for themselves.
1724000	1727000	Like, don't expect nothing but Zelda. That's all you're going to see here.
1727000	1731000	Thank you, Dungeon Buster, Horizon Zero Dawn. That was the game I was thinking about.
1731000	1736000	But yeah, there's a lot of like games that they kind of show and a lot of it's just, I don't know.
1736000	1739000	I'm excited about Crackdown.
1739000	1740000	Well, there you go.
1740000	1743000	Eventually, whenever the hell that decides to come out.
1743000	1745000	I think it's this holiday. I think they're going to do it.
1745000	1746000	I hope so.
1746000	1750000	We'll see. I do love this comment from Stoppy though. It's in our chat, live.vognotework.com.
1751000	1756000	It's good that our expectations are low. Wait for some surprises to show up.
1756000	1758000	Then ask us whether E3 is still relevant.
1758000	1761000	I think that's a very good. I think that's a very good way to look at it.
1761000	1762000	That's very fair.
1762000	1766000	That's very fair because we may walk after this E3 going, oh my God, I didn't believe.
1766000	1770000	Oh my God. They announced it was out today. What the fuck?
1770000	1771000	Best show ever.
1771000	1774000	Yeah, I hope they do some. Oh, and it's out today, guys. Like, I really hope.
1774000	1777000	Oh, that's all. That's that's just one more thing.
1778000	1782000	That's the shit we live for. Because there's so few surprises in the industry anymore.
1782000	1783000	Everything's getting leaked.
1783000	1785000	Yeah. Thanks internet.
1785000	1786000	Yeah. Internet ruined everything.
1786000	1790000	But so it's like those genuine surprises that really can like stay under wraps.
1790000	1795000	I think that's part of what made Sony's press conference such a big.
1795000	1799000	I mean, in part, and I love Sony in part, it was a huge deflection from look at.
1799000	1802000	We have no holiday lineup, but here's some. Oh my God.
1802000	1804000	You guys, Shenmue three.
1804000	1809000	You know, everything is it was a Kickstarter, but that shit was was secret.
1809000	1814000	And that's what allowed that press conference to just blow minds.
1814000	1819000	I my thoughts on E3 a little different than Aaron's. Aaron is 100 percent.
1819000	1823000	He does not curse on our show. He does not drink any alcohol whatsoever.
1823000	1827000	So he's our church mouse. I like to partake.
1827000	1832000	And E3 has been some of the best parties in my life.
1832000	1837000	And see, I still consider us, even though we're technically going as press, I still feel like we're just guys.
1837000	1844000	Yeah. Yeah. Are super lucky. Yeah. At this point. So when we get invited to the parties, I like to just go in there and steal T-shirts.
1844000	1848000	I like to take all the order that you're going to get into the parties to. Oh, yeah.
1848000	1854000	The first E3 part, do you remember like the first E3 party you went to? Because I remember the first one I went to, I'm like, what am I doing here?
1854000	1860000	I remember I went to Nintendo's E3 party and they had who the hell do they have playing?
1860000	1866000	They had some big band playing. Black Eyed Peas. They had Black Eyed Peas.
1866000	1872000	Oh, God. Oh, that year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Because we got in because I not only was there as press,
1872000	1878000	but I also worked in the industry. So I got invited with my co-workers and stuff to go there.
1878000	1885000	I mean, it was lame. But, you know, I remember I got yelled at for like filming Black Eyed Peas playing.
1885000	1890000	They're like, stop that. Stop that. Well, they were doing you a favor, Loki. Yeah.
1890000	1895000	I'll tell you what I remember, because I was a DDR freak moderator at the time.
1895000	1901000	DDR freak parties where we did nothing but just drink and play taboo drunk.
1901000	1906000	But but that you but OK, but that was that was a lot more fun.
1906000	1911000	That was an invite only private thing. Benson, that's a lot more fun than going to this industry party.
1911000	1915000	Oh, really? OK. Because I don't like to be around a bunch of people.
1915000	1921000	I don't know. Elbowing people, I don't know. And drinking awkwardly in the corner, looking at a bunch of people.
1921000	1926000	I listed three of my favorite things. And I think that I love elbowing people.
1926000	1931000	I don't know. I think that's just personality stuff for sure, because some people don't like to be in those unfamiliar situations.
1931000	1935000	I'm kind of like I'm like kind of like on the fence. Like I do like my environment to be controlled a little bit.
1935000	1940000	But I get what you're saying. Like, you know, sometimes you just want to be social and go meet everybody.
1940000	1945000	And this is my time to network, network, network. And I go into solo mode at those things.
1945000	1950000	I go into solo mode at conventions. I go into solo mode at E3 every time that I went.
1950000	1955000	It's just I avoid every other human being and zigzag through the crowds and go to where I want to go.
1955000	1961000	Talk to who I want to talk. And then I move on. Well, it's also hard to know, especially even though you get in as pressed.
1961000	1967000	You're not an IGN, so we can't talk to you. I used to turn my way into conferences, though.
1967000	1972000	Yeah. Jamie was very good. Like, even though she's talking about this whole thing, she's very good at getting what she wanted.
1972000	1977000	Because all you have to do is just look cute and talk to the Capcom people.
1977000	1979000	Well, I tried, Jamie. I tried.
1979000	1981000	Not everyone can be me, Rob.
1981000	1989000	My first one was the Wargaming party. They threw a party and it was like, you remember Blade? The first party scene?
1989000	1991000	That's what it felt like to me.
1991000	1993000	So people died? Is that what you're saying?
1993000	1995000	It was full of vampires.
1995000	1997000	Did Wesley Snipes show up and not pay taxes?
1997000	1999000	There was a dude who looked just like Wesley Snipes.
1999000	2001000	You were crawling on the floor and everything.
2001000	2003000	But it was the most fun I've had.
2003000	2009000	Web, actually, honestly, the reason why Web is our solid number three is because I kind of owe him my life.
2009000	2013000	We went to a Twitch party once, an industry party, and if it wasn't for him, I probably would have died.
2013000	2017000	Because it came to a moment where we were with another one of our members, Jada.
2017000	2024000	And there was these guys, Puerto Rican dudes from Miami, because they let us know a million times they're from Miami.
2025000	2027000	Like, bitch, you're from a suburb.
2029000	2032000	It was like in Telltale when you see the two paths.
2032000	2037000	And Jada and these Puerto Rican guys were going to go off into the night and do who knows what.
2037000	2039000	And then Web was like, dude, let's go back to the hotel room.
2039000	2045000	And so life paused, I looked both ways, and I ended up going with Web.
2045000	2050000	Sure enough, next thing we get a phone call in the morning from Jada, where are you guys?
2050000	2055000	And I just hear, who are you talking to? Thank you, Web.
2055000	2062000	Well, that was my first really big convention, and so I was really wanting to be professional.
2062000	2066000	I had interviews the next day, so I didn't want to be hungover talking to the guy from XSplit.
2066000	2072000	And this guy, that was our second party, and you had definitely partaken.
2073000	2081000	And yeah, I was like, it's midnight, it's San Francisco, we gotta walk back, maybe we should head back.
2081000	2082000	Web will remember that.
2082000	2083000	Yeah.
2085000	2090000	Oh my gosh. Okay, so before we get into like gaming weeks and everything, I just kind of want to know like you guys as gamers,
2090000	2094000	and I always ask new people to OLR this question, so I'll ask you guys as well.
2094000	2103000	Your favorite video game, and you gotta pick one, of all time, of period, all period, time period, and why?
2103000	2106000	My answer never changes, it's always Tetris.
2106000	2107000	Really?
2107000	2114000	Hands down, Tetris. I can play that game in every different iteration.
2114000	2122000	And I just, since high school, to a little bit of college, to now, Tetris is just my jam.
2122000	2126000	That's what I love about it. I mean, it's a different game each time I try it.
2126000	2127000	Huh.
2127000	2136000	And it's the only game that I can think of that has kind of stayed true to its original in almost every single iteration.
2136000	2139000	Well, we'll ignore the Hatris and the Welltris.
2139000	2140000	Well yeah, there's others.
2140000	2141000	We'll just ignore all of them.
2141000	2142000	It's all about Blastris.
2142000	2143000	But I get what you're saying.
2143000	2145000	I got a question from the chatroom.
2145000	2150000	D'Artessio wants to know which Tetris? Nintendo, Tengen, Atari, or Rika?
2150000	2151000	Nintendo.
2151000	2156000	I played it on a whole bunch of different platforms. I even played it on Mac one time.
2156000	2158000	Game Boy or NES?
2158000	2160000	Game Boy.
2160000	2161000	Okay, yeah.
2161000	2163000	I prefer Game Boy over NES.
2163000	2165000	So did you do Tetranet?
2165000	2168000	No. I did not.
2168000	2169000	Is that still a thing?
2169000	2173000	I don't know, but I did Tetranet for like four years.
2173000	2177000	Do you like the new Tetrises? Like, Ubisoft did one on the PlayStation 4 that's like,
2178000	2180000	Tetris Ultimate!
2180000	2182000	No, they're kind of weird now.
2182000	2186000	Like, there was one I played, I think, on the 360, Tetris Bubble?
2186000	2187000	Or something like that.
2187000	2189000	And I was like, what is this?
2189000	2193000	There was the one that I think I peeked out and just said, alright, this is the final one.
2193000	2196000	It was Tetris on the Game Boy Advance. Tetris Advance.
2196000	2198000	And it kind of stopped.
2198000	2199000	Wasn't there a DS1?
2199000	2201000	I think the DS1 was like the best one they did.
2201000	2203000	Oh, you know what? Yes. The DS1.
2203000	2205000	I played online versus people.
2205000	2209000	And I remember, I played on a friend's, and he was like, you're gonna play online? You're gonna get crushed.
2209000	2212000	And I smashed everybody I went against.
2212000	2215000	And the DS1 is like Tetranet, if I remember right.
2215000	2217000	Like, they took some good ideas from the multiplayer there.
2217000	2221000	So if you've played multiplayer DS, you kind of know Tetranet.
2221000	2225000	So Tetranet is still a thing, although the last update I have is from 2012.
2225000	2228000	But it's six person multiplayer online Tetris.
2228000	2230000	Oh my god, we need to set up a server.
2230000	2233000	Bobby, how much would a VoG server cost for Tetranet?
2235000	2239000	That'll get more use than the Team Fortress 2 thing, I guarantee it.
2239000	2241000	And the Minecraft server.
2241000	2243000	And the Minecraft server.
2243000	2245000	So Tetris, that actually is a great answer.
2245000	2247000	Well, I mean, they're all gonna be great, I'm not gonna tell you.
2247000	2249000	That's a shitty answer. Get out of my house!
2249000	2252000	But, you know, Tetris just, you're right.
2252000	2256000	It's like, the game itself, the core game just hasn't changed yet.
2256000	2261000	It's like, this story's been being told for 20 plus years now.
2261000	2264000	And it'll all come to fruition when the Tetris movie comes out and you guys are gonna love it.
2264000	2267000	We shall see. We'll get to that in a little bit.
2267000	2269000	Corey, how about you?
2269000	2272000	I have more of a plebe answer.
2272000	2278000	I have a few games that impacted me major throughout my life that I just sunk so many hours into.
2278000	2285000	Like Super Mario World, Tekken, and even like the wrestling games.
2285000	2288000	Like, you know, WCW versus NWO.
2288000	2293000	But I have to say Halo 2 is my favorite all-time.
2293000	2295000	You're gonna win a lot of fans here at OLR with that answer.
2295000	2298000	Well, I was like in a clan. No offense, Aaron.
2298000	2299000	Yeah, wow.
2299000	2304000	But I was the commander of a clan as like a high schooler.
2304000	2307000	The high wizard? Is that what you were?
2307000	2311000	No, we were a DoG. I had my own branch called...
2311000	2313000	You were a dog clan leader?
2313000	2315000	I was a dog clan leader. Decisals of gaming.
2315000	2319000	So you were the head bitch in charge.
2319000	2320000	That's accurate.
2320000	2321000	That's very accurate.
2321000	2322000	Never thought of it that way.
2322000	2323000	That's definitely very accurate.
2323000	2327000	But it was so much fun, man. We organized tournaments.
2327000	2333000	We brought in new members. We had to run through the do's and don'ts of being in our clan.
2333000	2337000	You don't circle boost. You don't quit out of matches.
2337000	2341000	You don't teabag. You don't use races. We would do all these things.
2341000	2343000	And we'd compete against KSI.
2343000	2346000	You don't have racism in your clan?
2346000	2348000	No, there's no racism. We did not allow for it.
2349000	2351000	As backwards as that sound.
2351000	2352000	Wow, yeah.
2352000	2358000	But no, I spent a lot of time. And that kind of really pumped me up for gaming again.
2358000	2361000	Because we all play games as kids.
2361000	2364000	Then it feels like something has to happen in that transitional period.
2364000	2369000	To where you're like, okay, I want to continue doing this and not play basketball or football or something like that.
2369000	2372000	And it was Halo. So Halo 2 is my favorite.
2372000	2379000	Halo 2 is such a... I mean, as much as we have the inside jokes here on OLR about why Halo is not going to be the classic game of the week.
2379000	2381000	And Jamie's things and all that stuff.
2381000	2387000	We all have to admit Halo 2 and the way that it pushed Xbox Live forward.
2387000	2390000	Games are forever changed because of it.
2390000	2395000	I mean, really. In a way, I don't want to be this direct about it, but I guess I'm going to be.
2395000	2398000	Halo 2 kind of killed the arcade. In a way.
2398000	2400000	I can see that, yeah.
2401000	2406000	Just from the soundtrack. That's the only game where I had a soundtrack.
2406000	2411000	And I'd listen to it over and over again on my MP3. My Zoom player.
2411000	2413000	It was like movie-style quality music.
2413000	2417000	Oh, yeah. And then that guitar riff. I was a rock guy.
2417000	2423000	When they put Steve Vai on the track, I was just bought. I was sold.
2423000	2425000	Satriani? I can't remember.
2425000	2426000	Love it.
2427000	2430000	I was going to say David, but I noticed they call you Web. Should I be calling you Web?
2430000	2432000	Yeah, that's fine. I'm used to that.
2432000	2434000	Web! Your top game.
2434000	2438000	Mine's similar to Quarry, but it's Halo 1. The first Halo.
2438000	2441000	That got me... That was kind of like Quarry.
2441000	2445000	Halo 2 was this serious game that got him into gaming, and Halo was mine.
2445000	2447000	Were you in a clan as well?
2447000	2449000	Were you in a clan as well?
2450000	2452000	Halo 1 was not live.
2452000	2453000	Well, you could LAN.
2453000	2455000	Right. Which is... I did that every weekend.
2455000	2460000	Every Friday night after high school, we'd go grab our Xboxes, meet up at a friend's house.
2460000	2463000	We had... His parents, for some reason, let us do that.
2463000	2470000	But we had five TVs in five different rooms, and we're whispering to each other in the same room trying to like...
2470000	2471000	Yeah.
2471000	2473000	True story. That was my husband's bachelor party.
2473000	2475000	That's an awesome bachelor party.
2476000	2477000	A Halo LAN.
2477000	2478000	That's legit.
2478000	2480000	Do you know the first time I ever got exposed to Halo?
2480000	2484000	Because I had always kind of written it off as like... That's kind of like... It seems like more of a bro game.
2484000	2486000	I don't know if that's something I'd really be into.
2486000	2488000	First time I ever played Halo.
2488000	2489000	Shit you not.
2489000	2493000	I went to a wedding, and the bride and the groom came down the aisle to the music from Halo.
2493000	2499000	And then the reception was a bunch of TVs with Xboxes, and we played LAN Halo.
2499000	2502000	Swear to God, to this day, one of the best weddings I ever went to.
2502000	2503000	That's amazing.
2503000	2507000	And I bought an Xbox not even a month later.
2507000	2508000	Yeah.
2508000	2510000	It's light red.
2510000	2511000	What?
2511000	2513000	It's lightish red, it's not pink.
2513000	2518000	But anyway, I ended up buying the Xbox not even a month later.
2518000	2520000	Because I was sold on Halo.
2520000	2523000	And this was even before the Xbox Live and all that.
2523000	2525000	It's unfortunate what's happened to the franchise.
2525000	2530000	I mean, I fell off, you know, shortly after 3.
2530000	2533000	Because 3 was good and all, but they got rid of the clans.
2533000	2537000	And so with that, I lost a lot of the people I played with all the time.
2537000	2539000	And then, you know, life kind of takes over.
2539000	2545000	But man, Halo 2 with the BXRs and the super bounces is just redonkulous.
2545000	2549000	Let me ask this quickly, since you guys are not shy for controversy.
2549000	2552000	Let me ask a controversial question in the Halo universe.
2552000	2557000	How do you guys feel about Destiny, which is in some ways supposed to be the spiritual successor to Halo in some ways?
2557000	2558000	How do y'all feel about that?
2558000	2562000	This has been a hot topic in our show.
2562000	2564000	Yay, ratings! That means ratings!
2564000	2566000	Yeah, right?
2566000	2569000	Aaron has always been anti-Destiny.
2569000	2571000	I wouldn't say always.
2571000	2573000	99% of the time.
2573000	2577000	The first time somebody at Bungie said Destiny, I was excited.
2577000	2579000	Just the word Destiny got you excited.
2579000	2583000	Then, yeah, the more they revealed, before they even revealed gameplay.
2583000	2588000	When they were talking about the story and what they wanted to do, I was all on board.
2588000	2592000	But then when I saw what they did, I aborted that mission.
2592000	2594000	That was done.
2594000	2600000	I was at the E3 right before the launch, and I got to do a meeting with Bungie.
2600000	2603000	The outlet we go with is Nerd Reactor.
2603000	2606000	I was like, you have to give me this one, because I'm a huge Bungie fan.
2606000	2607000	You have to put me there.
2607000	2610000	The guy who was walking me through the game was a developer.
2610000	2612000	He was like, so you played some of our other games?
2612000	2616000	Of course, because these guys are like, they knew I knew who they were.
2616000	2620000	He's like, yeah, I actually did development on Halo 2.
2620000	2622000	I was like, puppy-eyed.
2622000	2625000	I started playing the game with him, instructing me.
2625000	2628000	He's like, why don't you jump on that sparrow, young lad?
2628000	2632000	I jump on the sparrow, and I was like, wow, this thing reacts just like a ghost.
2632000	2634000	He's like, no, no, no, no, it's not a ghost.
2634000	2636000	It's a sparrow. It's way different.
2636000	2639000	I jump off, and I grab a shotgun, and I start blasting.
2639000	2642000	I was like, those guys look just like elites.
2642000	2644000	This shotgun reacts just like the shotgun.
2644000	2646000	I'm saying it as a compliment, because I love the game.
2646000	2648000	He's like, no, no, that shotgun's way different.
2648000	2650000	Those are not elites. That's the fall.
2650000	2653000	It's just thing after thing.
2653000	2656000	I was like, bro, don't hide it. It's fine.
2656000	2659000	Are you sure this isn't a skim? Is this just DLC right here?
2659000	2660000	That's all I expected.
2660000	2662000	This is Halo 2, isn't it?
2662000	2664000	That's an awesome story.
2664000	2667000	That's a perfect E3 story, too, right there.
2667000	2669000	That's how it is. I bought it hook, line, and sinker.
2669000	2670000	Got the game day one.
2670000	2673000	Played it pretty consistently for about four to six months.
2673000	2675000	And then just got super bored.
2675000	2681000	Once you beat it all, because you can beat it in a week, not even.
2681000	2683000	It's just a few days to really hit max level.
2683000	2687000	They still have those really passionate fans, though, for it.
2687000	2691000	You can beat it, and you max, and you get everything you wanted, all the gear.
2691000	2694000	But they still have those passionate fans for some reason.
2694000	2698000	To be fair, I need to go back and probably check out Destiny at some point.
2698000	2701000	I played it hard for a month or whatever,
2701000	2705000	but I was just really frustrated in the endgame that you needed light to level up.
2705000	2708000	And I was like, what kind of fucking system is this?
2708000	2711000	I never knew you could single-handedly screw your entire game by messing up the endgame.
2711000	2713000	That's where my head was at.
2713000	2716000	But I heard they kind of went back and changed a lot of that.
2716000	2719000	Let me ask you guys how you feel about this,
2719000	2723000	because this is one weird trend we've had just in the past five years in gaming,
2723000	2728000	is that you can fix your game with a patch.
2728000	2733000	Because Final Fantasy XIV, I don't know if you guys are into MMOs or any of that type of stuff,
2733000	2736000	but Final Fantasy XIV was absolute garbage when it first came out.
2736000	2739000	It was garbage MMO, one of the worst I've ever played.
2739000	2741000	Now, probably the best one on the market.
2741000	2744000	And I wonder how many people really went back and gave it a second chance.
2744000	2745000	Amazing.
2745000	2748000	Diablo III, not so great when it first came out.
2748000	2750000	Now I can't stop playing it.
2750000	2753000	Destiny, a lot of people have actually compared to Diablo III.
2753000	2755000	Webb, what are your thoughts on that?
2755000	2760000	Yeah, because I was the longest playing Destiny player in the group,
2760000	2763000	and I kind of related to cocaine.
2763000	2766000	Cocaine is really hard to drop, and so was Destiny.
2766000	2767000	You speak from experience.
2767000	2768000	I do, yeah.
2768000	2771000	You can't see me, but I have scars on my...
2771000	2773000	Yeah, it was really...
2773000	2776000	Especially because I put so much money into it with the two expansions,
2776000	2780000	and then after I played the second expansion,
2780000	2783000	just because I had already prepaid for it,
2783000	2785000	I was going to drop it, and then the new one came out,
2785000	2787000	Taken King, and I was like,
2787000	2789000	okay, it looks like they fixed some stuff,
2789000	2792000	but really they just polished a turd and make it look shinier
2792000	2795000	to distract you from it's still a turd.
2795000	2798000	Couple thoughts on first impressions for video games.
2798000	2802000	They're so important, especially for me and you, I'm sure.
2802000	2804000	We've got stuff to do. We're doing podcasts.
2804000	2807000	We're doing appearances. We're doing articles.
2807000	2809000	We have to stay up on what's hot.
2809000	2811000	We have to keep playing the new games.
2811000	2813000	You have my attention for a short time.
2813000	2818000	The biggest example I have is Assassin's Creed Unity.
2818000	2820000	So bad. Unplayable.
2820000	2822000	I'm sure they patched it up, and it's fine,
2822000	2824000	but I just don't have time to go back and play it,
2824000	2825000	and it didn't hook me.
2825000	2828000	The other one for me is Division, and just bad timing.
2828000	2829000	Wow.
2829000	2831000	First time I played, of course, servers are down.
2831000	2833000	I get it the first night, and I'm excited.
2833000	2836000	Nothing launches good anymore. I've come to realize that.
2836000	2837000	Yeah, no.
2837000	2838000	I get it. It doesn't work.
2838000	2840000	I decide a week later, oh, let's play.
2840000	2842000	Aaron gets on. Web's on. I'm on.
2842000	2844000	I sit down to play my game.
2844000	2846000	Okay, there's an update, so I wait three hours for an update.
2846000	2848000	Get to play the game,
2848000	2850000	and they take the servers down for maintenance.
2850000	2852000	Never tried to play the game again.
2852000	2855000	Yeah, the whole thing of we can fix a game.
2855000	2858000	Just put it out there. We'll fix it later.
2858000	2860000	That's definitely a trend.
2860000	2863000	It's a very poor trend.
2863000	2866000	But when you have to rehaul a whole game,
2866000	2868000	like how you said they did with Final Fantasy,
2868000	2871000	how they did with the system for Destiny,
2871000	2875000	I wrote an article saying, are these just tests?
2875000	2877000	Like, are they putting these games out just to see,
2877000	2880000	hey, do you like that? No? Okay, then we'll just wipe it all.
2880000	2882000	And I got, first comment was like,
2882000	2883000	you don't know what you're talking about.
2883000	2886000	Actually, I said, was Destiny one giant test?
2886000	2888000	And, yeah, my first comment was like,
2888000	2890000	oh, you have no idea what you're talking about.
2890000	2892000	The game was amazing.
2892000	2894000	And I was just like, I just want you to think.
2894000	2897000	I didn't want you to, like, I'm not saying it was.
2897000	2899000	Besides Destiny's Horde endgame,
2899000	2902000	I can get around some of that, but what really killed it for me
2902000	2905000	was how they abused the fans monetarily.
2905000	2908000	Like, they screwed everyone who bought the game
2908000	2911000	and who was an early adapter when they came out with that big expansion.
2911000	2915000	First of all, that expansion didn't come with the pre-purchase version of it.
2915000	2919000	And then second of all, they released a full retail version
2919000	2921000	where if you bought the original game and the DLC,
2921000	2923000	it was like standard price.
2923000	2926000	But if you bought the game, you know, spent 60 bucks before,
2926000	2928000	just for the DLC by itself, it was 40 bucks.
2928000	2931000	Yeah, so you're well into the century mark
2931000	2934000	by the time you're playing the latest stuff with everybody, right?
2934000	2937000	Yeah, reward the people who are playing your game and making it what it is.
2937000	2939000	I can't stand when people do that.
2939000	2941000	That was the good news about XIV when they rebooted it,
2941000	2944000	was that if you were an early adopter, you got the new one for free.
2944000	2946000	So that was kind of nice.
2946000	2949000	Jamie, I thought I saw you trying to jump in on the whole Destiny stuff.
2949000	2951000	I was just more saying this way.
2951000	2954000	I think that BioWare is doing the right thing with Mass Effect Andromeda
2954000	2958000	by delaying the release until they know they have a polished product.
2958000	2960000	And honestly, it's like I've said before,
2960000	2966000	I would rather wait for something good than, you know, have a turd.
2966000	2968000	I mean, really enough.
2968000	2970000	Isn't it interesting, though, that most people, I think,
2970000	2972000	will agree with you in what you're saying and they accept that,
2972000	2974000	but yet when it comes to the Nintendo NX,
2974000	2977000	a lot of people are having a difficulty swallowing that pill.
2977000	2979000	What do you mean you're going to launch a console outside of Christmas?
2979000	2982000	What are you doing, Nintendo? You're going to shoot yourself in the foot.
2982000	2985000	Isn't that interesting? I don't know.
2985000	2987000	I've got to see what that thing does.
2987000	2992000	It's too much of a nobody knows what it's going to be about.
2992000	2995000	There's a whole bunch of rumors and speculations what it might be.
2995000	2998000	I mean, I have no problem with them dropping it summer or something like that,
2998000	3001000	but just let me see what it is.
3001000	3003000	Yeah, tease me already.
3003000	3004000	God.
3004000	3006000	Where's that little video they had with the Wii remote
3006000	3008000	where they just showed people chopping things
3008000	3010000	and then they had all the sound effects?
3010000	3012000	They didn't show you any graphics, any gameplay.
3012000	3014000	They showed a remote and then people moving it,
3014000	3017000	and they were like, just imagine, and then they left,
3017000	3019000	and then they came back and told you what the actual remote did,
3019000	3021000	Wii Sports and all that other stuff.
3021000	3023000	And, and I can't stress this enough, and then we'll end on this
3023000	3025000	and move on to our gaming weeks,
3025000	3029000	but Nintendo has got to have that game that sells that concept
3029000	3032000	because Wii Sports sold the Wii.
3032000	3034000	Tetris sold the Game Boy.
3034000	3036000	Super Mario Brothers.
3036000	3038000	Duck Hunt sold the original NES.
3038000	3042000	If Nintendo, Nintendo Land did not sell the Wii U,
3042000	3045000	that's how, I mean, but that, we laugh,
3045000	3048000	but that's how important that launch game is.
3048000	3050000	Yeah, you could say the same, going back to Halo.
3050000	3053000	Halo is what made the Xbox one.
3053000	3055000	But did it, was Halo a launch game for Xbox?
3055000	3056000	I don't even remember.
3056000	3058000	It wasn't a launch, number one.
3058000	3061000	It was damn close. It was the first couple months.
3061000	3065000	It had me, me and my friends sat in Fry's until it closed playing that,
3065000	3067000	and they never put it up again,
3067000	3069000	and it definitely sold us on.
3069000	3071000	Yeah, by the time I got, I remember my, my original Xbox was different.
3071000	3073000	It was actually like a Halo Xbox.
3073000	3075000	It was like green and transparent. It was all like weird, different.
3075000	3077000	Oh, yeah, that one, yeah, I remember that one.
3077000	3079000	Yeah, it was a nice looking system.
3079000	3084000	All right, anyway, let's see, going to our comments over at Live.vognetware.com.
3084000	3085000	Bobby Blackwolf confirming,
3085000	3087000	Halo was a launch title on the original Xbox.
3087000	3089000	It absolutely was.
3089000	3091000	Dr. Su is saying, just, Halo didn't have live support.
3091000	3093000	It just wasn't up at the time.
3093000	3096000	Dungeon Buster says, I'm tired of the NX rumors at this point.
3096000	3099000	OMG, they're using colors on the case, whatever.
3099000	3105000	Kaijuto saying, in his perspective, Wii Sports didn't sell the Wii.
3105000	3107000	The Wii sold the Wii.
3107000	3111000	Wii Sports would come, people would come into GameStop all the time
3111000	3114000	with their scratched copies, like, do I, I need another one.
3114000	3115000	I need my fix.
3115000	3116000	Give me another hit.
3116000	3117000	Yeah.
3117000	3122000	I will say, Microsoft was not the first one to have multicolored systems.
3122000	3123000	Oh, no.
3124000	3127000	The Dreamcast had that clear white one that came out in Canada.
3127000	3128000	And the Hello Kitty one.
3128000	3130000	The Hello Kitty ones that came out in Japan.
3130000	3133000	And then there was also a blue one that came out in Europe.
3133000	3134000	Yeah.
3134000	3135000	And...
3135000	3137000	I guess Dreamcast would have been the first one,
3137000	3140000	because they didn't really have, like, different colors on Super Nintendo's, Nintendo's, Genesis.
3140000	3141000	N64 had a...
3141000	3143000	Oh, that's right.
3143000	3146000	I had a Pikachu N64.
3146000	3149000	Yeah, I had like a, I had a, the basic gray one,
3149000	3151000	but then my neighbor had the blue one.
3151000	3154000	Donkey Kong Country Bundle or whatever it was there.
3154000	3156000	And then on my Nintendo, I had a Sharpie.
3158000	3159000	Alright.
3159000	3161000	Let's get into Our Gaming Weeks.
3161000	3163000	We're almost an hour into the show, haven't hit a single story,
3163000	3164000	but that's what happens here at OLR.
3164000	3165000	Oh, whatever.
3165000	3168000	Especially now it's two podcasts, so it's like, it's gotta be like,
3168000	3170000	it's gonna be a gigantic show.
3170000	3171000	Four hour show.
3171000	3173000	But no, I really do want to thank you guys for being here this week
3173000	3174000	and bantering with us.
3174000	3175000	It's awesome, man.
3175000	3176000	Good time, good time.
3176000	3178000	So we'll get into the news here shortly, as well as Our Gaming Weeks.
3178000	3180000	I think it's really where we want to start off.
3180000	3182000	So quickly, since there are so many of us this week,
3182000	3184000	we'll just kind of hit a few highlights of Our Gaming Weeks.
3184000	3186000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
3186000	3187000	There's Sakura.
3187000	3190000	I got a terabyte hard drive to add into my system.
3190000	3193000	So I've moved my entire Steam library over and my Origin library.
3193000	3195000	So I have actually played a little bit of everything,
3195000	3197000	just to make sure it worked.
3197000	3199000	I've reinstalled Dragon Age Inquisition.
3199000	3200000	I have to remod it.
3200000	3202000	I have to remod Mass Effect 3.
3202000	3204000	I've been playing some Danganronpa 2.
3204000	3206000	I'm still not to the second trial,
3206000	3208000	so Shane's probably going to yell at me.
3208000	3211000	I've played some Happy Home Designer.
3211000	3218000	I have Ingress, which, oh, my God, I am so close to eight.
3218000	3221000	I don't care what Jason said in our intro.
3221000	3224000	I'm going to keep playing Ingress because I'm going to hit freaking level eight
3224000	3226000	this week, if I can help it.
3226000	3228000	Rob, you're helping me level tonight.
3228000	3230000	I've got some issues with Ingress.
3230000	3231000	We'll talk about that a little later in the show.
3231000	3232000	Issues?
3232000	3234000	Yeah, we'll talk about that a little later in the show.
3234000	3239000	And also, I'm still stuck on the Dragon Age.
3239000	3242000	Here's a Dragon Age thing on iOS.
3242000	3247000	And I actually am going to be getting a controller for my Apple TV
3247000	3251000	so I can play Sonic CD on my Apple TV.
3251000	3259000	I think a $64 controller that only works with my Apple TV would be worth it.
3259000	3261000	People do crazy things to play the one game.
3261000	3263000	People do crazy things for love.
3263000	3264000	That's right.
3264000	3267000	With a good soundtrack, Bobby, with the Japanese one, which is the best one.
3267000	3269000	Don't sass me.
3269000	3272000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I do that when I get a new TV.
3272000	3276000	I have to play all the games on my consoles just to make sure they work on my new TV.
3276000	3279000	How often do you buy new TVs, Bobby?
3279000	3283000	Oh, we also had Killer Instinct on Super Nintendo today.
3283000	3284000	This is important.
3284000	3285000	It is very important.
3285000	3289000	And we gave away one of our Super Nintendos, one of our six ones.
3289000	3291000	Why not me?
3291000	3292000	We have six Super Nintendos.
3292000	3293000	There's one.
3293000	3294000	Somewhere.
3294000	3295000	I gave you games.
3295000	3296000	I don't have six.
3296000	3297000	Yeah, you can borrow some of our spares.
3297000	3298000	All right.
3298000	3299000	But we gave it to a young-
3299000	3301000	It doesn't have a portable game system.
3301000	3304000	Yeah, I also have the Retron, so it's like if I want to play any of that.
3304000	3308000	We gave it to a young person to introduce him to the history of gaming.
3308000	3313000	And I'm going to be buying Julian Mega Man 2 because he watched some of the playthroughs going,
3313000	3315000	this game's cool.
3315000	3316000	Good.
3316000	3317000	Raise him right.
3317000	3318000	Good boy.
3318000	3319000	Julian is an eight-year-old boy.
3319000	3320000	Yes.
3320000	3321000	Very good.
3321000	3322000	So we'll just go in a big circle here.
3322000	3323000	Webb, I'll go to you next.
3323000	3324000	How was your gaming week?
3324000	3325000	It was slow.
3325000	3328000	I'm in the middle of a move, so I haven't been able to play a lot.
3328000	3333000	But I did play some Smite earlier on in the week with these guys.
3333000	3338000	Yeah, it was like each couple nights this week we played like two, three hours.
3338000	3339000	Yeah.
3339000	3340000	Just smiting about.
3340000	3341000	Just play again.
3341000	3342000	Just play again.
3342000	3343000	You guys ever play it?
3343000	3345000	Honestly, no.
3345000	3348000	And the reason why, well, but I have more and more friends that are getting into it.
3348000	3350000	It's probably in my Steam library.
3350000	3351000	I just haven't checked.
3351000	3352000	Well, it's free.
3352000	3353000	It's free.
3353000	3355000	It's on PS4 and Xbox One and all that.
3355000	3358000	It's kind of like League of Legends, but my understanding is the big twist is it's more
3358000	3360000	like from like a Warcraft perspective where it's like over the shoulder.
3360000	3361000	Yeah, third person.
3361000	3362000	That type of thing.
3362000	3363000	Yeah, right?
3363000	3364000	And a lot friendlier community.
3364000	3365000	Okay, good.
3365000	3369000	Because that's what I'm afraid of because when I play League of Legends, oh my, no,
3369000	3374000	like I heard better things in high school than I hear on League of Legends.
3374000	3378000	Heroes of the Storm, I like that because I feel like it's dumbed down for someone like
3378000	3379000	me.
3379000	3381000	I feel like Heroes of the Storm is kind of like easy mode.
3381000	3382000	And I think that's what Blizzard does.
3382000	3385000	Not that Blizzard does everything easy mode, but I think Blizzard does a very good job
3385000	3388000	at like mass marketing a good idea.
3388000	3390000	So that's why I kind of like Heroes of the Storm.
3390000	3393000	It's very, very like commercial and easy to get into.
3393000	3396000	So that's kind of what's always held me back on smite is that I'm like, oh God, I'm
3396000	3398000	going to be terrible and they're going to eat me alive because they do emo.
3398000	3406000	Yeah, no, that community is like a 180 from League and you might get one toxic person
3406000	3411000	every six games, but that's a very forgettable person like real quick.
3411000	3415000	Is Corey leading the smite clan where he has all these rules?
3415000	3416000	You're not going to do this?
3416000	3417000	You're not going to be a respectable gamer?
3417000	3419000	Aaron would break the racism rule too quickly.
3419000	3424000	No, I believe I play the most out of everybody.
3424000	3426000	No, there's probably one other guy, Jerry.
3426000	3433000	He probably plays more than I do, but definitely I play a crazy amount of that game.
3433000	3437000	I think that the community, I think it's probably just as toxic as League, but it's
3437000	3439000	a lot harder to talk shit on a controller.
3439000	3441000	Yeah, there's another good point.
3441000	3443000	I think most people are using controllers.
3443000	3444000	Yeah.
3444000	3445000	God.
3445000	3446000	So you guys are playing on like Xbox one.
3446000	3447000	I played on the PC.
3447000	3448000	Yeah.
3448000	3449000	Oh yeah.
3449000	3450000	We all play on the PC.
3450000	3451000	That's the one good thing about the game though.
3451000	3455000	Cause Aaron always has issues with PC because there's like the skill gap between mouse and
3455000	3457000	keyboard typically and, and controller.
3457000	3458000	Right.
3458000	3461000	And in smite, it really seems like that's nullified.
3461000	3466000	Like you can do work with just a controller and throw down with people using keyboard
3466000	3467000	mouse.
3467000	3468000	Yeah.
3468000	3469000	Yeah.
3469000	3470000	You can go toe to toe.
3470000	3472000	Like you can think of a first person shooter versus, you know, controls versus a mouse
3472000	3473000	and keyboard.
3473000	3474000	Mouse and keyboard smashes all the time.
3474000	3475000	Right.
3475000	3476000	That's why I bought Doom on PC.
3476000	3477000	Exactly.
3477000	3478000	Yeah.
3478000	3480000	But when it comes to smite, it's like you're on a level playing field.
3480000	3482000	Like, yeah, you couldn't tell the difference.
3482000	3483000	Yeah.
3483000	3486000	Like the, the game I do play a lot of Fung-Hezi 14, you know, that exists on PlayStation four
3486000	3488000	and PC and I got to say they did a good job.
3488000	3490000	So I feel like they're figuring it out now.
3490000	3491000	Yeah.
3491000	3492000	Yeah.
3492000	3493000	You can do PVP with the PlayStation four people.
3493000	3494000	I'm on PC and it's there.
3494000	3495000	It's toe to toe.
3495000	3496000	It's, it's same, same.
3496000	3497000	Okay.
3497000	3498000	So smite.
3498000	3499000	Awesome.
3499000	3500000	Cool.
3500000	3501000	Uh, Corey, what about you?
3501000	3503000	Well, I did play smite with them earlier in the week.
3503000	3507000	I made some time to, uh, start playing fallout four again.
3507000	3510000	Uh, I'm not jumping into the DLC quite yet.
3510000	3514000	The far Harbor stuff, because I, I started a new, uh, I don't know.
3514000	3516000	Did you get a press copy of fallout four?
3516000	3517000	No.
3517000	3518000	Okay.
3519000	3520000	Yeah.
3520000	3521000	So I'm in my version and we played through and it was the first time I've seen this.
3521000	3522000	It said press copy.
3522000	3528000	And as soon as the, uh, game launched, it disappeared out of my steam library.
3528000	3529000	So that was like pretty cheesed.
3529000	3531000	It took me a while before I got it back.
3531000	3535000	And in, in the interim I had to redo my computer, so I lost my save file.
3535000	3536000	Interesting.
3536000	3540000	I thought I'd heard about that, that they like had pulled it from steam libraries and
3540000	3541000	stuff.
3541000	3542000	It was kind of interesting.
3542000	3543000	Yeah.
3543000	3544000	So it took me a while to get back.
3544000	3546680	So I'm in my second play through having a very hard time getting through the story for
3546680	3550560	a second time, just because it's so bad.
3550560	3551560	But I'm almost there.
3551560	3554200	And then once I get through that, I'll start playing the DLC.
3554200	3560880	I also got to do my regular street fighter five training and then that's, that's been
3560880	3561880	my week.
3561880	3562880	All right.
3562880	3564280	Aaron, what about you?
3564280	3565400	Lots of smite of course.
3565400	3571760	Um, and then I literally on my phone, I picked up this game called a color switch.
3571760	3574080	I don't know if anybody's played that before.
3574080	3579640	Basically you just tap the screen to have the colored ball go through the same color
3579640	3582960	and it'll have obstacles in between.
3582960	3586320	So it's like four colors, but you're trying to get like purple through purple, red through
3586320	3590000	red and the obstacles will spin or go side to side.
3590000	3594320	And if you don't hit the right color with it, it'll blow up and it's literally like
3594320	3597360	flappy birds just with a different tape.
3597360	3599540	But it's, it's really addicting.
3599540	3603240	Like you can sit in a, I don't know, like an office or on your lunch break or something
3603240	3606320	and you just tap away and well, that's a phone games are really best.
3606320	3607320	Exactly.
3607320	3608320	Yeah.
3608320	3611680	So I mean, I've kind of been playing the water down and becoming a phone game gamer for a
3611680	3614200	little while, but yeah, I like it.
3614200	3615200	It's fun.
3615200	3616200	So nothing wrong with that.
3616200	3617640	Loki, how about you?
3617640	3619880	I played all sorts of weird shit this week.
3619880	3625440	So um, I finally, I realized that the, Hey, there's an app on my, um, on play, the play
3625440	3630640	store that I can actually run cardboard games on my gear VR.
3630640	3632980	So I kind of experimented with that.
3632980	3638600	Next I played a little bit of Vanguard V. I tried this in mind VR and in cell VR, which
3638600	3639600	are kind of neat.
3639600	3642420	They're like little tech demo things.
3642420	3650860	Um, and I'm glad that Vanguard runs, uh, well on my phone and then finally, finally I was
3650860	3654480	able to find a controller at retail.
3654480	3659900	And the clouds parted and the sun shined down and the angels started singing and blessed
3659900	3660900	you.
3660900	3665180	And then they started carrying Bluetooth, Android, clearly God heard last week's episode
3665180	3667020	was like, I am so sick of this shit.
3667020	3671500	It was at Best Buy, which, which makes sense because I was like, dude, you guys are selling
3671500	3678080	gear VRs like by the boatloads and you have Minecraft out on it now.
3678080	3681500	It requires a controller and you don't fucking sell the controller.
3681500	3686180	I was, I was listening to that episode today and I was feeling really guilty cause I had
3686180	3695380	two Bluetooth controllers sitting in my office and I haven't even connected them to my gear
3695380	3696380	VR yet.
3696380	3697860	I'm just looking at him.
3697860	3698860	I have two.
3698860	3699860	No, I got him.
3699860	3701420	I got a steel series.
3701420	3703380	Jamie sent me a text message earlier this week.
3703380	3705660	Do you want to just go have these, get him a controller, shut them up.
3705660	3711380	No, she didn't say that I did, but you know, but I did, I did say so because one of one
3711380	3715500	of my coworkers listens to the show and he messages me like, why doesn't he just order
3715500	3717780	it online?
3717780	3719540	Because I'm not shipping that shit.
3719540	3722340	I just want to get it out of store and get it.
3722340	3723820	We're not going to rehash last week.
3723820	3724820	Just don't.
3724820	3725820	Prime exists.
3725820	3728580	They, yes, I understand that.
3728580	3731980	But the good news is he found the controller and now he can talk about playing it.
3731980	3732980	Yes.
3732980	3738620	So now I'm going to talk about playing Minecraft on gear VR and it's, it's pretty awesome.
3738620	3745360	My only gripe about it would be that the lighting in the game during daytime, it's hard to
3745360	3748200	see the world seems very flat.
3748200	3751120	Like it doesn't, the 3d doesn't seem to pop on it.
3751120	3752120	The earth is flat.
3752120	3753120	Yes.
3753120	3757300	The earth is flat in Minecraft.
3757300	3761280	But yeah, so when it hits nighttime though, or when you have like different lighting than
3761280	3763880	it actually kind of pops out a little bit more, but it's pretty fun.
3763880	3769440	It's I built a, you know, mine cart and kind of a little roller coaster thing and you know,
3769440	3771760	tried that out and yeah, it was nice.
3771760	3772760	I'm playing in the mode.
3772760	3773760	They have two different modes.
3773760	3779240	VR casual mode type thing where, Oh, this is for most people won't get sick by this
3779240	3782240	and there's one that's like, yeah, this one probably not for everybody.
3782240	3783400	You're probably gonna get sick from it.
3783400	3784480	So I'm playing in that mode.
3784480	3787000	So VR is now in casual and hardcore.
3787000	3788000	Yeah.
3788000	3790200	They have tolerance modes or like different tolerance levels.
3790200	3791200	Actually.
3791200	3792200	That's probably not such a bad idea.
3792200	3793200	Yeah.
3793200	3794200	So it depends on how motion sick it gets.
3794200	3797600	I'm playing in the actual one that you're probably going to get motion sick on because
3797600	3799400	you turn faster and stuff.
3799400	3801280	Otherwise it segments, it turns and slower.
3801280	3806320	It is a little weird though, because like I'm very used to, you can use the right analog
3806320	3810520	stick to turn and I do that to the term I look at stuff so I don't have to like just
3810520	3815880	spin around where I'm sitting, but I'll be, you know, kind of forced to have it, trying
3815880	3817720	to look up and I'm pushing up.
3817720	3819800	I'm like, Oh wait, I got to move my head up.
3819800	3820800	Oh, okay.
3820800	3821800	There you go.
3821800	3822800	I'll just take some getting used to.
3822800	3823800	Yeah.
3823800	3825080	It takes some getting used to, but I love it.
3825080	3826080	It's fantastic.
3826080	3827080	It's seriously what would sell.
3827080	3828800	I think this is going to sell a lot of people.
3828800	3830360	Is there any multiplayer in it?
3830360	3834680	Yes, there is actually, it's basically the same multiplayer as, um, any of the pocket
3834680	3835680	edition stuff.
3835680	3836680	So you can play with windows 10.
3836680	3842360	Um, you can play with anybody that has the Android iOS, any of the, you know, pocket
3842360	3843360	edition versions.
3843360	3844360	Hmm.
3844360	3845360	Yeah.
3845360	3846360	I might have to pick that one up.
3846360	3847360	So it's pretty awesome.
3847360	3849980	Um, so after all that was said and done on all that angst a couple of weeks ago, it actually
3849980	3851680	ended up being awesome.
3851680	3858480	I spent $60 to buy a fucking controller to play a $7 game, but it's, but it's great.
3858480	3859480	It sounds like you're having a good time.
3859600	3860600	Yeah.
3860600	3861600	That's the important part.
3861600	3862600	It's great.
3862600	3863600	And it runs smoothly.
3863600	3864600	It's just, it runs great.
3864600	3865600	So, and it's awesome.
3865600	3870440	I mean, it didn't, yeah, the galaxy of six, the cooks sometimes when you playing different
3870440	3871440	VR games.
3871440	3874600	Um, and it actually didn't really seem to bother very much.
3874600	3875600	So that was nice.
3875600	3879840	Um, the other thing I played on a completely different spectrum since I got that Coleco
3879840	3882520	a flashback console, I played some Coleco games.
3882520	3887660	So Raz playing Jumpman jr bump and jump and pepper too.
3887660	3889640	So loving that stuff.
3889640	3892420	Totally going back to, I know Jumpman was on the Coleco.
3892420	3893420	Yeah.
3893420	3894420	Jumpman jr is on there.
3894420	3895420	Yeah.
3895420	3897060	I need a Commodore 64 flashback console.
3897060	3899100	I need it bad.
3899100	3902020	So man, that's the, um, the Drake one, right?
3902020	3903020	Jumpman Jumpman.
3903020	3904020	Yeah.
3904020	3905020	I've played that.
3905020	3907980	The only thing I didn't like though, they have like some home brew ones that were on
3907980	3908980	there.
3908980	3909980	Some home brew games that were made.
3909980	3911460	The home brew games aren't good.
3911460	3912980	They like overly complicated.
3912980	3916540	They have this like mech shooter game that has like eight different buttons on there.
3916540	3918380	And I'm like, dude, this is a fucking Coleco game.
3918380	3920700	I don't need eight different action buttons on this.
3920700	3924140	Uh, Bobby block, Bobby block open chats is Coleco chameleon.
3924140	3925220	No, no, no.
3925220	3926220	The Coleco flashback.
3926220	3927980	There's a, there's a little bit of a difference.
3927980	3928980	Yeah.
3928980	3932220	This, I mean, you could probably shove this inside of an S you know, SNES jr, which then
3932220	3936060	you can shove into like a Jaguar, uh, you know, console.
3936060	3942620	It could be like a turducken of video.
3942620	3945780	Are you saying that the Coleco chameleon was basically just a turducken?
3945780	3948820	Um, it was a turd.
3948820	3949820	Stop.
3949820	3951860	He in chat says, Loki is actually happy.
3951860	3953340	Screw global warming.
3953340	3958620	We're in for a cold summer because I also got, he wasn't that orange cream milkshake
3958620	3959620	in the beginning.
3959620	3960620	Oh, well shit.
3960620	3963060	See more cream, milkshake controller.
3963060	3964060	There you go.
3964060	3965060	Look, he's having the best week ever.
3965060	3966060	All right.
3966060	3967060	Uh, my gaming week.
3967060	3969500	I'm going to talk about something a little different cause as far as like console PC,
3969500	3970500	it's same old stuff.
3970500	3974020	I'm still playing fall of SC 14 Diablo three, all that same stuff, but okay.
3974020	3978700	So I went on a little bit of an adventure this weekend, uh, on Friday, my buddy Shane,
3978700	3980820	we talk about on the show a lot and he's here sometimes.
3980820	3982860	Uh, it's his birthday by the way.
3982860	3985820	Um, which I think is actually, I'm lost track of what day it is.
3985820	3986820	It's 23rd tomorrow.
3986820	3987820	Yeah.
3987820	3988820	23rd tomorrow.
3988820	3989820	So tomorrow's his birthday.
3989820	3991700	We went for an early birthday thing, uh, Friday.
3991700	3995760	So we actually went to great America because they just opened up what the new mass effect
3995760	3996760	ride at great America.
3996760	3997760	Right?
3997760	3998760	So we rode the ride.
3998760	4002180	I would love to tell you what I thought about it, but we're teasing a video that we did.
4002180	4003500	So look for that midweek.
4003500	4005060	So I can't tell you about that right now.
4005060	4007380	Uh, all the details give us just the tip.
4007380	4012420	Uh, yes, I will say, um, it was not what I expected, which was both good and bad.
4012420	4013420	Okay.
4013420	4017420	So I'm going to watch that video now.
4017420	4020340	I can tell you what I will be watching the video now because of that.
4020340	4021340	Sounds good.
4021340	4022340	All right.
4022340	4023340	Um, but here's the other exciting thing.
4023340	4027740	So also in San Jose, cause, um, you know, great America's in the San Jose area is right
4027740	4029620	next door to where they had the super bowl, right?
4029620	4035920	So not that far away, although an eternity in Bay area traffic, Jesus, God, uh, we went
4035920	4040020	to a place called round one, which, um, I don't know if you guys have heard of this
4040020	4041020	here cause they're not everywhere.
4041020	4043380	It seems like they have a lot of them in like the Texas area.
4043380	4047620	There's some in California Bay area, so Cal, uh, and I think there's some in Washington.
4047620	4052180	I think there might be one in the Chicago area, but anyway, it's basically a Japanese
4052180	4053260	arcade chain.
4053260	4057780	I believe it's Japanese entertainment center, uh, that is starting to make way in the U
4057780	4059540	S uh, you can.
4059540	4061580	Even it has bowling inside of it.
4061580	4062740	I promise more bowling talk.
4062740	4063740	You have bowling there.
4063740	4064740	You can do darts.
4064740	4066140	You can rent a karaoke room.
4066140	4070140	Like I don't know what store this used to be at the East Ridge mall, but I'm assuming
4070140	4074780	it was something like a Kohl's or a, it was a, yeah, it was like a huge store, like a
4074780	4079340	JC Penny's type of thing that they have turned into an entire entertainment complex.
4079340	4082540	So kind of like Dave and busters, I guess, but without the restaurant.
4082540	4083540	Okay.
4083540	4084540	It's kind of like that type of thing.
4084540	4088620	Um, because I, or at least if there was a restaurant, I didn't fucking see it because
4088620	4094140	I was too distracted by what was in the arcade because the arcade was like nothing but Japanese
4094140	4095140	games.
4095140	4099420	So yes, there were the ticket spitters and all that garbage, although there were actually
4099420	4100420	some really fun ones.
4100420	4102780	Like there was one that was like a giant piano.
4102780	4106100	And so I would just like you then literally gives you tickets for banging on the keys.
4106100	4110180	So I could go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and it was like giving me what they needed
4110180	4111180	golf land.
4111180	4113340	This is like this is what they need everywhere.
4113340	4115100	I had so much fun.
4115100	4117180	Um, and this is the crazy thing.
4117180	4122480	Like the arcade, I would, okay, so this show started because of things like DDR and road
4122480	4126580	trips to play things like para para paradise and games they only had in Japan.
4126580	4133300	Do you know how much 25 year old Rob Robert shit his pants being in this place?
4133300	4134980	It was amazing.
4134980	4143380	Like dark soccer, rows and rows of UFO catchers with adorable next week, little hamster plushies.
4143380	4145480	We're going next week.
4145480	4149080	You can take, you can take my card and spend the rest of what we didn't spend.
4149080	4150080	Okay.
4150080	4153860	So I got to play some music based games that like, you know, cause we still have a lot
4153860	4158280	of music game fans that listen to OLR and I'm very thankful for you guys, but you guys
4158280	4161280	kind of know I've, I've kind of lost touch with some of that and I haven't followed as
4161280	4165740	closely as I used to, but now I kind of got to actually play some of those games because
4165740	4167380	this round one place had them.
4167380	4171320	So I played the newest BeatMania 2DX, the copula or whatever it's called, which is awesome.
4171320	4173600	I played a new game called Musica.
4173600	4174920	I don't know if I'm saying that right.
4174920	4175920	Musica.
4175920	4176920	Okay.
4176920	4178800	So imagine you take, you guys know pop and music.
4178800	4184200	It's got these giant buttons and you slam the buttons with the notes to make music.
4184200	4186960	Basically when the little note hits the bottom, you hit these, it's like the a problematic
4186960	4188600	bubble on trouble, right?
4188600	4189600	That's like pop and music.
4189600	4190600	Okay.
4190600	4197120	Musica is kind of like that, but instead of five buttons, it's five little turntables
4197120	4202140	and what you do, you can either slam the turntable down like a big button or you can spin it.
4202180	4205820	So as the notes are coming down, it's either a note that you hit or it's something that
4205820	4209220	you spin and they decided to throw in a foot pedal.
4209220	4210220	Why?
4210220	4211220	I don't know.
4211220	4212220	Foot pedal.
4212220	4215620	But I'll tell you, I love that game.
4215620	4221140	That took me back to being like 25 when this show started and I was like, I would have
4221140	4222780	drove to Arcade Infinity to play this.
4222780	4223780	This is a lot of fun.
4223780	4224780	That seems very difficult.
4224780	4227580	Like it would get challenging quickly.
4227580	4228580	These games are.
4229020	4235140	I've been a musician for 15, 16 years, a drummer, and that takes, you'd think it takes a lot
4235140	4236140	of coordination.
4236140	4240220	You know, there's a lot of things going on, but I look like a child, an infant when it
4240220	4244380	comes to some of these games where you're waving your hand below and on top of it to
4244380	4245380	make the music keep going.
4245380	4246380	Dance Maniacs.
4246380	4247380	Is that the one I'm thinking of?
4247380	4248380	Yep.
4248380	4249380	I see it.
4249380	4250380	I try it.
4250380	4251380	I'm like, yeah, I'm a musician.
4251380	4252380	Screw it.
4252380	4253380	Here's my quarters.
4253380	4254380	Watch me kick ass.
4254380	4255380	And no, it does not work.
4255380	4257700	And I think that also kind of ties into like what types of genre games you just might be
4257700	4260700	into because like, you know, you talk about the division of some of these shooters and
4260700	4264580	when I play a first person shooter, I'm like, I just run in there and get killed.
4264580	4267300	I get shot in the face and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.
4267300	4270560	You know, so I play those types of games, but music games, like because I played them
4270560	4274940	so fucking much, like when this show started and when I was around that age, like I just
4274940	4276220	kind of picked it up second nature.
4276220	4279700	Like when I played the first little song and music, I'm like, this is too fucking easy.
4279700	4280700	Come on.
4280700	4284780	So like I had to like amp up the difficulty and it was, it was crazy, but it was, it's
4284780	4285780	fun.
4285780	4288540	So like it's neon, it's bright, it's Japanese.
4288540	4289540	It's everything I love.
4289540	4295180	Were you still like, you know, good at two DX or was that just kind of like, oh boy,
4295180	4297340	have I regressed on that shit.
4297340	4298420	I failed songs.
4298420	4301860	I used to be great at like, that was a very humble pie experience.
4301860	4306540	Uh, some other games quickly I played, there's a game called cross beats, which is by Capcom.
4306540	4310700	That's kind of like, um, DJ max technica or like elite beat agents.
4310700	4315600	If you ever played that on the DS, we're like big arrows will kind of cross at one point
4315600	4319400	and that's really, that's why they call it cross beats, but sometimes it's a whole note.
4319400	4320680	Sometimes it's a, what was the other one?
4320680	4323960	Oh, you flick it like a, like you would on like an iPhone or something like that.
4323960	4326840	So I played that and that was cool cause it was by Capcom.
4326840	4331520	So it has remixes from like Phoenix Wright and a street fighter.
4331520	4334400	So yeah, you can kind of like play those songs and I was having fun with that.
4334400	4339040	Um, I saw an arcade version of grooves, groove coaster, the iPhone game.
4339040	4340040	Yeah.
4340040	4341440	Like that is crazy.
4341440	4346040	Um, and another iPhone game, the sum sum, the Disney, like the little match three with
4346040	4347040	the Disney's head.
4347040	4348040	That's very Japanese.
4348040	4349040	Okay.
4349040	4350040	Sue Sue.
4350040	4353720	They have an arcade version of Sue Sue at round one and if you give it enough credits,
4353720	4358720	you get a little like it actually spits out a physical, like it has like the fucking amiibo
4358720	4359720	thing built into it.
4359720	4364880	You get a physical Sue Sue that you can tap onto the arcade machine and you get its powers.
4364880	4367040	That's where these right.
4367040	4369740	That's where these arcade machines are going.
4369740	4373980	They're fucking stealing everything from phones now because here's the thing.
4373980	4378660	You can buy like an EMUs pass, Konami's like thing, official thing because, because round
4378660	4384120	one is like a Japanese thing and has a deal with Konami, you can buy an official Konami
4384120	4385120	EMUsment pass.
4385120	4386620	I can just use the one I already have though, right?
4386620	4388420	If you, if you happen to have one, sure.
4388420	4393680	And you can actually, you tap this card on the 2DX machine or on Musica or on Crossbeats
4393680	4395280	has a separate one cause it's Capcom.
4395280	4399140	But on any of the Konami scenes machines, you type tap it and it saves your data.
4399140	4404220	And of course, every time you play, you get coins and you can use coins to unlock skins
4404220	4408580	and new songs and bullshit, but that's what you do on the phones.
4408580	4409580	Right?
4409580	4410580	Yeah.
4410580	4411580	But that's awesome.
4411580	4412580	Yes.
4412580	4413580	That's why.
4413580	4414580	I was like, where was this when I was 25?
4414580	4415580	That's why we used to go to the arcade.
4415580	4420020	It's like, damn, you know, max two there's, you know, the songs were so close to unlocking
4420020	4421020	those.
4421020	4422520	We just have to play more.
4422520	4426860	They Akuma JP, our pal in Japan, Tumutumu, not Zoom Zoom.
4426860	4427860	I did not know that.
4427860	4428860	Tumutumu.
4428860	4429860	That Disney one.
4429860	4430860	But that was cute.
4430860	4431860	I liked that one.
4431860	4433620	They had a Silent Hill arcade machine.
4433620	4434860	Oh my God.
4434860	4439220	Like I saw it was just, it was being in little like anime convention heaven.
4439220	4440220	It was gigantic.
4440220	4441220	Right?
4441220	4442780	It was a fucking like JC Penney's converted.
4442780	4443780	It was huge.
4443780	4444780	It's like a Dave and Busters.
4444780	4446380	And I don't mean Roseville, Dave and Busters.
4446380	4449300	I mean like, like, I don't know if you guys have been to Great Mall, Dave and Busters.
4449300	4450300	It was like that big.
4450300	4451860	Yeah, the Roseville one was kind of disappointing.
4451860	4452860	Yeah, no, no.
4452860	4457180	That one's like, they say that one's the littlest one in the entire chain next to Times Square.
4457180	4458180	That's terrible.
4458180	4459180	Yeah.
4459180	4462460	So anyway, I have to give credit where credit is due.
4462460	4466140	I don't mean to sound like a commercial whore, but I guess I'm going to a little bit.
4466140	4467460	I loved round one.
4467460	4469420	I had a fantastic time there.
4469420	4472060	So this episode brought to you by round one.
4472060	4473060	Right?
4473060	4474060	And stamp stop.
4474060	4475060	Oh my God.
4475060	4476260	Just send me a $20 card every month.
4476260	4477260	I'll be fine.
4477260	4479580	Just build one in Sacramento.
4479580	4481720	Well they are building one in Concord, apparently.
4481720	4487100	So it's closer in San Jose, especially remember Bay Area traffic.
4487100	4488140	Thank you.
4488140	4491280	So I would rather just take the 680 to little John down and go there.
4491280	4492860	So they're inching closer.
4492860	4494620	So I'm excited.
4494620	4496740	So yeah, that was my gaming week.
4496740	4503180	And I'm sure a lot of the music game fans are going to be very thankful that I finally
4503180	4506540	got to play some of these games that I'm really behind the times and playing.
4506540	4509300	But yeah, man, I'm happy for that place.
4509300	4510300	That takes me back.
4510300	4511620	Drumscape was my game.
4511620	4512980	Oh, the MTV Drumscape?
4512980	4513980	Yeah.
4513980	4514980	Oh yeah.
4514980	4519580	And on the cruise beach boardwalk, I will put all the money I have in my pocket into
4519580	4520900	that game.
4520900	4523820	They have another one I'll talk about real quick.
4523820	4527540	So Konami used to have a series Guitar Freaks and Drummania that was kind of like what there
4527540	4529760	was before Guitar Hero.
4529760	4533580	And Red Octane used to make controllers for people that imported that game and then Red
4533580	4534580	Octane made Guitar Hero.
4534580	4537580	So it's kind of like, you know, it kind of evolved one way or another.
4537580	4542620	Well now Konami kind of bit back and so they have a game, they merged it into a game they
4542620	4546620	just call Ghidadora and they have the five key.
4546620	4549300	Now the guitar has five keys, kind of like Guitar Hero does.
4549300	4554100	But the drum thing, okay, like back in the day it used to have only like five.
4554100	4556860	But I, and I don't know drumming unfortunately.
4556860	4561540	So all I can say is like, there was like nine thingies and there was like, like so many
4561540	4565460	thingies and a foot pedal and I didn't know what the shit was what.
4565460	4572460	Well they have the bass, two toms, and I want to say a hi-hat and maybe a cymbal.
4572460	4573460	Okay.
4573460	4575460	He's like, yeah, that sounds right.
4575460	4576460	Oh sure.
4576460	4580180	And a Neil Peart drum cage that lifts you above and spins you around.
4580180	4583980	There was like a cymbal above the cymbal and I was like, whoa, this is like some 3D shit.
4583980	4584980	Cymbalception.
4584980	4585980	Yeah.
4585980	4586980	Crazy.
4586980	4591020	That's like when you get the like Rock Band 2 drum kit and you get all the extra, you
4591020	4595020	know, cymbals and shit that you can actually attach to this kit.
4595020	4596740	Oh, the Ion drum kit?
4596740	4601420	No, not the Ion drum kit, the actual Rock Band drum kit they actually had additional
4601420	4606020	accessories you could add to basically additional cymbals that would, I think it would map
4606020	4612700	to the same buttons for like the older drum or the older Rock Band games, but the newer
4612700	4615460	ones would actually detect them as different things.
4615460	4620100	But yeah, I actually bought those for my drum kit that I don't play that's sitting in my
4620100	4621100	garage.
4621100	4622740	So you're not the only one.
4622740	4625980	One of these days we're all going to have to do a giant road trip to round one.
4625980	4627180	I think, I think you guys would have fun.
4627180	4628180	I'm in.
4628180	4629180	Be a good time.
4629180	4631620	We're going to, uh, Bree and Gabe about it from the indie, they want to go.
4631620	4635180	I know Bree does, so we're going to have to, we'll just rent a bus.
4635180	4636180	Yeah.
4636180	4637180	All right.
4637180	4638180	We'll call it the bang bus.
4638180	4639180	Yeah.
4639180	4647420	But we need a giant logo on the side so everybody is aware of what.
4647420	4649780	I'll drive my own car then behind you guys.
4649780	4651740	Aaron, do you have room in your car?
4651740	4653740	Cause I don't want to be on the big bus.
4653740	4654740	Sure.
4654740	4655740	Yeah.
4655740	4656740	Okay.
4656740	4657740	Be by myself.
4657740	4658740	I don't care.
4659300	4660300	All over random people.
4660300	4665100	Hey, guys, the bang bus is going around one.
4665100	4667620	Would you say you'd be a master banger then?
4667620	4669700	All right.
4669700	4675580	Uh, let's move on, uh, act after saying heck vodcon at round one, you know, they have party
4675580	4676580	rooms.
4676580	4677580	Why not?
4677580	4678580	All right.
4678580	4680340	Anyway, let's get, uh, just some quick housekeeping.
4680340	4684100	I don't really have a lot to say except, you know, the usual follow us on Twitter, twitter.com
4684100	4685100	slash O L R.
4685100	4688900	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, Google plus as well.
4688900	4690620	If you're, you know, you're still doing that thing.
4690620	4695900	Um, so yeah, and as far as upcoming shows, I don't think there's anything off that we're
4695900	4699940	going to be, uh, taking off until we get to labor day and dragon con, cause I'll be out
4699940	4700940	at dragon con.
4700940	4702460	So I won't be here that week.
4702460	4705400	I do want to give though a quick shout out because I think we're only just about three
4705400	4706400	weeks away.
4706400	4710220	A vog network is sponsoring these Southern fried game room expo in Atlanta.
4710220	4713980	Um, which, you know, talk about all these cool arcade machines under one roof.
4713980	4714980	Okay.
4714980	4718980	Instead of like flashy Japanese stuff, make it retro arcade and pinball.
4718980	4721820	And that's what they're going to have at this, uh, Southern fried game room expo in Atlanta.
4721820	4722820	So that'll be fun.
4722820	4726180	They do a very, very, very similar thing in California called California extreme.
4726180	4728860	If you guys don't know the details on that, I think that's in July.
4728860	4729860	Check that out.
4729860	4730860	Yeah.
4730860	4731860	That's a lot of fun.
4731860	4732860	But that one every year.
4732860	4733860	Yeah.
4733860	4734860	Oh yeah.
4734860	4735860	So that one is a lot of fun.
4735860	4736860	So love football.
4736860	4740420	Super happy if Steve Ritchie makes it again this year cause he was, he was fun.
4740420	4744020	He designed a lot of pinball tables that probably everyone grew up with.
4744020	4745020	Yeah.
4745020	4748420	And a lot, a lot of those like retro game making celebrities show up at these types
4748420	4749420	of conventions.
4749420	4752940	So I know Southern fried game room expo has their own, um, our own Bobby Black Wolf is
4752940	4754460	going to be speaking on a couple of panels there.
4754460	4755460	So check that out.
4755460	4756460	That's going to be the Atlanta area.
4756460	4761420	I think it's June 10th through 12th, a question mark on those dates cause I don't have them
4761420	4764700	up in front of me, but I'm sure Bobby will advise me right now if I'm wrong, but that
4764700	4765700	sounds right.
4765700	4766700	Oh, Rob got it.
4766700	4767700	Right.
4767700	4770420	There you go.
4770420	4774980	So register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at bognetwork.com.
4774980	4776940	Use the pass phrase, Archer.
4776940	4777940	All right.
4777940	4780340	Uh, let's get into some news for the week.
4780340	4783820	And of course you guys, uh, from Video Game Bank, please, please feel free to comment
4783820	4786300	on the news as we're going over it here.
4786300	4787300	All right.
4787300	4792300	So Minecraft is making its way to China, um, because you know, just recently they kind
4792300	4795120	of lifted the ban from all that, you know, those different game consoles and everything
4795120	4796120	coming out there.
4796120	4799080	I guess they're just trying to expand the China because, Hey, there's billions of people
4799080	4800960	there and why not?
4800960	4805860	So they're going to be a teaming up with NetEase to expand Minecraft into China.
4805860	4811000	They have a five year license to publish the game and should be coming out soon.
4811000	4813400	That is going to be massive over there.
4813400	4814400	I think so.
4814400	4816460	You already said there's billions of people over there.
4816460	4819880	So yeah, they were saying, uh, was it a 1.3, 5 billion?
4819880	4820880	Oh yeah.
4820880	4821880	Most of them are smarter than us anyways.
4821880	4826940	So you think we've designed some pretty engineered, some pretty cool contraptions.
4826940	4827940	It's about to go to a whole new level.
4827940	4830440	And now the Chinese have their hands on it.
4830440	4831800	This is cancer cured.
4831800	4835680	This is following what we talked about last week, where there's those two consoles in
4835680	4837040	China that they just announced.
4837040	4841640	So it's like, I really feel like, okay, we are on, like, there's going to be a game bang
4841640	4845780	in China, like in the coming, in the coming years, because like, it really feels like
4845780	4849300	ever since they lifted that restriction on, on the consoles, what, like a year and a half
4849300	4851840	ago or whenever it was like, now it's like, Oh boy.
4851840	4856080	Now the dam's starting to burst and China's going to have gamers everywhere.
4856080	4863040	And you say that they're smarter than us, but wait till the video games make them dumb.
4863040	4866880	So is this a really, it's a giant tactic to bring them down to our level?
4866880	4868760	It's a Kim Kardashian game.
4868760	4874360	I'd be curious to see like how much of, you know, how many, how, how big that market could
4874360	4877920	be because a lot of times, you know, you're looking at, you know, America kind of driving
4877920	4882720	the market for like the Xbox and stuff, because, you know, we sell most of the consoles here,
4882720	4887160	but like Japan kind of driving a lot of the Sony consoles and you see different kind of,
4887160	4889200	you know, landscapes because of that.
4889200	4893920	So I'm wondering if, you know, you have China driving, you know, you know, a marketplace
4893920	4898560	for, who knows, one of these consoles be kind of interesting to see how that changes what
4898560	4900880	games are released or what types of games they develop.
4900880	4901880	Yeah.
4901880	4906560	Cause right now, pretty much all your consoles, they're U S like basically Microsoft and Xbox
4906560	4908960	or they're Japan like Nintendo.
4908960	4910640	And I would really argue half Sony.
4910640	4915200	I really feel like Sony's console operations, they're Japanese company, but I feel like
4915200	4918520	it's all happening in the San Francisco Bay area where that console is.
4918520	4920600	So it's kind of like halfsies with Sony.
4920600	4925080	It would be very interesting if suddenly now China enters the conversation with whatever
4925080	4926720	consoles they're bringing out.
4926720	4927720	Be very, very interesting.
4927720	4930640	Do we want a Chinese console?
4930640	4931640	We will.
4931640	4932640	We just talked about two of them last week.
4932640	4933640	Yeah.
4933640	4937360	I mean, that's the sound like, but I mean, you think it's going to bring communism?
4937360	4941320	No, I'm not saying like that, but I don't, I don't know.
4941320	4942320	It's going to be competition.
4942320	4943320	One way or the other.
4943320	4947160	Are you worried like, you know, like those, the V or like those other knockoff consoles?
4947160	4948160	Yeah, exactly.
4948160	4949160	That's what I'm exactly talking about.
4949160	4951080	There are a lot of Chinese knockoff consoles.
4951080	4953320	You're going into the mall like, Hey, this is kind of cool.
4953320	4955880	It's a Nintendo with like some zapper gun.
4955880	4956880	It looks like a pistol.
4956880	4957880	Yeah, exactly.
4957880	4960840	It's got like a hundred games built in.
4960840	4964800	I don't think that's legit, but yeah, but I think, I think the restrictions that the
4964800	4966760	country had was what was lending to that.
4966760	4970840	It was kind of like they had to make their own knockoffs cause they couldn't, you know,
4970840	4973640	they didn't, they didn't have the type of freedom that they're going to have now.
4973640	4974640	There's a lot.
4974640	4979200	I used to watch the YouTube reviews on them just to see what they were and it's like,
4979200	4980760	they were all, this feels plastic.
4980760	4985120	I'm like, well, it's a Chinese console right now and that's all they've been producing
4985120	4989200	for the last, like, you know, like grocery store consoles, like you can go find that
4989200	4993760	at an Albertsons and it'd be in the aisle with the produce or something like that.
4993760	4995880	And you just pick it up and you play with it.
4995880	5002480	But I mean, if, if you say like the restrictions being dropped and now they're, you make it
5002480	5006920	sound like though, in my opinion, you make it sound like now technology is reaching them
5006920	5008920	and they can use mic and chips.
5008920	5009920	Fair enough.
5009920	5010920	Sort of.
5010920	5011920	I don't know.
5011920	5012920	They're letting them reach them now.
5012920	5014440	They have Bluetooth now over there.
5014440	5015440	What can they do?
5015440	5016440	The possibilities.
5016680	5021480	Hey, uh, the phone, aren't there, isn't there a phone game in China, like way beyond where
5021480	5024400	we're at or am I, am I confusing it?
5024400	5025540	I wouldn't doubt it.
5025540	5027440	It's like a mystery over there.
5027440	5032400	I've been into the show Vikings, you know, so I see us as the Vikings and with them as
5032400	5034400	like the English people.
5034400	5035400	Highly advanced Wakandians.
5035400	5036400	Is that what they are?
5036400	5037400	Yeah, exactly.
5037400	5038400	All right.
5038400	5039400	Uh, let's see.
5039400	5046420	Uh, go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com uh, Akuma JP says, nah, Chinese copy stuff.
5046420	5047420	That's half of their economy.
5047420	5048420	Hmm.
5048420	5049420	Uh, let's see.
5049420	5052900	Dungeon buster says if you walk around Beijing, communism is the last thing anyone gets an
5052900	5054320	impression of nowadays.
5054320	5059580	So maybe things are, are changing and we'll say this, this is, this is the sign of maybe
5059580	5061140	some type of like greater shift or something.
5061140	5062140	Who knows?
5062140	5063140	Who knows?
5063140	5066740	Anyway, let's move on and talk about, I think something that a lot of folks been talking
5066740	5069620	about on gaming blogs, on Twitter and all this stuff this week.
5069620	5071980	And that's that Tetris movie.
5071980	5073300	Have you all heard about this?
5073300	5077220	Uh, Tetris, not just one movie.
5077220	5082420	Apparently they've already said, go ahead and make a damn trilogy, a trilogy of Tetris
5082420	5085460	movies, $80 million budget.
5085460	5087500	I am I being punked with this story?
5087500	5088500	I swear to God.
5088500	5092740	$80 million for the first movie or all three, because that's, that's different.
5092740	5093740	Yeah.
5093740	5094740	It's probably going to be one of those things.
5094740	5095740	I shoot them all at once.
5095740	5096740	That's, that's what they do these days.
5096740	5097740	Right?
5097740	5098740	Shoot all the movies at once.
5098740	5100820	I know we look at them at CG, live action.
5100820	5101820	What are we talking?
5101820	5107860	It is being promoted as a sci-fi thriller, thriller, thriller.
5107860	5113200	I don't get that feeling every time I play it's gonna be played by Vin Diesel and that's,
5113200	5117580	that's why I'm getting a little nervous about this whole lie.
5117580	5118580	Am I being punked right now?
5118580	5122220	You know what other games, you know, other game was a good sci-fi thriller.
5122220	5125060	Somebody made their own NX and fooled the entire internet.
5125060	5126060	Just want to remind y'all.
5126060	5127060	I'm sorry, Loki.
5127060	5128060	You had a joke.
5128060	5129060	Yeah.
5129060	5131580	I was going to say, you know what, you know what other game had a nice sci-fi thriller
5131580	5134460	movie that made, you know, out to theaters?
5134460	5135460	Battleship.
5135460	5136460	Remember how that turned out?
5136460	5137760	It's the first one that came to mind.
5137760	5138760	The Rihanna movie.
5138760	5139760	Yeah.
5139760	5140760	The Rihanna.
5140760	5141760	That's what we think of it as.
5141760	5142760	The Rihanna movie.
5142760	5144460	Was that the one that had Ralph Fiennes in that epic climatic scene?
5144460	5145460	You sunk my battleship.
5145460	5147980	You got to put that in there somewhere.
5147980	5148980	Yeah.
5148980	5153620	That's why I said, if that line isn't in the movie, fuck it.
5153620	5155820	Is Tetris going to be a follow up to Pixels?
5155820	5159160	Is this like a sequel?
5159160	5162040	Like the aliens come back and they're just now all Tetris shapes.
5162040	5163040	So we have...
5163040	5165040	If Jack Black gets attached, I'm out.
5165040	5168280	Do we have anybody attached so far or is it just, hey, we're going to make one?
5168280	5170240	I do not think there's a...
5170240	5171240	It's going to be...
5171240	5175840	They're going to actually film the first movie in China and other locations in 2017.
5175840	5176840	Cheap knockoffs, huh?
5176840	5178720	Oh, the cast will be Chinese.
5178720	5182320	It's a China-US co-production under Threshold Global Studios.
5182320	5184280	So the cast will be Chinese.
5184280	5188200	Bruno Wu and producer Larry Kasanoff are co-producers.
5188200	5193900	Now Larry Kasanoff was actually a producer on the Mortal Kombat movie, which, say what
5193900	5197760	you will, that was probably one of the better video game movies probably to this day.
5197760	5198760	Number one?
5198760	5199760	Part one?
5199760	5200760	Huh?
5200760	5201760	Part one we're talking about.
5201760	5202760	There's only one anyway.
5202760	5203760	All right.
5203760	5204760	Yeah.
5204760	5205760	Mortal Kombat one, that's it.
5205760	5206760	There we go.
5206760	5209560	But that has some semblance of a fucking plot to it, whereas Tetris is a puzzle game.
5209560	5210600	There's some plot.
5210600	5215000	There's some tension there when you're on level 12 and they're coming down pretty fast.
5215000	5220080	So when we talk about a Chinese-US co-production thing, I think about the Crouching Tiger
5220080	5221080	Hidden Dragon.
5221080	5222080	I think it was kind of like that too.
5222080	5223080	Yeah, that was very good.
5223080	5231640	Because you had Ang Lee that had directed that movie, but they had shot and they filmed
5231640	5238520	it in China and the cast was Chinese, but they ended up releasing it over here.
5238520	5243240	When you say sci-fi thriller, I'm thinking it has to be some type of coding movie.
5243240	5246280	They're going to make it some type of hackers, but in China.
5246280	5249520	And then just surrounding the whole hacking system is Tetris.
5249520	5255120	And that's what you have to do, is to break some code, you have to play Tetris.
5255120	5256120	That's the only thing I can think of.
5256120	5260600	I don't think they're going to actually have large physical blocks falling from the sky.
5260600	5266600	They have to build a Tetris wall around Earth to save them from the invading shapeless things.
5266600	5267600	You know what?
5267600	5273040	As much as you say that as a joke, maybe that's kind of what it is, is that the game it's
5273040	5276880	self is kind of non-important, like the Battleship movie, as much as we're kind of like laughing
5276880	5277880	at that.
5277880	5280560	How much you want to bet they're going to have like nanomachines or something in this
5280560	5283320	where they're just going to have to like, I don't know.
5283320	5285440	It sounds terrible.
5285440	5290280	They have to build a wall around the Earth and they're missing the piece that they need.
5290280	5291280	Wow.
5291280	5294600	So they're searching the galaxy for a straight line?
5294600	5299520	I vow, here and now, not going to see it.
5299520	5301640	I will see Angry Birds before I see that.
5302160	5303960	Angry Birds seems okay.
5303960	5307880	Angry Birds will actually have a plot because the game has a plot.
5307880	5309120	Is there no lore to Tetris?
5309120	5310120	Because you're a Tetris guy.
5310120	5313000	Is there like a story that we don't know when you just pick it up?
5313000	5314000	Is there like...
5314000	5320000	I, in high school, being caught playing Tetris in my computer class, my teacher made me write
5320000	5327120	a four page essay on Tetris and I could not research any lore behind it.
5327120	5328120	It was just...
5328120	5329120	But the dude got screwed over royally.
5329120	5330120	Oh, he got screwed over royally.
5330600	5333800	Well, he got his upcoming, so he's good now.
5333800	5336000	And then he went on to make other games.
5336000	5341200	But yeah, there's no lore in the original Tetris.
5341200	5344200	There may be some now in some newer versions, but...
5344200	5347520	As long as they don't base it off that horrible fucking PlayStation version with a little
5347520	5348960	archaeologist that would walk by.
5348960	5350140	I couldn't stand that one.
5350140	5358600	We have Mr. Pajitnov, drunk in college on lots of vodka.
5358600	5365600	Staring at the little pixel blips on his monochrome screen, going, you know, I think
5365600	5368680	these would fit a certain way.
5368680	5372120	I will make a game instead of doing my job.
5372120	5373120	And there's history.
5373120	5374120	And there it is.
5374120	5379760	And then he goes up to the Kremlin and goes, fuck you!
5379760	5380760	The Kremlin.
5380760	5381760	I made a game.
5381760	5385320	Yes, there is no story to Tetris.
5385320	5386720	Let's wait and see a trailer.
5386720	5390680	Let's wait and see what actors are on it and what kind of talent is in it.
5390680	5391680	Let's see.
5391680	5392680	Let's see what...
5392680	5394280	Let's wait till the trailer.
5394280	5395280	I'll give it that.
5395280	5396280	But I just...
5396280	5400040	The part that's really weird to me is, A, the sci-fi thriller.
5400040	5402520	And B, the fact that it's already a trilogy.
5402520	5403520	That's a concern.
5403520	5404520	Yeah.
5404520	5409920	Sci-fi thriller instead of romantic comedy, because that's what I see Tetris as.
5409920	5414760	And then already a trilogy when it should literally be four.
5414760	5418840	I mean, it's Tetris, like four is the number.
5418840	5419840	That's true.
5419840	5420840	A quad...
5420840	5421840	A quadri...
5421840	5422840	Yeah, a quadri...
5422840	5423840	A Tetris.
5423840	5424840	A Tetris.
5424840	5425840	Yeah.
5425840	5431480	I just think that the producers and whoever thought this was a good idea, the same way
5431480	5434080	drunk frat boys think certain things are good ideas.
5434080	5435080	Maybe, yeah.
5435080	5437120	Dude, I got an idea.
5437120	5439400	There's still a Monopoly movie coming at some point.
5439400	5440400	Oh, really?
5440400	5442600	And it's still a mousetrap movie, I think.
5442600	5443920	They released the Ouija movie.
5444320	5446040	Mousetrap could be fun.
5446040	5449000	Mousetrap was kind of fucking rad, though.
5449000	5453600	If it's done like a little first person mousie, like Stuart Little or something.
5453600	5455720	Whoever builds those things in the Pee Wee Herman movies.
5455720	5458880	You're saying like a hardcore Harry meets Ratatouille?
5458880	5460880	There you go.
5460880	5461880	You've just made the movie.
5461880	5466720	And just have it all from that little miniature point of view and having to get through the
5466720	5467720	mousetrap.
5467720	5469680	Oh, what's the cage thing coming down?
5469680	5471080	Like the commercials were, right?
5471080	5472080	Yeah.
5472080	5473080	Those would be great.
5473240	5474240	That would be a crossfire movie.
5474240	5475240	You know what?
5475240	5476320	I would be down for that now.
5476320	5479160	I want the kids, though, who are in the commercial in the movie.
5479160	5480680	You know, they're probably like 40 now.
5480680	5481680	I think.
5481680	5483760	They're pro crossfire players.
5483760	5487600	We need to do a list list for the plot of the Tetris movie.
5487600	5490000	Okay, we'll have to do that.
5490000	5491600	This show is already running way too long.
5491600	5492600	I know, that's right.
5492600	5493600	We'll do that in a future week.
5493600	5494600	All right, that's right.
5494600	5495600	I want to read this quick comment from chat.
5495600	5496600	Bobby Black Wolf.
5496600	5498720	Tetris 1 will be the sci-fi thriller.
5498720	5501140	Tetris 2 will be the romantic comedy.
5501180	5503260	And Tetris 3 will be the feel good kids cartoon.
5503260	5504260	There you go.
5504260	5505860	Maybe some genres switch up.
5505860	5506860	Yeah.
5506860	5507860	All right.
5507860	5508860	Let's move on.
5508860	5509860	Dark Soccer.
5509860	5510860	What do you have for us?
5510860	5512620	Well, we knew it wouldn't end.
5512620	5517220	We knew there would be another Five Nights at Freddy's.
5517220	5521500	There is a new Five Nights at Freddy's sequel.
5521500	5524860	Oh, that's my version of an echo.
5524860	5527500	Even after the final Five Nights at Freddy's.
5527500	5528500	Right?
5528500	5529500	Liar.
5529860	5533260	There was the RPG that probably should not have happened.
5533260	5537280	I want the RPG though to actually come out because I would play the crap out of that.
5537280	5538280	It's out.
5538280	5539280	That's the problem.
5539280	5542460	No, I mean, I want it to like be fixed and come out because they took it down to fix
5542460	5543460	it.
5543460	5544460	Right?
5544460	5545460	No, I think it's bad.
5545460	5546460	I think they don't.
5546460	5547660	I think he's going to re-release it for free or something.
5547660	5549860	I don't remember what the deal was, but anyway, new one.
5549860	5553340	I still have that as my ringtone thing anyway.
5553340	5558300	So Five Nights at Freddy's, the sequel is called Sister Location and oh my God, the
5558300	5560580	animatronics are even creepier in this one.
5560580	5562420	Their faces like come apart.
5562420	5566260	If it's Sister Location, is it like Francine now?
5566260	5567260	No.
5567260	5569260	Five Nights at Francine's?
5569260	5571540	Is that what they're doing?
5571540	5577420	It has a new head animatronic called, I think, Dolly.
5577420	5583100	This little clown face, little girl with pigtails, but the way that the animatronics are is that
5583100	5587880	they're split down the middle and they're split over the eyes, under the eyes, and across
5587880	5588880	the mouth.
5588880	5593940	So that parts expand and move in and out while the eyes move around.
5593940	5598340	And I'm like, who the hell was designing these animatronics and thought this will be good
5598340	5599340	for kids?
5599340	5600340	My nightmares.
5600340	5604920	Well, it's not exactly made for kids, but just looking at the trailer, I'm trying to
5604920	5611680	see because some of the other animatronics are back.
5611680	5612840	What was the white one called?
5612840	5613840	God, I can't remember.
5613840	5616440	That I think became the bangle.
5616440	5618400	And I think Chica was in there.
5618400	5622440	Chica's the one that always, have you guys played those Five Nights games?
5622440	5625960	I played the very original first one.
5625960	5632400	She gets me to play them on Twitch and I scream like a 12 year old girl when Chica comes out.
5632400	5633720	It is an actual scary game.
5633720	5634720	It's intense.
5634720	5640280	I don't know how much the third or fourth iteration is.
5640280	5643720	And Freddy's in it too, but it's like a purple Freddy, but I don't think he's the purple
5643720	5644720	guy.
5644720	5647920	I can't call him the purple man because the purple man was in Jessica was in, no, not
5647920	5653120	just in the TV series, but it was alias and he was actually purple and his daughter was
5653120	5654120	purple.
5654120	5659220	So just saying, I know my comics, but yeah, it's looking like it's going to be pretty
5659220	5664140	crazy and instead of being like a, in a little surveillance room where you're in the area,
5664140	5668500	you're like in a basement surveillance room, like a big circle thing.
5668500	5671840	And like they had people going through vents and things, so maybe you have to travel in
5671840	5672840	between.
5672840	5674960	It's a 360 degree thing this time.
5674960	5680440	And it also had like the lights out deal like it had with the, um, the flashlight for the
5680440	5683120	little boy in the last one.
5683120	5684360	We'll just put that in the pile of games.
5684360	5685360	I won't be playing.
5685360	5690080	No, no disrespect to the creator who is, you know what, he's made a huge success for himself
5690080	5691080	as an indie developer.
5691080	5692080	What's his name?
5692080	5693200	Thumbs up to you, bro.
5693200	5700680	Not going to play also, also Rob, I've decided that you're now going to have what's called
5700680	5702240	the pile of nope.
5702240	5706760	Well, I will apply one nope to this.
5706760	5712420	And just looking at these, um, you know, the, the other, you know, suggestions to watch
5712420	5714500	on YouTube for their little trailer.
5714500	5716720	One of them is a Minecraft five nights.
5716720	5718740	Five nights is huge.
5718740	5722820	I mean, it's, it seems like every year you have that one indie success that like is not
5722820	5724400	going to fucking stop Minecraft.
5724400	5725400	Obviously.
5725400	5728000	I think five nights was kind of like last year's game this year.
5728000	5729000	Stardew Valley.
5729560	5731960	Someone still needs to buy for me.
5731960	5736560	I haven't played it myself, but I have a coworker who comes up to me once per day and has to
5736560	5739000	tell me everything that happened in the past year.
5739000	5740000	Yeah.
5740000	5742000	Of her game.
5742000	5744800	It's insane how, how, uh, crazy addicted that game is.
5744800	5748720	Of course they were also advertising, um, Alaska Thunderfucks last single.
5748720	5749720	What?
5749720	5750720	In my little thing.
5750720	5753000	Cause it read it, read it off of my, uh, YouTube.
5753000	5754880	Oh, cause YouTube spies on what you do.
5754880	5755880	Cause YouTube spies on me.
5755880	5759160	If you watch drag queen videos, it's going to be like, you watch five nights at Fridays.
5759160	5761400	You watch, you're trying to be Lady Gaga.
5761400	5762400	Scary drag queens.
5762400	5763400	All right.
5763400	5764400	You know what we need?
5764400	5766400	It's a popular category.
5766400	5767400	Category is.
5767400	5768480	All right.
5768480	5773480	So Pokemon go, um, you can actually test or sign up for the field test or beta test, whatever
5773480	5774720	you want to call it.
5774720	5785800	For Pokemon go, um, go to Pokemon go dot niantic.com and go there to our niantic labs.com.
5785840	5786840	That's what I meant.
5786840	5790000	Pokemon Pokemon go dot niantic labs.com to register.
5790000	5796560	Uh, they are seeming to, I don't know if they're, you know, um, giving preference to people
5796560	5801800	that play ingress, but they do ask if, you know, if you play ingress, what's your agent
5801800	5805920	ID, what's your level, finally, finally, all that addiction is going to pay off.
5805920	5809800	And then of course you need a Gmail address and a mobile device to be able to play it.
5809800	5811940	So I signed up for it just to see what it is.
5811940	5815120	I really have no interest in Pokemon, but I'll, I'll check it out.
5815120	5816720	What do you guys think from what you've heard about Pokemon go?
5816720	5820920	I think it's going to be the, I, I, I, I'm going to kind of go on a rant in a minute
5820920	5824120	here, but I still think this is going to be the biggest mobile game since candy crush.
5824120	5825120	I really do.
5825120	5827000	I think it's going to kill people.
5827000	5832280	First of all, I think like they're going to put a Mewtwo in the middle of a penitentiary
5832280	5836800	and some kids going to go try and catch a Diglett or something.
5836800	5839600	Breaking and entering is going to be all time high.
5839600	5842760	And then I think what's going to happen though, I think this is for reals, I'm pretty sure
5842760	5846320	like target, it's going to cut a deal where it's like, if you come to the kid's section
5846320	5849760	of target on North gate, you'll get Pikachu in a birthday hat.
5849760	5851600	Oh, that's what, that's what they do in Ingress now.
5851600	5854200	Like a Jamba juices used to all be portals in Ingress.
5854200	5855200	Yeah.
5855200	5856200	So that'll happen.
5856200	5857200	Absolutely.
5857200	5858200	Yeah.
5858200	5861400	It's going to take the world by storm big time.
5861400	5865520	I mean it's bringing Pokemon to life.
5865520	5869720	I mean all they have to do is start releasing animatronic Pokemon out in the world that
5869720	5870720	randomly just walk around.
5870720	5871720	That's the only thing that could be bigger.
5872080	5876000	Kids going to walk into the middle of a freeway trying to catch a Bulbasaur and then the game
5876000	5877000	will be over.
5877000	5878000	Yeah.
5878000	5881120	Luckily I, you know, and I've played Ingress for a while now, their other game and I don't
5881120	5886480	see like portals in the middle of freeways, but they do have portals in some like, so
5886480	5891080	hopefully somebody's screening them a little bit because like I know a guy the other day
5891080	5895940	that went to go get a portal that's basically right on the Mexican border in the middle
5895940	5901440	of the desert and I don't know why there's a fucking portal there, but there was, and
5901480	5903280	he had to get it for reasons.
5903280	5907480	So yeah, I, I, it would be very interesting to see where these Pokemon gyms or whatever
5907480	5908480	show.
5908480	5911840	A lot of them, especially in our area that just, they're not there anymore.
5911840	5916280	Like it's, Oh yeah, here's a fountain for this restaurant that's closed down or Hey,
5916280	5918860	here's one for this giant mural that's not there anymore.
5918860	5922560	Here's one for another mural that's was on a building that's torn down.
5922560	5923560	Yeah.
5923560	5924560	Come on.
5924560	5928040	So here's my thing and I got to get this off my chest cause I mentioned I have some reservations
5928040	5932240	and so obviously I've been playing Niantic's other game Ingress for a very long time and
5932240	5936000	just within the past few days I'm starting to get really fucking irritated at something
5936000	5940600	in Ingress and I think if Niantic is going to be this and that's going to be their niche
5940600	5945920	is that we are the GPS global phone game exploration thing.
5945920	5950280	They have got to figure this problem out and that problem is people spoofing their phone
5950280	5955540	location and being places where they really are not because I'm going to tell you it's
5955540	5959760	extremely fucking frustrating to work with other people.
5959760	5960760	That's not the hard part.
5960760	5961760	I like that part.
5961760	5965500	Work with other people to accomplish this big task where I don't know if you guys know
5965500	5970060	Ingress, but basically like you try to connect these real world places together to make,
5970060	5974780	make triangles, but no lines can cross, but sometimes you can make very large triangles.
5974780	5979020	Let's say a triangle that goes all the way from Hawaii to Mount Lassen to Baja, Mexico
5979020	5982580	and back like sometimes and you get like 40 people involved to me.
5982580	5983580	It's like a fucking raid.
5983580	5984580	I love that you mentioned Mount Lassen.
5984620	5986180	That's one of my favorite places in the world.
5986180	5987180	Yeah.
5987180	5988180	Right.
5988180	5989180	Why did you say that?
5989180	5990180	Because that actually happened.
5990180	5991180	I feel like I had a Batman moment.
5991180	5995700	Why didn't you just said Martha?
5995700	6000420	Because those are all real places that this just happened the other day and you know,
6000420	6005860	a lot of people worked on it to make it only to have a person spoof their location and
6005860	6013740	take it down right away and everybody knows that the person was lying because the team
6013740	6019620	that threw it in Hawaii is right there going, we are on a beach and nobody else is here.
6019620	6021180	Like it is just us.
6021180	6022580	This is a spoofer.
6022580	6024900	So here's my thing.
6024900	6028460	And it's not like I realize there's always going to be assholes that try to ruin it for
6028460	6032460	everybody, but Niantic has got to figure out how they're going to police their fucking
6032460	6037660	game better because they're not doing it well enough and it's starting to make me really
6037660	6038660	not want to play that game anymore.
6038660	6040660	Well I think they are catching those people are doing it, but they're just not really
6040660	6041780	doing anything about it.
6041780	6044060	They're like banning them for a week and then that's it.
6044060	6045060	Yeah.
6045060	6046060	And then they come right back.
6046060	6049820	It's not like there's, there's no other repercussions that the game's not smart enough at catching
6049820	6053140	if somebody is doing it in the first place and if you're going to make your niche around
6053140	6055260	GPS games, you've got to figure this out.
6055260	6060300	Especially with my phone, like my GPS sometimes will be like way fucked up.
6060300	6062380	You know, even as it is, my compass is way fucked.
6062380	6065420	It's never pointing in the right direction in that game, you know?
6065420	6068980	So in my GPS, a lot of times they'll be bouncing around all over the fucking place.
6068980	6073620	And so thank God it doesn't trigger spoofing or anything from that.
6073620	6077980	I can only imagine that's probably why they haven't, you know, it's hard for them to gather
6077980	6084180	all that cell data and stuff that might be around as well to kind of verify their location.
6084180	6089060	So all I have, so just, you know, just something like that happening is just incredibly demoralizing
6089060	6094200	and makes you kind of sit there and go, well, why am I spending time and money and gas on
6094200	6097660	something that is not being policed effectively?
6097660	6103140	Like at least World of Warcraft, if I go play PvP, it's all server side.
6103140	6106880	They got locked down, so it is very hard to cheat on World of Warcraft and there is zero
6106880	6108980	tolerance for it, you know, in a game like that.
6108980	6114340	And I just need Niantic to kind of like step it up a little bit and look at Ingress through
6114340	6118960	that similar kind of lens where they need to police it better if they want me to continue
6118960	6120420	to support Ingress.
6120420	6124100	Because right now I'm just kind of like, I don't know, I'm like, I'm like, I'm happy
6124100	6126460	for Jamie that she's gonna be level eight and I kind of want to help her get that and
6126460	6129540	all sorts, but I'm just kind of like, do I really want to take another two hour road
6129540	6132920	trip only to have some little kid in their basement fake it?
6132920	6137500	You know, it's like, I think I'm, I think I'm kind of past that probably some 30 something
6137500	6142100	that's doing that and you know, the ones that are going to be excellent at Pokemon go are
6142100	6146020	going to be the same retired people that play Ingress all day long.
6146020	6149700	Maybe it's a Nintendo property, so maybe they might take a little, little more serious.
6149700	6153060	They don't want to lose or have a bad relationship with Nintendo.
6153740	6157660	Well, I don't know like how much it is with, I don't really know the game mechanics too
6157660	6158660	much.
6158660	6161980	I know that you can go to different gyms and like deploy your Pokemon there to, and you
6161980	6166100	go and battle those different Pokemon, but it's not like a war game.
6166100	6168460	You got deploy your Pokemon battlefield.
6168460	6172060	It kind of is like Michael Vick like video game.
6172060	6173060	Yeah.
6173060	6174060	They're child soldiers.
6174060	6175060	That's what the Corey Pokemon.
6175060	6176060	I'm not fucking with you.
6176060	6179060	Pokemon go is real life.
6180060	6184060	If you fake your location, then I will find you.
6184060	6187580	I always, I always tell people like, cool, you want to sign up for Ingress?
6187580	6188580	That's awesome.
6188580	6191860	Like you should play Ingress with me, but if you sign up for blue and attack my portal,
6191860	6194860	I will kill you.
6194860	6195860	Cheaters in video games.
6195860	6198860	We talked about that recently, how it could be game breaking.
6198860	6203100	And we were talking about whose responsibility is it and what the outcome should be.
6203100	6207860	So like for Overwatch, they're doing like no tolerance, permabands, right?
6207860	6208860	Quickly.
6209660	6210660	I love that.
6210660	6211660	I think that's the way to go.
6211660	6216220	And in Overwatch, that's you, you, you wasted 60 bucks because there is no single player
6216220	6217220	game.
6217220	6218220	So if you get banned from Overwatch, done.
6218220	6219220	Yeah.
6219220	6220220	Yeah.
6220220	6224940	They, I think they need to set an example for some of them.
6224940	6227940	If some of you can't control, which I don't know how they can differentiate the ones like,
6227940	6230380	Oh, my internet connection just bailed out on me.
6230380	6234940	So I couldn't even, you know, I didn't leave the game, but you know, that's just what happened.
6235020	6240380	You can get some leeway on that, but the downright PC cheaters that are like, I went and got
6240380	6242860	a third party program to aim bots.
6242860	6243860	Yeah.
6243860	6249660	They definitely need to be, you know, struck and down, smited down definitely with the
6249660	6250660	biggest ban hammer.
6250660	6252660	With great vengeance and curious anger.
6252660	6254860	Because that stuff doesn't make the game fun.
6254860	6256820	And it's just like, why do you do that?
6256820	6260420	Like why do you make the game unplayable for other people?
6260420	6261420	Right.
6261420	6262420	Exactly.
6262420	6263980	Anyway, I got to move on.
6264020	6267500	So because of time, I want to talk a little bit briefly about Nintendo, because they were
6267500	6273340	kind of, they were kind of turning some heads this week because they revised their incorporation
6273340	6274340	articles.
6274340	6278380	And I don't know if you guys saw this on Twitter and the blogs and all this, but apparently
6278380	6283220	Nintendo has said, we're getting into other things than just gaming.
6283220	6287940	They have talked about now that they are doing medical and health services, computer software,
6287940	6292460	eating establishments, and IP licensing.
6292460	6294580	So we don't know like what this all involves.
6294580	6298180	I don't think this necessarily means that Nintendo is going to suddenly open a restaurant
6298180	6299180	themselves.
6299180	6300180	That would be awesome.
6300180	6301240	But what, well, what is...
6301240	6303340	They do have cafes in Spain.
6303340	6304340	Do they really?
6304340	6305340	Yeah.
6305340	6306660	Oh, I didn't even know that.
6306660	6307660	Okay.
6307660	6308660	Well, so maybe that's part of it.
6308660	6309660	Like the themed cafes.
6309660	6312380	Like there's the Final Fantasy one that Square has.
6312380	6313380	Okay.
6313380	6314380	Right.
6314380	6315380	Right.
6315380	6317060	Like Mario milkshakes or Luigi latte or something like that.
6317060	6320300	I'm really concerned with them starting to get into practicing medicine.
6320300	6321300	Medicine?
6321300	6322300	Yeah.
6323140	6324140	Amazing.
6324140	6325140	Point taken.
6325140	6329100	But I kind of see that I don't necessarily think Nintendo is going to open up their own
6329100	6333180	restaurant, but like, you know, let's say we know that Nintendo Universal signed that
6333180	6336180	deal to do the theme park thing where there'll be a Mario ride.
6336180	6339500	Well, look, haven't just been at a theme park over the weekend.
6339500	6343220	Let me tell you, they also make a shit ton of money off food and selling the food there.
6343220	6346020	So what type of Mass Effect food do they have?
6346020	6347020	Okay.
6347020	6349940	You got me there because they actually didn't have any.
6349940	6355120	But they did have, like at their gift shop, they had a ton of Mass Effect merchandise,
6355120	6359140	but it was mostly the stuff you get in the store because it wasn't really anything new.
6359140	6361740	Why did you not bring me back in Elcor?
6361740	6364460	Because I wanted you to go yourself and they didn't have the Elcors.
6364460	6365920	Well, ew.
6365920	6367140	But anyway, yeah.
6367140	6370820	So maybe you'll have like a Mario pizzeria or something.
6370820	6371820	I don't know.
6371820	6372820	Wow.
6372820	6373820	Straight to the pizzeria.
6373820	6374820	Coming to a Luigi.
6374820	6375820	Yeah.
6375820	6376820	I can see that.
6376820	6377820	Yeah.
6377820	6378820	Just why not?
6378820	6379820	Like that'll be the thing.
6380700	6382860	I would be down too actually for that.
6382860	6386620	But see, and that's the thing is I kind of think what's happening now in Nintendo, because
6386620	6390560	we all know they're under new leadership and I kind of feel like maybe the new leadership,
6390560	6395020	because I get the sense the new leadership was not as much of a gamer as Miyamoto was,
6395020	6396020	who was...
6396020	6397020	Satoru Iwata.
6397020	6398020	Jesus Christ.
6398020	6399020	Satoru Iwata.
6399020	6400020	My bad.
6400020	6401020	Sorry.
6401020	6402020	Hail Mario.
6402020	6403020	Hail Mario.
6403020	6404020	Shame.
6404020	6405020	Shame.
6405020	6409100	A lot of names spinning in my head, live radio.
6409100	6413780	So when Iwata was leading the company, he was in the trenches and kind of worked his
6413780	6415200	way up and so forth, right?
6415200	6419900	And so I think the leadership now is somebody that was more of like the business perspective.
6419900	6424300	And I kind of feel like, whereas there was that hesitation to really license Nintendo
6424300	6425300	stuff out.
6425300	6428860	Like we've heard in the past, Nintendo was like, we learned our lesson from the Super
6428860	6431500	Mario Brothers movie that starred Bob Hoskins.
6431500	6433880	Like we are not ever doing that shit again.
6433880	6437500	So stop, stop writing your fanwank.
6437980	6442740	Stop writing the fanwank about the Zelda Netflix series, because that's not fucking true.
6442740	6444720	That was like the old Nintendo, right?
6444720	6450780	But now I kind of feel like I see that we have made a lot of fucking money putting out
6450780	6453140	Nintendo figurines.
6453140	6455340	Why don't we license our...
6455340	6459900	We just made a lot of money licensing Mario and Luigi to theme parks.
6459900	6462900	We are the fucking Disney of video games right now.
6462900	6465620	Why don't we just license our shit everywhere?
6465620	6466620	They are making a movie.
6466620	6468020	They're making a movie with Sony.
6468020	6469380	They're going to be doing animated movies.
6469380	6470380	Right.
6470380	6472380	And I think that is now the future of where Nintendo...
6472380	6475620	Because if Angry Birds can do well, wait till Mario.
6475620	6477820	I think a Mario movie would do fantastic in this day and age.
6477820	6478820	As long as it's CG.
6478820	6479820	As long as it's CG.
6479820	6480820	Yeah, yeah.
6480820	6481820	Let's not...
6481820	6483200	We're not doing live action.
6483200	6484200	Never again.
6484200	6485200	Yeah, never.
6485200	6486200	Yeah.
6486200	6487200	Who's the guy that...
6487200	6488200	Jack Black is Mario?
6488200	6489200	No, no.
6489200	6490200	Who's the guy that plays...
6490200	6491700	I don't want Vincent D'Onofrio putting on a Mario hat.
6491700	6492700	That would be awesome.
6492700	6494700	He's not that fat.
6494700	6495700	Yeah, no.
6495780	6497420	Yeah, sure he's not.
6497420	6499900	I can see them branching out and everything else, though.
6499900	6501220	You hit it right on the head.
6501220	6503940	They are the Disney of video games.
6503940	6509100	They have that marketing appeal to where you know who Mario is as soon as somebody says
6509100	6511380	Mario.
6511380	6512940	He's like Mickey Mouse, yeah.
6512940	6517600	But I think some people are reading this to say, oh, Nintendo is contingency planning
6517600	6518940	for the NX to flop.
6518940	6520180	They're no longer a game maker.
6520180	6523660	I'm just like, no, Nintendo sees dollar signs and they'd like to chase them.
6523660	6528220	I could see where they're going with that because you can't get...
6528220	6530660	Consoles lose money generally anyways.
6530660	6534300	Even a decent console will lose money.
6534300	6538860	And they had one massive flop with the GameCube, I think it was, right?
6538860	6542620	Yeah, GameCube is considered a flop, even though it was a great console.
6542620	6544260	I think it eventually made its money back.
6544260	6545260	It almost broke that.
6545260	6546260	Yeah, I think it made...
6546260	6549460	And it was kind of the same thing with the Wii U, and it's like the gamer in me does
6549460	6554460	not want to call the system of Mario Kart 8 and the system of like all these fantastic
6554460	6559020	games that are on it a flop, but from a financial perspective, it did not live up to the expectations.
6559020	6560580	Financially, it almost like killed them, right?
6560580	6563740	And then they did the Wii as like, this is going to be the last thing, and then it like
6563740	6564740	did gangbusters.
6564740	6569640	See, here's the thing, I can't say that it almost killed them because you have to remember
6569640	6574340	Nintendo is sitting on mountains and mountains of cash.
6574340	6575340	Remember that.
6575340	6576340	Nintendo's got money in the bank.
6576340	6580580	Of course they do, because they're fucking charging $10 for fucking Mario Kart or Mario
6580580	6588460	64, which I did buy, but I bought it so my son can play it.
6588460	6590420	I didn't want to pay $10 for it.
6590420	6592300	I think it's fucking ridiculous.
6592300	6600580	That handheld pillar that they stand on is always gold, like they rule the handheld market.
6600580	6604140	I got to move on to the next story, but I have to get some of these restaurant ideas
6604140	6605140	from chat.
6605140	6606140	Awesome, here we go.
6606140	6609860	So Dungeon Buster is suggesting the House of Mario Pancakes, possibly.
6609860	6610860	I'd eat there.
6610860	6613100	Stoppy, I'm sorry, wins with this one.
6613100	6614700	Stoppy wins with this one.
6614700	6615700	Yoshi's cookies.
6615700	6617700	Oh, that just makes sense.
6617700	6618700	Done.
6618700	6619700	Yeah.
6619700	6620700	Trademark it.
6620700	6621700	Simplest thing.
6621700	6622700	Right?
6622700	6623700	Yeah.
6623700	6626140	I feel like there should be an app, and I order my cookies, and they're ready for pick
6626140	6627140	up.
6627140	6628140	Wow.
6628140	6629140	Yoshi!
6629140	6632360	So if you put like three of the cookies together, do you get a discount or something like that?
6632360	6637120	As long as the cookies weren't actually shit out of the dinosaur, I'm fine.
6637120	6641320	Yeah, I bet that would be really popular, they're like around Easter, where you have
6641320	6642320	Yoshi eggs.
6642320	6643320	Oh, man.
6643320	6644320	Cream filled eggs.
6644320	6645320	They might be, setting themselves to take over the world.
6645320	6647320	And they're actually like the little white and green.
6647320	6650680	It's like the little toy Yoshi in the middle, like the Kinder Surprise.
6650680	6653680	Oh, I'm sorry, we can't have those in the US.
6653680	6657380	Even better with all these stupid YouTube trends, you can have it be like a giant fucking
6657380	6659720	surprise egg with shit inside of it.
6659720	6661720	Oh, unboxing, or un-egging or something?
6662080	6665760	Bullshit fucking toys that are worth nothing.
6665760	6669040	Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura.
6669040	6673000	Well, this actually makes me super happy.
6673000	6678880	There is an option in Uncharted 4 that makes a lot of people happy, and it's an accessibility
6678880	6686640	menu for people who have a physical audio or visual impairment.
6686680	6692100	In fact, there was a comment made by Josh Straub, who is the editor-in-chief of the
6692100	6699480	Disabled Accessibility for Gaming Entertainment Rating System, or DAGRS, who had a complaint
6699480	6703840	about Uncharted 2, that there was a series of doors that you couldn't get through unless
6703840	6708000	you button mashed through them, and his physical disability lowered his reflexes to where he
6708000	6709200	couldn't do it.
6710120	6717120	They actually went in and rated Uncharted 4, and I'm trying to find the rating.
6717120	6722480	This one, they pretty much gave it as perfect a rating as they could, that they found no
6722480	6731600	limitations to playing the game for most visually impaired, audio impaired, or physical disabilities.
6731600	6732600	Good for them.
6732600	6733600	Yeah.
6733600	6734600	That's great.
6735000	6742400	A lot of developers don't always think about people who may not be able to handle certain
6742400	6746680	things, have any kind of...
6746680	6751680	I hate to use the word disability, just because in some cases, some people don't find it to
6751680	6761360	be a disability, especially in terms of autism or other being non-neurotypical.
6762000	6768380	But at the same time, having those differences catered to, it makes a lot of difference,
6768380	6774080	and it shows the company respects the people who are buying their games enough to make
6774080	6776720	it accessible to a wider market.
6776720	6777840	Have you guys had...
6777840	6782760	I know one thing about being a podcaster for this long is that I've really had my eyes
6782760	6787720	opened up to not just me as a gamer and Loki as a gamer and our soccer, but the other gamers
6787720	6788720	out there.
6788760	6792640	I don't know if you guys ever get this, but I know we have people that call into the show.
6792640	6797200	For example, just I think last week or two weeks ago, we had a blind gamer who sometimes
6797200	6801080	calls into the show pretty regularly who kind of reminds us like, oh shit, yeah, there are
6801080	6806840	people who like video games that if game makers don't consider these people when making them,
6806840	6807840	they're kind of shut out.
6807840	6808840	I don't know.
6808840	6809840	Have you guys...
6809840	6813240	Do you guys have any fans or people that listen or talk to you guys that are kind of like,
6813240	6817960	oh shit, I never would have thought that this part of the game would have been a challenge,
6817960	6819200	but maybe...
6819200	6822520	We have one guy who's pretty consistent.
6822520	6824320	He does a YouTube channel and stuff.
6824320	6831520	He actually had brain surgery to remove a tumor and it's messed with his reflexes in
6831520	6832520	one of his hands.
6832520	6837160	And he was a really good tournament level Street Fighter player.
6837160	6841360	And so I started streaming Street Fighter and he'd come in and give me tips and stuff
6841360	6842360	and I was like, well, let's play.
6842360	6847920	And he's like, I can't because I'm not good because of what happened.
6847920	6849400	And we started playing anyways.
6849400	6850400	I was like, dude, just play.
6850400	6855160	Cause he still had the game at Street Fighter IV and we played and it did kind of open my
6855160	6862520	eyes to that there are people out there and it kind of turned into like a Rocky situation.
6862520	6866360	He'd go in my streams and be giving me all sorts of amazing tips and stuff.
6866360	6868360	And I was just playing through his instruction.
6868360	6869360	That's rad.
6869360	6873440	That like the fact that like, okay, maybe I can't play the game, but that's not going
6873440	6877340	to stop me from playing the theory crafting of the game and the science of the game and
6877380	6878380	all that.
6878380	6882180	I kind of went through some of that after I had that hand surgery twice where I couldn't
6882180	6885640	play games on a console as long as I used to.
6885640	6891620	And it made me into a PC player actually, because I wouldn't play PC games except for
6891620	6895020	tetranet and like Ragnarok online.
6895020	6898420	And now, well, you remember when we were playing final fantasy 11.
6898420	6900200	I started off with the controller.
6900200	6905340	All my macros were set through my shoulder buttons and I played an entire MMO on a controller
6905520	6908660	that wasn't necessarily meant to be played on a controller.
6908660	6911460	And then I had hand surgery and I couldn't do it again.
6911460	6918060	There's still some games I can't play because it's not something I make super common knowledge,
6918060	6920540	but I am autistic.
6920540	6926100	And so I can't play with certain levels of depth in a game.
6926100	6932260	And I can't play with certain flashing because it'll be overstimulating.
6932260	6937660	So I like when I can find a game that says turn off this feature, like the blur in Mass
6937660	6938940	Effect.
6938940	6939940	The motion blur.
6939940	6940940	I had to turn that off.
6940940	6941940	You could turn that off, yeah.
6941940	6944800	Because that would just fuck with me.
6944800	6945900	Motion blur fucks with most people.
6945900	6947020	I hate motion blur.
6947020	6951040	It's the bane of my, like in Doom, I was on the multiplayer beta and there was no way
6951040	6952040	to turn that shit off.
6952040	6953860	Almost killed it for me.
6953860	6959140	There's some games I can take it in that has like a fraction of it, but when it's like
6959140	6966180	that pronounced, it actually, it's not quite like a pain, but I feel like I get tunnel
6966180	6970820	vision right away, almost like I'm about to shut down, so I have to stop it.
6970820	6974900	The first time I saw it, I had to close down the game until I figured out you could turn
6974900	6975900	it off.
6975900	6976900	But yeah.
6976900	6978620	Well, I love this discussion.
6978620	6981740	I got to keep things moving for time, though, unfortunately.
6981740	6986020	But yeah, I think the additional accessibility and the fact that they tested it with a greater
6986020	6989180	audience, I think that's a great thing and I hope more game makers will look to that.
6989180	6992100	Well, let's travel around the world quickly and check out some release dates and some
6992100	6995340	games that will be coming out soon near you.
6995340	7000300	So this week we have Overwatch coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7000300	7001300	Good.
7001300	7005900	Also, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mutants in Manhattan on PlayStation 4, PlayStation
7005900	7009420	3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC.
7009420	7015140	And that's the game that was from Platinum, so that should be pretty cool.
7015140	7020500	Total War Warhammer on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
7020500	7023540	Omnibus on PC.
7023540	7027660	And Table Trap Racing World Tour on PC.
7027660	7030460	Omnibus looks awesome, by the way.
7030460	7034620	Looking at Japan and the Japanese release dates, on the PlayStation 4, Guilty Gear,
7034620	7036860	I think that, do we say Xrd?
7036860	7037860	Xrd?
7037860	7038860	Xrd?
7038860	7041460	I'm not sure exactly how the fans pronounce that, but Guilty Gear X.
7042300	7047220	Revelator is out in a regular and a limited edition on the PlayStation 4 this week.
7047220	7049500	I don't know if the Wii U has anything new this week.
7049500	7050500	I don't think so.
7050500	7051500	I think it's kind of slow there.
7051500	7052500	I don't think they have anything coming out on the Wii U anymore.
7052500	7056180	Yeah, even in Japan, I don't think there's anything until June when the Mario and Sonic
7056180	7057340	Olympic stuff.
7057340	7059140	But yet they are still trucking along with the Vita.
7059140	7061860	In fact, there's a lot of Vita games this week in Japan.
7061860	7064700	Classic Dungeon Sengoku is out this week.
7064700	7068220	Kayokai no Shoryuki comes out in a limited edition this week.
7068260	7073740	Sengoku Hime 4, Tenka Rioran, Tenmei no Koi Imaki comes out this week as well.
7073740	7078900	And let's see, Koyukai no Shoryaki is in the regular edition as well.
7078900	7082580	So there's regular and limited edition on the Vita in Japan.
7082580	7085420	And lastly, on the 3DS this week, nothing.
7085420	7088020	Things are still pretty quiet until June the 9th.
7088020	7091220	What was this on Sengoku Hime?
7091220	7094020	Like Princess of the Three Kingdoms?
7094020	7095900	I'm not sure if that...
7096500	7099020	Yeah, it's definitely a princess game.
7099020	7103580	Yeah, it looks like one of those like Romance of the Three Kingdoms type of games, but all
7103580	7104580	ladies in charge.
7104580	7105580	I had a feeling.
7105580	7106580	Yeah.
7106580	7107580	My turn.
7107580	7108580	Yes, Europe.
7108580	7109580	Oh, Europe.
7109580	7110580	I'm sorry.
7110580	7113300	You get one game and you'll like it.
7113300	7114300	I think.
7114300	7116380	Dungeons 2 on PlayStation 4.
7116380	7117380	Safine.
7117380	7120340	All right, slow week in Europe.
7120340	7122340	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
7122780	7126060	A dozen indie developers are like, hey, what about me?
7126060	7129220	We'll tell Eurogamer to start listing your shit.
7129220	7133300	A great time to catch up on indies or like the 500 other games in your backlog.
7133300	7134300	Yeah.
7134300	7136940	All right, just a couple more quick stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the
7136940	7138260	classic game of the week.
7138260	7139260	Loki.
7139260	7144620	So this is, I guess, a good demonstration of how YouTube's kind of broken.
7144620	7151020	Apparently a recent episode of Family Guy had featured a clip from a YouTube user Switched
7151060	7157580	with one instead of an eye, featuring a glitch from Double Dribble.
7157580	7164900	And what's kind of funny is, so first they borrowed the footage and used it in the episode,
7164900	7168980	I'm assuming without licensing it from the original user that made it.
7168980	7174580	And then on top of all that, after it did air and everything, Content ID said, hey,
7174580	7178580	hey you with the original clip that was on YouTube, we're going to fucking Content ID
7178580	7184020	claim your fucking video because it's our video now.
7184020	7191480	So Fox Content ID claimed the video that they borrowed for the episode of Family Guy.
7191480	7194820	Which I'm sure they never contacted the guy to get permission because in a way they kind
7194820	7197260	of don't have to because it's really Konami's game.
7197260	7198260	Right.
7198260	7200740	Did they contact Konami for license?
7200740	7204660	And I mean, I guess it could be kind of, I don't know if you want to call it fair use
7204660	7209260	because they're talking over it and stuff and it's kind of transformative in that way,
7209260	7212740	which I really wish something like that would go to court because then that would set precedents.
7212740	7214440	But who knows?
7214440	7217340	Of course, you know, Seth MacFarlane, you know, on Twitter said, hey, you know, he's
7217340	7223700	kind of aware, you know, I don't run Fox, but stop tweeting me, but I will look into
7223700	7224700	the issue.
7224700	7229620	Apparently the video did get put, you know, the DMCA strike was lifted and it was back
7229620	7230620	up.
7230620	7234260	But still though, I mean, they didn't ask permission for that guy's clip.
7234260	7239540	I mean, it's kind of, kind of lame that they can just steal that off the internet, especially
7239540	7244620	when, you know, if I were to steal a Family Guy clip, obviously we get content ID strike.
7244620	7251620	YouTube needs to fix this content ID fuckery soon because Amazon is right behind them,
7251620	7253300	ready to pounce in for the kill.
7253300	7257220	And this is the type of thing that's going to send people somewhere else.
7257220	7261220	And you guys might remember just what last week, Amazon said they're launching their
7261220	7265460	own thing that is essentially going to compete at least with like the premiere stuff on YouTube,
7265460	7270460	where basically they're going to open up Amazon Prime, where anybody can put their show on
7270460	7271740	Amazon Prime.
7271740	7275140	And that's going to even, you know, we're not in the business of doing video, but now
7275140	7280420	even I'm sitting here going, if I did make a video show, because Dark Soccer and I have
7280420	7284920	talked about it before doing something, you know, inspired by some other things we follow,
7284920	7292800	like if we did do a video show, would we put it on YouTube or should we go to Amazon?
7292800	7297920	You know, these, I think as long as YouTube continues to show that they're going to side
7297920	7302320	with the corporations long before they side with the people creating the content, I kind
7302320	7304760	of think it just inspires people to run the other direction.
7304760	7305760	I've said this before.
7305760	7308320	You should go to Vimeo.
7308320	7311960	But then see, but then here's the problem, Vimeo is kind of, it's still kind of niche.
7311960	7315880	Vimeo hasn't really, Vimeo is not an app on your PlayStation 4.
7315880	7318040	You know what I mean?
7318040	7319040	What?
7319040	7320040	Bianca Del Rio goes through Vimeo.
7320040	7324280	Oh, well, if it's good enough for her, then it's good enough for us.
7324280	7328720	I'm just saying the problem is there's no Vimeo app on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but
7328720	7329720	there is Amazon Prime.
7329720	7330720	You know what I mean?
7330720	7332540	That's why I think there is Twitch.
7332540	7336200	That's why I think Amazon entering this market is finally, somebody's going to fucking give
7336200	7337400	YouTube some competition.
7337400	7340920	I'm excited.
7340920	7345860	YouTube has kind of been in some weird space, especially with their major users and stuff
7345860	7346860	like that.
7346860	7354520	They're very popular Twitch creators, or YouTube creators, and they've been very vocal about
7354520	7358480	it too, how they're not happy with the state of YouTube.
7358480	7365120	I think if one of them, I don't know, who's like a real big one out there that's PewDiePie?
7365120	7369720	Like if a PewDiePie said, hey, Amazon's doing their thing, I might have to go over there
7369720	7370720	for a second.
7370720	7374720	Then they can probably get a big draft of people just be like, well, I mean, PewDiePie's
7374720	7375720	over there.
7375720	7376720	I'm over there now, you know?
7376720	7379840	And then you have this giant civil war or something like that, that just people are
7379840	7380840	choosing sides.
7380840	7381840	Oh, man.
7381840	7382840	It's going to be just like the movie.
7382840	7383840	I'm on T-Putes.
7383840	7384840	T-Markiplier.
7384840	7385840	Yeah, see?
7385840	7387840	Yeah.
7387840	7388840	He's my friend.
7388840	7389840	Yeah.
7389840	7391920	So was I. Yeah, you're going to get some of that type
7391920	7392920	of stuff.
7392920	7395840	I mean, it'll draw some lines, definitely.
7395840	7401680	But Amazon, you're right, they have their prime to pounce on this type of thing.
7401680	7402680	Nice.
7402680	7403680	Nice.
7403680	7407440	I wasn't even thinking about that, too.
7407440	7412580	For once, I actually really agree with Kaijuto on this comment.
7412580	7413800	All joking aside.
7413800	7417200	What shocks me the most out of this story is that Family Guy is still on the air.
7417200	7420240	That was the reaction I had.
7420240	7421920	I thought it was only in repeats.
7421920	7425000	I thought it was just that thing that's always on the stoner television.
7425160	7426160	That's true.
7426160	7427160	New episodes, yeah.
7427160	7428160	I haven't watched it.
7428160	7429160	Have you seen the clip of the Double Dribble?
7429160	7430160	Because I've watched it.
7430160	7434360	Luckily, somebody filmed it with their iPhone and put it on YouTube so that it wouldn't
7434360	7435360	match content ID.
7435360	7436360	So yes, I did see it.
7436360	7439200	Yeah, it's a pretty funny clip.
7439200	7442560	I thought they were talking about another clip, because they did the same one for a
7442560	7443920	football game, too.
7443920	7448240	But it's such like, I guess this is kind of typical of Family Guy, and they're really
7448240	7452920	long references or very obscure references.
7452920	7455160	Most people aren't going to know what the fuck that is.
7455160	7458160	They're like, Double Dribble, what?
7458160	7461380	Is that a real game?
7461380	7466040	They're targeting a very specific audience here, and it's just like, I don't know.
7466040	7468120	People are going to be kind of pissed off about it.
7468120	7472760	Since you guys at Video Game Bang do more of the video than we do here at OLR, you guys
7472760	7474240	actually do broadcasting.
7474240	7476360	Have you ever gotten hit by the copyright thing?
7476360	7477360	Oh yeah.
7477360	7478360	Oh yeah.
7478360	7479360	We've been hit.
7480360	7483000	We've been hit by different type of stuff to get banned, too.
7483000	7484000	Yeah.
7484000	7485000	We get banned for weird things.
7485000	7488360	Luckily, they're not as strict as YouTube, because YouTube, there's like three strikes
7488360	7489360	and you're out.
7489360	7490360	Yeah.
7490360	7494480	For us, we use some music that has gotten caught.
7494480	7495480	Yeah, muted.
7495480	7496480	Yeah.
7496480	7497480	We get to mute it.
7497480	7498480	They'll mute it out.
7498480	7499480	They'll just mute the audio.
7499480	7500480	We've gotten banned only twice.
7500480	7501480	Once, because idiot over here broke NDA.
7501480	7502480	Because I didn't read an NDA.
7502480	7503480	Excuse me.
7503480	7504520	Yeah, you got to read your damn NDA's.
7504520	7506640	He didn't read NDA's, and it wasn't even a very good game.
7506640	7507640	What was it?
7508640	7509640	Nightwatch?
7509640	7510640	I don't remember.
7510640	7511640	Something.
7511640	7512640	No.
7512640	7513640	It was something by...
7513640	7515640	2K, wasn't it?
7515640	7516640	I can't remember.
7516640	7520640	It was one of those zombie horde games where you build...
7520640	7523640	Oh yeah, yeah.
7523640	7525640	The Unreal 4 one.
7525640	7528640	I could have swore people were streaming it, so I was like...
7528640	7529640	Well, they had permission.
7529640	7531640	I was like, well, then I'm going to stream this thing.
7531640	7532640	Oh, yeah.
7532640	7533640	That is some bullshit, too.
7533640	7536640	You know, where, oh, these people can have permission to stream this.
7536640	7537640	Yeah, but you can't.
7537640	7538640	All these other people know about them dollar bills.
7538640	7542640	So I got 30 minutes of that, and then they shut me down, and I was like, what happened
7542640	7543640	to the game?
7543640	7544640	And, yeah, it's gone.
7544640	7547640	Our other ban was for nonsense, because...
7547640	7548640	So this idiot...
7548640	7551640	It was April Fools.
7551640	7552640	Watch Dogs had just come out.
7552640	7556640	I was like, hey, I'm going to make this article saying that there was a hot coffee mod in
7556640	7561640	Watch Dogs on Nerd Reactor, you know, as a joke article, and link it to a Twitch.
7561640	7564640	And then when they get to the Twitch, it was just going to be a picture, like a video of
7564640	7566640	my dogs in their crates all day.
7566640	7567640	Watch Dogs.
7567640	7568640	Get it?
7568640	7569640	Funny.
7569640	7570640	Yeah.
7570640	7571640	Okay.
7571640	7576640	Twitch didn't think it was funny either, so they banned us for like 48 hours.
7576640	7577640	Over some dogs?
7577640	7578640	Over some dogs.
7578640	7579640	Over some Watch Dogs.
7579640	7582640	It would have been great, though, if you actually had a cup of coffee in front of the dog.
7582640	7583640	There you go.
7583640	7584640	See?
7584640	7585640	That's why I needed to be here.
7585640	7586640	Then it would have been accurate.
7586640	7587640	Yeah.
7587640	7589640	Well, thank God you met us.
7589640	7591640	Watch out.
7591640	7592640	Watch out.
7592640	7593640	I think about this stuff regularly.
7593640	7594640	Coffee and dogs.
7594640	7595640	Yeah.
7595640	7598640	The SSJ100Matt says, that was a good troll.
7598640	7599640	Thank you.
7599640	7600640	Some folks appreciate that.
7600640	7601640	They do.
7601640	7602640	Now, thank you.
7602640	7603640	SSJ100Matt also reminding me.
7603640	7606640	I promised I would bring up Glee later in the show.
7606640	7607640	Okay.
7607640	7612640	So Fox is obviously the one that has the Uber clamp down content ID thing.
7612640	7615640	Let's not forget, Fox has stolen shit in the past.
7616640	7621640	Do you remember when they did Baby Got Back on Glee and they totally stole Jonathan Colton's
7621640	7622640	version?
7622640	7623640	Borrowed.
7623640	7624640	Borrowed.
7624640	7625640	Borrowed.
7625640	7627640	And didn't even credit the guy.
7627640	7629640	They sold that version on iTunes.
7629640	7630640	Really?
7630640	7631640	Not even a fucking...
7631640	7632640	No, that's so cool.
7632640	7633640	They probably totally credited the guy that made the YouTube video, too.
7633640	7634640	Oh, wait.
7634640	7636640	No, they fucking didn't because they're Fox.
7636640	7638640	See, here's the weird thing about it, though.
7638640	7640640	But at the end of the day, that was...
7640640	7644640	If I remember right, the original gameplay clip was like nothing but footage from Konami's
7644640	7645640	game, right?
7645640	7646640	Yes.
7646640	7649640	So I'm kind of like, do they really have to get the guy's permission?
7649640	7653640	I don't think they do because it's Konami's fucking game and the guy's face wasn't in
7653640	7654640	it.
7654640	7657640	His commentary wasn't in it as far as I know.
7657640	7658640	So...
7658640	7660640	They only have to get someone's permission because...
7660640	7667640	Well, I think, okay, no, they would not need to get his permission to use footage of Double
7667640	7673640	Dribble, but being that it's his footage of Double Dribble, they didn't just make footage
7673640	7674640	up.
7674640	7676640	Then, yeah, I think they do need to get permission from him.
7676640	7681640	And how hard would it be to reach out to this guy and there's no way he'd be like, oh, no,
7681640	7683640	I don't want my stuff on your show.
7683640	7684640	Yeah, right.
7684640	7685640	He's gonna give up his stuff.
7685640	7686640	I equate it to a photograph.
7686640	7692640	Like, you have to ask permission to use a photograph on something.
7692640	7693640	That's true.
7693640	7694640	Ask the guy.
7694640	7696640	I'm literally sure he's gonna be like, yeah, I would love it.
7696640	7699640	Sure, they could have just been like, hey, just a heads up.
7699640	7701640	We're gonna air your stuff.
7701640	7704640	Here's some free tickets to Megyn Kelly's upcoming talk show or something.
7704640	7705640	Yeah, there you go.
7705640	7706640	There you go.
7706640	7707640	Whatever.
7707640	7708640	And he'll gladly take that.
7708640	7713640	Megyn Kelly, what the fuck?
7713640	7715640	All right.
7715640	7718640	Let's talk about Resident Evil 7.
7718640	7722640	Apparently it's happening, which, good, I thought 6 had killed the whole series, honestly.
7722640	7723640	It almost did.
7723640	7724640	So I think a lot of us were thinking...
7724640	7726640	Where do you go from giraffe fellatio?
7726640	7729640	Where do you go from giraffe fellatio?
7729640	7730640	Which 6 was that?
7730640	7731640	Oh, the symbol.
7731640	7732640	The box art?
7732640	7733640	Yes, the actual 6.
7733640	7735640	Now you'll never unsee it.
7735640	7740640	I literally was thinking in the game, I'm like, I don't remember seeing giraffe.
7740640	7743640	It was done so artistically.
7743640	7745640	It's like the old Red Bull logo.
7745640	7747640	You can never forget it and never unsee it.
7747640	7748640	The Red Bull logo?
7748640	7749640	Sold Red Bull logo.
7749640	7751640	Don't ruin that now for me.
7751640	7752640	I don't even want to think.
7752640	7755640	Now I'm gonna have to go and Google search the old Red Bull logo.
7755640	7762640	Or if you ever go to Final Fantasy XIV's Mog station, it's supposed to be like a little Moogle hat or something like that.
7762640	7765640	It looks like the Moogle is bending over and showing you his butthole.
7765640	7770640	And you'll never, now you will never unsee that when you go to look at the Mog station.
7770640	7772640	All right. Anyway.
7772640	7778640	Resident Evil 7, apparently a thing that is gonna happen and you are gonna see it at E3.
7778640	7786640	Apparently some tweets from a Tokyo-based analyst, Dr. Serkan Toto mentioned that it will be shown at E3.
7786640	7797640	The Resident Evil 7 team hired Jordan Amaro, a designer who had worked on Metal Gear Solid 5 and PT at Kojima Productions.
7797640	7803640	So, well, it's not Del Toro and it's not, you know, Hideo Kojima.
7803640	7807640	But it's like we're trying to narrow down the degrees of Kevin Bacon type of thing.
7807640	7814640	Like so, we got a dude who worked with those guys, maybe like assimilated some of the good ideas.
7814640	7824640	But the problem is that like Resident Evil, the newer games now seem to be more in line with like the Resident Evil movies which are like ridiculously action-based.
7824640	7830640	I mean, I want to say that, you know, being that I never actually played Resident Evil 6, just kind of watched different gameplay.
7830640	7836640	But they had a scene where I think where one of the characters jumped an explosion with a motorcycle or something like that.
7836640	7849640	Which, that doesn't seem like survival horror to me. I mean, it's not the same like as Resident Evil 1 where you're in a mansion and there's like jump scares and zombies and monsters and shit.
7849640	7852640	It's just like, I don't know.
7852640	7864640	They've drastically moved away from one now. Like it's night and day. Like one, you can even kind of be like, oh, it's survival horror and there's puzzle elements to the game as well, you know.
7864640	7871640	There are no puzzle challenges whatsoever in Resident Evil anymore. It's run, shoot this, blow that up, and that's it.
7871640	7875640	I want the terrible voice acting back. I want the terrible, terrible voice acting back.
7875640	7880640	Just know what you are, you know. There's always a place for a bad horror movie.
7880640	7892640	Alright, there's always a place on this show for the classic game of the week. Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that is ten years older or more that she thinks,
7892640	7899640	hey, you little brats, stop blowing giraffes and go play this classic video game.
7899640	7902640	Break out your ethernet adapter for your dreamcast.
7902640	7908640	I love this pick. This is one of my very favorite games. Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
7908640	7910640	Phantasy Star Online.
7910640	7911640	Yes!
7911640	7914640	Did you choose that because you knew he was going to be on here?
7914640	7916640	Exactly, like if I had to choose a second one.
7916640	7917640	Divine Intervention.
7917640	7918640	Exactly.
7918640	7920640	Well, I did an MMO last week. I figured I'd do another one.
7920640	7921640	Great.
7921640	7929640	And it's also one that I super love that actually I've been sort of in this rut of MMOs right now because I'm getting kind of bored with Final Fantasy XIV.
7929640	7934640	Kind of thinking about going back to WoW and then I was like, wait, I could just re-patch Phantasy Star Online 2.
7934640	7940640	And I could play it in partial Japanese and badly translated English.
7940640	7943640	But you've probably played it so much that you know how to navigate through that.
7943640	7944640	Yeah.
7944640	7945640	No problem, yeah.
7945640	7948640	I did play Phantasy Star Online 2 for a while actually.
7949640	7954640	So anyway, Phantasy Star Online 2 came out on December 21st, 2000.
7954640	7956640	So get this.
7956640	7959640	16 years old.
7959640	7960640	No.
7960640	7962640	15 years old and change.
7962640	7964640	So, still.
7964640	7966640	You don't really think about it, right?
7966640	7970640	So this one is a full hack and slash.
7970640	7979640	And it's different than a lot of MMOs in the fact that where you have certain quests to do, you're not in a huge open world.
7979640	7981640	You're in a sectional world.
7981640	7984640	So you're navigating through these different planes.
7984640	7987640	I mean, you can freaking memorize entire levels.
7987640	7989640	I used to just have a pile of them memorized.
7989640	7991640	But you could get your little...
7991640	7993640	Crap, now I forgot the names of them.
7993640	7994640	Your little floaty things.
7994640	7995640	Your mags.
7995640	7997640	Mags, yes. Thank you.
7997640	8004640	I ran around with an Oppa Oppa for the longest time because my first favorite game is the Guardian Legend.
8004640	8006640	My second favorite is Fantasy Zone.
8006640	8012640	And I ran around with an Oppa Oppa forever and my friend had a Dreamcast and another friend of mine had a Master System.
8012640	8014640	And it was amazing.
8014640	8025640	So when we got it in the US, I think that we started with the Phantasy Star Online 1 and 2 which came out in 2002.
8025640	8028640	In Japan, you had each individual one.
8028640	8036640	And then we had... There was an Episode 3 which was the card revolution that came out on GameCube in 2003.
8036640	8038640	That was terrible.
8038640	8046640	And so that's where Blue Burst comes from as the fourth installment in the series.
8046640	8049640	That came out in 2004. So we're still 12 years back.
8049640	8052640	This video is so crazy because it's a speedrun or something.
8052640	8054640	I'm going to switch it up a little bit.
8054640	8056640	I did find one that had music.
8056640	8058640	How about this? Because this is from the soundtrack.
8058640	8060640	The soundtrack was amazing.
8060640	8062640	I love the music in this game.
8062640	8068640	And of course, a lot of us played Blue Burst on PC.
8068640	8074640	Because after a while, new systems came out. They didn't put out a new one.
8074640	8077640	But the PC version kept getting updated until...
8077640	8082640	This was funny. They were allowing people when the US servers closed down,
8082640	8087640	they were giving them their character data to import into private servers.
8087640	8088640	Wow.
8088640	8093640	So Sega was fully cool with people continuing the game with their characters.
8093640	8095640	They just weren't going to support the server.
8095640	8098640	Wow. Take a note, Blizzard.
8098640	8100640	I'll let you do that.
8101640	8104640	And it did have an offline mode.
8104640	8108640	Which you can just play through everything and work on the story.
8108640	8110640	Take note of everybody that has an MMO.
8110640	8111640	Exactly.
8111640	8117640	I still, to this day, have a Red Ring Riku on my desk at work.
8117640	8118640	Wow.
8118640	8120640	From a little capsule thing.
8120640	8123640	I used to have the Sega Ladies one.
8123640	8125640	My Sarah Bryant's leg fell off.
8126640	8128640	Who was the other one that I had?
8128640	8131640	I still have Arl from P.O.P.O.
8131640	8134640	But I can't remember the other one I had that broke.
8134640	8139640	I got that game before it came out in America.
8139640	8143640	In 2002, I had no system.
8143640	8147640	And I was like, okay, I'm getting a GameCube because I read up on this game called Fantasy Star.
8147640	8149640	Whatever this is.
8149640	8153640	And I remember setting my desktop thing, or my background,
8153640	8157640	so that picture that's literally on this YouTube playing soundtrack.
8157640	8160640	And I was like, I'm getting this game no matter what comes out.
8160640	8164640	I buy four controllers, two memory cards.
8164640	8168640	We play, me and my three friends play all night long.
8168640	8172640	Like chuggy graphics, split screen on the GameCube.
8172640	8175640	Did not matter. We failed so hard for that game.
8175640	8178640	And it was just, it was amazing.
8178640	8182640	I didn't actually play online until two years after buying that game.
8182640	8186640	We couldn't get it to play online because the ethernet adaptor wasn't supported by the U.S.
8186640	8190640	One on Dreamcast. And then I played it on Xbox.
8190640	8194640	In fact, I will actually say that playing on Xbox,
8194640	8197640	this is before I had a reliable cell phone.
8197640	8201640	This was back in the Nokia phones that I had my Batsmaru cover on.
8201640	8204640	You know, the one that everyone had.
8204640	8209640	I actually had an instance that I needed to go to the hospital.
8209640	8214640	And I was playing with one of my friends, a local friend thankfully,
8214640	8217640	who came and got me and took me to the hospital
8217640	8220640	because I told her in the game, I think something's wrong
8220640	8222640	and I need someone to take me to the hospital.
8222640	8225640	And that's with that little dinky headset.
8225640	8228640	And so next thing I know, her character beeps out
8228640	8232640	and I get a call, I'm on my way.
8232640	8234640	They're saving lives.
8234640	8238640	Yeah, it turned out to not be anything majorly crazy, but it could have been worse
8238640	8240640	had I not gone.
8240640	8243640	It was just interesting.
8243640	8247640	And now we hear stories all the time about how people are talked down from suicide
8247640	8249640	and everything through their online games
8249640	8253640	or how this one guy logged off from his online games saying that that was it.
8253640	8256640	And because one of his online friends knew where he was,
8256640	8262640	they called the police and then prevented him from hanging himself.
8262640	8265640	I'm sorry though, nothing will top the Domino's Pizza
8265640	8269640	where the guy was ordering a pizza every other day for forever
8269640	8271640	and he didn't order a pizza for 11 days.
8271640	8274640	So Domino's Pizza called the cops, sent him to the guy.
8274640	8278640	Yep, the guy had a fall, was on the ground, needed medical intervention.
8278640	8279640	Wow.
8279640	8280640	Crazy.
8280640	8282640	Did he get free pizza for the rest of his life then?
8282640	8285640	He'll be in the commercials, you know it.
8285640	8290640	If that crazy guy can be in the Subway commercials, this guy can get a Domino's commercial.
8290640	8292640	Anyway, oh yeah, Fantasy Star.
8292640	8294640	I'd like to go into a little bit of the development of this
8294640	8297640	because I do think it's pretty interesting.
8297640	8300640	At the time, the Sega chairman was Okawa Isao
8300640	8304640	and he said the internet gaming was going to be important.
8304640	8306640	It was the future, you know.
8306640	8313640	And he was very curious about bringing the PC online element into consoles in Japan.
8313640	8316640	Because I mean, and he also looked back at Sega.
8316640	8319640	You had, you know, the Sega channel.
8319640	8320640	Oh yeah.
8320640	8324640	You had, you know, even that whole satellite thing came out in the US for a short while.
8324640	8330640	I mean, of course, Nintendo had the Satellaview, but they had really embraced it, I think.
8330640	8338640	And so, right after Sonic Adventure was completed, Sonic Team was tasked with making a network game.
8338640	8341640	They didn't quite know what it was, but it was going to be a network game.
8341640	8345640	And so, they had a working title called Third World
8345640	8352640	and they wanted to do science fiction and fantasy combined with realistic 3D graphics.
8352640	8357640	And so, the first piece of concept art was a dragon.
8357640	8361640	And he showed it to Yuji Naka, the director of Sonic Team.
8361640	8364640	Who my husband got to meet. He's a really cool guy.
8364640	8370640	Anyway, he immediately got the feeling of Phantasy Star with it.
8370640	8373640	And so, that's how it came to be called Phantasy Star Online.
8373640	8379640	And they actually took a big cue from Diablo for how the game would work.
8379640	8381640	For basic mechanics.
8381640	8389640	And pretty much, they went with some of the design staff from Phantasy Star IV.
8389640	8392640	And now we have it.
8392640	8399640	That's why I also think that it has such a stylistic tie-in with the Phantasy Star series.
8399640	8403640	Just because it went immediately with the designers from...
8403640	8404640	What?
8404640	8405640	Loki?
8405640	8406640	Nevermind.
8406640	8409640	He has a VR thing on his face and I was distracted.
8409640	8415640	And so, our first review of Phantasy Star Online came with a demo disc for Sonic Adventure 2.
8415640	8418640	And then, it came out.
8418640	8421640	This is the game I bought a Dreamcast for, really.
8421640	8425640	This is my first MMO before I even knew what an MMO was.
8425640	8429640	I was like, whoa, there's other people on the same game.
8429640	8431640	Yeah, that game was amazing.
8431640	8435640	Bobby and some of the people in chat are talking about that it's not really an MMO.
8436640	8438640	I'm kind of on the fence.
8438640	8441640	I think it has MMO characteristics and I think it's definitely like...
8441640	8443640	There were roleplay channels.
8443640	8446640	I definitely think there is a bridge here.
8446640	8447640	You know what I mean?
8447640	8450640	So, it's not EverQuest, but it's...
8450640	8453640	It's a massively multiplayer online game.
8453640	8454640	MMO.
8454640	8457640	Isn't Guild Wars the same type of setup?
8457640	8458640	Don't you kind of get into a...
8458640	8459640	It's an actual roleplay.
8459640	8460640	The original was.
8460640	8461640	You're right.
8461640	8462640	The original was a very similar type of setup.
8462640	8467640	I would say Phantasy Star Online was the console's first attempt
8467640	8470640	at replicating what the PC was doing in the MMO space.
8470640	8473640	Anyway, but technicalities.
8473640	8477640	At any rate, the whole basis of the game is that you're trying to find a planet to settle on
8477640	8480640	and so the Pioneer 1 is sent to check it out
8480640	8482640	and then you have the Pioneer 2 later on.
8482640	8486640	They go to this planet, Raghul, to investigate.
8486640	8488640	I will tell you this.
8488640	8492640	My friend, Julie, has a Rappy.
8492640	8493640	Like a plush one or something?
8493640	8498640	A plush Rappy that she paid 120 bucks for that is like...
8498640	8501640	That's it? Bitch got a deal.
8501640	8503640	Four feet tall and it's huge.
8503640	8505640	It's like the size of a toddler.
8505640	8506640	What color? Yellow?
8506640	8507640	A really fat toddler.
8507640	8508640	Yellow one?
8508640	8509640	Yeah.
8509640	8511640	I remember they had those special events where you would go in
8511640	8513640	and they had different color Rappy.
8513640	8517640	They were like a blue one and then you'd have to try to get it
8517640	8519640	to get a secret item or something like that.
8519640	8520640	Those were pretty cool.
8520640	8521640	We did all those.
8521640	8525640	And then the episodes pretty much keep continuing.
8525640	8527640	The gameplay pretty much stays a lot of the same.
8527640	8531640	You had your offline mode which had your stories and everything in there as well.
8531640	8534640	Your different side quests that you get through the Hunter's Guild and everything.
8534640	8536640	And then of course your online.
8536640	8540640	You can keep working, but you can get up to level 20 for hard mode,
8540640	8542640	40 for very hard and 80 for ultimate.
8543640	8548640	And then for blue burst it was actually broken down into series of separate missions.
8548640	8551640	And then you had special missions coming for the principal's office.
8551640	8552640	It was pretty cool.
8552640	8555640	You had symbol chat as well.
8555640	8560640	Which I liked because I would every so often play with Japanese players.
8560640	8562640	And so it was just really nice.
8562640	8564640	You could just put out your symbols and boom there you were.
8564640	8566640	And it was universal for everyone.
8567640	8572640	The game, I don't know, everybody that played, at least at my house,
8572640	8574640	because I played on the GameCube,
8574640	8577640	everybody that made a character, they felt unique.
8577640	8579640	And I think that was one thing I really liked about it.
8579640	8583640	I had a friend who he was just hardcore type of manly type of guy.
8583640	8587640	And he made this robot and he made them all tall and he had them all black.
8587640	8593640	And then you pick your name that you go through and it assigns you the color and everything.
8593640	8596640	So he was all hardcore black.
8596640	8600640	And then he had Pinkle right in the middle of his chest.
8600640	8602640	And I was like, you better own that dude.
8602640	8603640	Just take it.
8603640	8604640	And he was like, whatever.
8604640	8608640	I always played the Newman Mage.
8608640	8609640	The Newman Mage?
8609640	8610640	Yeah.
8610640	8611640	That was the other thing.
8611640	8616640	I guess you could say that was how I always thought it was an MMO.
8616640	8617640	And that was my first experience with one.
8617640	8623640	So going from that to WoW, I picked a warrior thinking,
8623640	8626640	oh, I can do a little bit of, you know, I can use any weapon.
8626640	8629640	I can do a little bit of magic up to a certain point.
8629640	8631640	That's what I thought a warrior was going to be when I played WoW.
8631640	8632640	Totally different.
8632640	8635640	And I was like, this is a terrible fantasy star and I'm playing that again.
8635640	8638640	And remember, I still have a paladin named Rebecca Black.
8638640	8639640	Wow.
8639640	8642640	Who I got to level 85 during Cataclysm.
8642640	8643640	Wow.
8643640	8644640	Oh, no.
8644640	8647640	There was one time I got followed around by someone just making up words to Friday,
8647640	8649640	following me around in one of the levels.
8649640	8653640	I was like, dude, you're cool, but I'm not going to be your friend.
8653640	8654640	Because that's creepy.
8654640	8656640	You're not that cool.
8656640	8657640	You're cool, but.
8657640	8660640	I do have screenshots of it.
8660640	8666640	So with Blue Burst, the other cool thing about that is that it came with the episode one
8666640	8668640	and two side story quests.
8668640	8669640	So it was pretty neat.
8669640	8674640	You also had, you know, your actions or your gestures that you could do and everything.
8674640	8675640	Like, come on.
8675640	8676640	Hi.
8676640	8678640	You know, all the little cute stuff.
8678640	8684640	And then, of course, we got Fantasy Star Online version two.
8684640	8688640	That was the we had the PC one.
8688640	8691640	And you also that was the one that introduced the ultimate mode.
8691640	8696640	GameCube and Xbox had episode one and two that came out in 2002.
8696640	8701640	And it had quite a bit more role play element to it with that version,
8701640	8705640	because it needed to be a more robust game for people who couldn't play it online.
8705640	8712640	And then Blue Burst, again, came out for Windows in 2004,
8712640	8717640	which I think it actually kind of works because, I mean, with Fantasy Star,
8717640	8721640	keep in mind that the Dreamcast ran on Windows CE.
8721640	8726640	So, well, almost every Dreamcast game ran on a version of CE.
8726640	8730640	In fact, with every game that comes on a Dreamcast,
8730640	8737640	it loads a version of CE before it runs the game so that it's running its OS first.
8737640	8741640	And then the game is tailored to that build of CE.
8741640	8747640	And so that was, I think, what made it easier for it to come out on, of course, PC,
8747640	8751640	because you're pretty much translating from one Microsoft OS to another.
8751640	8753640	And the same, of course, for Xbox.
8753640	8756640	As for GameCube, well, they're a special snowflake.
8758640	8763640	Then, of course, we got Fantasy Star Online 2, of course, much after that.
8763640	8765640	But this is focusing on the original.
8765640	8768640	Now, you know, this wasn't my first MMO, though, I must say.
8768640	8770640	You know what my first was?
8770640	8771640	What are you writing it on?
8771640	8775640	Gemstone 3 on AOL, text-based MMO.
8776640	8779640	And I played a crapload of Ragnarok Online.
8779640	8780640	And that's it.
8780640	8781640	So, Fantasy Star.
8781640	8782640	In fact, you know what?
8782640	8786640	I think I might just have to go back to Fantasy Star Online 2.
8786640	8787640	Who's with me?
8787640	8788640	Me, I love Fantasy Star.
8788640	8790640	I wish we'd get the sequel.
8790640	8791640	I really do, too.
8791640	8794640	I understand that it may not be as good and maybe, like,
8794640	8798640	the whole rose colored glasses thing, but it just depends on you.
8798640	8799640	I want to try it for myself.
8799640	8800640	Yeah, yeah.
8800640	8803640	Let's just find a private server for Fantasy Star Online, Blue Burst.
8803640	8804640	And do it.
8804640	8806640	Just message me at DarkSakura on Twitter.
8806640	8807640	All right.
8807640	8808640	We'll make this happen.
8808640	8813640	So, this week, we need a server for Minecraft VR, Tetranet, and PSO Blue Burst.
8813640	8815640	PSO Blue Burst gets the focus, though.
8815640	8816640	We'll work on that.
8816640	8817640	All right.
8817640	8818640	That'll be my task.
8818640	8819640	We're going to take a break.
8819640	8823640	I believe we are now at the point where we're at the halfway point of our show,
8823640	8826640	and it's already longer than the entirety of last week's show.
8826640	8827640	But that's all right.
8827640	8830640	We're having a good time here with our pals from Video Game Bang.
8830640	8834640	We're going to come back after this quick break with your phone calls here shortly,
8834640	8838640	1877-GameOLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,
8838640	8841640	and Fugu Question of the Week, as well as maybe the mailbag.
8841640	8843640	I don't know if we got emails this week.
8843640	8844640	No emails.
8844640	8845640	Never mind.
8845640	8846640	We won't do the mailbag.
8846640	8847640	But we will do more news when we come back.
8847640	8848640	It's a Quota Classic movie.
8848640	8850640	We ain't found shit.
8850640	8854640	Well, we hope you will find us again here after a quick break.
8854640	8855640	We'll be right back.
8861640	8864640	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
8864640	8872640	Live tonight with episode number 642 of our show for this May the 22nd of 2016.
8872640	8878640	Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, all here in studio with our pals from Video Game Bang,
8878640	8881640	another Sacramento-based video game podcast joining us here in studio tonight.
8881640	8885640	We got Aaron, Corey, Webb, all here.
8885640	8889640	And I'm going to be crashing their show on Wednesday, so make sure you tune in.
8889640	8890640	That'll be a lot of fun.
8890640	8893640	I realize, horrible host I am.
8893640	8897640	I never let you guys, like, tell people where to find your show.
8897640	8898640	I mean, I figure people know how to use Google.
8898640	8902640	But where can we find and follow all the good stuff for Video Game Bang?
8902640	8907640	So the usual places, iTunes, just search Video Game space bang.
8907640	8911640	We're also on Google Music, so if you have an Android device,
8911640	8913640	that's probably the easiest way to find it.
8913640	8916640	Facebook.com slash Video Game Bang bang.
8916640	8919640	Twitter at Video Game Bang.
8919640	8923640	And then we're actually going to be launching our website June 1st.
8923640	8928640	And that will be VGBstudios.com as well as Video Game Bang.com.
8928640	8931640	Nice. Wow, you got a whole empire going on over there.
8931640	8932640	Slowly but surely.
8932640	8933640	Nice.
8933640	8936640	And only we know about it.
8936640	8937640	All right.
8937640	8942640	We're going to pick up some rapid fire news and get into all the rest of the gaming news.
8942640	8944640	And we want to get into as well our Skype line.
8944640	8946640	1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.
8946640	8948640	Orange Lounge Radio.
8948640	8950640	We'll be opening that in just a little bit.
8950640	8953640	But we do want to run through at least this rapid fire news here first.
8953640	8955640	We'll start with Loki.
8955640	8956640	All right.
8956640	8959640	So unfortunately this isn't going to really save this game,
8959640	8964640	but there's a nice little Easter egg from Home Front Revolution.
8964640	8967640	And it's featuring Time Splitter 2 levels.
8967640	8970640	Apparently there's an arcade machine in the game
8970640	8973640	where you can actually play the first two levels of Time Splitters 2.
8973640	8978640	Which, that's awesome, but it also pisses me off
8978640	8983640	because I don't have Time Splitters 2 or even a new Time Splitters game.
8983640	8987640	Are they upping the graphics on the HD remake for at least the two levels?
8987640	8989640	It doesn't appear so.
8989640	8992640	I don't know, maybe that's a sign?
8992640	8993640	Missed opportunity.
8993640	8995640	That would be pretty cool.
8995640	8997640	But yeah, you get to play Siberia in Chicago.
8997640	8998640	So check it out.
8998640	9001640	Oh, Siberia Arrow, I played that level so many times
9001640	9004640	trying to beat it without being detected.
9004640	9006640	Oh my gosh, that's...
9006640	9008640	Time Splitter is a good one, yeah.
9008640	9009640	That's awesome.
9009640	9010640	That needs to come back.
9010640	9011640	All right.
9011640	9015640	And then, so Rockstar apparently has some new projects in the pipeline.
9015640	9018640	They're seeming to be revealed soon.
9018640	9021640	The thought is another Red Dead game,
9021640	9024640	being that it's been hinted at several times
9024640	9027640	through different social medias, Reddit and Twitter and stuff.
9027640	9030640	Also, possibly something else coming out.
9030640	9034640	I guess E3 might be a good place for them to announce that
9034640	9036640	since I want to say that they're supposed to be there.
9036640	9039640	My thought is maybe another Red Dead game
9039640	9043640	being that they are getting the compatibility working for Red Dead Redemption
9043640	9046640	and that would be something that I could see them announcing
9046640	9049640	during Microsoft's press conference
9049640	9052640	and then doing, hey, by the way, it's going to be a Games for Gold game
9052640	9054640	and it's backwards compatible now.
9054640	9055640	That would be awesome.
9055640	9056640	Games for Gold?
9056640	9057640	Yeah.
9057640	9059640	So that would be something I could see.
9059640	9060640	I don't know.
9060640	9062640	Well, I guess we'll find out soon.
9062640	9065640	And then, last but not least,
9065640	9069640	Destiny had some leaks regarding the new expansion.
9069640	9072640	And this is going to be called Rise of Iron.
9072640	9078640	And I guess it's leaked from a new poster or key art for some poster
9078640	9080640	that was said to come out.
9080640	9083640	So, no idea.
9083640	9087640	They're saying that I guess some people familiar with Bungie
9087640	9090640	are saying that I guess it's going to feature a new raid.
9090640	9097640	And they said loosely based on the earlier Fallen themed one
9097640	9101640	of initially planned for House of Wolves DLC in year one.
9101640	9102640	But I guess crap.
9102640	9104640	I don't know.
9104640	9106640	Neat artwork, though.
9106640	9107640	That's pretty cool.
9107640	9110640	I still yet, I bought Destiny
9110640	9112640	like day one when I got my PlayStation 4.
9112640	9114640	Still have not played it.
9114640	9116640	That and Watch Dogs.
9116640	9119640	Both games still in their case, not played.
9119640	9121640	Have you actually watched Dogs?
9121640	9125640	I have not watched Video Game Bang's Twitch story.
9125640	9128640	But there are dogs on this poster.
9128640	9129640	Wolves, I guess.
9129640	9132640	Watch Wolves, the sequel.
9132640	9134640	Alright, speaking of sequels,
9134640	9136640	if you're looking forward to The Witcher 4,
9136640	9138640	you might be waiting a little while.
9138640	9141640	The Witcher 3 was pretty damn good.
9141640	9143640	And maybe it's time that CD Projekt
9143640	9145640	wants to move on to some other things.
9145640	9147640	And based on some comments this week
9147640	9149640	from the co-founder over at CD Projekt,
9149640	9150640	Mark and Iwinski,
9150640	9153640	they're not really actively working on A Witcher 4.
9153640	9155640	They're not denying that it's ever going to happen.
9155640	9157640	But they're just saying that they're focusing
9157640	9159640	on some other stuff right now.
9159640	9161640	Saying there won't be any Witcher anytime soon
9161640	9162640	if there ever will be one.
9162640	9164640	And I would really like to see how people feel about it
9164640	9165640	if they will enjoy it.
9165640	9168640	Speaking about some other stuff they're working on.
9168640	9170640	Witcher 3 Blood and Wine
9170640	9173640	is the upcoming expansion there for Witcher 3.
9173640	9176640	However, the CD Projekt is working on some other games
9176640	9180640	including Cyberpunk 2077.
9180640	9182640	That is supposed to come out in the next couple years.
9182640	9185640	There's also a mysterious AAA role-playing game
9185640	9187640	between 2017 and 2021.
9187640	9190640	But apparently it is not The Witcher 4.
9190640	9191640	It's something else.
9191640	9193640	And I think they've earned the ability
9193640	9195640	to do some other stuff if they want.
9195640	9198640	Another role-playing game I know has lots of people's attention
9198640	9200640	Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon.
9200640	9203640	You kids into Pokémon over at the Game Bang?
9203640	9205640	Eh, on and off.
9205640	9208640	I mean, to the Pokémon GO when that comes out.
9208640	9209640	I know I'll be into that.
9209640	9211640	But I haven't purchased...
9211640	9213640	The last one I played was Silver.
9213640	9217640	So I haven't been into Pokémon in quite some time.
9217640	9218640	I'm notorious.
9218640	9221640	I'll play them up through the first gym.
9221640	9223640	And then the OCD in me gets really overwhelmed
9223640	9225640	at everything I'm not catching and I quit.
9225640	9227640	It just happens without fail every time.
9227640	9230640	Back in my day there was 150 of them and we liked it.
9230640	9231640	That's right.
9231640	9232640	151.
9232640	9233640	Whoa!
9233640	9234640	No.
9234640	9236640	He didn't catch them all clearly.
9236640	9237640	152.
9237640	9238640	You forgot Missingno.
9238640	9239640	Alright.
9239640	9240640	Oh yeah.
9240640	9241640	Glitch.
9241640	9245640	Anyhow, I know a lot of people are very excited about Sun and Moon.
9245640	9248640	You can get more information on that apparently on June 2nd.
9248640	9250640	Because remember, Nintendo ain't bringing it to E3.
9250640	9252640	So they're kind of dumping the information a little early.
9252640	9253640	Allegedly.
9253640	9254640	Allegedly.
9254640	9256640	So we don't know if it's gameplay footage.
9256640	9259640	Maybe the evolutions of the starting characters they've already revealed.
9259640	9260640	Who knows?
9260640	9265640	But if you're a Pokémon fan, you probably already took June 2nd off of work.
9265640	9267640	Also, World of Warcraft.
9267640	9269640	You know that little movie that's coming out?
9269640	9270640	The Warcraft movie.
9270640	9272640	Not World of Warcraft movie, but Warcraft movie.
9272640	9274640	Because it's early on in the lore.
9274640	9278640	But as many people were speculating may happen,
9278640	9282640	you will have a chance to get World of Warcraft by seeing Warcraft.
9282640	9283640	Wow.
9283640	9289640	If you see the Warcraft movie, it's through a promotion at certain regal cinemas.
9289640	9292640	United Artists Theatres or Edwards Theatres,
9292640	9296640	which is a whole chain that are kind of related here in the States.
9296640	9299640	If you actually go see Warcraft through this promotion,
9299640	9303640	you will get a free, full copy of World of Warcraft.
9303640	9307640	Not the restricted version, but the full version of World of Warcraft.
9307640	9309640	Which, they just recently announced,
9309640	9313640	includes all expansions through Draenor.
9313640	9315640	The latest one they just released.
9315640	9319640	Now, it doesn't include Legion, the one they're about to release in August.
9319640	9321640	So they'll make some money there.
9321640	9323640	And yeah, those monthly sub-fees I think is what they're...
9323640	9325640	That's what they're going to make their money once they get you there.
9325640	9328640	They also, though, just gave out Warlords of Draenor for free,
9328640	9329640	because that's how I have it.
9329640	9330640	Right, right.
9330640	9334640	To people who own base Warcraft, you now have that for free.
9334640	9336640	So all you have to do is just wait?
9336640	9337640	Yeah, apparently.
9337640	9339640	You didn't use to be that way, man.
9339640	9341640	You would have to, like, I remember when...
9341640	9344640	I bought every expansion in between so I could get to Cataclysm.
9344640	9347640	I think when Cataclysm was the newest one,
9347640	9352640	I think you still had to buy Lich King and Cataclysm to catch up.
9352640	9354640	Like, you didn't just get it all for free.
9354640	9356640	And I said for the longest time, I used to do a WoW-focused show
9356640	9359640	and I was playing more often, and I said for the longest time,
9359640	9362640	you know, Blizzard needs to just include everything up to the latest expansion,
9362640	9364640	because that's the only way you're going to get people on board.
9364640	9366640	That's the way they do it with Final Fantasy XI,
9366640	9368640	and I'm assuming they do it with, you know,
9368640	9370640	because I've already bought that a few times now,
9370640	9372640	but each time it's always with the additional expansions.
9372640	9376640	Oh, and I'm sure with Final Fantasy XIV 4.0, whatever their next expansion is,
9376640	9377640	they're just going to have a base game.
9377640	9378640	And it's always dirt cheap, too.
9378640	9381640	Like, five bucks or something for the whole thing.
9381640	9383640	Actually, they just announced with Final Fantasy XIV
9383640	9388640	that their free trial is going to go now from level 20 up to level 35,
9388640	9391640	so you can actually experience the job system that kicks in at level 30.
9391640	9394640	So, that's kind of cool that they're expanding that out.
9394640	9396640	So, there you go.
9396640	9399640	Anyhow, so, yeah, if you've always been curious about World of Warcraft,
9399640	9402640	I guess if you see the movie, this will be your chance.
9402640	9406640	How nice of them to give me something to spend a bunch of money on.
9406640	9407640	That's right.
9407640	9408640	That's right.
9408640	9409640	How nice.
9409640	9411640	Exactly. It's drug, it's hood logic.
9411640	9413640	That's right. It's the first hit.
9413640	9414640	Yeah.
9414640	9416640	After you've seen the pretty movie.
9416640	9418640	All right, Dark Soccer, what do you have?
9418640	9422640	Well, the thing that everyone on the internet ever has been linking to me for the last week
9422640	9430640	is there is a fan movie for R-Type that's made by OdaKing 77077,
9430640	9437640	aka Paul Johnson, who basically animated a little short movie
9437640	9441640	about some guy who gets sucked into a copy of R-Type.
9441640	9443640	Yeah, I watched that one.
9443640	9444640	It was pretty neat.
9444640	9445640	Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
9445640	9450640	It was weird. They put a Not Safe for Work sign on it,
9450640	9452640	and I was like, what's not safe for work?
9452640	9456640	I guess they meant the language, but I'm like, there are people that curse everywhere.
9456640	9458640	I don't understand what's not safe for work.
9458640	9463640	Just what's baffling is how can anyone ever not know about the safe point
9463640	9465640	when you're fighting the first level boss.
9465640	9467640	Oh.
9467640	9469640	How?
9469640	9472640	It's just beyond me how people don't know about that now.
9472640	9473640	What?
9473640	9478640	Almost every fight in that game has a sweet spot that you can stay in
9478640	9480640	where nothing can hit you.
9480640	9483640	Honestly, I just haven't played R-Type.
9483640	9487640	It was well done because it was done by mainly one guy, basically, right?
9487640	9488640	Yeah.
9488640	9490640	Yeah, it was very well done.
9490640	9494640	The music was done. Actually, I loved the remix of the music in there
9494640	9501640	because the first level of R-Type has probably my favorite piece of video game music ever.
9501640	9505640	And it was a really good homage to it. I thought it was great.
9505640	9515640	So, also, for folks out there who have some concerns, concerns about,
9515640	9518640	you know, it would also help if I didn't close the wrong window.
9518640	9523640	Anyway, there's actually some, for people who had concerns about Yooka-Laylee,
9523640	9528640	there's some screenshots out, and it's pretty. It's so pretty.
9528640	9530640	And that's what's really important.
9530640	9532640	That's what I look for first in video games.
9532640	9533640	Exactly, right?
9533640	9534640	It's pretty, yeah.
9534640	9535640	Is it pretty?
9535640	9536640	Nope.
9536640	9537640	Okay. Gotta move on.
9537640	9541640	It is prettier than a little girl and her Sunday best. Is that pretty?
9541640	9543640	No comment on that one.
9543640	9544640	You know what?
9544640	9547640	Yeah, you're wise to just leave that alone.
9547640	9553640	No jerk photo moments happening on this podcast.
9553640	9560640	So, in other news, we have some sales that are on until tomorrow.
9560640	9564640	For the PlayStation Store, a bunch of games got knocked down to five bucks.
9564640	9570640	One of them being Journey, which that means I should probably go buy it tonight,
9570640	9578640	Borderlands, Max Payne, Manhunt, Shin Megami Tensei, Persona 3 Portable,
9578640	9582640	the Jackbox Party Pack 2, and the Banner Saga.
9582640	9587640	I only care about the one in there I have not yet played, which is Journey.
9587640	9591640	And that's it. That's it.
9591640	9596640	So, I will, though, there's a little thing on here that did grab my attention,
9596640	9600640	which is, alright, did any of you guys ever see Perfect Blue?
9600640	9601640	No, I don't think I have.
9601640	9602640	Yes.
9602640	9605640	It is a crazy anime. Like, completely wild.
9605640	9610640	Well, it looks like apparently the other thing that the director did,
9610640	9615640	Millennium Actress, is streaming for free, I think, but I can't find where.
9615640	9618640	Look it up for yourselves if you care.
9618640	9619640	Alright, you got Google.
9619640	9621640	Alright, let's get to the foogle question.
9621640	9623640	Speaking of Google, let's get to foogle.
9623640	9625640	You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together,
9625640	9634640	and you get foogle.
9634640	9637640	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities,
9637640	9640640	and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.
9640640	9643640	And this one is about, I don't know if you guys saw,
9643640	9649640	there's a leaked prototype that just released this week for a Snow White NES game.
9649640	9652640	Not that it was based on the movie, but I think it was kind of like a sequel,
9652640	9655640	whatever they, it was called Happily Ever After.
9655640	9657640	Sometimes it was like spiritual successor to Snow White.
9657640	9662640	And apparently, the joke is, the game is fucking hard.
9662640	9665640	So for something like based on Snow White,
9665640	9671640	it's apparently like ghosts and goblins level like tough.
9671640	9674640	So anyway, we asked our listeners this week,
9674640	9678640	what is a difficult video game that frustrated you,
9678640	9682640	but you stuck with it to accomplish what you wanted in the game,
9682640	9684640	whether that was like beating it, 100% collection.
9684640	9686640	How did you make it through all the frustrations?
9686640	9687640	That's what we asked this week.
9687640	9689640	What was the game and how did you push through?
9689640	9692640	Degenerate Johnny starting us off on Facebook saying,
9692640	9697640	the one game that was difficult but maybe pushed through is Catherine on the hardest difficulty.
9697640	9700640	If it wasn't for my intervention worthy trophy addiction,
9700640	9703640	I don't think I ever would have made it through that amount of torture.
9703640	9707640	However, my determination and perseverance to brag about this accomplishment
9707640	9710640	allowed me to break through this near suicidal ordeal.
9710640	9713640	Don't believe me? Look me up on PlayStation Network.
9713640	9718640	It's amazing what those stupid little achievements and trophies will motivate you to do.
9718640	9723640	Yeah, that was a bomb whenever Microsoft came out with achievements.
9723640	9724640	Yeah.
9724640	9726640	And he's like, I don't need this, but I'm going to do it.
9726640	9731640	Which is funny because I know I'm going like really old school and showing my age here,
9731640	9734640	but way back in the day when I was a kid during the Atari 2600 era,
9734640	9738640	Activision, if you sent them like a Polaroid of your score in like Pitfall or something,
9738640	9742640	they would mail you a patch that you could put on a jacket or something like that, right?
9742640	9745640	And of course, I'm sure it signed you up for some mailing list
9745640	9750640	to send you all the stuff to show mom for Christmas.
9750640	9753640	But that was truly the first type of achievements.
9753640	9757640	And I really think somebody at Microsoft thought of that idea and was like,
9757640	9759640	what if we just gave them a virtual patch?
9759640	9761640	Why don't we get some physical ones out here?
9761640	9762640	Right?
9762640	9765640	That's a great idea. We can do that to our games too.
9765640	9770640	Back in the day when, and I'm surprised there have been no Activision collection
9770640	9772640	where those patches are the achievements.
9772640	9774640	That seems so logical.
9774640	9775640	They've done that actually.
9775640	9776640	Did they?
9776640	9777640	I want to say they have.
9777640	9778640	With the full achievements? Maybe they did.
9778640	9781640	I want to say, I don't know.
9781640	9783640	It sounds like something.
9783640	9786640	I want to say they have had an Activision collection with patches.
9786640	9789640	All right. Fifth Dream on Facebook says Jet Grind Radio.
9789640	9791640	I had so much trouble with the fast pace and the controls,
9791640	9794640	but I liked the game a lot, so I kept playing.
9794640	9798640	I attempted some levels 20 to 30 times before I finally beat them.
9798640	9801640	I think the fact that I got a little better each time tried to push me to not give up.
9801640	9804640	I was so proud when I won the game.
9804640	9807640	Brad B., our buddy from Pod Culture, said BioShock.
9807640	9810640	But the scenery and soundtrack alone are worth it.
9810640	9813640	Sometimes you push through because it's pretty.
9813640	9815640	Fat Cylon. I love that name.
9815640	9817640	Fat Cylon replied Witcher 3.
9817640	9820640	The trick was to not play anything else.
9820640	9822640	I learned this the hard way by having breaks and coming back,
9822640	9825640	only to have my ass handed to me by all and sundry.
9825640	9830640	So it became my one and only and slowly but surely opened its hearts and legs to me.
9830640	9833640	All this to make sure Ciri got her happy ending.
9833640	9836640	Well, congratulations to you, Fat Cylon.
9836640	9839640	RageNator says the original Super Mario Brothers.
9839640	9842640	Got it as a separate game alongside my NES and Christmas of 87.
9842640	9844640	I got fairly far in it but could never beat it.
9844640	9847640	I ultimately gave up on trying to beat it.
9847640	9850640	Well, then you didn't really push through, did you?
9850640	9851640	You're a quitter.
9851640	9852640	You're a quitter.
9852640	9855640	You know what? You need to go back and kick that game's ass.
9855640	9859640	Winston H. says I love this game but would have to say Persona 3.
9859640	9861640	For the following reasons.
9861640	9864640	Teammates leave after X battles due to fatigue.
9864640	9867640	Elemental weaknesses work both ways so it can wipe your party out.
9867640	9870640	Maps randomly generate so finding checkpoints are difficult.
9870640	9872640	No real quick way to level up.
9872640	9879640	And ultimate boss with game facts and save state still requires many hours of preparation than I care to admit.
9879640	9881640	Sometimes you will just do that grind.
9881640	9883640	Just, again, to say you did it.
9883640	9886640	And Dark Tetsuya says La Mulana.
9886640	9888640	Would you expect any different answer from Dark Tetsuya?
9888640	9889640	I sure wouldn't.
9889640	9895640	But no, seriously, the first time I made it through the game after 60 hours of exploration, tricky enemies and tough bosses,
9895640	9899640	I can't think of any other game that has quite made me feel like that.
9899640	9905640	And lastly, ActDeft over on Google Plus says Tetris Evolution on the Xbox 360.
9905640	9908640	It's actually not a difficult game because it's Tetris.
9908640	9913640	But there's an achievement called Dirty South Style Back to Back.
9913640	9915640	I'm not going to look that up on Urban Dictionary.
9916640	9918640	It's the name of my sex tape.
9918640	9921640	But it's an achievement on Tetris Evolution.
9921640	9924640	It asks you to do three Tetrises in a row.
9924640	9927640	It's not something you can do by skill alone.
9927640	9929640	It also requires a lot of luck.
9929640	9932640	Yeah, to get three Tetrises in a row, you have to get three of those pieces.
9932640	9934640	You also have to set it up.
9934640	9936640	You have to set it up and just pray.
9936640	9938640	That's the only way to do it.
9939640	9941640	It made it all the more frustrating when you filled the screen
9941640	9945640	and didn't get at least two long Tetrominos.
9945640	9951640	I spent weeks trying to get that achievement back in the day until I finally got it.
9951640	9953640	That is a pain in the ass. Good for you.
9953640	9955640	Good answers, all you guys.
9955640	9961640	Anybody in the room care to give us a very difficult game that you just sucked it up and persevered?
9961640	9964640	Mischief Makers on the 64.
9964640	9966640	Oh, nice treasure game.
9966640	9971640	Yeah, that game I borrowed from a friend because he was like,
9971640	9974640	this game is terrible. It's crap. I don't want it here.
9974640	9977640	So he actually just gave it to me now that I think about it.
9977640	9982640	And so I just played it one day because it sat there for the longest and I didn't play it.
9982640	9985640	I put it in and I was like, this game is fun.
9985640	9990640	Like shaking everything the whole time and then all of a sudden it was just like an addiction.
9990640	9994640	And I just got into that game and I hadn't played until I beat it.
9994640	9996640	And it got difficult, definitely.
9996640	10002640	But it was one of those games that it's so fun that you don't really care how hard it was.
10002640	10005640	You kind of still went through it.
10005640	10006640	Jamie?
10006640	10010640	Level 37 Lavos fight.
10010640	10016640	Because I was determined to get the first of the special endings for Chrono Trigger.
10016640	10017640	Good answer.
10017640	10018640	And I freaking did it.
10018640	10019640	You have to see every single ending?
10019640	10022640	I think we've had 10 out of the 14 cartridge endings.
10022640	10027640	Was it? No, 14 was the PlayStation one.
10027640	10030640	The cartridge had 12.
10030640	10032640	10 or 12. Yeah.
10032640	10034640	We're like too short of all of them.
10034640	10040640	Because Dan and I went through and did another few rounds of Chrono Trigger together to add on to what I already had.
10040640	10044640	I would say for me, the original Mega Man.
10045640	10047640	Just because I remember that game.
10047640	10049640	I mean all of those games really are just about muscle memory.
10049640	10051640	Like you just have to learn the patterns.
10051640	10053640	You know when the enemies are going to come out.
10053640	10055640	What weapons work on what boss.
10055640	10059640	Like a lot of the great old NES games, it's all about muscle memory.
10059640	10063640	And you just push through because, I don't know, it's Mega Man and Mega Man's Red.
10063640	10067640	The music! I wanted to hear all the music in the game. That's why.
10067640	10070640	Alright. Any other answers in studio?
10070640	10072640	Alright. I was going to say VVVV.
10072640	10076640	Oh yeah. I still never finished it though.
10076640	10080640	Because I got tired of playing the one level.
10080640	10082640	That game is hard.
10082640	10086640	I'm trying to remember the actual name.
10086640	10088640	It's like...
10088640	10090640	Let's see here. I'm just looking up the achievements right now.
10090640	10094640	It was called...
10096640	10098640	I guess it wasn't its own thing.
10098640	10104640	It was the one that they had you where you had to flip through five different screens and then bounce back.
10104640	10106640	And then get it and then bounce back again.
10106640	10108640	It was a pain in the fucking ass.
10108640	10111640	Yeah. No. That game is difficult.
10111640	10112640	For sure.
10112640	10115640	Alright. We're going to do just a few more stories here.
10115640	10117640	Since we are after 9 o'clock, I think we'll do just one more round.
10117640	10119640	We don't have emails this week.
10119640	10123640	But if you want to send emails to the show, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
10123640	10125640	if you want to participate in a future episode of the show.
10125640	10127640	I think we'll do one more rotation here in the room.
10127640	10130640	And then we'll probably dump the rest of those stories while we wait for some phone calls.
10130640	10132640	So we'll do one more round here. So, Loki?
10132640	10135640	Alright. Let's see.
10135640	10139640	Well, let's just talk about there's a needle exploit that they have on the PlayStation 4.
10139640	10142640	I guess they've already got it running Linux, which I guess makes sense.
10142640	10147640	But you can possibly run Steam games on the PlayStation 4.
10147640	10149640	How is that possible?
10149640	10152640	Well, it involves installing Linux.
10152640	10161640	Basically, I guess, through a jailbreak, you install Arch Linux and then some software libraries.
10161640	10166640	And once you have that done, you can install Linux version of Steam.
10166640	10173640	And, yeah, they've got at least running the Steam interface, showing some video of that.
10173640	10176640	I'm not sure if they've run any games.
10176640	10181640	Let's see the spoilery video here. See if they've pulled it up.
10181640	10185640	Yeah, I don't know if they've run any games.
10185640	10189640	Oh, actually, they are running...
10189640	10191640	Is that Bastion?
10191640	10193640	They're running Bastion.
10193640	10196640	Which is already available on the PlayStation 4.
10196640	10198640	But, hey, hackers gonna hack.
10198640	10200640	It's still pretty cool.
10200640	10207640	However, you're not gonna be able to do it unless you've really kept an old version of the operating system.
10207640	10210640	You need 1.76 to jailbreak it and install Linux.
10210640	10214640	And, of course, they're up to 3.5 or something now.
10214640	10217640	So you have to find an old one on the shelf somewhere.
10217640	10220640	You have to find one that's never been updated.
10220640	10224640	Alright, well, I don't know about you guys. I don't know if you guys like to gamble.
10224640	10229640	But if you are a gambler, this news may excite you, especially if you're a video gamer and a gambler.
10229640	10232640	Or it may really get you scared.
10232640	10243640	Because, apparently, the governor of Nevada and the gambling commission of the state are considering allowing casino bookmakers to accept bets on professional gaming events.
10243640	10249640	So just like you can bet on, what, horse racing and professional sports. You can bet on professional sports in Nevada, right?
10249640	10251640	That's why Nevada doesn't have any professional teams.
10251640	10254640	You can bet on literally anything in Nevada.
10254640	10256640	Can you bet on salty bets?
10256640	10258640	Maybe.
10259640	10260640	That's so meta.
10260640	10269640	I don't really want to do that because, yeah, you don't normally win, but it's interesting.
10269640	10274640	But get this, the casinos are looking into it because they want to keep sports books fresh.
10274640	10279640	I guess this is a way to hook a whole new generation on gambling.
10279640	10282640	Very clever, but dangerous.
10282640	10299640	I feel like the esports community, while I love watching the FGC events, like Street Fighter and Killer Instinct, I feel like for such a small and young sport, it's already gone through so much controversy.
10299640	10306640	There's PED usage in esports that people are cracking down on. Sponsors like, what was it called?
10306640	10307640	Pornhub.
10307640	10309640	Yeah, that's the one. I have no idea what that is.
10309640	10311640	Of course, of course.
10311640	10317640	That has spawned controversy. So now this is just going to get worse. People are going to be throwing matches.
10317640	10318640	PED usage? What's that?
10318640	10320640	Yeah, there's PED usage.
10320640	10321640	Performance enhancing drugs.
10321640	10323640	Oh, what Red Bull? Too much Red Bull?
10323640	10325640	I read about that on the internet.
10325640	10327640	They're pissing hot.
10327640	10334640	Adderall, they say that it's a performance enhancer and they do testing for it now on the esports level.
10334640	10339640	Isn't Adderall what they give like extreme ADD, ADHD type of stuff?
10339640	10341640	They say it helps you focus.
10341640	10342640	It does, actually.
10342640	10350640	It does, but if the doctor prescribes it to you, you're not supposed to take it unless the doctor knows you're taking it.
10350640	10354640	Or unless the coach for the esports prescribes it to you.
10354640	10367640	Well, if they're not medical school, then that's not a good thing. Anyway, apparently the committee who has set up this whole esports, or gambling on esports thing, they did get feedback from Fatality.
10367640	10371640	Oh, well I'm glad they got him. Thank god he's involved.
10371640	10374640	The voice.
10374640	10379640	I'm glad he can speak for all of esports. At least they talked to somebody, whatever.
10379640	10387640	I feel like gamer culture kind of takes things that are popular already and then just does them worse. Like celebrities, for example.
10387640	10389640	Twitch celebrities are the worst.
10389640	10391640	Really? Oh, those are fighting words.
10391640	10392640	They are so bad.
10392640	10394640	They can be very bad, yes.
10394640	10398640	They get real life celebrities and interview them and stuff and they're amazing people.
10398640	10407640	The scandal and just the general mentality of YouTube stars, typically, and Twitch streamers are just some of the worst people.
10407640	10414640	I think it just has to be like, a lot of it has to do with, I think, their personality because of the audience that they're trying to attract.
10415640	10420640	It's the age range is really immature, so a lot of times they're kind of personally very immature.
10420640	10431640	Whereas there's some personalities like, I can think of John Bain, TotalBiscuit, who seem very mature and just kind of with it.
10431640	10439640	Whereas there's just some that they like to do let's plays for Minecraft and Scream. So, I mean, it just depends.
10439640	10440640	Do you guys go to TwitchCon?
10440640	10442640	Yes, the two of us do.
10442640	10448640	I feel like there's a story here because I went TwitchCon for a day even though I was like, I'm not really interested in going because I don't really do a lot with Twitch.
10448640	10454640	But then my buddy Jason who does the voiceovers for the show was like, dude, I got an extra ticket. It's in San Francisco. Just come.
10454640	10460640	And I was like, you know what? I do need to stop being such a stubborn old man. This is where things are trending. I need to kind of look into it.
10460640	10467640	And it was actually kind of refreshing because they had all of these celebrities there. I didn't know who the fuck any of them were. Any of them were.
10467640	10468640	Great feeling, wasn't it?
10468640	10476640	I guess, but at the same time, you know, I didn't expect that any of them knew who I was because I knew I was the old podcasting dude. So, like, nobody's going to know who I am.
10476640	10481640	The only one I think I've ever enjoyed was Lady Insanity because she does Bioware games.
10481640	10491640	And I'm not to say that like all Twitch celebrities are bad. I'm not saying that at all. It was just kind of like, yeah, there are certainly some and then some are going to ruin it for the rest that do have the diva attitudes.
10491640	10503640	Yeah. And so I think it's like reaching over to the same deal in esports. Like, I just don't understand it. You're nobody still. Keep your humbleness. You know, you're just famous on the internet.
10503640	10515640	They've tried so much to like really make it like a thing. I remember like one time I got invited or it wasn't even, I don't know if I got invited or I had like an invite and there's no way I could go to it.
10515640	10526640	It was like to the Playboy Mansion for they were doing a draft for like some sort of esports team or so. I know how the fuck I got the invite, but I couldn't go and I was extremely disappointed by that.
10526640	10531640	Why could this? There's no, you couldn't go. It's the Playboy Mansion.
10531640	10532640	I think it was the trap, brother.
10532640	10534640	Being married with children, though, unfortunately, there is no way.
10534640	10535640	You take the family, then.
10535640	10542640	It was literally like the day before it was going to happen. It's like, okay, I can't do this. You know, arrange work.
10542640	10547640	I take the whole family. We pack up and we show on Hef's door right there.
10547640	10558640	I'm going to take you way back to the show that preceded OLR that I was on. Way back in the day, 2001, I was co-hosting a show called Understadation Live with my buddy Travis Donovan, who has now since retired.
10558640	10569640	And one day on a whim, we called the Bunny Ranch. We got Dennis Hoff on the line interviewing with us for a good 45 minutes because nobody knew what the fuck internet radio was.
10569640	10579640	Just like, this is the big fucking thing right now, right? He fucking invites us to the Bunny Ranch to hang just at some celebrity thing, right? We didn't go.
10579640	10580640	What the hell?
10580640	10581640	Opportunities.
10582640	10592640	And I swear to God, I don't really have regrets because I was like, there was a part of me that was like, well, first off, I'm gay, so there's probably not a lot for me at the Bunny Ranch. Let's be real.
10592640	10594640	There's tits, come on.
10594640	10596640	I still love boobies. Who doesn't love boobies?
10596640	10603640	But, and I'm sure Dennis would have found something for me, but that's kind of past the point.
10603640	10607640	You serve food there, how are there cheese sticks? Because that's really what I meant.
10607640	10614640	That's right. How's the food? How's the food? I just, there's that little voice in the back of my head going, you're walking into a situation you don't really want to be in, Rob.
10614640	10624640	That one, you dive head on and then you tell people, you tell us now, the 15 years later or whatever, you tell us now.
10624640	10628640	Tell my grandkids, my gay ass went to the Bunny Ranch.
10628640	10630640	Was that one of those telltale situations?
10630640	10633640	A and go this way or B and go this way.
10633640	10637640	Yeah, Dennis will remember that. That was the last time we ever spoke to him.
10640640	10649640	Anyway, let's see. Where were we? Oh, yes. More stories. Dark soccer, I care to follow up the Bunny Ranch story.
10649640	10654640	Good lord. I started watching a Yo-kai Watch games anyway.
10654640	10656640	Were you there during that episode when that happened?
10656640	10657640	What?
10657640	10658640	That was a long, because you used to guess.
10658640	10660640	Yes, I was, actually.
10660640	10661640	I used to guess on Education Live all the time.
10661640	10664640	Was it, I was either a guest or filling in for Jessica?
10664640	10666640	I feel like Jess was there.
10666640	10668640	I was sitting in the stereo chair.
10668640	10669640	Yeah, yeah.
10669640	10670640	That was it.
10670640	10671640	Anyway.
10671640	10674640	So yeah, because I think I've been like a guest on that show like more than anyone.
10674640	10685640	So anyway, we had brought this up a few episodes ago about concerns about Miitomo, about what happens with all those weird questions they ask you.
10685640	10688640	Who in here other than me is still playing Miitomo?
10688640	10690640	Every day they go to the NSA.
10690640	10695640	Every day. I missed one day. The day I went to Great America this week was the first Miitomo day I've missed.
10695640	10697640	That was the thousand coin day.
10702640	10705640	You get it the next day.
10705640	10709640	You're never going to get your Miitomo Sojourner that way.
10709640	10716640	Well, Nintendo released a statement and I'm just going to read it because they sum it up pretty nicely.
10716640	10724640	The goal of our Miitomo questions is to spark fun conversations with your friends and for you to discover new facts about them as they answer the questions being posed.
10724640	10728640	In your dreams, how many blooming flowers do you see? What the fuck question was that?
10728640	10730640	That's how many people do you want to fuck?
10730640	10731640	Yeah, which is, it's code for...
10731640	10733640	Let me finish reading it.
10736640	10740640	That's why Miitomo generally avoids yes or no questions.
10740640	10752640	As to the answer information our customers provide through the Miitomo app, it is only used to provide a better experience for Nintendo consumers and to support the application.
10752640	10757640	Neither Nintendo or any of its partners sells or shares that answer information for any other purposes.
10757640	10760640	However, Nintendo knows.
10760640	10765640	Now, one of my friends on the app just said fuck it to their questions and started asking his own.
10768640	10769640	I'm taking over.
10769640	10771640	He numbers them so you know which one's which.
10771640	10776640	Yeah, because you have the little chat threads and I didn't really realize that until you pointed it out.
10776640	10778640	They're like, no, we have conversations on Miitomo, Rob.
10778640	10784640	I'm like, oh yeah, I guess because you can leave comments and the comments will usually go completely off track.
10784640	10788640	Yet you get alerted whenever somebody posts a new comment.
10788640	10791640	It's basically LiveJournal for the modern era.
10791640	10801640	This same friend, by the way, is an excellent maker of Miitomo photos that involve spread legs, open mouth kisses and buttholes.
10803640	10804640	Three of my favorite things.
10804640	10806640	On the next episode of OLR.
10806640	10809640	He's actually pretty cool, but he's also hilarious.
10809640	10815640	My coworker is trying to get me to play Miitomo because she doesn't have any friends that play that.
10815640	10818640	And so she's like, well, the only way you can play it is if you have friends.
10818640	10822640	I'm like, I'll add your sad friend if you want.
10822640	10826640	No, no, no. You add the friend and then they make friends with all your friends and then they talk shit about you.
10826640	10829640	If they're not following me on Twitter or Facebook, I don't add them.
10829640	10831640	I've added a few people.
10831640	10833640	Am I being a Twitch celeb?
10833640	10834640	Yep.
10834640	10835640	Let's go.
10835640	10836640	I've added a few people.
10836640	10837640	What's that?
10837640	10838640	I've added a few people.
10838640	10840640	Just a bunch of actually random people.
10840640	10843640	Some have gone like, oh, this is so-and-so.
10843640	10844640	Oh, OK.
10844640	10845640	But yeah.
10845640	10852640	I figured if they're friends of my friends, they have to be OK because I don't hang out with shitty people.
10852640	10856640	And if they turn out to be, you know, shit stains, they get wiped.
10856640	10859640	I'm easy.
10859640	10860640	That's what bleach is for.
10860640	10863640	I will end you.
10863640	10867640	I won't just cut you. I will dismember you.
10867640	10869640	Wow, the wonderful world of Miitomo.
10869640	10873640	I want to know from this comment because, you know, we're talking about LiveJournal and throwback and all that.
10873640	10876640	I want to know when the first Miitomo hookup is going to happen.
10876640	10878640	If it hasn't already, it probably has, right?
10878640	10881640	Like we met in Miitomo and then day one, I'm sure.
10881640	10886640	Tonight on Channel 10 News.
10886640	10887640	Did you guys get in Miitomo?
10887640	10888640	Would you check it out at all?
10888640	10889640	I have not.
10889640	10892640	I literally just looked it up right now to see what's all.
10892640	10893640	And you're the phone guy, too.
10893640	10895640	It's like five million.
10895640	10897640	Five million downloads right now for it.
10897640	10902640	Eleven year old Stacy was drawn across state lines.
10903640	10906640	So you've got Miitomo?
10906640	10912640	Someone in here who I'm not already friends with needs to have Miitomo so I can get the face to face challenge met.
10912640	10915640	I downloaded it for, I think I had it for a week.
10915640	10917640	I played it the first day.
10917640	10924640	I bought like new clothes and then I go, I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with this app.
10924640	10926640	And then so I just kind of left it and then I needed space on my phone.
10926640	10928640	So I deleted it.
10928640	10930640	I don't understand it.
10930640	10931640	I don't know.
10931640	10936640	It's like for me, I get more useful information on my friends out of Miitomo than I do on Facebook.
10936640	10939640	Because Facebook is just like, here's this clickbait article.
10939640	10944640	Here's this picture of my friends and I at something you weren't invited to.
10944640	10946640	Like all this stuff.
10946640	10950640	And then Twitter is just like, random, random, random again.
10950640	10952640	Twitter is like, hi everybody.
10952640	10953640	I'm on this place.
10953640	10954640	Look, this bathroom looks shitty.
10954640	10957640	P.S. I want X person to adopt me and be cool.
10957640	10962640	Thank you Facebook app for telling me every single time there's a new view on Orange Lounge page.
10962640	10964640	Like, I don't need to know this.
10964640	10970640	And the things, I do love Twitter, but the things people post are like, you guys have to try the new burger at Red Robin.
10970640	10972640	Or, hi, I'm pooping.
10972640	10975640	Like, you know, it's just people write, you know, sometimes like weirdly weird stuff.
10975640	10978640	I am pooping after trying the brand new burger at Red Robin.
10978640	10980640	I tweeted that once, okay guys?
10980640	10982640	It was once.
10984640	10985640	Alright.
10985640	10987640	Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.
10987640	10989640	I'm not going to keep it open very long though, you guys.
10989640	10991640	So if you want to get in, you should probably do that now.
10991640	10995640	If you have a question for us, or possibly for our friends from Video Game Bang, you can do that.
10995640	10996640	Call us now.
10996640	10998640	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10998640	11000640	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11000640	11001640	All one word.
11001640	11006640	If you want to give us a call, Skype line is open right now for you to call in.
11006640	11008640	So, let's get to it.
11008640	11010640	We've got calls already coming in.
11010640	11012640	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
11012640	11014640	Hey, this is RagingNator.
11014640	11016640	Hey, RagingNator. How's it going, buddy?
11016640	11018640	Oh, pretty good.
11018640	11022640	I'll try to make this short and sweet just in case someone else wants to call in.
11022640	11024640	Yeah, we're pretty popular.
11024640	11036640	Yeah, I don't know if you heard the story, but apparently there's been a leak regarding an upcoming steam sale.
11036640	11045640	Supposedly, the next major steam sale is going to be the final week of June leading up until July 4th.
11045640	11047640	Don't they do like a big summer?
11047640	11048640	Yeah, it's usually around then.
11048640	11052640	Yeah, I feel like, cue the whole Gaben.tv, the whole,
11052640	11054640	How do you believe in miracles?
11054640	11058640	The whole thing, because there's going to be a steam sale. It's going to come raining down and everything you've been wanting will be on sale.
11058640	11060640	They've correlated it with E3 the past couple of years.
11060640	11064640	I feel like every time an E3 and then Humble also usually comes out with something really cool.
11064640	11068640	Yeah, because steam's got a lot more competitors these days, I feel like.
11068640	11072640	Everything I see on sale, it's just all in your library, in your library, in your library.
11072640	11075640	I don't remember purchasing that, but it's in my library. Okay, cool.
11075640	11080640	Yeah, I guess that wouldn't really surprise me. I'll be curious about two things.
11080640	11083640	Do they put any of the new stuff on sale? That's the first one.
11083640	11088640	Are they going to knock 10%, 25% off Doom or something? That's always the big question.
11088640	11094640	And then, is there going to be a mini game? Because sometimes steam does these meta games for the sales that are really fun.
11094640	11102640	That last one was ridiculous. They did their own version of Cookie Clicker or whatever that just went fucking nuts.
11102640	11115640	One thing that I noticed in previous sales though is that the particularly old, old games that are on steam.
11115640	11122640	Let's say, just to pick something off the top of my head, Everyday Shooter.
11122640	11133640	It's not very likely to be marked down. Now, you're kind of hoping that something like that would be marked down.
11133640	11137640	It probably seems to say it's not going to happen.
11137640	11144640	Yeah, if there's something on your wish list you very badly want to go on sale, that is going to guarantee that it will not go on sale.
11144640	11159640	But on the semi relay though, is there like a top three games that you definitely want to go on sale in?
11159640	11164640	If they do go on sale, you're going to jump on those like Hungry Dog jumping on steak.
11164640	11175640	Well, I do keep a steam wish list going on and steam is very kind enough to email me every other day when a game on my wish list is on sale for 10% off or 20% off.
11175640	11181640	So, I'm pretty sure that will come into play. I still haven't picked up Final Fantasy 9, that little remake, so I think I want to pick that up.
11181640	11187640	I ended up buying Doom, that was on my wish list, but I was just like after I heard all the positive feedback on it.
11187640	11189640	It was like 15% off on some of the websites right now.
11189640	11198640	God, don't fucking tell me that. Let's see, I'm trying to think of what else is on my wish list that I want. I don't know, there's some other stuff too, Raginator.
11198640	11201640	You should play Danganronpa.
11201640	11206640	Okay, I'll just put that in the queue with the 500 other games I have to catch up on.
11206640	11211640	What about you? What's your number one thing you want to see go on sale, on sale, on sale, Raginator?
11212640	11220640	Kind of hard to say, and honestly I should slow down on my game purchases, because my God, do I already have a backlog.
11220640	11224640	Sell that stuff in your closet that the cat keeps getting into.
11224640	11238640	Yeah, seriously though, I kind of want to get some of the Final Fantasy games that I'm still missing, like I'm missing 9.
11238640	11240640	Square Enix has taken over.
11240640	11243640	Yeah, 4, 5, and 6.
11243640	11252640	I will say this, I did think of a new answer. The game that I would most like to see go on sale during the summer sale would be Half-Life 3.
11252640	11256640	Yeah, that's probably not going to happen.
11256640	11262640	Raginator, you're ruining my dreams. You're ruining my dreams, buddy. Alright, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls. Take care, my friend.
11262640	11264640	Alright, you too. Bye.
11264640	11267640	1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype, orange lounge for you.
11268640	11272640	They need to put Darius Burst on sale soon, because I want that game.
11272640	11280640	Do you guys have disgusting Steam backlogs like the rest of us, or do you really stick to console? Because I know you give Aaron a hard time about being a PC guy.
11280640	11283640	No, I play PC mostly. These guys are the console dudes.
11283640	11285640	Oh, did I get it switched around? I'm sorry.
11285640	11289640	Yeah, no, I give him crap because he always comes back to Papa.
11289640	11292640	I go everywhere. I'm a gaming whore.
11292640	11296640	Alright, we got another call coming in. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
11296640	11298640	What's up, everybody? It's Ranma.
11298640	11304640	Hey, Ranma. Your connection's a little fuzzy tonight, but we'll try to push through it. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
11304640	11309640	Sorry about that. My headset is kind of like when it's last stages of dying, so it's got to be replaced soon.
11309640	11313640	Well, stay in whatever position you're in and don't move because it's working fine. What's up?
11313640	11320640	Well, I slightly adjusted the mic, so a couple of things, then I'll be on my merry little way. So, Rob, I have a question for you.
11320640	11322640	Well, I have an answer for you, I hope.
11322640	11330640	The guests that are on your show, Video Game Bang, you said earlier that they were inspired by your show O.L.R.
11330640	11332640	Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.
11332640	11334640	Wait a minute, what?
11334640	11338640	I don't want to sound like a Twitch celeb. I didn't quite say that.
11338640	11346640	I think what I said was that Aaron was listening to the all-game shows, and all of those shows kind of inspired in part,
11346640	11350640	but I really think All Games Interactive was probably the big one that really, you know...
11350640	11351640	Forefront, yeah.
11351640	11355640	No, so I'm not, like, my head isn't that big, Rama. Knock it off.
11355640	11363640	Okay, because I wanted to know, because if that was the case, O.L.R. has another sibling, and since I am the half-sibling,
11363640	11370640	we talk about something different, we might have to call Maury and find out who the parents are, figure out why this podcast isn't doing video games.
11370640	11374640	Cue Aaron's happy dance, you know, when they find out he's not the father.
11374640	11380640	Am I correct that you just called O.L.R. to demand that Video Game Bang take a paternity test?
11380640	11382640	Wow.
11382640	11383640	Wow.
11383640	11387640	But I have been taking notes, so I do have a couple other things I do want to talk about.
11387640	11388640	Okay, all right, go for it.
11388640	11390640	You don't even look like me.
11390640	11394640	Well, Rama, I do agree with you about Miitomo, so I'm there with you on that.
11394640	11398640	If I don't know who they are, I do not add them. I don't have time for it.
11398640	11400640	Thank you! Am I just being a diva?
11400640	11401640	No.
11401640	11404640	I only accept people in my life that I clearly inspire.
11404640	11408640	If I can't speak, what's your Facebook connection, who you are?
11408640	11418640	No, simple as that. I've actually had to say no to some people, and I've had some people actually ask me if I've actually accepted their friend request,
11418640	11425640	or I got them just like, um, let me get back to you on that, you know, so, yeah.
11426640	11431640	The worst is when I know I've sent somebody a friend request, and I see them posting pictures on Twitter from Miitomo,
11431640	11436640	and I'm like, I know you're checking that fucking app, and you still haven't accepted my friend request. What did I do to you?
11436640	11437640	Jason.
11437640	11440640	Oh, shit, naming names.
11440640	11441640	Shot fired.
11441640	11448640	I wasn't thinking about Jason, but I think he'd added me, but you have to remember to check that.
11448640	11454640	So just a friendly reminder, be sure to check your friend requests on your Miitomo app, especially if your name is DJ.
11455640	11463640	Um, by the way, darktosuyu in chat says, I thought the pod father was Travis Donovan, since Undersedation Live inspired our show.
11463640	11469640	Travis Donovan would actually be retired grandfather at this point. He has gone off to the home.
11472640	11481640	Rob, that makes you the new Don, okay, because you are the made man, and you've learned everything from him, so you are currently at the helm, pod father.
11482640	11487640	I'll be appearing at TwitchCon 2016 in San Diego, but do not look directly at me.
11488640	11495640	It is pretty safe to say, like, we all were very aware of Orange Land Radio. Aaron was an avid listener.
11495640	11502640	When we started getting into it, I of course started researching, like, who's in the area doing this? What do they do? How could we learn from them?
11502640	11506640	You know, what's the do's and don'ts? You know, what makes a successful show?
11506640	11508640	Did you find some don'ts?
11508640	11512640	Uh, nothing specific from Orange Land Radio. No way. No, okay.
11512640	11514640	I was going to say, I can name some names, just don'ts.
11514640	11516640	Oh, there's some podcasts out there?
11516640	11519640	We like to support all indie podcasts, so we won't go there.
11519640	11522640	This was back 15 years ago. I don't even think they're around anymore.
11522640	11523640	Well, that's why.
11523640	11525640	Except you game and talk, Joey Ferris.
11525640	11527640	Wow, he's a regular on the show.
11527640	11528640	We love him.
11528640	11530640	His show is good, too.
11530640	11537640	But no, no, no. There were some podcasts in my experimental days that really I would listen to.
11537640	11540640	And like I said when I first got here, they were like 30 minutes long.
11540640	11547640	And, like, they would kind of quickly shoot past every single little detail, bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, and then bye.
11547640	11548640	And that was it.
11548640	11552640	And they just had no room for, I don't know, casual banter sometimes.
11552640	11554640	And, you know, it didn't feel, it just felt like a spreadsheet.
11554640	11559640	I do agree that, you know, if you're going to do a video game podcast, don't just read the news to people.
11559640	11563640	Because people that have seeked out a video game podcast are already reading the news kind of thing.
11563640	11568640	Although, I do think there is a niche that a couple people feel very well at.
11568640	11574640	If you do want to be the, you know, CNN and that journalistic side of it, then I think there is a little room there.
11574640	11575640	You know what I mean?
11575640	11581640	But, yeah, you're right. For the most part, like, people that download gaming podcasts already kind of know what's going on in the gaming industry.
11581640	11586640	True. And, like, for us, one of the big moments, I was a fan of gamertag radio.
11586640	11589640	That's the one I listened to and actually became a fan of.
11589640	11594640	So, I met them at an E3, exchanged information, and had Danny Pena on our show.
11594640	11596640	He was on our show a long time ago.
11596640	11602640	We did a holiday special one year where we got, like, we just invited a ton of, like, indie broadcasters on the show and he was there.
11602640	11606640	But I met him at, like, Penny Art. One of those shows I met him at. He's a good guy.
11606640	11607640	Super solid dude.
11607640	11615640	And, actually, we didn't even plan it, but the day he was on our show, maybe he did because he's smart, but it was International Podcast Day.
11615640	11616640	Oh, get out.
11616640	11619640	Yeah, so we had him on our show on International Podcast Day.
11619640	11621640	We got to just nerd out about podcasting.
11621640	11627640	He told us about the good old days, you know, of recording on Xbox and his first time recording, like, in a pickup truck.
11627640	11632640	Yeah, and his jeep in the middle of the snow with his brother, like, on a laptop he recorded, he said.
11632640	11637640	Like, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, the rough times.
11637640	11640640	Oh, yeah, we did all that, too.
11640640	11653640	Yeah, and everybody scratches a different itch. Like, for us, we do kind of cater to more of a urban, you know, we have a lot of pop culture references, you know, like, on our show.
11653640	11655640	Urban? Is that what you're going with?
11655640	11656640	I'm trying to be PC here.
11656640	11657640	Wow, okay.
11657640	11660640	I mean, people on our show come from so many different backgrounds, though.
11660640	11661640	Yes, yes.
11661640	11663640	We have, you know.
11663640	11667640	We have a rainbow of characters that definitely come on the show.
11667640	11668640	And so do we.
11668640	11669640	Religions.
11669640	11675640	Yeah, we don't exclude anybody, definitely, and try to include everybody.
11675640	11676640	I agree.
11676640	11677640	Except terrorists.
11677640	11678640	Wow.
11678640	11681640	So, no, yeah, we have terrorists on the show as well.
11681640	11683640	I mean, they have a point, right?
11683640	11684640	Great.
11684640	11686640	Hey, Rama, you're still there, right?
11686640	11688640	Yes, two more things, I'm getting out of here.
11688640	11690640	Oh, sorry. I thought you were there.
11690640	11692640	I think they forgot a collar was on the line.
11692640	11695640	The last guy had video, Rama, you're gonna have to get that back.
11695640	11698640	All right, anyway, sorry, go ahead, what was your other thought?
11698640	11703640	I wanna tip my hat to Jamie about her PSO talk tonight,
11703640	11706640	because I remember our good old days of playing Blue Burst.
11706640	11707640	Yes.
11707640	11708640	It was a very good pick.
11708640	11711640	I think everybody can agree that was a solid pick.
11711640	11712640	Very good.
11712640	11714640	We'll have to revive that.
11714640	11715640	I'm down.
11715640	11717640	We'll have Blue Burst night.
11717640	11719640	We'll burst something blue.
11720640	11722640	I'll get a case of Blue Moon.
11724640	11727640	Blue Moon and Blue Burst, that's so much fun.
11727640	11729640	There's better beer, I wouldn't do that to you.
11731640	11734640	I'll tell you this, anything is better than Budweiser.
11734640	11735640	True.
11735640	11739640	Aren't they renaming to, like, America, or was that just a fucking Facebook prank?
11739640	11744640	They're renaming to America as a little homage to what's going on, and then there's another-
11745640	11751640	I won't drink it, I won't drink it, unless the very bottom or, like, under the thing says fuck yeah.
11751640	11753640	I'll put it this way, I wouldn't drink it if it were free.
11756640	11758640	Because I have something called self-respect.
11759640	11763640	You can't get in trouble for drinking in public, because are they gonna arrest you for drinking America?
11763640	11765640	You drunk off America?
11766640	11768640	What, you a terrorist for arresting me?
11769640	11777640	And you know what? I have been so good that I'm gonna entertain myself with a Guinness tonight.
11778640	11779640	And y'all can't have any.
11780640	11781640	Because that's my shit.
11782640	11787640	Actually, believe it or not, I still have some of the buffalo sweat that, um, that Code Man sent us.
11787640	11788640	Sent me, really.
11788640	11790640	I just love some of these comments in chat.
11790640	11792640	Act deft, I'm drinking freedom.
11792640	11795640	Uh, Scoppy says, uh, DWA, driving with America.
11796640	11797640	Alright, anyway.
11797640	11798640	Uh, alright.
11798640	11802640	There is an indie brew called Morica that's out.
11802640	11803640	Fuck yeah.
11803640	11804640	Uh, anything else, Rama?
11805640	11806640	Um, the Tetris movie.
11807640	11813640	It should be based off of the YouTube video, The Complete History of the Soviet Union, as a range to the melody of Tetris.
11814640	11818640	I will be upset if the theme from Tetris, which I realize is like a classic song-
11818640	11819640	Isn't that an excerpt from Troika?
11819640	11820640	Yeah, it is.
11820640	11821640	It is.
11821640	11823640	But it's the- I'm sorry, it's the Tetris theme.
11823640	11828640	It's one of those things where, like, they've just taken over the song and now it's theirs.
11828640	11830640	It's like when Johnny Cash covered Hurt.
11830640	11833640	Like, I love Nine Inch Nails, but, like, now that's Johnny Cash's song.
11833640	11834640	Like, sorry, it's just- it's done.
11834640	11837640	So, that is the Tetris song.
11837640	11841640	And if that song is not in the movie, we're not- I'm not- I can't handle it.
11842640	11843640	Heads will roll.
11843640	11844640	Alright.
11844640	11845640	That's right.
11845640	11847640	Alright, take care of my friend, we're gonna let you go.
11847640	11848640	Alright, take care.
11848640	11849640	Alright, bye.
11849640	11850640	Alright.
11850640	11851640	Alright.
11851640	11854640	I am so sorry, guys, we are gonna close up the Skype line because we are- we're starting
11854640	11859640	to run a little bit long and we gotta wrap things up here in studio because it's about
11859640	11862640	9.30 and, you know, it's about time for the show to be done.
11862640	11866640	So, I wanna go around and get everybody's final thought here before we say goodnight.
11866640	11871640	I do wanna say, though, first off, a big thank you to the crew from Video Game Bank for being
11871640	11872640	here tonight.
11872640	11873640	We had a really good time tonight.
11873640	11874640	This was a lot of fun.
11874640	11875640	Lots of fun.
11875640	11876640	I thought 6 was gonna be a lot of people, but we made it work.
11876640	11877640	This is good.
11877640	11880640	And I do wanna say, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, first off,

11920640	11921640	So, yeah.
11921640	11925640	I'm looking forward to coming on your show on Wednesday, so we'll have to- what are we
11925640	11927640	gonna talk about Wednesday?
11927640	11929640	You can expect a mixed bag.
11929640	11931640	A lot's gonna happen between now and Wednesday.
11931640	11932640	That's true.
11932640	11934640	In this beast that we call video game.
11934640	11935640	Yeah.
11935640	11937640	But lots of laughs.
11937640	11938640	We can guarantee the laughs.
11938640	11940640	Alright, I'll try my best to be funny.
11940640	11941640	Alright.
11941640	11943640	I'm gonna go down the line.
11943640	11945640	Aaron, thank you so much for being here.
11945640	11946640	Appreciate it.
11946640	11948640	And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11948640	11949640	Any party words?
11949640	11952640	Vote with your dollars when it comes to video games.
11952640	11953640	You know?
11953640	11955640	They won't make crappy games if you don't buy them.
11955640	11956640	That is solid advice.
11956640	11958640	You gotta vote with your wallet.
11958640	11959640	Very true.
11959640	11960640	Corey.
11960640	11961640	It's just been great being here.
11961640	11965640	This is like a 15 plus year institution of podcasting, right?
11965640	11966640	Not quite that old.
11966640	11969640	Don't over age us.
11969640	11976640	But actually, funny enough, next month, June 26th, happens to be my birthday and OLR's
11976640	11977640	14th anniversary show.
11977640	11978640	Geez.
11978640	11979640	14 years of podcasting.
11979640	11981640	That's podcasting before podcasting.
11981640	11984640	Yeah, technically it wasn't a podcast when it started.
11984640	11988640	We were just on Live 365 doing a live show, but we've carried that into podcasting.
11988640	11994640	It's been an honor to be here and I'm so glad we met at that convention because it's
11994640	11996640	like we gotta work together.
11996640	11997640	So thanks for having us.
11997640	11999640	Thanks to Sac IGDA for bringing us all together.
11999640	12002640	Yeah, those dudes were super awesome in putting that together.
12002640	12004640	So yeah, it's been an honor.
12004640	12005640	Thanks for having us.
12005640	12006640	Thank you.
12006640	12007640	It's been an honor to have you.
12007640	12008640	Webb.
12008640	12009640	Yeah, it's been awesome being here.
12009640	12013640	You guys have a really cool show and it's cool being able to hear from the audience
12013640	12015640	and yeah, it was a lot of fun.
12015640	12016640	It's very cool.
12016640	12017640	Thank you very much.
12017640	12018640	Thank you guys all so much for being here.
12018640	12019640	Check them all out.
12019640	12022640	Google, iTunes, just video game.
12022640	12023640	Bang.
12023640	12024640	How can you forget that name?
12024640	12025640	Jesus.
12025640	12027640	Just go out, Google it and follow them on everything.
12027640	12031640	All right, let's go around and get the final thoughts here in studio.
12031640	12032640	I'll do my final thought.
12032640	12037640	My final thought is I'm going to try to forgive Ingress, but it may take me a little.
12037640	12039640	Jamie, you gotta help me find the love again.
12039640	12040640	Just help me level.
12040640	12041640	All right, we'll see.
12041640	12042640	We'll see.
12042640	12043640	Maybe.
12043640	12044640	I will give you the love.
12044640	12049640	I'm only going to continue to be on them because I really want that Pokemon Go invite.
12049640	12051640	I really want the beta invite.
12051640	12053640	I put in for it.
12053640	12056640	I'm going to cry if I don't get in.
12056640	12060640	What will be the absolute worst, this is my nightmare, if Shane gets in and I don't.
12060640	12064640	I will be so, like don't call me if that happens.
12064640	12066640	You know what would be awful though?
12066640	12071640	Given his absolute love of all things Pokemon, if you got in and I got in.
12071640	12073640	I would love that.
12073640	12074640	He did not get in.
12074640	12079640	Or better yet, if I got in, I just don't give a crap about Pokemon Go.
12079640	12081640	Yeah, that would be the worst if Loki got in.
12081640	12082640	Like, Loki, tell us about the game.
12082640	12085640	I don't know.
12085640	12087640	Spot on impression.
12087640	12089640	It's like your guys' impression of me.
12089640	12092640	Loki, your final thought tonight.
12092640	12097640	Well, since we didn't have last minute stories, I thought I'd just leave everybody with this nice little story to piss you off.
12097640	12102640	So, thank you Nintendo for pulling another Nintendo.
12102640	12104640	They decided that, hey, guess what?
12104640	12107640	You know that really awesome Minecraft thing that we put out?
12107640	12109640	That has all the Mario levels in it?
12109640	12117640	Guess what? Even though Minecraft videos are really awesome and Mojang and 4J studios are totally allowing you to put it on there.
12117640	12120640	We're going to copyright claim all that shit because it has our fucking music in it.
12120640	12122640	And we're assholes, by the way.
12122640	12125640	So disable the music if you're going to do it.
12125640	12130640	Apparently, yeah, they're being copyright claimed because you got to be that Nintendo partner in order to post those Nintendo videos.
12131640	12133640	God, is that really a thing? I thought it was a joke.
12133640	12140640	And we're hearing, basically they tweeted out, we're hearing reports copyright strikes on Super Mario mashup videos.
12140640	12144640	We're sure this wouldn't happen. We're following up with Nintendo.
12144640	12146640	Thank you, Nintendo.
12146640	12147640	Thank you, YouTube.
12147640	12150640	Coming soon to Amazon Prime Minecraft videos.
12150640	12155640	Lastly, but not leastly, ladies last night, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
12156640	12164640	I'm a little bit too obsessed right now with making my face look not like my face.
12165640	12168640	But you have a very pretty face, but you also do very pretty makeup work.
12168640	12169640	Thank you.
12169640	12170640	It's art.
12170640	12175640	It's all practice, practice, practice, because you know it's coming in the beginning of October.
12175640	12180640	I just, I literally can't believe like you are, you are, you are having your life changed by drag queens.
12180640	12184640	Well, you know my love of cosplay.
12184640	12191640	And you know I've been wanting to change up what I do because it's gotten stale and everyone does the same shit that I've never seen.
12191640	12194640	I've seen drag queens do character perfect cosplay.
12194640	12199640	I have seen normal cosplayers do regular cosplay.
12199640	12203640	I have not yet seen drag cosplay and I'm going to make that happen.
12203640	12209640	All right. Well, but about the face, Dark Soccer, remember, remember what, what, what is said every week.
12209640	12212640	If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love anybody else?
12212640	12216640	I already love myself and enough to love everybody else and myself some more.
12216640	12217640	All right.
12217640	12221640	We love all of you out there in OLR and VOG Network.
12221640	12222640	Thank you so much for listening.
12222640	12226640	We will be back in seven days to do it all again during Memorial Day weekend.
12226640	12228640	Oh boy, a Memorial Day show.
12228640	12229640	That should be fun.
12229640	12230640	That means three day weekend.
12230640	12231640	That means I don't work Monday.
12231640	12233640	Should we break out the liquor?
12233640	12235640	We'll find out in seven days.
12235640	12236640	Have a good one.
12236640	12237640	Good night.
