00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, the ebb and flow of game teases reaches new highs as release ads for No Man's Sky make their way to game stores only to have the release postponed and stainless modified. This, a special guest and plenty more news begins right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on May the 29th of 2016 with episode number 643 of our show.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
We are that show, of course, about all things video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California. Hot Sacramento, California.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
With myself, Rob Roberts, and the one laughing, cackling wickedly over there, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
We may be live, but I'm dead inside.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Does the heat make you dead inside? Did it evaporate your soul?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Soul?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, I forgot. You don't have one of those.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
No, my soul is fueled by coffee. And now I can't have coffee that much anymore.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
This is a tragedy.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
A tragedy and a travesty. It's a sin against me.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
It's a tragivesty.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
That sounds like... Nevermind, I was going somewhere.

01:34.000 --> 01:46.000
We need to traverse the tragivesty that is you not being able to drink coffee. So doctor's orders, you have to quit coffee for like a couple weeks? Couple months?

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
I ease off the caffeine in the first week, so I'm drinking decaf coffee for the first week. The next week starts easing out my coffee, so I've already got this cocoa drink replacement.

01:56.000 --> 02:11.000
Contrary to popular belief, chocolate does not have caffeine. I believe the chemical in it is theobromine, which produces a caffeine-like effect without the various other upsets that caffeine can cause.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Which is why you get a semi-euphoric effect from good chocolate. The stronger the chocolate, the stronger the effect.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I see.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Note to self, when playing Overwatch, have chocolate.

02:25.000 --> 02:35.000
I also have raw cacao nibs to mix in my smoothies and stuff. I'm working through it right now, it's the headaches that are the worst.

02:35.000 --> 02:47.000
Although I was at work on Friday and I was like, hi, what can I do for you? I'm sorry, you're having problems. I'm having problems too!

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Alright, well, also having problems here in studio. Say hello to Techmaster Loki!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Hello.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Hello. You got 99 problems, but a lack of breadsticks ain't one I can see over there.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
No, lack of breadsticks is not... Lack of air conditioning, however...

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm trying! I have the air conditioning down in the fan oven.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
No, I'm talking about my house. I don't have air conditioning right now.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
What?!

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, because our air conditioning is broken. We're getting it replaced, but we don't have it yet.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Oh, and I bet your kids are just... I bet they don't complain whatsoever.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Nope, of course not.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
Oh my gosh. Yeah, just so you guys know, we're starting to get into that infamous Sacramento summer, and it's... Is it what, 90 degrees here today?

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
That's not even the worst of it. 90 degrees today, which isn't even that bad. I'm sure there's a lot of people sitting out there...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh, it'll be 107 I think tomorrow.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, people in Phoenix are probably sitting there going, God, you babies. But, I mean, this isn't the worst of it. This is just the beginning.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
So, here we go. Anyway, you guys in our chat, of course, every week, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
www.vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And if you are listening to us live, you should join us in our chat room.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Live.vognetwork.com, where SSG100Matt points out, it's been 90 most of the week in New York.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, God, because it's all...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
And it's humid there.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
It's humid there. So, yeah, I guess we're not going to get any sympathy from our East Coast friends this week.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
Well, actually, there's a good way to find out if we'll get sympathy or not because we have a guest here in studio who's come to visit our fair show all the way from New York.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
And I'm very excited to have him here because he's been a long-time supporter of the show.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Those of you that have listened for a while are going to know who this is right off the bat.

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
And he's literally made our dreams come true in so many ways. And he's here to join us in studio tonight.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
Say hello everybody to developer YYR is here.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Wait, what? I'm still stuck on vaginesty.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
It's like a 40-year vaginesty reaches back to the Queen Elizabeth era or something.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
That's what happens when the Amazons take over.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Oh, okay. I get it now.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Yes, I'm here from New York.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah, so is it hot here compared to New York?

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, you know what? It was pretty cool in New York actually up until about the time we left.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
We've been here almost a week now.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
And so we went from like 60 or so degree weather in New York to 60 or so degree weather in San Francisco.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
So for me, there was like no change at all.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
So to know that it's been like 90 in New York is it's like, what are we going home to?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
You're kind of you're kind of glad that you're here right now, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, with the 90 degrees being the exception.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Yes. Yes. I am very happy to be here.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And you're you're actually here on the West Coast because you just got married and you're here.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Is this like your honeymoon or your you have to visit the other side of the family?

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, actually, Amy's niece graduated middle school this past week and we needed to be there for that anyway.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
So we decided, well, you know what, why not just make a week long trip out of it?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So we did. There you go.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
We'll probably take our real honeymoon later in the year when we actually have some vacation time again.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Nice. Because this basically just bottomed us all out.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And I do I do want to acknowledge your lovely new wife. Amy is joining us here in studio.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
But I know she's not as much of a gamer, although she what is she doing on her phone right now?

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
She's probably playing a game. So she sits there and goes, I'm not a gamer.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
She's playing threes or something over there on her phone.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
So, you know, like just just because you don't play like Doom or Overwatch or that doesn't mean you're not a gamer.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So I'm just this one is called Word Whistle. Her niece showed it to us.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
And yeah, it's just this, you know, it gives you blanks and a number of words.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
And you have to come up and it gives you a category and you have to come up with the words.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
It's actually pretty clever of one of many free to play games on the phone.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So, yeah, check it out if you like word games and things.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
All right. I will get right on that.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
But we we got to check out the games you make because some folks in chat are like, wait a minute, I know this game.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal in chat, reminding one of our listeners that YYR made pixel shits.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
That was that was you. So you you have actually developed your own video games.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
What was the first one you ever published? You did Snake 360, right?

07:20.000 --> 07:30.000
That's right. And back in 2008, someone you may know as SSJ 100 Matt said to me, you know, I know these guys.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
They're pretty cool. They do a video game podcast.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
They probably would interview you if you want. Just go ahead, give them a buzz.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And so, well, I did.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Who the hell is he to name drop us like that and not go through my agent?

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm just kidding. Yeah. And so that that started this whole deal that we have.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
And yeah. And I was grateful to you guys for interviewing me back in the day.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
And well, thank you for helping spread the word about my silly little arcade style games.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, and it was it wasn't just the fact that, you know, you had the the friend tie in because SSJ 100 Matt's been a longtime supporter of the show, though that helps.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
I mean, let's be real. But you are also a longtime fan of music games and music based video games.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Yes. You were a DDR freak poster back in the day, right?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I was. I think I had like 2000 posts before they shut down.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Oh, my God. That's probably more than I had. I don't even think I ever hit in the four digits. That's crazy.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
So you and you actually had music from Kyle Ward, who was on this show probably about a year ago at this point,

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
who did who now does the rerave and has this other the ditto beat in those games.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
So you actually had his songs in your game. Yeah. For all that happened.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah. Yeah. And actually, it's going to happen again.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm getting close to releasing Snake Party, which is going to be my last.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm sorry. Snake Party sounds a little something. Something.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Something I'm something I might rent at the adult video store.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
It's like making a video game called Sausage Fest. Like, you know what?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I can call it Snake Party, a.k.a. Sausage Fest on the Web site.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
They have a movie coming out called Sausage Parties.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
But yeah, it's basically the the evolution of Snake 360 multiplayer,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
plus a whole bunch of single player missions thrown in for good measure and a couple other bonus modes,

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
including one secret unlockable mode, which I could mention here if people want.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
But yeah, it's that's also going to have the Kyle Ward music in it.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
And he's really cool because, you know, if you're an indie developer and you have zero budget or close,

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
you find somebody who says, oh, I'll let you put my music in the game if you give me a percentage of your money.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
And then you don't have to lay out anything. Yeah. So he was really cool.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
He said that would be OK with him. And there it is.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
A lot of a lot of indie gamers have to remember there's a lot of indie artists that can probably team up with you.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
And you guys can find an agreement that works with you guys. So that's the best way, really.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Now, you were showing Snake Party. I'm sorry. I love the name.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Yes, I was showing Snake Party with my pants up.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
As much as we're laughing at it here in studio, like, you know, the game itself is like I thought, you know,

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I remember the cell phone game Snake and thought it was a lot of fun.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
And so when Snake 360 happened, I was like, oh, this is this is funny, like in a good way.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
And then when I see the Snake Party, I was like, OK, this is one of those things where, like, when you tell people,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
oh, it's a multiplayer of the cell phone game Snake, I'm sure there's a lot of people that kind of roll their eyes.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
But if you actually play it, it's really fun.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Really, the hardest thing is to get people to try it. Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
They walk past, they see it's Snake. A lot of people just keep walking.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
But those people that do try the game seem to have a really good time with it. So I'm hoping they check it out.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I'm sure WarioWare looks ridiculous the first time you see it, too.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
But like once you play it.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
You don't even know what you're looking at.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah, it's like, oh, my God, this game is so much fun.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
But the other thing you were showing at MAGFest this year, which is super notable, we talked about the saga a little bit on the show.

10:56.000 --> 11:07.000
So I don't want to rehash it completely, but we've got to talk about the success you've really had in in large part because of demoing at MAGFest with multitasking.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Tell us a little bit about multitasking.

11:09.000 --> 11:20.000
So multitasking is, as you may remember, a game that challenges you to play up to four minigames at the same time, starting from one, but gradually building up.

11:20.000 --> 11:33.000
The minigames each have you doing one single task, such as pong, hit the ball back, dodge the falling weights, you know, just avoid the other cars you're driving.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Just one task, one task at a time.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
But when they start asking you to do two, three or four of them at a time and things start speeding up, it's not so easy anymore.

11:41.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, it's it's kind of like like the best way I could describe it is it's like imagine you're playing WarioWare, but you're playing four copies of it all at once.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
And that's I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but it is so fun and it's it's really addicting.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And I remember and this is probably about a good year and a half ago at this time.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Now on the show, you called us, you were telling us about this idea.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
And I remember telling you, Aaron, this is a genius idea.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
And if you don't make it, I will steal it.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
And so and I remember Bobby saying in chat, yes, I am looking to do it.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I am reverse engineering this right now.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And sure enough, here we are. You're at Magfest.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
You demo the game. You had a great response right at Magfest.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I did.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Everyone who tried it really those people that didn't just like stumble away and confusion.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
Right. Really seem to like it. We had people coming back all weekend, you know, again and again to try it.

12:35.000 --> 12:44.000
And you made it a point and I'm sure Amy, when she was helping, you made it a point to tell everybody as they were leaving, hey, you like this game, go vote for it on Steam Greenlight because we want to see it happen.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Right. And they did. And they did. That's the surprising part.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
And what happened a month after you got home?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It passed.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It was not even 30 days.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
And I was talking to other developers at Magfest and they were saying, oh, well, this game took a long time, but it finally got through Greenlight.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I was on Greenlight for 12 months, 18 months.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I don't know how the heck I managed to get multitasking through in 30 days.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I really don't.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
Because it's a genius concept and here's the part of the show where I'm going to do the I told you so dance.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I told you so.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
He's really dancing, by the way.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
You can't see it if you're not here, but he is really dancing.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
Aren't you glad you came out here for the radio show so you could see the dancing that happens that they can't see?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
It was absolutely worth the trip.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Also, Amy Droven, not me.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, congratulations. And I can't wait.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
Now, are we talking like a Mighty No. 9 release schedule here or when do we actually get to play multitasking?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
First of all, I'm not setting a release date for the Steam version until I have one.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Smart.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
A concrete, actual release date.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Soon.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
And I can also tell you that we're not going to delay it due to online multiplayer features because there won't be any online multiplayer features.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So at least we don't have that.

13:58.000 --> 14:10.000
What we will have in the Steam version is a version of the game that will allow you to play with a controller and also hopefully with not just an Xbox 360 controller but with some others as well.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
It'll also be able to be played with a keyboard if you don't have a controller handy.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
We worked on a control scheme that pretty much works and is intuitive.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
So just because you don't have a controller doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy the game.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Please do test with a Steam Box, though, because I plan to put that on my TV through a Steam Box.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
That made you think, didn't I?

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
You know what? I don't know if it'll work outside of Windows.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Steam Box is...

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, it's just broadcasting what's on your computer over to the TV. It should be fine.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
I don't know how well this game will work broadcasting, but hey, you know what? I'll do my best.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
You'd be surprised. A lot of the response times and everything like that.

14:53.000 --> 15:02.000
I played Cavern of the Necrodancer. I've played that on the Steam Box and it's fine.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Oh, cool. Alright, yeah, as long as the response time is good, you should have a good experience in theory.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
But yeah, I'm trying for extra controller support and also there'll be, I believe, five or six new minigames that weren't in the original.

15:13.000 --> 15:22.000
It'll be kind of like point blank in the fact where you can choose the original set of like 13 games or the expanded set of 19 games if you want the extra challenge.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Nice. I'm so happy for you that that is happening.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Thank you.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
Good luck and we will promote the shit out of it when it finally releases eventually.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
And by the way, the Steam version will probably be called Super Multitasking.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Okay, so because multitasking was too generic.

15:42.000 --> 15:51.000
Actually, somebody in the comments section on Greenlight pointed out, you know, you need something else besides the word multitasking because if you Google just the word multitasking, you're not going to find your game.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
So super multitasking hopefully is a little bit more unique.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
Maybe super multitasking 5000 because you're going to have 5000 minigames in this.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
And this is someone I'm just kidding.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
That's a lofty goal.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
You do want to play this game sometime during my lifetime.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yes.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
I will say that with Steam Box, there are some latency issues for some people.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Really?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Which is why we returned ours, remember?

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
That's true. You know what, maybe I don't know. Ours is completely wired. Our box is wired.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
We did wireless.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Interesting. Okay, that could be part of it.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
But you should have seen the lag on DuckTales.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Okay, so yeah, your your mileage may vary.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
But I think I think I will have good luck playing on the television.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
I do want to say really quick, though, before we get into our gaming weeks and news and all that stuff.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
I want to quickly talk about because one reason we love you so much, Aaron, is that you have made our dreams come true.

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
We have a long running gag on this show about our dream games, things that we have said on air that were, you know, inside jokes or whatever that we said, no, this should this should really be a game.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
And I guess one of these ideas actually inspired you years ago to make a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yep.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
That is still available on Xbox 360 for another year and a half, right?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, about that. A year from September is when they take them all down.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah, and that's Microsoft's decision, not yours.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
That's correct.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
But you were telling me a little bit on the ride over here from our lovely Chipotle dinner.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
You were telling me about the kind of like what that's evolving to.

17:22.000 --> 17:31.000
Can you can you kind of tell our listeners a little bit about what the because, you know, it sounded like at first that all you guys that were developing for XNA were just going to get the finger, basically.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
But that really doesn't seem to be the case now, right?

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
There really is a future for XNA projects.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
It's it's surprising.

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000
But yeah, back in I believe it was either late February or early March, Microsoft announced at a build conference, which I believe is halfway across the world somewhere.

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
Basically, they announced that they were making the Xamarin tools free to all developers.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
They had purchased the company and they made all their tools free.

18:00.000 --> 18:13.000
And what that is is basically these are libraries that you can run on top of Visual Studio that allow you to create things for iOS and Android in C Sharp.

18:13.000 --> 18:24.000
Now, this is notable for XNA developers because MonoGame, a free and open source replacement for XNA, runs on the same framework.

18:24.000 --> 18:41.000
So I literally, not counting the like two or so hours it took to install all the crap, in about one hour I had a project that was an XNA game running on my phone, my Android phone.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
And yeah, so I mean, basically, I don't need to reinvent the wheel if I want to take these games and put them on mobile platforms.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I can just go ahead and click a few buttons.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
And then, of course, tailor things for either Google Play Games or Game Center or what have you.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
And there I have a mobile version of whatever my game was.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
That's awesome that they're leaving the door open to make it so easily portable.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
So that's great.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
So hopefully a mobile version or something, a bungee fair tossing in the future to live forever.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
It would be difficult considering the control scheme to reproduce that on a phone.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I guess that's true.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
But I can tell you on my website I posted something.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
I have created an initiative called No Game Left Behind.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Clever.

19:27.000 --> 19:39.000
Basically, by the time Microsoft brings the XBL-IG store offline a year from September, I intend to have all of my games available for sale in other places.

19:39.000 --> 19:49.000
And what probably will happen with bungee fair tossing is it will be for sale on itch.io, which is a nice little site where indies can post their games for any price, DRM free.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
They provide a storefront.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
They provide, you know, pretty pages and the ability to accept payments.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
We really don't give that site enough love here on the show considering how much they do for the indie community.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
So definitely check that out.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Itch.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I always say itch.io, but it's itch.io.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It sounds like itch.io.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Itch.io, yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah, so look forward to that.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
You may or may not need an Xbox 360 controller to play it.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
I think I have a mouse and keyboard control scheme that I came up with at some point written down somewhere.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
So I'm thinking mouse and keyboard controls if you don't have a controller.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And you will be able to play it on your PC.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Windows PC, I should say.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Sorry, Jamie.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
For a dollar.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
I'm getting the death stare right now.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
You know what?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I have a PC still.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Oh, okay.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
How else would I play Dragon Age?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm not boot camping this thing.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
She'll find a way.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
There's a will.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
There's a way.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
She'll find it.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
Also, I found out Danganronpa is on Steam for Mac as well, and that makes me happy.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I did not know that.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
That's a surprise.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Both of them are.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Cool.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
Actually, a lot of the games that I play through Steam are available on Mac these days.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
SSG100Matt wants to know about multitasking.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Will there be a Bobby Black Wolf Friends Forever mode?

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
The minigame and the multitasking difficulties are actually independently adjustable.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
So you can go ahead and make the multitasking easier and the minigames harder or vice versa.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
Actually, I think it's really entertaining to put the multitasking difficulty on maximum

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
and the minigame difficulty on minimum so that you have to do four things at once,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
but they're really easy, at least at first.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Okay.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Very cool.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
One other question from SSG100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
SSG100 wants to know, could there be a YYR classic games collection on Steam with all your old games?

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Snake, Snake 360, Card Arcade, so on.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
There are no plans for that at this time, but honestly, I feel like if there was a demand for it,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
I would be able to get a collection like that ready.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And if there's a demand, I mean, if I have a successful game and people are like,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
YYR games, I actually know who that is.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
Okay. So if multitasking sells shitloads, then we'll be in a good spot.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I think so.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Speaking of shit, what is the current status of Pixel Poops?

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
I know this was your Vita game that was free online, the Pixel shits,

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
and that was another like 2600 homage, but hilarious.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Hilarious in concept.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
I mean, just, you know, again, if you don't know this game,

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
and then you actually released it for the Vita for a very short period of time,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
because the Vita then pulled that stuff, like not even a month, right?

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
So for those who didn't know, basically the idea was you had these joggers that were running through the park,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and your goal was to poop on them.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Just don't ask. That was the game.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
You have to poop in front of them.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, you have to poop. Anyway.

22:48.000 --> 22:56.000
But the genius, the genius thing that made this into a game was that your poop is finite.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
And to refill, you have to go to the, it's Taco Bell, but he called it something else.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I call it the taco restaurant.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
The taco restaurant that's in the upper right hand corner, and that's how you refill the poop meter.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
And when I heard that, I was like, God damn, this guy is brilliant.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Like, he'll think of that one thing that just makes the entire fucking game, and there it is.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
And then you sold that on Vita, but unfortunately it's gone.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
If you don't have it, too bad.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Is that part of no game left behind?

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
It is. Although, actually, if you go to yyrgames.com right now,

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
you will actually be able to play Pixel Poops on there right now if you are doing it from a macro Windows PC.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Nice.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
There are leaderboards. They're not very populated, so please come play.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And as far as the mobile versions-

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Please come poop.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Yes, please come poop.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
I feel like there's a nincompoop joke here somewhere.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Yes, as far as the mobile version, right now multitasking is my priority,

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
but my plan is still hopefully to get this out sometime within a year's time.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
A mobile version where you'll be able to go ahead and select different characters like a dog,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
a monkey who flings his poop, you know, things like that.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
And also you'll be able to eat different foods to change your color of your poop.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
And also maybe the consistency-

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
You need to have asparagus mode.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Yes.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Because asparagus turns poop green.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Corn on the cob. Blueberries.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That would be like speckled poo.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
All right, anyway. Oh my god, I'm dying. This is so disgusting.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, I have it on Vita.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
You and about 12 other OLR listeners have it on Vita.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
And by the way-

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
You and about 12 other people have a Vita.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Oh, stop it.

24:37.000 --> 24:45.000
And by the way, I do want to shout out to those of you who sent me happy wedding wishes last week over Twitter.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Thank you. There were several OLR listeners that did that.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Well, big congratulations to you.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Thank you.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
It's kind of a big deal.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Some of us forget to check our Twitter.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
That's okay. That's all right.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
Anyway, YYR, I'm so happy to have you here and to talk about video games with us this week.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Anything else you want to plug real quick while you're here?

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
Make sure we get out all the stuff where people can follow you and the games you make and keep tabs on multitasking?

25:13.000 --> 25:24.000
Yeah. I mean, I always post my up-to-the-minute news at my website, yyrgames.com, which sadly will not become yyr.game.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Or are we getting to that later?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
We'll talk about that a little later in the show.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
All right.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Yes.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
The promo a few weeks ago was hilarious, though. And no, I did not pay for it.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
We'll talk about why in just a little bit here in the show.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
But before we get to the news, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
It's a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week? And we're going to start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
It was actually busier than expected.

25:50.000 --> 26:01.000
I quit Final Fantasy 14 because no one was ever on and played World of Warcraft just to find out that no one is ever on.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Thanks, Overwatch.

26:03.000 --> 26:13.000
But I've actually had a pretty decent time playing it because there have actually been quests to do, you know, that didn't require me to have 50,000 other people in the dungeon with me.

26:13.000 --> 26:26.000
I also played some Dragon Age Inquisition again to basically with that whole migration of my games to the new drive, I've had to test them all.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
So I played a decent amount of Inquisition.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I love that game.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Pretty people in it.

26:33.000 --> 26:50.000
Anyway, also, I actually have kind of ignored Danganronpa 2, except for Magical Girl Usami mode, which is pretty fun because you just basically go around drawing circles around your enemies and then gathering power ups and then you have to fight like this big mecha spider thing.

26:50.000 --> 27:00.000
No, not like a mecha spider thing. It's actually you have to fight like one of these different beasts that are in the game blocking the different island exits to the other islands in Danganronpa 2.

27:00.000 --> 27:08.000
And it's been pretty fun. It's kind of been like, except it's really freaking hard to do on a keyboard, so I have to go find my controller.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
Um, so what else did I do? I'm still having Streetpassed YYR here and that sucks.

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
And, um, oh yeah. Here was Dragon Age. Ingress now that I'm level 8.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Grads. Attic.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Thanks, Rob.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Hi, Pot. This is Kettle. Guess what color you are? Here's a mirror.

27:33.000 --> 27:42.000
I've also been playing the How Much Can I Get Away With Spending at Sephora game.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
How much have you gotten away with so far?

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
I've made it out of Sephora with an $85 purchase.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
That's impressive.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
I bought, well, granted it wasn't all makeup. Okay, girly tangent for a moment.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Lord.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
For my birthday.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Pay break, everybody.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Bitch.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
For my birthday, they give out like a special gift if you're signed up for whatever their club thing is.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
So I got this cleanser and it felt so good and it made my face feel like a 12 year old boy's butt.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Or like a baby's butt or something. I don't know. It was smooth.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
How would you know what a 12 year old-

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I have brothers.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I've punched them before.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Awkward conversation. Never mind. I'm sorry I asked.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
I've punched them before and pushed them out of trees.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Fair enough.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
And shot them with arrows. They were a nerf.

28:36.000 --> 28:45.000
So anyway, I ended up buying like a big thing of it and some Anastasia Beverly Hills.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Which I would have never discovered if not for Drag Race. So thank you, queens.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
I think we're about three months away from a full-on intervention with Dark Sakura and-

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
No, no, no, no. Wait until gamer X.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Alright. Oh, is it on at gamer X?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
You already know what I'm doing at gamer X.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
I do. I do.

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
I've got a toolbox full of makeup now and glue and prosthetic aid and spirit gum and you name it.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And I'm bringing it.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Plus I've made the shade fan now.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
An 18 karat gold leaf. Bam.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
Alright, clearly we've distanced ourselves from video games on that one.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
So let's talk with Loki about how was your gaming week?

29:24.000 --> 29:33.000
I didn't play a whole lot this week. Mainly just, well, I played Ingress because I have to keep that going.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
And then I played a bit of Pokemon Go and that was it.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Are you really supposed to be saying that you've played that? I don't think you're supposed to tell me.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Who gives a shit? You know, whatever.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I really don't fucking care. I mean, so what?

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Oh no. I'm not posting screenshots or anything, so it doesn't matter.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
Not that it really matters if you've seen screenshots or not because there's not much to show right now.

29:55.000 --> 30:03.000
Which, by the way, is I think the reason why not a ton of ton of people are in the beta is that they're really testing, I think, a lot of mechanics.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
But there's no game, you know, from what I understand.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
So there's not a lot of like...

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
There's not much to it right now.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
It's not like Ingress where you link and field and get points and there's leaderboards.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Like, none of that is... You can catch Pokemon and that's it.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
There's leveling, but I have no fucking clue what the leveling does.

30:22.000 --> 30:30.000
You can catch Pokemon. They have it where you kind of have to flick the Pokemon ball up like you're actually throwing it.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
And half the time it's just hard to gauge the depth on it and stuff.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
It works okay.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
If you like, you know, the Pokemon Rattatat or whatever, then you'll be really happy about this game because there's a shit ton of them.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And then...

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
What else? Oh...

30:48.000 --> 30:55.000
I mean, it's just kind of... It's neat, I guess, and you can battle your Pokemon at the gyms and stuff and deploy them and that kind of thing.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
But, again, from what I understand, it's not like the battles in the Pokemon Game Boy games.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
It's like action-based. You tap on your Pokemon. You swipe left and right to dodge attacks.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I mean, it's different.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Well, I'd tap that.

31:07.000 --> 31:14.000
So, if you're expecting the Pokemon games on the phone, that's not what Pokemon goes.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's a lot harder to play it driving than Ingress.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Not to say that that has dissuaded me.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
It's harder, though. Like, my GPS playing Pokemon, because like I said, this is in beta, it cooks your phone right now.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
So, the state that it's in, it's just devouring that battery to the point where your phone is melting down.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Wait, I have a question. Is it worse for your battery than Miitomo?

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
I haven't played Miitomo, but I'm probably going to say yes.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
From what I understand, yes.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
From what you understand, what I've heard on the internet, yes.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Whatever.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
And then, what was I going to say?

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, I mean, other than that, my GPS doesn't seem to be as accurate.

31:59.000 --> 32:08.000
So, it's hard for me to hit like the Poke Stops, which are like the portals while I'm driving, because my GPS would be lagged way behind where I'm at.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
And like, I don't know how to, you know, get this. But whatever, it's fine.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
They keep giving us free money to buy shit from their little store, which we'll be using real money at some point.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
So, yeah, that'll be fun.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
It's alright. I'm enjoying what I've played so far. Will I continue to play? We'll see.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
I like Ratatta. I wish I could catch some Ratattas. Thank you, Niantic.

32:33.000 --> 32:42.000
And then I installed this week in Final Fantasy XI, because I've been trying to play on a private server.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Because I don't want to pay...

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
You just don't give a shit about the rules this week, do you?

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
You just don't give a shit. When have you, actually?

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
Because, yeah, I just wanted to be able to play it at my leisure and without the grind.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
So, there's a lot of servers that'll allow you to do that.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Not really having luck right now logging into those servers.

33:06.000 --> 33:13.000
The one I did get on, I was able to create a character, but it's not connecting for some reason, so I had to figure out what's going wrong there.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
But, yeah, I did my 10-hour update or whatever the other day. Thank you, Play Online and Final Fantasy.

33:18.000 --> 33:25.000
But, hey, I did actually purchase it, and I played for a long time, several years, so they've gotten my money.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
I don't know. We'll see how long I stick with it, too. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
Awesome. My gaming week. Okay, I've actually had a very busy gaming week.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.000
So, for some unexplainable reason, I don't know why. There's no perfectly rational explanation for this.

33:43.000 --> 33:51.000
But I've just become really suddenly interested in Pokemon again this week for some... I don't know why. I just suddenly got really interested in it again.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
From what you understand.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
From what I understand, it's a really popular franchise.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
From what you've heard.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
From what I've heard on the internet.

33:57.000 --> 34:09.000
So, Shane, being Shane, was like, Rob, you should play a real Pokemon game. You should play Pokemon on the DS again, and you should play this.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It's so much fun, and if you like Pokemon, you'll love these games.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
And he went so far because this is what Shane does.

34:14.000 --> 34:23.000
Here, Rob, I actually got you a used copy at GameStop, and I'm just going to leave it here at the lunch table so you can just take that with you and do what you will.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
So, I've been playing Pokemon Alpha Sapphire on the 3DS.

34:27.000 --> 34:50.000
So, I have this notorious habit in Pokemon games where I will play up to the first gym, I'll get my badge, and then I'll become so overwhelmed with everything there is to do between the fucking beauty contests and the items and the fact that your Pokemon can only learn four moves, yet you have to, like, force teach them these moves to cut grass and smash rocks.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm going to fuck everything up by not min-maxing them the right way. I just fucking quit, right?

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
You'll smash those rocks correctly and I'm going to smash your fucking head against those rocks.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
The rocks will get smashed one way or the other.

35:01.000 --> 35:10.000
I get so overwhelmed that I am, like, making Pokemon that are not the very best, that no one ever was, that I just fucking quit.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm like, I can't fucking handle the pressure. I'm done.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
You'll be the very best at fucking fighting, or you're going to be the very best on my plate.

35:17.000 --> 35:25.000
So, here's the thing, though. With Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, everybody, I am pleased to announce I have two gym badges.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
I made it, and I am currently battling my way through the third gym.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.000
The electric gym's a little harder because I don't have any, what is it, rock Pokemon? I don't really have any rock Pokemon, so I'm having to make some of my other ones work.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
So, I am currently battling my way through the third gym.

35:42.000 --> 35:53.000
And I got to say, I think a big part of the reason why this is working for me in a way that the other games didn't do is that it gives you a lot of quality of life stuff right off the bat.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
Final Swipe, which is the move that allows you to not kill Pokemon, so you capture them.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Oh, that sounds really helpful.

36:01.000 --> 36:10.000
Yeah, Final Swipe is an attack that will, it will reduce them, it can, well, it's just like any normal attack, but it will not allow them to go below one hit point.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Wow.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
So you can just keep Final Swiping them as long as your Pokemon's strong enough, and you can get it down to one hit point, making it a lot easier to capture.

36:17.000 --> 36:28.000
They give you that really early on, and they give you something called EXP Share, so that way, when your lead Pokemon gets, or whatever Pokemon you're using gets experience in battle,

36:28.000 --> 36:35.000
everything else in your party gets half the experience, which is so much better than, you know,

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
Lamymon, I choose you, but I got to level you, and then you just recall it instantly and then send back.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I didn't even realize you can kill them. That's kind of cool.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Well, they faint. They faint, Loki. They don't die. They don't die, they just faint.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
They went on vacation.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
That's right.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Yes, I get it. They went to the farm. They retired.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
So, and I'm getting reminded in chat, Fifth Dream says, Sky, get all your free Pokemon this month.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Yes, I'm aware I need to get a Mew, I think, somehow, at some point.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I don't know.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Shane, don't worry, guys.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
Shane is reminding me every day of everything I'm doing wrong in Pokemon.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
So, I think we're covered. We'll be good.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Let's see.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
Kaijuto in chat says, that's why you catch wild Pokemon to do the work.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah, that's what I had to do.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Stoppy in chat says, I usually play until I have to go on a long distance journey to another city.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I've never finished. Blue.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Let's see.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
Fifth Dream says, I'm good in the game. I'm just not good against other people.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Same as in MMOs. I play stuff and win. I just suck at multiplayer content.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
So, but yeah, I've been all about the Pokemon this week for some strange reason.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
So, I've been enjoying the Alpha Sapphire, playing that in between other stuff.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
But I want to talk about this, too, because this is a huge event.

37:53.000 --> 38:03.000
My birthday happens to be next month, and it actually is going to end up being the same day as our 14-year anniversary show.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
June 26 is my birthday and the 14-year anniversary show, so that's something.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
But Alan just said, you know what, I'm going to get you your present early.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
I guess he got a big bonus because his job involves elections and what goes on there.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
So, they're kind of busy right now. I don't know if you're aware, but there's a primary coming up here in California.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
And for some reason, a lot of people are paying attention to it and all this stuff.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
So, his work is kind of popular right now. So, he made a lot of bonus money this month.

38:33.000 --> 38:43.000
So, he bought me my birthday present early, and he got me a new video card, which is a...

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
And I never remember these model names right, but it is the one that you can actually use to do Oculus Rift.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
It's a 760 GTX, is what he got me, graphics card.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
760?

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah. No, wait, is that what I had? I lied. No, 760 is what I had. Sorry, guys.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
Now I have a 970 GTX, is what I have.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Those are not bad, yeah.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
While I was running over to get the box, just to check.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, no, it's a 970 now. Sorry, 760 is what I had, so now I have a 970.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
And then he also upped my chip. I had a 4 GHz chip in the computer, now I have 4.7.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
So, yeah, right?

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
So, the first thing I did was I logged into Final Fantasy XIV to see how much prettier it was.

39:24.000 --> 39:31.000
The second thing I did was I booted up Doom, because you know the new Doom is pretty gorgeous, right?

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
So, now I can play the new Doom on Ultra at 60 frames a second.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Nice.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
And I was playing, it's so gross, oh my god, it's so gross.

39:42.000 --> 39:49.000
Like, just the insta-kills and everything, like, I am becoming desensitized to violence, but it is a lot of fun.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
I am terrible at it, I died on some mission last night because I'm an idiot,

39:53.000 --> 40:00.000
but it is a lot of fun to just go in there guns-a-blazing and kill everything and die, die, die, even though I'm like, this is so disgusting.

40:00.000 --> 40:07.000
But, Alan, he was playing Fallout 4 on his computer and he turned around and he's like, that is so gorgeous.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Oh my god, that's so pretty, that was so worth it.

40:10.000 --> 40:17.000
And yeah, it's a gorgeous game, the new Doom is gorgeous, with a high-end video card on PC, yeah.

40:17.000 --> 40:26.000
But now I am all ready for Oculus Rift that I didn't even think I wanted, but I guess I could get it.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
You have the bare minimum now.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I have the bare minimum now, so who knows, I might.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Well, technically you don't have the bare minimum, because my fucking laptop runs that shit.

40:34.000 --> 40:40.000
It doesn't run it good, or maybe up to spec, but it runs it, so technically you should be able to run it.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah, and I might, I don't know, I don't know where I stand on the whole VR thing.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
I still have the PlayStation VR headset ordered, I realize that's different from PC offerings.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
The PC pool is really, like, there's so many options, right?

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
You know, so I'm just gonna wait for Bobby to tell me what to buy.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
I just, I'm just gonna wait for Bobby to tell me what to buy.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Or, you know, the one that has the games that I want to play on it.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
Although, some of those, you know, thanks to piracy, a lot of those walls are coming down, right?

41:08.000 --> 41:15.000
You know, they're modding them so that things that were locked to Oculus, you know, there was big talk about that last week, so.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Was this about $1,000 video cards?

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
Well, that is, like, the highest end video cards are still like $1,000.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
Not necessarily, I mean, like, if you wait for the 1080, that's gonna be about $700, $600.

41:30.000 --> 41:36.000
And then the 1070, which is a step down a little bit from that, is gonna be about $400.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And those are gonna be coming out at the end of June.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
The 1080, I thought it was supposed to be coming out about now.

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
Alan didn't tell me how much he spent on the card, but I could kind of guess that it was probably about maybe $250, $299, right?

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
And he said it was right at the borderline before, like, a big jump happens in price.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
And he says, Rob, I love you, but not that much.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
And I understand, that's fair, that's totally fair, I understand.

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
Still, it's really hard for me to internally justify spending more on a video card than, like, the newest greatest console costs.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Right.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
And that's for a full system, including video capabilities, so.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
Well, that's because you're gonna have to upgrade it again, so, you know, it's basically just the same now.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
E3.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
Thank you, console manufacturers. I was just going, geez, you know, it would be really nice if I spent more money on your stupid console.

42:22.000 --> 42:33.000
So, one other thing that I want to point out quickly is that Alan got me those toys, but then I was like, okay, well, if you're gonna open up the computer to put in, because he does all the hardware stuff.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I don't know that stuff as well.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
So, if you're gonna open up the computer to put in the new toys, there's something else I want to put in there.

42:40.000 --> 42:54.000
So, I went to Best Buy and got myself a three terabyte hard drive so that I won't fucking run out of space anymore because I keep running out of, like, when I had to free up 60 gigs to install Doom, it was kind of, yeah, a mess.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
So, now I can just install everything on Steam without, I won't have to worry about it for a very, very, very long time. So, I'm excited about that.

43:02.000 --> 43:09.000
So, and plus, all that space for porn. Thank God. Thank God for space, thank God for porn.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
Come on, no one saves porn to their hard drive anymore. You have the internet, you stream that shit.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
When you have that very special cum shot that you don't want to forget. I'm sorry, I'm so nasty.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
That's what bookmarks are for. That's why you have a favorites list.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Yeah, if you're into the animated stuff, though, you can only explore it.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
You know, some people are into certain types of porn that involve, I'm sorry, hi.

43:35.000 --> 43:45.000
Jason in chat says, has a fries, go to Best Buy, I'm crying. Here's the reason why. I have justification.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
Because I am very much that person that when I want something, I want it now.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
And we would get to Best Buy by closing, but we would not get to fries by closing. So, there it is.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm surprised they had video cards at Best Buy. I mean, their computer section nowadays is, like, the size of this table right here.

44:02.000 --> 44:10.000
The video card came from somewhere else. We went to get the hard, because I was like, if you're going to do surgery on my computer tonight to put in this stuff, I want a hard drive to go in there, too.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
So I was like, and it's 830.

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
You know what's hiding in Best Buy's video card section, right? Their one Bluetooth controller.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
They have three. I got one of the three.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
Incorrectly placed. Hiding behind an outdated video card.

44:26.000 --> 44:34.000
Yeah, the Bluetooth controllers are in the PC controller department, so it's not even, like, Android or anything. Sorry, this is PC and Android.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
And iOS. Oh, yeah, that's PC as well.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
At least you know they're politically correct.

44:38.000 --> 44:44.000
Alright. Let's do some quick housekeeping here now that I've completely fouled up the show.

44:44.000 --> 44:51.000
Some quick housekeeping tonight. Of course, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

44:52.000 --> 44:59.000
I do want to remind everybody, especially if you're in the South area, specifically the Atlanta greater area where our pal Bobby Blackwolf is,

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
we're going to be sponsoring, we meaning VOG Network, are going to be sponsoring the Southern Fried Game Room Expo that's running June 10th through 12th.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
So that's only, like, two weeks away. Not even.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
So if you're in the South area, be sure to check that out.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
Lots of classic video games and pinball and panels celebrating all that stuff.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
And fun to be had, so be sure to check that out.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
I will be going to the Atlanta area in a few more months.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
I wanted to go to Southern Fried Game Room Expo. I really did, but trying to juggle the day job and all that.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
I could only pick one or the other. Could I do Southern Fried Game Room Expo or Dragon Con?

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
And with all due respect to Southern Fried Game Room Expo, if I'm going to take a trip from California, I'm going to Dragon Con.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
So I'm going to Dragon Con over Labor Day weekend, so I'm looking forward to seeing all of you there.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
I do also quickly want to say, before we get into the gaming news tonight, because it is a three-day weekend.

45:52.000 --> 45:59.000
Tomorrow is Memorial Day, so I do just want to take a minute to acknowledge, you know, there's a reason we celebrate Memorial Day.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
So I just want to say, you know, a big thank you to everybody who serves in the armed forces or has served.

46:06.000 --> 46:12.000
You know, or especially if you have a loved one that you've lost, since this is Memorial Day.

46:12.000 --> 46:20.000
If you have a loved one that has paid the ultimate price to defend my right to say the word come shot on the radio,

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
and nobody's going to come to my house and police me, we're not going to get censored for that type of stuff.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
You know, people pay a big sacrifice to protect those freedoms.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
So a big thank you in remembering why we have a three-day weekend this week.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
Okay, that all aside for housekeeping tonight. Let's talk about video game news.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
Because with the long weekend, I think a lot of you spending some time playing some games, right?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Yep.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
So let's get into the news this week.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
A little bit.

46:46.000 --> 46:56.000
Alright, so No Man's Sky was thought to have been delayed because there was some updated marketing materials that were going out to GameStops and stuff.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
They were basically putting a sticker over, you know, the release date with a coming soon.

47:00.000 --> 47:06.000
And that was confirmed as well by, you know, the developers and by the PlayStation blog.

47:06.000 --> 47:13.000
Basically, the date has moved from June 21st to now August 9th, which is seven weeks.

47:13.000 --> 47:21.000
And their reasoning for that, as we approach our final deadline, we realized that some key moments needed extra polish to bring them up to our standards.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
I have had to make the tough choice to delay the game for a few weeks to allow us to deliver something special.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
And that was coming from Hello Games, Sean Murray.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
Like, I want to be upset, but I just, I can't. I can't get mad about this stuff anymore.

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
This is so much the norm in our industry that everything gets pushed back.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
I have now just adopted the attitude of, you know what, when I see it on the shelf, I see it on the shelf.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Whenever Amazon drops it on my front door, there it is.

47:54.000 --> 48:01.000
That's okay. I mean, that's fine. Now Mighty No. 9 can get your full attention, assuming that it actually comes out on its way first.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
Low key. Don't make stuff up on this show. I'm just kidding.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
No, but lots of other games can now, you know, free up and have that time.

48:11.000 --> 48:20.000
And now No Man's Sky gets pushed even closer into the deadly holiday period, which will be coming, you know, now even shorter after that release.

48:20.000 --> 48:28.000
But, you know what, if it's to make the game better, then great. People aren't going to remember the delay if the game is great.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
Uncharted 4 got delayed an additional six weeks, didn't it? Are people complaining now?

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
No, people aren't complaining. And, you know, people seem to be taking it well.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
I mean, people have only been leaving death threats for the developers, so that's typical, I guess.

48:46.000 --> 48:54.000
You know what, once Mighty No. 9 comes out in two years, no one will remember that delay either.

48:54.000 --> 49:01.000
Death threats over this. Is this Twitter egg accounts that are doing this?

49:01.000 --> 49:11.000
Yeah, it's Twitter. I mean, come on, can we just get to the point now where we understand that, listen, Twitter is an anonymous platform.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
People act like assholes over anonymous platforms. About anything, it could be about anything.

49:16.000 --> 49:23.000
People could be sending death threats because they didn't like who won Survivor or something, or didn't like the outcome of Game of Thrones or something.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Jeff Probst, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
You survived my wrath, I mean, seriously.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I'm gonna vote you off the planet.

49:33.000 --> 49:42.000
I feel like, God, we shouldn't even be laughing about it, because to be on the receiving end of that, could you imagine somebody sending OLR a death threat?

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
I didn't laugh once during your show this week. I'm gonna kill you.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Yeah, let me just see if I can read this tweet here real quick.

49:47.000 --> 49:54.000
It says, your little article about No Man's Sky is being delayed has me hate you to my very core. It's the only thing I've lived for.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Okay, come on, just a little dramatic.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
That means you have mental problems.

49:58.000 --> 50:07.000
And you go and write that bullshit about the delay instead of visiting London later this month, I think I'll come by and say hi to you and fuck you up.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
You think you can get away with making...

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Okay.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Come on, people. Seriously.

50:13.000 --> 50:20.000
Send that person over someone's knee and spank them. That is the only appropriate response, I feel like.

50:20.000 --> 50:30.000
I don't know. Again, if it's mental health, maybe I shouldn't be making light of it or whatever, although I don't know. I do think we can spank some people.

50:30.000 --> 50:41.000
The problem is you have these people that are so immature using the internet. These are the same type of assholes you run across back in the day, Xbox Live and stuff.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
It's just now they're writing it down on board.

50:45.000 --> 51:00.000
Unfortunately, there's just no repercussions for these people because of the fact that they're being anonymous, but I just think we at this point kind of expect this kind of behavior because unfortunately people are assholes and people take things really ridiculous.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
I don't know. It's unfortunate, but this is kind of the world.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
And I kind of think, well, I don't know if that was Twitter or something else.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
It was Twitter.

51:12.000 --> 51:21.000
Okay, I'm going to pick on Twitter for a minute here. Twitter really needs to step it the fuck up with as big of a site as they are and so forth.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
They need to put more accountability into some of the stuff that people say on there.

51:26.000 --> 51:38.000
And it's like if they're understaffed or whatever, then staff. So you can better respond to some of the vicious crap that goes on on Twitter because by doing nothing about it, you're enabling it, I feel.

51:39.000 --> 51:48.000
There's a lot of great things that have come from Twitter. I have made awesome friendships because of Twitter. You and your wife met on Twitter?

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
We did.

51:49.000 --> 52:00.000
Oh my God. See, that is a great story. I met a friend of mine who I've been talking to on Twitter for like three years. I met on Friday. He happened to be in Sacramento for a conference and so we met.

52:00.000 --> 52:07.000
And another friend of mine was here from Hawaii a couple weeks ago when we met too. I have these real friendships from that.

52:07.000 --> 52:15.000
But there is just this like the lower 10% of Twitter is the real bottom of the fucking barrel.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
There's always a few bad apples spoiling the bunch, really.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
But fucking clean the goddamn barrel, Twitter.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
And then she'll-

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Hold on, Jamie. What?

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Sorry.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
I will say, being someone who met my husband on AOL when it charged by the hour, good job.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Thank you.

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
And children, so here's how I met your mother. I loved her at the very first post I received from her.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Kids.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
Where she called me a fucking shit posting, mansplaining, misogynist pig.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Kids.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Okay, I have to respond to this.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Shut your mouth.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I have to respond to this because this is important.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
Cajudo in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, no, no, don't tell Twitter to censor.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
You just spoke about how you're proud to have free speech and say cum shot on the air.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
That's three times now, by the way.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
We can't start policing the internet.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
I agree. However, your rights-

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
Well, A, Twitter is a private site so they can do whatever the fuck they want.

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
But your rights end where mine began.

53:16.000 --> 53:25.000
I don't give a shit what you say on your corner of the internet and all this stuff, but when you threaten my life, that's crossing the line.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
There's a big difference there. Now you're infringing on my rights. Does that make sense?

53:30.000 --> 53:37.000
I think the problem is that if you were to do this face to face with somebody, you could be brought up on charges.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.000
Whereas over the internet, they think they're hiding behind something that, oh, no one's going to find me, so that's the thing.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
If people were that afraid, then maybe people would be a lot more nicer, I would think.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Some laws need to be updated, I think, really.

53:52.000 --> 54:03.000
But let's not take it to the extremes here. If I'm disagreeing with somebody over the internet, I better not be brought up on charges of harassment because they didn't like what I have to say.

54:03.000 --> 54:17.000
But there is, though, a way that if you feel you're truly being harassed, you can make the phrase, please stop speaking with me, any further communication will be considered harassment, and I have saved a screenshot.

54:17.000 --> 54:26.000
Usually stops things, and I've actually been able to call law enforcement on someone who continued to harass me.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
Because you outlined it clearly.

54:31.000 --> 54:37.000
It's just disgusting that things reach that point. Whatever happened to common human decency?

54:37.000 --> 54:49.000
Because common decency, for the most part, for a lot of people out there, is a social construct. It's a rule that you play when your face is exposed.

54:49.000 --> 54:55.000
The real heart of people comes out when you put the masks on.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Alright.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Maybe I'm a little bit of a cynic.

54:59.000 --> 55:16.000
It's a complicated issue, and there's really no easy answer. I do put a lot of value in our listeners that I really do think people that suffer through this program have a particular intelligence, or low intelligence, no, I'm kidding.

55:16.000 --> 55:24.000
When I say treat people with common decency, I really believe that most of our listeners do follow that.

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
Society treats people pretty decent. It's just the loud assholes that get the attention.

55:30.000 --> 55:36.000
But if by nature you're one of these people that send death threats to people anonymously online, fucking stop it!

55:36.000 --> 55:46.000
You gotta evaluate your life that your life is so surrounded by revolving around this one game. I don't believe that. I think it's a troll.

55:46.000 --> 55:56.000
I would also say that the people who do have decency, there could be many, many more of them, but it's sort of like what I experience as a Southern woman in the South.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
The only people that you see on the news are the morons. The people that give the entirety...

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Florida man.

56:02.000 --> 56:14.000
Florida man, exactly. Or his dumber cousin, Mississippi man. It was even worse. Trust me, the Alabama state motto is, we're not Mississippi.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I'm kidding. We had Mardi Gras first.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
I'm kidding too, because I know we actually have listeners in Florida, but you're also not on the nightly news.

56:20.000 --> 56:32.000
Alright, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, TigerClaw in chat says, it's those damn milleniums. Blame it on the milleniums! When in doubt, blame a generation.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
Did you read that milleniums now outnumber baby boomers?

56:36.000 --> 56:42.000
Well, I mean, it would make sense that as one generation gets older, they're dying.

56:42.000 --> 56:47.000
But still, they're actually now the largest generation group out at present.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Heaven help us all. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
And you have us a fake because we fucked like crazy!

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Amy's taking a shit over here.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Amy's like, I'm a millenium.

56:57.000 --> 57:05.000
No, no. I'm just joking. You know what? There's a lot of things that I identify with milleniums as well, but I do love the scapegoating that happens out there.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Like, when in doubt, just fucking blame milleniums.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
Gosh, freaking bitch! Get off my lawn!

57:13.000 --> 57:20.000
Sometimes we just need to pull out the fan, put it in the way of the selfie camera, and just...

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
Goddamn internets, goddamn milleniums fucking...

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Get off my virtual lawn!

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
...tweeting their food and...

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Right.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
You know what?

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
My wife does that shit, and it fucking annoys the crap out of me.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
It's like, what are you doing? Oh, I'm trying to get the perfect picture of the kids and eating ice cream and stuff. Who fucking cares?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Loki, you married a millenium.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I didn't marry a millenium. I wanna be a millenium.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
You know what? I do the shit out of that at Disneyland, though.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Because everything there is pretty.

57:48.000 --> 57:55.000
And when they served me that food that we paid a hundred plus bucks for at Carthay, you're damn right I took several pictures of it.

57:55.000 --> 58:03.000
Listen, I'm not gonna take a picture every time I cook something because you only need one giant plate of spaghetti picture to be on the internet.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
And it basically represents all the giant plates of spaghetti that I eat.

58:07.000 --> 58:16.000
Next Saturday, on Lifetime, Loki stars in, so I married a millenium.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
Yes, my Russian bride.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Alright, I'm so Ukrainian bride.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
Look, we gotta move on, we gotta move on.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
Well, we talked a lot about face-to-face interaction, and would you say that to somebody's face?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Well, you'll have the opportunity to say it.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Sometimes I would.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
All of her faces.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
E3.

58:35.000 --> 58:44.000
A lot of people are kinda just, you know, mentioning this and moving on, but this is a really big deal, I think.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I wanna talk about this for a minute.

58:46.000 --> 58:58.000
The organizers behind E3, not somebody else, but the ESA, the folks that organize E3, have announced that there is going to be a free public event called E3 Live.

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
That's going to happen between June 14th and the 16th, which is the same days as E3.

59:03.000 --> 59:11.000
It's not gonna be held at the convention center, but it will be in downtown Los Angeles, next door.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Literally, it's gonna be at the Staples Center.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
E3 too, the quest for more money.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
E3 too, Electric Boogaloo.

59:17.000 --> 59:26.000
The event starts at 5pm on June 14th, and you do have to register for a free ticket, although my understanding is it's already gone.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
Those free tickets give you a five hour time slot and it's gone.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Five hours?

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Yeah, so I guess you get in through AM, PM, I don't know.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
You don't go for the whole three days like it is E3.

59:36.000 --> 59:42.000
However, this is still now E3 opening up a little more to the public.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
And this comes off the heels of what they did last year, where they basically openly said,

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
if you can get sponsored by a gaming company, you can get into E3.

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
Remember the whole thing where it's like, we're gonna let gaming companies invite 500 of their biggest fans or whatever it is to E3.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You know, E3 is slowly and slowly getting more public.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Because we've got all this space now that all these different publishers aren't actually participating with E3.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Well, but here's the thing that's especially odd about this, in my opinion.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
This was announced this week, right?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
E3 is like three weeks away.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Wouldn't you have announced something like this like four months ago, five months ago?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So this is something that I don't want to say they necessarily thrown it together, but it does have a last minute sense about it.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Well, I mean, I'm sure all those people will be able to find, you know, accommodations and lodging about, you know, two counties away.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I wonder when they told the, you know, the publishers and people bringing booths with them about this.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Well, it's not every publisher I don't think is participating.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I think only some.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It's all Ouya.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
No, it's like Twitch and what, Frito-Lay.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Can you imagine? You spend all this time, you're going down there, you're super excited, you walk in and it's fucking just like Twitch.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Mountain Dew and Doritos.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And Mountain Dew, Doritos, and Ouya.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Hey, maybe if you're lucky, you'll get to see Konami streaming the same like two minute Pro Evolution soccer video over and over again.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Ow, that hit a nerve.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
But no, I mean, it's very, very interesting to me that this is the way that E3 is now going.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I mean, are we looking at potentially a public E3 in the next couple of years?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I really think we're getting closer and closer to that, especially as more and more people are starting to ask the question, is E3 relevant?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I mean, aren't we, aren't we basically, you know, seeing E3 go from all the stuff that you wanted to know about gaming to, oh, you need to be press and make an appointment to see that?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yes, that is true to some extent. However, I would argue, here's my argument, E3 is already public.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:01.000
What do we know? I mean, I guess we don't know what the participation is this year, but could it be because the participation, just people going to it is even down?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Because maybe that's the thing is they're trying to make sure that the businesses around E3 are staying.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
You're not seeing a float, but getting that traffic.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And this is a way to drive more traffic to the businesses nearby because they're going to get, you know, extra people, the public coming in for these different events.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
That could be part of it. But the years that they went to Santa Monica instead and kind of left the businesses with E4ALL instead at a completely different time.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I don't know if that shows that they necessarily feel that obligation to the businesses to do that, but I was going to say, I want to follow up to what I said to Aaron about E3 is already public.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I mean, the reason why I say that is because with all the streaming that goes on with half the time you make appointments to see stuff, you're seeing the exact same fucking thing that's on Spike TV or that's on Twitch or whatever.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It's a controlled demo done by the publishers so that there's no mistakes or what have you. It's the hands on at E3 is going away.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And so in some regards, maybe they want to open that up to the public because, well, we're just going to show you the same shit that's going to be on Twitch TV or whatever anyway.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So E3 in some regards is just becoming kind of like an announcements week and less of the hands on stuff that he used to be a long time ago when truly the people that got their hands on to play was the only way that the public could experience it through the articles they wrote.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It should be inviting more people to E3, to be honest. I mean, it's hard enough, especially like back in the Nintendo days where it's like, OK, everybody has to wait, you know, five hours to play the Wii or Wii U or whatever.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I mean, I think if there's less people going, that's a good thing, because then you're actually getting to view that stuff without having to wait five hours to waste your time doing that.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I don't see a problem with that. I mean, if they want to do the public event next door, I guess that's fine. But I think it's a bad idea having these publishers, you know, bring in like 500 other fans or something like that. They'll need that.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Oh my gosh, it's just it's going to be a shit show in downtown L.A. I just oh my God. I hope you all got your hotel rooms already and can stay right there because even transit is going to be a mess with all those extra people.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Or maybe they are thinking that less people will be at the main show itself, so it's going to balance each other out. I don't know.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Anyway, I do want to mention, though, speaking of the fact that, you know, E3 is practically already public, YouTube is going to continue doing their own E3 coverage.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:30.000
YouTube did their own E3 thing last year, and they have announced that that will continue this year. So, you know, it's kind of an alternative to Twitch, I suppose, in a way, as they do have competing gaming sides to it.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But there's going to be a 12 hour stream hosted by Jeff Keighley. So if you're a Jeff fan, there you go. That will kick off at 9 a.m. Pacific on June 13th.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:51.000
A reminder that they did break some news in 2015. They actually had the announcement of the Walking Dead spinoff game and so forth. So they may have some exclusives this year as well. Who knows?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Wait, 2014 they said?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
In 2015 they said that.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Oh, was that the Telltale one?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
The Walking Dead Michonne was last year.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
What the fuck is that?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Like the spinoff series. There's another Walking Dead. Where have you been?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
The game came out recently.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yeah, the game came out already.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Oh, what the hell was it?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It was just another Walking Dead game, but it wasn't a whole season. Was it an entire season or just one episode?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
We haven't cleared season two yet, so don't know.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Shows you how.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Alright, well that seems very impactful to my life.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, but still, it's something.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Hey, it's a victory from the evil corporate overboard people.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I'll tell you what I'm not doing this year is watching a stupid fucking PC conference. Yeah, my stupid brain.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I bet you they're gonna announce Half Life 3. Why would they have a PC conference? God, it was so stupid. Why did I watch that piece of shit?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I'm not doing it again.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You had hope. A lot of us watched.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I had hope. I just, you know.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I will develop Pixel Poops 3 before Half Life 3 is released. That is my pledge to you.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
You better watch what you promise on this show.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I'll skip over two if I have to.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
What happened to Pixel Poops 2? That was crap.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Uh, go see Frog Fractions 2. It's there. It's in the same place.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
It's at the bar with Frog Fractions 2.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yes.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Well, we made a mention of it. At least I did earlier.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Overwatch. It's popular. Now that it's popular, it has porn.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Porn made with assets from the game.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Assets.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Assets. Can I ask you a question?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Anyway.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Well, of course, since there's porn using assets from the game, there's been a cease and desist issued.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I'll stop him.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Oh yeah. They're out of those woods now.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
They had to say the safe word.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000
So, anyway, Overwatch porn searches are up by 817%.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And so they're all, the people who are using Overwatch assets are being hit for copyright infringement.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Which, if you are using assets that you don't own, to try to make money off of property you don't own,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
it can't be considered parody when you're taking the assets.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:30.000
So they do have a case here. I mean, basically it was really just to the people who ripped the character models.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000
They might have added bits to them because I thought they were rendered with bits.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Or removed some.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
They were actually rendered specifically with Steam Source Filmmaker.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So, interesting.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Which brought you such wonderful things as Bioshock Infinite porn and Borderlands 2 porn.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Really?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, you know what can really eliminate that is stop making giant breasted people in your games.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
There you go.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
But Overwatch has a pretty diverse lineup.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
It's not just the female characters. They're adding cocks on the dude characters.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Batman Arkham City porn as well.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well, I know a lot of people are jumping to the whole...

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Why are women the only ones to be sexualized?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I'm just saying, they're normally the first. It's like, okay, women with giant breasts in the game, you're naked first.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
They do tend to float to the top of the results, yes.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
But...

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Why can't I have like... nevermind.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Don't worry.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
You can have whatever you want. This is the internet, Jamie.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I'm not saying that...

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Believe in your dreams.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I'm not saying that everybody doesn't get, you know, representation eventually.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm just saying that those are chosen first.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Yeah.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Why's it gotta be boobs?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
It doesn't have to be.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I'm just saying that it's what they choose first.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
William Murderface in chat says,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Let there be all the porn, dude and chick.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Isn't that what God said on the eighth day?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It's rule 34.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I mean, seriously, just rule 34.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
On the 34th day, God said, let there be all the porn.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
No, on the 34th day, it's like, I just realized there's no other women in the world.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Where are all the babies coming from?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Look, let's see...

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You can't have siblings going at it.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
It messes up the gene pool.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Ray, have you ever read the Bible?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I'm just kidding.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Yeah, which is probably why I converted.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I don't want to go there.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I'm just... I shouldn't...

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Nope, that was...

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm just gonna put the couch covers back on that topic.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I should not have looked under there.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
All right.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Are they plastic like an old lady's living room in the 50s?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Ray Genator in chat says,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I noticed that people had modded Skyrim to be pornographic.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And every other game in existence ever.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I accidentally stumbled upon someone streaming Skyrim porn on Steam.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Accidentally.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
But the thing is, is that that content is not there for profit.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And typically porn sites are looking to make money.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So if they are stealing assets from an IP they don't own

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and marketing it for their own profit

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
without, you know, giving any money or rights back to the owner,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
which also can in some way diminish the overall reputation of the product,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
you know, of their IP.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Yeah, they have every right to shut it down.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
When you're making, you know, naked mods for, you know, Dragon Age,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
okay, they're naked.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
No one's making money on it.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I understand.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I don't think they're doing it for profit.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I think actually a lot of these people do it for funsies.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I mean, so I just...

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It just gets put on these sites

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
because this is where you find your adult content videos and stuff.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
So that's where it just gets hosted

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
because you're not gonna throw this shit on YouTube.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I mean, VMO, you know.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
So that's why it ends up there.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
But I don't think anyone's actually doing it like,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
hey, we're gonna make so much money off of this.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Said no one ever on a video, you know.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You can't make that kind of money on videos.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You know, a lot of people are saying Blizzard is so out of touch

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and Blizzard doesn't know rule 34 and all this stuff.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
But if I'm not mistaken, a third party is doing this on Blizzard's behalf, right?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And, you know, sometimes third parties do really weird things

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and you've kind of seen that with YouTube content ID matching.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
You have to wonder if maybe Blizzard's third party might be overreaching a little bit.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Although, when Jamie puts it the way she does,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
that, you know, essentially when this porn starts to make money off Blizzard stuff,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
then that's, you know, if I put titties out there for free, that's one thing.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But if I make you pay to see the titty, that's another.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And there is a distinct difference between that.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But what's interesting is that if I were to have like a DeviantArt page

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
where I sell posters of my Tracer fan art,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
completely G-rated and tasteful, there's not a problem with that.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Blizzard and most companies in general kind of just turn a blind eye to that sort of stuff.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
But the minute there's a titty...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm just telling you one thing, I mean,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
because I remember when Bioshock Infinite first came out,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
they were like, please don't make Elizabeth porn.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Please don't do that.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Don't do that.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And then everyone's like, I'm doing that.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
It's like, you told me not to do that. I'm totally doing that.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
My favorite thing in the world is this Miyamoto parody account that's out there on Twitter,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and it will always post these things like where somebody did fan art of Mario and Luigi making out,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
and he'll tweet the picture and he'll put, please don't do this.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yes, rule 34.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Or like, please, please stop. This is not what was intended.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yes, you know, a lot of the Mario characters already represented.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Samus, yep. Anything you can possibly imagine, it's there.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Super Smash Brothers and Sisters.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Emphasis on Smash.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Now, there's only one logical solution for this, honestly, I believe,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and that is to take these videos that have Overwatch porn characters

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and to add to them Grand Theft Auto porn characters, Nintendo porn characters.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
They'll never find them then.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I believe you should treat all the game companies equally.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
What you gotta do is you gotta go the copyright block method,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
like he suggested, you know, put all the characters in there.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Never find the men. Just put all of the naked characters in there.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
On Elsa, I mean fucking Pac-Man, Sonic.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man porn? There you go.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Thank God someone in chat still brings up like a 15-year-old reference.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000
William Murderface in chat says Final Fuck X, which is a real thing.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It is a real thing because we watched it live on air on an early episode of OLR.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
The DVD's still in my house.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Yeah, it was cosplay porn is basically what it was.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah, it was these...

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
They didn't even dress the guys up. It was just...

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Really good costumes, though.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Yeah, the girls had really great costumes for a minute.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And then there was Dance Dance Fuck, which just...

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Dance Dance Fuck was ridiculous. Like, there was nothing there.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It was just like one of those days searching for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
There it is. It's like, I kind of have to buy that now.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I'll never forget. That's when I was living with Loki. I'll never forget the day.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Guess what I got today? He just drops Dance Dance Fuck down on the table.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Do they have bazookas?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I don't remember.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
No, there was like no cosplay or anything.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
No, it had nothing to do with it. It was just...

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
They were dancing in a club and then... fucking.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Oh.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I think it was just the name.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Oh, I don't know. Anyway.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Watch of a revolution if you ask me.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Well, tonight is a special episode of Orange Country.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Look how fucking dirty this show gets when you visit.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It's good she's in the room.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
You should feel ashamed of yourself.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Shame.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Level of shame is near zero.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Shame.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yeah, you're the Game of Thrones. You're the one that says,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Oh, I'll watch Game of Thrones before I listen to OLR.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Shame. Shame.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I kind of meant it.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
You need to get the bell.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I mean, it's really... it's missing something without the bell.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
It is missing something without the bell. I'll work on that.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The Taco Bell?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I'm usually not the kind of show to have the zany sound effects and all that stuff,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
but for that, we'll make an exception.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
We'll make an exception. All right, let's move on.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Logie.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
All right.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Gosh, so distracted by all this stuff.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Oh, God. No, this is really important. I'm sorry.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Sorry.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Defective Candy in Chat says, Oh, God, I remember pterodactyl porn.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Wasn't that the first porn on the Wii?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
That was New Year's Eve one year.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
This is what nerds do.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
We realized that you could bring up XTube or PornTube or one of those up on the Wii.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
It was the year that the Wii got the internet browser.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
So, of course, the first thing we did was we started to bring up pornography on the Wii.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And one of the first things that was there was pterodactyl porn.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And it was a guy in a dinosaur suit banging some girl.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
But my favorite was, like, the way he would just kind of shake his wings.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Like, he's putting so little effort into it. Like, I'm sorry.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Please don't do this.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Please don't do this.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The makers of Jurassic Park, please stop.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
S21 Hunter Matt says, I remember Rob was scream laughing during the episode.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Sounds accurate.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Oh, my God.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase PIG.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Anyway, could we please stop the pornography talk and move on?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Loki.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I guess.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So, there's some rumors now regarding the Xbox One.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000
You know, it's been kind of rumored that the Xbox One will also be getting some sort of new device that would be slightly upgraded and stuff.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
One of the things now, there's actually two rumored devices.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
One being a slimmer model that's going to be coming out in 2016.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
It's supposed to be spec-wise pretty similar.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
What's kind of neat about those, from what I remember hearing, I've listened to quite a few shows about it.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
They're saying that the size of this console would be about a little smaller than a lunch box.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
So, I mean, that's significant.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
How big of a lunch box?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
A small lunch box.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I mean, so, I mean, considering the size of the Xbox One now, which is like 80s VCR, this is significantly smaller since we're talking like 80s lunch box now.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Can I get like awesome 80s lunch?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Like, will they start putting patterns on the Xbox like they used to do on 80s lunch boxes?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Like, can I get a Dukes of Hazzard Xbox One or like a Transformers Xbox One or something like that?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
No idea.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Maybe faceplates will come back.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And then, of course, the other rumor is that there's going to be a more powerful Xbox One coming out in 2017.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Codename Scorpio.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000
That's supposed to have a more powerful GPU and Oculus Rift support.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Which makes sense because they're kind of partnering with, you know, Oculus to provide the controllers and everything in the Rift.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So, maybe since, you know, I would think HoloLens isn't going to be available anytime soon for a reasonable price.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.000
This sounds to me like the Xbox 1.5 or whatever it is.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It sounds like this has gotten delayed, but you can't delay something you never announced.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Well, I think for sure that the slim thing is going to happen because if you notice on all the retail sites right now for Xbox Ones, they're throwing out some insane deals to clear out inventory.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000
That's usually what happens when they're going to be announcing a new SKU like that is that they're trying to clear out the old shit that they figure is not going to sell.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Because maybe it's being offered for the same price or something and they're not going to do any sort of, you know, back-end price rebates or whatever to allow them to clear out inventory.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So, I could see something like that happening.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I really don't like this new console thing coming out where they're saying, oh yeah, sure, the old games will be supported by it.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
To me, it's just like putting out a brand new console without numbering it.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Except it's backwards compatible with the last generation. It's kind of like the DS with Game Boy Advance or the 3DS with the DS games.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Yeah, you can't really just call that a new DS because there's games that are going to run on that that aren't going to run on the other system.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And if they're not going to be utilized, if you're not going to have any sort of games taking advantage of that increased hardware and it's supposed to run perfectly on both systems, then what's the point?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And just because it runs, you know, it's going to be like some of the older games that came out at the end of, or I should say the beginning of the new generation.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Where, oh yeah, it runs great on this platform, but it runs 30 FPS on this platform with the decreased resolution and blah, blah, blah.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I don't know. I think it's too early for new consoles. We just had new consoles.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Yeah.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
It's like you should have waited some time and increased the specs on them.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Another year though will be a little like, it'll feel a little better in another year, I think.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000
But still like then what's going to make me want to buy a new like PlayStation 4k or whatever we're going to call it means.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Because what, what makes me want to buy an iPhone 6 when I had an iPhone 5 that worked just fine. You know what I mean?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:14.000
They have more features in it, but seems like, but I think for the most part, you know, software is going to be, I don't want to say software is going to be,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000
it does run significantly better on the other system. And with an iPhone or something like that, it's something that you use every single day.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I just don't see, I don't think you can compare it like that. It's, you know, iPhones in most smart devices do a lot more than just play games.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And if you're asking me to spend $400 a year for something, fuck that. I'm going to buy a PC, spend the same amount of money and have something that's going to need to be upgraded every few years.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And that's still going to run your games better than these upgraded specs. Because there's no way that those consoles are going to run games better than PC or even on par with PC.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Alright, well I'm going to move on to something else that is planned for 2017 and that is the brand new Mega Man cartoon that's coming out.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I don't know if you've seen the picture that was floating around the internet this week, but it's part Mega Man, part Tron basically that's out there.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I don't hate it. I just, it is different, but I don't necessarily hate it because at least I'm sitting here going, well, it's Mega Man something and it's going to take that to get the games to come back.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So, I don't know. But anyway, here's the deal is that this series is going to be aimed at kids 6 to 9 and parents who grew up playing the games.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
6 to 9.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So, this is going to be about Mega Man's alter ego Aki Light.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
No, we don't need fucking alter egos. It's fucking Mega Man. You don't need the fucking alter egos. Nobody gives a shit.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Wait, wait, wait, but it wasn't Mega Man made by Dr. Light, so it still seems kind of scary.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Yes, I understand that, but who gives a shit about alter egos and their high school drama bullshit? He's a fucking robot that kills more fucking robots.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Well, that's what it should be.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Well, hold on, because if you're a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog's friends, wait till you hear this.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Other characters from the games and new characters.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them with all the fuckable things and the non-fuckable things.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
New characters including Mega Mini will also be featured.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000
What is this? Fucking Austin Powers? Mini fucking Mega Man? Yes, that will be fucking irritating and stupid.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:40.000
By the way, for anyone wondering, Loki sounded loud on the show. He was even louder in person.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Not everybody gets to experience the Loki rants. You know, you've been listening to the show for a long time. You get to actually see it play out live.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:54.000
It's amazing in person. Everyone should try this. You need to do this once in your life.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:10.000
By the way, Capcom offered their own perspective on the Mega Man series, saying it's a young school-aged robot living in Silicon City.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:27.000
He soon learns that deep within his programming are secret protocols that allow him to transform, giving him nanocore armor, a Mega Buster, and the iconic helmet to turn him into a superhero, Mega Man.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yes, he's a magical girl. How do you feel about that, Loki?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I just fucked with them, seriously. I mean, they're not... It's like, what the fuck is it? Yeah, this worked out so well for Pac-Man, for fucking Sonic.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Actually, the 80s Pac-Man anime series was pretty good.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I'm not talking about the 80s Pac-Man. I'm talking about the fucking Pac-Man and Ghostly Adventures or whatever, where everybody, for some goddamn reason, they feel it's necessary to add more fucking sidekick friends.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Because you know what that means? They can merchandise more shit. All it means is it's fucking irritating.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I introduced my son to the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures. I didn't think it was that bad. It was not as irritating as I expected it to be.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But he doesn't give a shit about that show anymore. Like, it literally meant nothing to him.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Did you try Pee-Wee's Playhouse?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
He liked Pee-Wee's Playhouse, actually.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Parenting done right, thank you.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So, I mean, so that was fine. It's just, this is stupid. This is like...

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
What's your audience? I mean, you're trying to get kids interested in Mega Man? I don't think that that's the problem.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Because, you know why they aren't interested in Mega Man now? Because you haven't put out a fucking game in years!

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Exactly!

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Yep. I was gonna say the same thing.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
What if this could lead to a new game?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
No! No, fuck that, because it's gonna be...

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Based on the hit cartoon!

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Are you gonna let me finish?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I don't fucking need Sonic Boom, the fucking Mega Man game, okay? I don't need that shit.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I want my fucking either 2D Mega Man game, or fucking Mega Man Legends 3.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I don't need you to fucking reinvent Mega Man, because you're doing a shitty job at it.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Okay, let's see. Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I did enjoy Sonic Boom, though. Weird redesign aside.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And Dungeon Buster says, the Sonic Boom cartoon is actually really good.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So...

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
How about that?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's really interesting! Too bad I'm never gonna watch the show, and the games suck ass, so that's fine.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I'm glad that they did a portion of it right.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
But you know what they do, and you know how you know this is gonna be a terrible show?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Because if it was a good show, they'd fucking cancel it, like fucking Tron.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Orange right in chat says, too bad they couldn't adapt the Archie comics.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Actually, isn't the CW getting a show called, like, Riverdale?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And they turned it into, like, a scary sci-fi thing?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Except, I think what they mean are the ones published by Archie comics.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Oh.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Because Archie's had a Sonic series running since, like, 1990.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So, when you say Archie comics, I actually think of Archie the comic, which is probably dating myself a little bit, but I don't give a fuck.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Let's still read Betty and Veronica.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And Josie and the Pussycats, thank you very much.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
You know what they need to do? I'm seriously, like, stop trying to, you know, dumb down these fucking franchises for kids.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Because if you make a franchise that's just badass, that's just fucking, okay, it's a badass Mega Man fighting robots and shit, little kids are gonna fucking want to watch that.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Just like fucking Transformers, they didn't dumb that shit down.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Okay, they did in the movies, thank you Michael Bay, but I'm talking about, like, the actual 80s cartoons, they didn't dumb that shit down.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Kids are like, fuck, that looks awesome, and they want to watch it.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Not because, ooh, this is my demographic, fuck yes!

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I mean, nobody watches something because it's in their demographic.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
This is, like, such backward-ass thinking.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I will say, though, that the toy series existed under a different brand.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Then they had the cartoon out for the purpose of marketing the toys.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Same thing happened with G.I. Joe, the toys were out, and they wanted to market it to the 80s audience.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Therefore, we had an animated series to push that out.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Same with Thundercats, same with Silverhawks, even though Silverhawks was awesome!

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Um, what was it? He-Man.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Yeah, but Dark Tetsuya, though, Rescue Bots, though, was for, like, preschoolers.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Go-Bots was shit.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Okay, Go-Bots, we're not talking about Go-Bots.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Um, this fucking Rama one-half robot bullshit is stupid.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Um, so, yes, I understand that sometimes they will take, like, different superheroes or series and dumb them down for, like, preschoolers.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.000
You know, kind of get them into, like, Superhero Squad or, I guess, the Transformers Rescue Bots or something like that.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Yes, they have those versions.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And, let me tell you, Superhero Squad is fucking irritating as shit.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And my kids, they kind of liked it at first, but they don't like it now.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I mean, it's fucking irritating.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
It's like you watch...

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
The characters are just fucking cliches, it's ridiculous.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I mean, come on.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
What happened to the good shit, like fucking Batman the Animated Series and fucking Gargoyles and Darkwing Duck and all that shit?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Like, why can't we just take these properties a little bit more seriously?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Because if you're showing me this shit, this doesn't seem serious to me at all.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And I don't think you're going to handle it seriously.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And who do you think is going to buy this game?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I hope that those six to nine-year-olds are really going to fucking pick up your game because I sure as fuck can't.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
God damn millennials, get off my lawn.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
It's not millennials, it's fucking people in marketing departments making terrible decisions.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
It's even worse. It's the generation after the millennials.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
There has to be a moment of correction toward the chat room.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
First of all, Voltron was not created as a marketing ploy.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It was two different series combined into one to market to the US audiences.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But they were their own standalone series and Robotech was fucking Macross and you do not sass Macross.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yes, there were many awesome toys that came as a result of that.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You even had figures for RPGs.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
RPGs based off of the Valkyrie design that, yes, I might have played.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I think they were wrapped up in the Playdium universe, I want to say.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
But still, that wasn't the intent was to have a marketing empire.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
The first intent was to have a series.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I feel like we should have a whiteboard with Dark Sakura's rules.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And for those that want a webcam during the show, it's just pointed at the rule board the entire time.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And it can start with one, do not sass Macross.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I hope Kaijuto is being facetious in here because that is the most stupid question I've ever seen asked in the entirety of stupid fucking questions.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
It's almost more stupid than Drumpf saying there is no drought in California.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Jamie, calm down.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Your rants are getting as bad as his.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
What are we going to do with both of you?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I haven't had caffeine, Rob.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
But seriously though, how am I supposed to take this shit seriously?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Capcom, you know, fucking...

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
What have they done in the last few years for us with Mega Man?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's just like, oh hey, guess what?

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Mega Man, he's going to be a fucking Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Oh fuck you, it's Bad Box Mega Man.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Hahaha, suckers.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Hey, Mega Man Legends 3, that's going to be so awesome, we're going to totally bring that back.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Haha, it's fucking cancelled, you assholes.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I mean, how am I supposed to take him fucking seriously?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I'm not.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
It's like, hey, we're going to come out with a new Mega Man cartoon.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Haha, it's fucking shit.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I mean...

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Whatever, you know what, come out with the cartoon, we'll see, it sucks.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
The end.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
For the record, yes, they killed the shit out of Roy Foker in Macross.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Let's move on to the next story.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
They killed the shit out of him.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And we were like, holy shit, by the way, that Sven guy in, um, uh, Voltron?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Yeah, he died too.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I see their parachutes.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Moving on, Dar Sakura.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Do you have another gaming related story for us?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yeah, I do, and it's sad and it pisses me off too.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000
So Vivendi is going to be making a hostile takeover of, um, Gameloft.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
They're moving through with it.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Like, you know, you don't really hear about hostile takeovers so much.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Not since like the 80s when it was like, everything was making me corporate world.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Yeah, they're trying to do it with Ubisoft too.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Actually, Ubisoft is definitely on their, uh, uh, they have their sights on Ubisoft next.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Um, both companies have been opposed to, uh, the acquisition for a while now.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And have been working to, uh, fight the hostile takeover.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
But Gameloft has, uh, succumbed and Ubisoft is going to have to get their asses in order.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000
We need to protect our poor, poor French Ubisoft.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Like a precious, precious little gem.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We need to shelter them and say, you know what?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Give us more lady characters and we'll protect you from the big bad Vivendi.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Oh, Ubisoft. You precious, special little slip lake.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Boy, Vivendi's been desperate to get something gaming back, isn't it?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Well, that's what you get for fucking it away.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates from an evil gaming company near you. Loki.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Alright, so this week we have a few things coming out.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Um, looks like Dead Island the Definitive Edition is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Yay.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Uh, One Piece Burning Blood on PS4, Vita, and Xbox One.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Also, Smite is coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Um, this is kind of interesting speaking of, you know, you want to talk about fucking, you know, pornographic and fan art shit.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Uh, Senran Kagura, uh, Shinobi Versus.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:48.000
This is the fighting game where you fight as big-breasted anime chicks and their clothes come off as you fight them.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
And that's coming out on PC.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Well, isn't that nice.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Um, a game called Turn On on WinMac and Xbox One.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
No, it's not pornographic.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
It also sounds pornographic.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
It's not. I checked.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Uh, Dangerous Golf, which actually looks kind of interesting.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
It's, uh, pretty cool.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
It's this game where you, uh, basically fire a ball out of a gun at, like, different things in a house.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And you're breaking shit and then you're also trying to get it into a hole within a certain amount of strokes.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And that'll be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Uh, Hard Reset Redux coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Uh, Seto Corsa on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And...

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Daydreamer Weekend Edition on Xbox One.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That is it.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Alright, well, it's a pretty slow week in Japan this week.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
There's really only one release I can find and it's on, believe it or not, the PlayStation Vita.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's a Taisho Alice All-In-One.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
It's coming out this week on the 2nd of June.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
And that's really it for Japanese release dates this week.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Loki, er, excuse me, Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Sorry, when you guys get so angry, I confuse the two of you so easily.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Girl.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
One thing.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
On, uh, the 31st, Oxenfree Director's Cut.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Didn't they already release that?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Uh, Oxenfree they did, but I'm assuming this is some type of-

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Is it worth having a Director's Cut? It sounds so weird.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Um, the game has a neat kind of story to it.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Um, I played it a little bit on Xbox One.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
It's, it's, it's neat.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I, it, I don't know what that means.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
If that means there's extra screens, if there's commentary.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I don't know, it depends how much they're asking for it and, you know.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Please give us money.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Please. Please give us money.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I say it depends on who the director is.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I mean, if it's Michael Bay or Uwe Boll, I'm in.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I think the good news is it's neither of them.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Oh, okay.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
For what it's worth.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Alright, then, then maybe I'm in.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But first, Loki.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So, Sony has sold 40 million copies, or over 40 million units, I should say, of the PlayStation 4.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It is the fastest selling console in PlayStation history.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And they are also saying their software sales have hit over 270 million units.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And that's counting retail and digital.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And that's, um, as of May 22nd.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Uh, also kind of neat, uh, Uncharted 4 has sold 2.7 million copies in the first week.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
So, it's doing pretty good. I guess people like the game.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And, of course, it's not the greatest first-party game that they've had.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Um, of course, Last of Us sold 3.4 million copies in its first three weeks.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So, actually, maybe it is the top one that they've had.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Because that's three weeks, not one.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Hmm. Interesting.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
People like it.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
See, that deserves, like, a mov-

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Well, actually, I think they are making a movie of that.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Uncharted?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Uh, it's like one of those movies in development hell or what have you.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Why? Okay, well, maybe I would be fine if it's in development hell as long as it doesn't come out like Assassin's Creed.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Which does not look good.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Is there even a teaser for that yet?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Oh, yes there is.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Oh, I've seen the poster. I didn't see the teaser.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Assassin's Creed where they thought, hey, you know what's cool?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
People really like the modern-day portion of Assassin's Creed.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.000
You know, um, games, not necessarily the part where there's actually all the action and story where they go back in the past.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Let's cover more of the modern portion of that.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
That's gonna be the majority of the movie.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Alright, well, one more story before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And, uh, I know Loki is really excited about the upcoming release Mighty No. 9.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Um, perhaps, Loki, you saw the new trailer this week.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Oh, yes.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
The Master Class trailer. What'd you think of the trailer?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I thought it looked crap.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Yeah, and-

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And it didn't help the snarky commentary over it.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Apparently, a lot of people felt it was crap, including the CEO of the co-developer of the game.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Takuya Aizu actually wrote a tweet that said, what the hell was censored censored, but it's very clear it says Deep Silver, thinking making a crappy PV, promotional video, like this.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Unforgivable.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Yes, I think, I think the quality quote that everybody can take away from this is that it'll have you crying like an anime fan on prom night.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Like, thank you, you fucking asshole.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I mean, I don't take that personally offensive because I'm not a huge anime fan, but jeez, way to piss on, way to piss on all your fans.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I mean, that's just like, hey, hey, people that backed us, fuck you. Fuck you all, because fuck you, that's why.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yeah, I'm not sure, um, who allowed that to go through, but unfortunately-

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
What the fuck were they thinking? I mean, seriously, how is that, like, shouldn't that be like one of like the first rules?

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Hmm, maybe we should insult our fucking audience.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000
So can I, can I admit to something? I never watched the trailer for this. Do you, do you think I should watch it now?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yeah, you should, let's do it.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Dark Sakura, have you seen this trailer?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
No.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Would you like to watch it now?

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I can't really see it from here, so I'll listen to it.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
This is rated E for everyone, just as cartoon violence.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.000
This is all pretty typical.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Hey, you, look at the screen. Let me ask you a question. Do you like awesome things that are awesome?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Then you gotta play this game, dude. It's friggin' cool and crazy addictive, like popping bubble wrap addictive. Check this out.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Okay, well, to be fair, pa- popping bubble wrap is really addictive.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Also, this is clearly not the guy from the, uh, the, the video trailer thing that they were saying.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:46.000
But, when you're try- okay, here's the first issue I'm gonna take with this trailer, is that when you're reminding me that popping bubble wrap may be more fun and cheaper than playing your game, that's not quite the best angle to take.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Is this like a new type of millennial marketing that they're doing now?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Also, I can't remember the last time bubble wrap was delayed.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Well, they gotta- they gotta take time to fill it all up with air. Artisan bubble wrap.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
That is true.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Each bubble hand-filled.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
By millennials.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
With the breath of angels.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Wait, hold on, here, moving on.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.000
See, that's your dash move. There's a short dash, long dash, jump dash, spiral, slide. There's probably a dash that makes you breakfast, I don't know.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Great idea- wait, what?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Point is, you're dashing around like a friggin' moon man and I love it.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Oh, and look at this. There's all these combo moves you can do, then you can do combos on combos to rack up your score.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And I know you like that combo on combo action.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
What?

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
But I saved the best for last. Absorption boost.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
That sounds more like it.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:49.000
You kill an enemy and you can absorb their power ups. Stuff that'll make you faster and stronger and make the bad guys cry like an anime fan on prom night.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So what do you think? You ready to play?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I'm ready.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
No one's talking to you, Vernon.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Mighty number nine.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Um, that sucked.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
It's just stupid. I'm not mad about it. It's just stupid.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Yeah, I agree.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Although I like what Stoppy says, cry like an anime fan without his body pillow waifu.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
It's silly.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
By the way, big shout out to everybody at Fanime this weekend. I don't know why but I'm just reminded. Big shout out to everybody at Fanime this weekend.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
That was just... no.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Why is it like, who gives a shit?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I need distractions from that thing.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Why do they need to fucking commentate over that? Why is it like, who gives a shit? You got dash attacks and an absorption move and you get combos.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Absorption moves? Sign me the fuck up.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Dashing combos and something that can gain power ups with? Wow, way to list the features of every fucking game that's in that genre.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I don't know if they had combo on combo action in those other ones though.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I ate combos the other day, does that count?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Why didn't he fucking just like, seriously they skirted around these fucking memes like shit. Why didn't he just say, yo dawg I hear you like combos.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I mean seriously just step it up a bit instead of...

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
You're writing stuff. You're deep silver writing stuff folks.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Somebody thought it was funny.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, Mighty No. 9 already has a lot of shit thrown at it. It really didn't need it from their own camp.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Yeah, I think that's kind of what it boils down to.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
It's like, now it's like, it's starting to feel like the showgirls of video games.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Like there's just a point where they started marketing it as camp, you know?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And like, how did it happen? I mean seriously it's like, fuck yes it's a Mega Man game.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
We've been fucking rooting for a Mega Man game, but now you know what?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
The guy that's making Mega Man, he left Capcom because they wouldn't fucking make a Mega Man game.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
He's going to make a Mega Man game, but it's not going to be called Mega Man.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:13.000
What happened between that time and now? Because what the fuck is that game?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I mean it just doesn't look that interesting anymore.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Drugs. Allegedly.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
You know what that trailer says? You don't know shit.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You know what I feel like they need to do?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I feel like it doesn't matter what the trailer was, there were going to be people that gave it crap.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
They just need to release the freaking game already.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
June 21st.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I wanted him to drag out his explanation of what happened with the enemies and how it made him cry.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Just in case if anybody didn't get the reference, he should have been like, you know, makes them cry like anime fans on prom night.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Get it? Because they're single. Because they don't leave the house. Because they're nerdy and nobody likes them.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I mean, just in case you're catching the reference here, I mean, they're basically sexless virgins.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm just trying to make sure that you understand that.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Mighty number nine.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I think low keys should just market video games for a living.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
How bad do you hate yourself? You'll love this game.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And I'm glad that... Oh, no. I'm not even going to give it any attention. I'm just... I'm done.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
All right. Let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
It's not Halo.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
We're going to go to a time when you didn't have these YouTube commercials promoting games.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
You had a magazine ad that didn't make any fucking sense at all.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Or the ad had like paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs of shit.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Actual shit.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Actual shit.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It's the classic game...

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Built into the ink.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Classic game of the week.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:49.000
And Dark Sakura is... She's got, I think, a little deep into the archive this week to find one.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
It's another one I've always wanted to play and never got around to.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
All right. So Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I love what a spiteful bitch the designer is, or the producer was.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:08.000
The game is D, or as it was called in Japan, D no Shokutak, the table of D.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
It is a psychological horror puzzle adventure game.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
It was developed by Warp and produced by Kenji Eno.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000
It was first released for 3DO in 1995.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:28.000
And then it came out later on Sega Saturn on the Sony Playstation and MS-DOS.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And it was the first in its series.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So D is basically a story of a lady who goes in to look at a hospital after finding that her dad's a serial killer, pretty much.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Well, not a serial killer, but more like a homicidal mass murderer.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And then he barricaded himself inside.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000
But once she gets in, it turns into a castle and she has to explore through it to find her father.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
It is very violent and very creepy.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I mean, I would even say that some of the psychological shit in this game borders on Silent Hill levels.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I mean, if not worse.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And the thing about how this game got released is what makes me love it.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Basically, the whole storyline and everything, and it was so explicit for what it was, that Eno decided to bypass the censorship committee by submitting a clean version.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So that he could get the publisher to give approval on it late in the development cycle.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And that he had to, of course, hand deliver the master to the manufacturer.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
So he switched the disk.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Yep.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
And the master had, of course, the more disturbing content.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It sold over a million copies in Japan.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
It was pretty successful.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Not so successful in the US.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.000
But part of that had to do with how Sony handled it.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Basically, Sony told them that there would be a certain number of copies produced.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:26.000
And what happened instead is that they ended up getting half the amount produced because Sony gave manufacturing priority to other titles.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
And so basically...

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I just want to call out real quick.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
The audio in this is very ambient.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
So you'll just get these random noises.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
We are looking at a video of the game in action, though, here in studio.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Just for the listeners.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:48.000
So basically, he got pretty much revenge on Sony by saying that the subsequent games were Sega exclusives.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:59.000
So the games that followed were Enemy Zero and D2, which Enemy Zero was also on Saturn and D2 was on Dreamcast.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And they had the same digital actress as they phrased it.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Although it's a different character in each game.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:15.000
So as you go through the game, you have different puzzles to solve.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And actually, even a time limit.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:25.000
So basically, you have to get everything solved within two hours of the game.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Plus, you have a particular time that you have to confront the main bad being her dad.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So you get different endings.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:48.000
You have the time-lapse ending, which if you go after the two hours, the other world closes off and you have to go back to the real world.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And then it says, out of time, please try again.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
You have the bad ending, which I'm not going to go into, which is really gross.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:01.000
You have the good ending and then you have the best ending, which if you look at scarabs all over the place, you get the best ending.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000
And the game has two characters completely, Lara and her dad.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:21.000
So the development of the game is, they actually were developing this in 1994 through the 3DO and had three Amiga computers to work with.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:29.000
And managed to get full CGI cutscenes and full visuals into this game.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Which, for its time, this really, really was no mean feat.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:43.000
So it was pretty, pretty awesome in Japan, like I said.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000
All three editions that were released in Japan were localized for US and Europe.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000
And see, I'd like to read this because this is actually the phrasing from Enno about what happened.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:04.000
So when I released D on PlayStation, the people gathered orders for 100,000 units, but Sony had given other titles manufacturing priority.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:12.000
So Sony told me that they only manufactured 40,000 units, but then in the end, they had only manufactured 28,000 units, which is very bad.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.000
So the sales people had gotten 100,000 preorders from retailers, but Sony wasn't able to manufacture all of them.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I was very pissed about that because one title like that for a small company is very important.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
If that game doesn't sell well, that's very bad for the company.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And so, revenge!

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.000
They actually did, there was another game, which is actually the game I've been trying and trying and trying to think of the name of.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
It's the game that fucking came with seeds.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Real Sound Cause No Regret, which is an all sound audio adventure for Dreamcast.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:50:00.000
It came with seeds and it was actually a game manufactured with the blind in mind or, you know, people who had some kind of vision impairment because you would play it all with audio cues.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
So that was the other game I was thinking of.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.000
There's also another rare addition called Dee's Diner Director's Cut.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:22.000
It has other sequences in it and other trailers, a sound novel that talks about Lara's family, and then a mini disc that had different tracks from the Dee soundtrack on it.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And then in the good ending, you actually get a longer trailer for the original version of Dee 2, which started off as a 3DO game and then was completely scrapped and reworked for the Dreamcast.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:43.000
So, the game scored pretty well.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Sega Saturn Magazine gave it an 83 saying that it was extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:06.000
It was pretty well received all over the place and they said that it was even better than some of the other puzzler adventure games because it had a really enticing story.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And the full motion video graphics were pretty hardcore for the game.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Game Informer even said that it was magnificent in storytelling, but the gameplay was a little tedious.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
So the story would make a great movie or book, but not a game.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
And like I said, it sold a million copies in Japan, so that's it.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Dee.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Which I know I got a copy of this somewhere in my house.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
This looks pretty intense and gross.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Yeah.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
But there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Dee.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Simply the letter.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
There it is on the Sega Saturn.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:51.000
We are going to take a quick break and come back with the second half of our show, but before we go to break, I know it's about 8 o'clock here on the west coast and you guys actually have to drive back to San Francisco tonight.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
So you're going to go ahead and say goodbye to us now.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
YBoyArt, it was so great to have you here.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
It was great to be here.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Amy as well, I apologize for all the millennial jokes.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
You don't.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
You're right, I don't.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000
But a very happy wedding and honeymoon to you both and congratulations Mazel Tov, all that good stuff.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
You need to play happy wedding during the break.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Maybe I will.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
But good luck with making the games.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I look forward to multitasking whenever that happens.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Awesome.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
You know, don't hurt yourself though trying to get it done. I know you're a one man operation.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Other than looking for a new place to live and other things, yeah, we have nothing going on so I'll be working on it.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Excellent.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And other things and I'll always post to yyrgames.com where the stuff that nobody reads is.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I will be posting regular updates.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And I'm very happy that you could actually be here in studio to actually sit in on an episode of OLR.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I'm really happy that you guys had me.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I actually was writing a review for OLR because I realized I never post a review on iTunes.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
What?

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
We say every week.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
It's fine. I'm just kidding.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:12.000
But I was actually writing a review on the way here on the plane and I said when you listen to a podcast regularly, it feels like you're getting to know the hosts.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:23.000
But with Orange Lounge Radio, you can actually get to know the hosts because of all the different forms of audience participation that you guys trumpet, not just offer.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And well, I guess this is just the ultimate form of audience participation right here.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Here I am sitting in the studio part of the show.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So it was really, really awesome to be here.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Which is almost everyone says when they do cross the line and get to see the studio for the first time, almost everybody says it is not what I thought it would look like.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
You said the same thing.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess I imagine something slightly different, but not too different.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
It works.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Yeah, no, it works.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
It works very well.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Compared to the last space we had, which is the little apartment, this is a dream.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
And the fact that Alan lets me get away with this and have this and do this is amazing.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
There's no longer a show me that sits on your feet, though.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:13.000
No, I do miss that, but I do have a Sanrio that hides in the closet and will come out and scream for treats once the show's done and everybody leaves.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I can vouch for this. We've seen no sign of Sanrio.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000
She's in the closet in the very back bedroom, like the complete opposite corner of the house.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Or under the bed.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
No, I looked when I took a potty break. She's in the closet.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
No offense taken, I would hide from me too.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:41.000
All right, well, again, a big thank you to you, because I know you were coming to San Francisco from some other stuff, but you still took the two-hour drive from Frisco on a busy weekend to be here with us here at OLR, and I really, really deeply appreciate it.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I would do it again. I would do it again.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And you are more than welcome to anytime.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You know what, we'll see if the calendar is kind, because a lot of times we fly back on Sundays.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Sure.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
But if the calendar is kind as it was this time, you know, Memorial Day and all, then maybe we'll do it again.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Well, in the meantime, I look forward to seeing you at MAGFest 2017, which I am fully planning on attending, and that is in part to the constant pressure that folks like you and SSJ100Matt and all the East Coasters put on me, saying, you really need to fucking go to this con already.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I did, and I love it, so I'll see you next year.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000
That's fantastic. Fantastic, absolutely, and it'll be great to have you again.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
All right, look forward to it. YYR, everybody, thank you for being here.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Thanks for having me.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.000
All right, check them out, yyrgames.com, not yyr, yyr.game, but I'll explain that later in the show.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:40.000
All right, we're going to take a quick break. We will be back with more rapid-fire news, the Fuqua Question of the Week, and more when we come back, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 643 of our show, already in progress.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:00.000
YYR has left the building with his new wife, Amy. They're on their way back to San Francisco.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:09.000
But if you're just joining us, be sure at some point to check out the podcast feed for a fun first half of the show, and very explicit, thanks to YYR's filthy mouth, honestly. No, I'm just kidding.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I am loving this thing that I put in my mouth.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Oh, yes, you went and had another one of those donut muffins, didn't you?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Yes, I did, and I really shouldn't because I have a corset to fit in, but I don't care.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
It's a long weekend.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
It tastes like a fucking churro.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I realized during the break, I never did crack open the bottle of wine I was going to have tonight, even though we had the company and everything.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.000
But then I thought, maybe I'll want to go out and play Ingress later, I don't know, so I should probably save the liquor for another week.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I'll wait. Maybe when Shane comes back and I have the sweet wine that he will drink the entire bottle.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
We'll have a fun show that week or something.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But we're having a fun show tonight, aren't we?

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:58.000
One thing I do want to make sure I plug before we get into rapid fire news tonight is that last week on the show, I briefly talked about during my gaming week

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:07.000
that I had ridden the new Mass Effect ride at Great America, Mass Effect New Earth, but I didn't really talk a lot about it because I knew a video was coming.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.000
That video is now up, so if you are not subscribed to our YouTube channel for VOG Network, I would point you in that direction right now.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Head on over to YouTube and look at the VOG Network channel on YouTube, and you can actually see there the most recent video we've posted is myself and, speaking of Shane,

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Shane is there in the video with me doing a review of the Mass Effect New Earth ride at Great America.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
So I'm hoping you guys will all check that out and see what we thought about that ride.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I'll just kind of tell you in a nutshell that I think as a Mass Effect fan, we were kind of hoping for a little more that it did just feel like kind of a generic ride layout sort of thing.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000
It was very kind of Star Tours, but with a lot of the Mass Effect stuff just kind of like shoved into it.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:59.000
But I thought it was very interesting. One thing that doesn't come up in the video, but Alan was telling me that one of his friends went and rode it at Great America,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:07.000
and basically this friend of his doesn't really play video games or understand any of that stuff, and he basically told Alan that I didn't get it at all.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I didn't understand what was happening. I didn't know what was going on. It all went over my head. So kind of interesting.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:22.000
But I don't think the ride was bad by any means. As a Mass Effect fan, you were hoping for a little more, but I guess it's something while we wait for the new game to come out.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:35.000
But if you want to find my full thoughts and Shane's full thoughts, go check out the review on our YouTube channel at VOG Network and some other random stuff from around Great America as well we threw in just for fun.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:43.000
And Bobby's reminding us you want to stay to the very end of the video just because. That's right. We're like a Marvel film at this point.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Stoppy says, just subscribe. Shit, you guys need more subs. Yeah, we do. Thank you for subscribing. I appreciate that.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Granted, we haven't done a whole ton of YouTube content, but it is something you'll notice this year we've probably done way more than we've done any other year,

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:09.000
and that's probably going to be a trend that keeps continuing. Bobby and I are always throwing ideas out there. Just you wait for Dragon Con. That's going to be one big one for sure.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:21.000
So anyhow, let's move on. We've got to get to some rapid fire news, Fugu Quest of the Week, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype in just a little while. But first, rapid fire news. Loki.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:29.000
So there was a trailer that was, or I should say an announcement, that Dragon Quest Builders will be coming to North America this fall.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:40.000
And if you're not familiar with Dragon Quest Builders, it's kind of like a voxel survival game, much like Minecraft, but with a lot of RPG elements because it is Dragon Quest.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:54.000
It looks interesting. I'm not sure if it's like tower defense as well, but it looks like you do end up building some different towns and stuff and exploring right at my wheelhouse, so you may have to check it out.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:04.000
So that should be coming around this fall to console, I'm assuming. And then they've announced the games with gold for June.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:16.000
So if you have an Xbox One or Xbox 360 with Xbox Live Gold, then you're able to get these games. Goat Simulator for Xbox One, and that's going to be the full month of June 1st through June 30th.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And then the crew will be available from the later half of the month to the second or the half of July. So that's from June 16th to July 15th.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:39.000
And then on Xbox 360, Super Meat Boy, as well as XCOM Enemy Unknown, and that's going to be available. Super Meat Boy the first half of the month, XCOM the second half.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.000
No word on PlayStation yet, so it'll be interesting what's coming out for them.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And then finally, there's going to be a new expansion coming to Grand Theft Auto Online for Grand Theft Auto 5. It's the Crime Boss, I guess, was it Future Adventures in Finance and Felony.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So you can actually be like a crime boss in this. You're able to basically have underlings that can go do different missions for you.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:17.000
So whether that be to like, you know, ship drugs or to, I don't know, kill people, you can do that.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:24.000
You also get a special high rise office or special warehouse that you can base your central command out of.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:35.000
And that'll be coming, I guess, 2016, June 7th. So, I don't know, maybe I'll have to check it out.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Alright, going to get sucked back into Grand Theft Auto all over again.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I mean, I kind of wish I would, but I haven't yet.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Alright, let's talk about DJ Max Encore. Yeah, another DJ Max game, which I believe, didn't we just talk about a PlayStation 4 release of DJ Max last week? I think we did.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Now we also have a DJ Max Encore apparently on the way for the Nintendo 3DS.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:06.000
And this is something that's being shown from Rising Star Games at London's MCM Comic Con. They actually have it all set up.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:14.000
What's interesting about it though is it's on a new 3DS. Oh god, I hope this doesn't end up being a new 3DS exclusive or I'll be really upset.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:20.000
But yeah, that's something that's being shown at the London Comic Con that's going on right now.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Apparently the top screen is used for the background animation and video playing, but the notes and details are on the lower screen, which you use left, up, and right, and Y, X, and A to hit the notes in the different lanes.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000
So, DJ Max fans, I'm sure will be happy about that.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:43.000
For those of you that are Wii U owners and are big fans of Virtual Console, you'll probably be excited to know that Star Tropics is now available on the Virtual Console.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Star Tropics is available for $4.99 on the Wii U. It just came out this past week.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:58.000
I believe they also said that Star Tropics 2, which was a little more rare because it came out so late in the life of the NES. Most people had moved on to Super Nintendo at that point.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Star Tropics 2 is forthcoming, but for now you have the original Star Tropics, which is one of the few NES cartridges that I own. I actually picked that up at a flea market not even, what, six months ago.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.000
So I love Star Tropics, so I'm very excited to see that that has made its way to the Wii U.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Sadly, without the letter that you dip into the water.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:28.000
But, from what I remember of the game's release on the Wii Virtual Console, the code you need is in the online manual, so don't forget to check there.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Or, it's pretty much all over the internet. Or, it's 747.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Alright, moving on. Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens has announced its season pass.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And usually when you hear about season passes, you go, oh god, how much more money am I going to have to dump on this game, paying $100 when the game releases.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Well, guess what? There's some good news. Even though, yes, Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens does have a season pass, it's only going to be a $10 season pass.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Which is much more realistic and, you know, exciting, I guess, to talk about, because with the $10 season pass will be three level packs and five character packs.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:22.000
If you want to wait and buy it individually, the level packs will be $3 each. So, you know what? Compared to the $50 season passes, the $40 season passes, I'll take it.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
So there you go. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Well, we have some Hello Kitty stuff. Yes, Hello Kitty is coming to Mario Maker.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Yeah. I'm going to leave that there.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Um, Zelda for Wii U will be playable at the Nintendo New York store during E3 for about 500 people.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:54.000
So, Ronchon, get on it. Play it, take video, let me know how it is. Or send me a plane ticket.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And then, um, Mirror's Edge. It's going to be getting a TV series. So, it could be good, it could not be good, but there'll be lots of parkour.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:17.000
And it will, uh, uh, let's see if we've got a date on it. Not a date on it, but hey, we'll see what happens.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.000
You know what's good, though, is the, uh, Church's song from the new Mirror's Edge game. It's really, really good.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Totally good.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
So, check that out, if nothing else.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Okay, let's get to the foogle question of the week. Um, if I could play the right song for the foogle question of the week.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Ah, you gotta love live radio. Mistakes and all, right?

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Alright, anyway, for our foogle question of the week this week. You know, you've probably heard about the explicit creations of the internet involving Overwatch that Blizzard is trying to shut down.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
We talked about it here earlier on the show. It was a lot of fun.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Ah, this had us thinking about internet creations, but of the G-rated variety, okay, because there's a lot of good stuff that comes from video games.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:17.000
So, what do you think is a great fan creation that has come from a video game? Like a remix, or a fanfic, a parody Twitter.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
You know, there's tons of fan things that come up from video games. What do you like?

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
So, ah, we're gonna go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities to, ah, get some answers.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And Rettertainment starts us off saying, a video game fan video that stands out in my mind is the Dead Fantasy series, as well as Haloid put out by the recently departed Monty Oum.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
May he rest in peace.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Fat Cylon replied over on Twitter saying, there's a video of a male Miranda from Mass Effect boning Edie. Now that's art.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Have you seen that one Dark Sakura? Yeah, neither have I. I think I skipped that.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Our old pal DMN is out there and said, Orange Lounge Revolution.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:08.000
That was, do you remember that? When they did like a step mania pack that actually had all these inside joke songs from the show.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Including, um, God that remix of you just saying rah rah rah rah rah rah over and over like Max 300.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Yes, I remember.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Somebody actually made DDR steps to that.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Yes.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Yes.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I remember.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
I remember as well.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Ray Jeneater says, I don't know if it qualifies as G-rated since there's the occasional swearing, but my personal favorite fan creation is Red vs. Blue, created by Roosterteeth, used in the Halo games.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Each video is short, but each is funny as hell and when watched in order, they tell a fairly decent overarching storyline.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
That's gone from fan creation to like Media Empire, right?

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
They've had a very long running podcast, if I'm not mistaken, and they're doing all sorts of videos.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
They have Ruby.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Yeah, so they're, they're busy bees over there.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
So yeah, but interesting to note how like a fan thing can go so big.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Very, very good point.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:08.000
William Murderface says, there are a lot of Pokemon ROM hacks that are very well done and completely change the game.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:14.000
If I had to just choose one thing though, it would be the Sonic Twitter, which is hilarious.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Is that really a fan thing though? Don't they, isn't that like a verified account?

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I think it's verified.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Yeah, so it's not, I mean, but still it's hilarious. Don't get me wrong.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
It's so good, it could be a fan one.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I guess that's true.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
So, all right, there it is.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000
We didn't really get any questions or answers on Google Plus this week, but I know it was a, it was a trickier question.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.000
But remember, if you want to answer the Fugu question of the week, you should friend us on Facebook.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always circle us on Google Plus.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Yes, there are still some people on Google Plus.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000
What about you guys? Any fan creations that you guys are fans of from video games?

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I'll take the easy way out. I'm going to say podcasts.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Come on, podcasts. This is a great, you know, not just us, but there's podcasts that really focus on like one particular game series and really dive into like all the specifics about it.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.000
So I guess I'm, I'm taking the cheesy answer, but it's true. I'm inspired by the other podcasts I listen to.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Darsakra? Loki?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I would say for series that maybe are not fully developed are, I'd say directed toward one series.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Because, I mean, I really liked VG Cats.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:33.000
The web comic would touch on different video game series and dedicate, you know, panels to it.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
I mean, you can even look at Homestuck itself as an homage to the entire genre.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Yeah, Homestuck is, or not Homestuck, you know what I was thinking, not Homestuck.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Homestar Runner.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Homestar Runner.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Is I'm thinking is kind of like,

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Homestar Wanna.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:59.000
It was kind of like a parody of like a lot of like internet culture, but then became a game meta.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
But Homestuck also is sort of the same way too.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
That's true.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Even going back into the old school like DOS games and text adventures.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Isn't it trying to become a game too?

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Yeah, Hive Bents already in production.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I was going to say maybe, I don't know, I can't really, there's so many things, a lot of the mods and stuff,

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
but the only thing that came to my mind was dorkly.com.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I love their videos with different games.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
It's a little Mario videos.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And Tiger Claw brings up VG Cats.com. We didn't even talk about comics.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000
That's what I just said.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Oh, herp derp. Sorry.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
You can tell I'm multitasking behind the scenes here.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
So, all right, well, let's move on.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Let's get into some more news stories, starting with Loki.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
All right, let's.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
So this is kind of neat.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
They're adding a new mode to Minecraft.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:55.000
And this is kind of, I guess, taking some hints from different mods that people have made on the PC versions.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:06.000
So a lot of the things that are popular on YouTube right now with Minecraft mods are a lot of these Sky Wars or Hunger Games type mods.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
So this one now is going to be this Minecraft battle.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
And it's kind of like a Hunger Games type experience.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:21.000
There's going to be maps that, set maps that they have that you can play on that, of course, you can buy more map packs later on for $3.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Unfortunately, you can't make your own maps, which is kind of stupid because it is Minecraft.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
And fuck, I mean, that's kind of what you do.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
But that's how they're treating it on console.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And I guess it makes sense if you want to actually, like, be able to sync up with people to play.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000
You kind of need to be all on the same type of maps.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
So, whatever.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000
But it is going to be something that's coming to all the console versions in June.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000
And they're going to have a few different maps that are going to be available when it launches.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
But, yeah, it sounds just like the Hunger Games type maps I've seen.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000
And so, I'm down. I mean, that sounds kind of fun.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
That'd be kind of fun vault game night type thing.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Yeah, I'm curious about this.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.000
And I like that they're still breathing life into this game that is, you know, pretty freaking old at this point, to be quite honest.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Yeah, kind of funny that you see them selling map packs for Minecraft.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Hey, let's get in on that DLC.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Alright, well, let's move on to a story about Street Fighter 2.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000
That's right, the old school Street Fighter 2.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Well, have you ever, like, watched, really watched the opening of Street Fighter 2?

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:39.000
And you might remember that in the very beginning of Street Fighter 2, on the title screen, there's, like, these two people that are fighting each other.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
One kind of punches the other in the face, then it pans up, you know, Street Fighter 2.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
We always thought they were two guys from the first Street Fighter.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Right, and that's actually a common urban legend.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.000
And the fact is, those guys don't actually exist in Street Fighter 2.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Like, they didn't use characters that were actually in the game.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:04.000
But, yeah, there's a popular fan fic, or whatever you want to say, is that they were actually characters from the original Street Fighter game.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Especially since they look just like them.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Well, here's what's interesting. Capcom has confirmed that these two fighters that are in the crowd at the beginning are Max and Scott.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:21.000
And they've actually given them bios with Street Fighter 5 logos.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Could these characters be DLC in Street Fighter 5?

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Kind of going back and revisiting these two characters that have been a part of Street Fighter lore without necessarily being in the game.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Here's the barrel. Here's the bottom. We're scraping it.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Oh, I thought you were going to actually say, here's the barrel, because there was that one bonus level in Street Fighter 2 where you actually broke barrels.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:52.000
It should be the car. We'll go the whole fighter's megamix round, or, fighter megamix way and just have the actual car and the barrels be.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000
I'm sorry, then again, then we'd be playing Tekken, I guess, at that point.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Well, the car and the barrels did come back in Street Fighter 4. I don't know if you remember that.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
But the whole bonus round in Street Fighter 4 is that. So, there is that, for what it's worth.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Kaijuto in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, these guys look too dorky to be real Street Fighters.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Well, they can be a little dorky and still be muscley and someone you don't want to punch you in the face.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
They're more Fight Club than Street Fighter, to be honest.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Ah, I like that comparison. That's kind of dorky.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Well, there's a game that, well, it was an April Fool's joke, really.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
It was called Catgirl Without Salad.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000
And it was supposed to be, as they said, a game that combines elements from several gaming genres,

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000
including puzzler, platformer, shmup, action shooter, adventure strategy, fighting rhythm, arcade horror,

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
tactical RPG, TPS, RTS, and visual novel.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Of course, it was an April Fool's joke.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:02.000
But, thanks to the Humble Monthly Bundle, it's going to be a real game and included with it for those who are subscribing.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:13.000
So, yeah, the joke with its massive, well, it's a decent sized fandom, is going to be true, thanks to WayForward and Humble Bundle.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:19.000
So, if you beg for something enough on the internet, sometimes you'll get what you want.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Not that that should encourage everybody, but there you go.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000
You know what even gets you what you want quicker? Start a petition.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Yeah, go to change.org immediately.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Change.org, real change is happening there.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
That's right, real change.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Out of curiosity, do they have statistics on how many changes they've actually made?

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Has anything actually changed from change.org?

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Sometimes it's hard to say.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Well, I always get change.org confused with the White House petition website, which is technically different.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.000
But the White House does respond, I guess they have to or whatever, to anything that gets above.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I think they had to change the number. I think it was 25,000 signatures at one point, but they bumped that up because something really stupid got through.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Death Star.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Was that it? Like, build a Death Star?

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
That was one of them.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.000
So something really stupid got through is they bumped it up to 100,000 on the White House site.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Alright, that'll stop them.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Yeah, that'll teach them.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000
The internet, there's not 100,000 people on here.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Yeah.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Alright, let's move on, Loki.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:36.000
So, kind of going back to how we were talking about rumors about new Microsoft consoles, here's something that maybe has been leaked out by the ESA.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:44.000
According to E3 2016's official website, there is a category for Xbox One virtual reality.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.000
But what? They haven't talked about Xbox One virtual reality. That's not a thing.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Could it be now? Could it be that this is an announcement? Or could it be just someone boned it so bad that they think that the Sony system is an Xbox One?

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Who knows?

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
To be fair, a lot of people have called HoloLens VR.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.000
People have called it that, even though it's augmented reality and there's a difference.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:19.000
But let's be real, most people that aren't necessarily tech-oriented, although you would expect E3 would be tech-oriented, but considering they use Alexa rankings to...

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
You know what? I'm not going to go down that road.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:30.000
But, yeah, I mean, I think it's more that mistake, that somebody is just simply thinking HoloLens is VR when it's really not.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I don't think so, but included on the list of companies, there's actually some third-party companies that are listed under that category.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Maximum Games, Rebellion, Readily Information Company, which that's a stupid name, and 3D Rudder.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.000
So, of course, Maximum Games, they have the farming simulator and WRC series.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Rebellion is the team behind Battlezone 98 Redux and the Sniper Elite series.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000
And then 3D Rudder, who the fuck knows that? It's a controller for your feet.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I would expect that maybe Microsoft is going to step it up with the HoloLens, that maybe that's something...

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
No. I think they're going to just add Oculus support.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
It's ready to go. HoloLens is not ready to go.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000
HoloLens, also on top of that, is fucking expensive. Well, the dev kit's fucking expensive.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.000
So, I don't think that HoloLens is going to be it. I think that it's going to be Oculus support.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:29.000
That would certainly be another feather in Oculus' cap that it would work on Xbox and PC.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Right. And, I mean, yeah, definitely that does, for me, that's like, oh, hey, I could use this on a console that I don't own, or PC I don't own that runs the spec.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:47.000
So, I mean, it's still, though, if I do end up having one of those, then that's kind of a nice thing. I don't know.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:57.000
A HoloLens would be nice at some point, once it gets down to the price point that I want it to be, and it's actually operating how they show the videos show it.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Not that little, like, tiny little window inside it.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000
All right. Well, there are more websites out there with more names than you might be used to.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I think everybody's kind of used to the fact that, like, almost everything out there is dot com, dot com.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Dot com is, like, synonymous with the web, even though surely there are sites that are dot net, dot gov, dot org.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:25.000
You know, we're used to a little bit some of these other ones, but there is even more out there now.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:32.000
The people that run these different top-level domains and so forth, this got opened up some time ago, right?

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000
And now you have more stuff. Like, I think a controversial one was dot xxx, right?

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Well, that was a long time ago.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:45.000
It was a little while ago, but they just recently opened up to the public dot game.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:51.000
It joined some other custom domains that have just, that have been opening up the past couple of years.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Dot beer, dot NYC, and so forth. So, dot game is now available.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Now, we were joking a little bit about this with YYR while he was here because he was actually looking up,

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
oh, how much would it cost me to register YYR dot game?

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Because usually, you can get a domain, like a dot com, you can get a dot com up and running for, like,

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Ten bucks.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Yeah, ten bucks, fifty bucks tops, right? Depending on what site you go through.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Okay, for Aaron to get YYR dot game was, like, sixteen hundred dollars.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Because I guess dot game, well, A, that's a three letter domain name, so it's considered premium.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000
And dot game is considered some type of premium domain.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:36.000
So, even for him to get YYR games dot game was, like, four hundred bucks.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Even to get a site like you just lost the dot game, which we have joked about getting,

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000
which now some asshole who hears this is going to get it, who has more money than we do.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:50.000
But that site's going to set you back three hundred fifty, four hundred bucks, depending on what service you go through.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
So, I mean, these are premium prices for this.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Apparently, early access opened up last week, and almost every major studio,

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Nintendo, EA, Microsoft, Blizzard, Starcraft, Diablo for those Blizzard properties and so forth,

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
have all been snatched up as part of this.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:18.000
And I have to admit, I'm kind of confused why, because I don't think a website dot game,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:25.000
like, you know, go to Blizzard dot game, I don't think it really has that same effect that dot com has in our culture.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
We're not at that level where we just hear dot and we think, oh, it's the web.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
You know what I mean? Does that make sense?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Yeah.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I kind of think, like, if we were to go out, oh, our website is Nintendo dot game, like, people are...

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Thank god they don't have emojis in URLs yet.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Dot poop emoji.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Yeah, it's not poop emoji.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Hey, Bobby, can we register vog dot poop emoji?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:58.000
But enough people out there have a hard time remembering that if you want the White House's website,

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:04.000
you got to go to whitehouse dot gov, because if you go to whitehouse dot com, I think it's porn, or it's something else now.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It used to be, I think.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
It used to be porn, but I think it's something else now.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:12.000
So, I mean, you know, people have a hard time remembering that type of stuff.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Let's find out.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, pod culture started as a dot net until I was finally able to snatch it when a squatter let it lapse.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Yeah.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Brad from Pod Culture also suggests buying just tooka dot poop.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Why not?

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Yeah, whitehouse dot com, it goes to nothing.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Just a squatter website now, right?

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Just basically a page with the White House on it, but yeah, it doesn't go anywhere.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
It's not the actual White House website, so.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Redertainment in Chat says, why are they selling it? Because people will buy it.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Yeah, and these websites aren't cheap.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I almost feel like Nintendo and all these companies kind of got fleeced out of 300 bucks a pop for these domains.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Did they actually register that?

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Yeah.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I'm never using that URL. I'm just saying.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I know, because everybody's so used to dot com.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Nintendo has Nintendo dot com. It's just, I don't know, it just seems a little weird.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I have darksakura.com and I'm happy with that.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Yeah, I mean, you know, unfortunately, I don't think we were able to get vog.com or even, I don't know if we have vog.net.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I don't think we do, because obviously a three letter domain is going to be very, very, very hard to get.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.000
So, but I believe there is now a dot network, so I don't know.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
But you know, you know.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Vog.net is for sale.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Yeah, gee, how convenient.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:41.000
But I think, you know, we've just marketed it as vognetwork.com and people kind of get that if you say it enough times.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:48.000
You know, we don't have to necessarily have all these other website names except for, because of Travis Donovan,

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:53.000
when Understadation Live, rest in peace, was on the air, he always used to say the vognetwork.com.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:58.000
And so Bobby actually went and registered the vognetwork.com.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
But I think he finally let that lapse.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:03.000
So, alright.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Anyway, we're going to move on.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
I don't think we'll be registering any game domains anytime soon.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Not at that price.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Maybe the price will come down once the new car smell wears off, I don't know.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
But certainly not now, that's for damn sure.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
We are going to get to the mailbag.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Or we would get to the mailbag.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000
But, unfortunately...

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
I think it's dead.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Yeah, DarkSakura went into the mailbag and found that it's...

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I'm checking it again.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Empty.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Unless YYR made good on his threat to email us.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Yeah, there's one.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Oh, is it from YYR?

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Yeah.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Of course it is.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Hello, LR, this is me, talking to myself.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Sort of.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Hugs and kisses, Aaron YYR.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Thank you.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Thank you.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Yeah, he overheard me saying earlier in the show the mailbox was empty.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000
So I think he is.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Now it's empty.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000
There it is.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000
You can send us an email if you'd like.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you know, you got to use it.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
So participate at...

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Use your words!

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000
You know what, just send us...

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000
You know what you could do?

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Write an X-rated fanfic starring your favorite video game characters.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.000
No.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
They do that anyway.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.000
I thought you were going to say like starring your favorite hosts and I'm like...

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
No!

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000
No, that's awkward.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Do you know?

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Do not.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Do you know?

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Do you remember Evan?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Of course I do.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
He wrote one.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.000
What?

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I asked very, very, very well worded and to the point, don't put me in it.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Here's what you do to those people that are making those pornographic game fan videos

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
or whatever.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
You just take the people that are making them and you put them in a pornographic fan video

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
that CG created.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
There you go.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
How very meta.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Alright, so...

02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Eye for an eye.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Send us your...

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Send us your mails.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Well, since we didn't get any emails this week, what a...

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Well, I mean, we got one, but come on, he was here.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000
We have a real good excuse to do the FUs of the Week.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:36.000
FU to those delicious, delicious monstrosities in that bag over there.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Oh my God.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yell me out.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Also FU to having to work tomorrow.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Because an FU to getting E6000 stitchless all over my fingers and having to unglue my

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:51.000
fingers.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.000
But it's all worth it for the purse.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
No one can see that.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Well, but you will be planning on walking into a club purse first eventually at some

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000
point.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Yes, I know.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Alright, moving on.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Loki.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
FU not having air conditioning for a week.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Especially now it's getting hot, so we are starting to notice it.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000
There's no real way to cool off the house, so that kind of sucks.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000
But, hopefully, we've got it narrowed down to two people that are going to do the work,

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
and they'll do it on Wednesday, so it won't be much longer.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:29.000
And then FU to these Final Fantasy XI private servers, which are a pain in the ass to get

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
the fucking work.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
It's just...

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I think partially it's Windows 10's problem.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Where it's firewalls like, I know you told me to let them go through, but I'm making

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000
my own decisions.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I'm the grown up here.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:46.000
By the way, just as punishment, I'm going to upgrade your computer again.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I don't, you know, to be honest, I have no problems with Windows 10 aside from the updates

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
where they're just like, eh, we're doing it.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.000
You know, hey, we forced our way onto your system, although I did allow them to.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Because I had Windows 8, and I consider anything other than Windows 8 much better.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000
But, yeah, their updates, it's like, hey, we're just going to do it.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Oh, hey, you're in the middle of something?

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
We're fucking updating.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Alright, my FU of the week.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I don't really have anything.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I mean, I got birthday presents last night.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
How can I be upset?

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
And I've had a pretty kickass weekend, so I can't really be sad.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I guess my FU of the week would go to the fact that I really need to buckle down and dye it.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Like Dark Sakura, I want to fit into a core set by Dragon Con.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:36.000
But, okay, well, maybe it's not really like an actual core set.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
But there might be cosplay I want to do, and I really need to get rid of a little bit of this dad bod.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:46.000
And it is really hard when somebody puts a creme brulee cheesecake slice right down in front of you.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
I mean, just, it's hard.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000
The struggle is real.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
And then now we have donut muffins.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Oh well.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Let's get to a couple more stories, and then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
But first, Loki!

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Something I was hoping that it would actually finally come out at some point.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
And it is!

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Well, at 4, the console mods are coming very soon.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
In fact, Xbox Ones are going to be available on May 31st.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000
And they've already got a cool list of mods that are going to be supported by it, including...

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Well, there's one that you can actually craft cats, and then there's one, apparently, that you can also eat cats.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000
So, it's both.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.000
But yeah, lots of cool mods that you can actually add to the game.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Apparently, though, there's a size limit for the mods you can download.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
It's restricted to 2GB.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And that extends to all mods, even if they're not currently enabled.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
So, lots of cool mods.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.000
I think a lot of them aren't going to be that big in size, but it's nice to see that this is going to be available.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.000
And I'm very excited once PlayStation 4s are going to be available, which is going to be at the end of June.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:09.000
So, that'll probably get me to go back to Fallout, for sure.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.000
I know Alan loves his mods, and he's been playing Fallout 4.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:18.000
But console mods! I mean, come on, this hasn't been done since Unreal 3?

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Or, yeah, Unreal 3, I think, on PlayStation 3, where they enabled console mods on the PlayStation.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I will say that I have managed to mod an Xbox 360 version of Mass Effect.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Not add content, at least, but be able to use content hidden in-game using my save file converter.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Save file modding, right?

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Yeah. But it's all stuff that was just code hidden, but nothing to add to it.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Still poking around where you're not supposed to be.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Well, some people like when you poke them.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000
You can turn dog meat into a feline companion. That's one of the mods.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
You can turn it into a cat.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
This would be called cat gut.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Alright, well, one more story for you guys.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Who's excited about the Warcraft movie coming out on June 10th, I believe, here?

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
A tenth of me is.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:17.000
So, here's the deal. Like a lot of big movies, the movie has already come out overseas.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.000
It's already playing in Europe and some other parts of the world.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000
And with that means some of the critic scores are coming in, and guess what?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:30.000
It's getting dragged. It's not doing very well with the critics.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Apparently, yeah, the critics are not.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Do the critics just not understand it?

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I'm thinking it's something like that. Let's see.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I do want to point out these are not necessarily critics in the UK.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Technically, it's May 30th when it opens, but with the time difference, I think it actually is May 30th over there now.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
So, some of these are from the US.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
But The Wrap gave it one star saying,

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Imagine Battlefield Earth, right there, that's a slam,

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000
without the verve and you get this sludgy, tedious fantasy adventure,

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.000
a fun-starved dud that's not even unintentionally hilarious.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Let's see, Variety, you guys know that publication, right?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Let's see, talking about all the extensive CGI and visual.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000
It's dispiriting to think about the time, energy, planning, and precision that went into Warcraft

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000
when the final product brings to mind those animated advertisements for iPhone games.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Ouch! And the movie doesn't even have Mariah Carey.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I added that part in.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Now, The Guardian gave it two stars saying,

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.000
There's a lot going on and yet we're never quite engaged with it.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000
In Lord of the Rings, we have the Shire, The Hobbit's idyllic pastoral realm

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
as an image of what everyone was fighting for.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Here, we barely see Azeroth outside the Royal Castles and the Wizard's Towers in epic battlegrounds.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
So, apparently it's not doing so well.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
But, critics!

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Do they really know what they're talking about? Not necessarily.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:13.000
But, I think we're all setting the bar pretty low right now if we're gonna spend the money to go see the movie.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
We'll see.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Alright, what do you guys think? Should we open up the Skype line? I think we should.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Tigerclaw actually mentions here,

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Obviously, these critics have never played the games.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:33.000
To be fair, if the movie is to be successful, they will need to lure in an audience that has never played the games.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
There's only so many people that have played the games.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Which is what? Okay, granted, it's 13 million worldwide, but, you know, at 15 bucks a movie ticket.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Okay, well, I mean...

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000
It's still only gonna be less than 200 million.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000
That's cool, and 13 million people worldwide, then I hope that those people actually go see the movie then.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
If that's what they're banking on it to be successful.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Which they may or may not. We'll see.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.000
And, we're getting a call right now, so let's get to it.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Hi, this is Ragenator.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Hi, Ragenator. How's it going? Nice mod you're using to call us, by the way.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Where Ragenator is appearing as a dragon, which I've seen that thing on...

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Tiger Claw uses that, too. I've seen that on Steam.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Yeah, it's Facebook, actually. It's one of the few apps I've bought through there.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Yeah, it's cute. What's on your mind tonight?

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Just a totally random question.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Now, I can't speak for the rest of the audience, but I know at least the three of you tend to hit...

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:46.000
...play and buy games through multiple storefronts on PC, be it Steam, obviously, Origin, or what have you.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And, now that being said, I think the two most popular ones out there right now happen to be Steam, obviously, and God.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:07.000
And one thing I've noticed is that there's a certain amount of overlapping what games are being sold on both platforms.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:17.000
And I was wondering, do the three of you have a hard time picking which platform to buy the games on for one reason or another?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:27.000
To give an example, Steam is notorious for the sales, and they also make it easy to download and install mods.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Whereas, GOG tends to have digital access and the Steam versions of a given game may not necessarily have.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Like, for example, soundtracks and whatnot.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Yeah, I gotta admit, it really depends on what's being sold in the package.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.000
That's a big part of it and, of course, the price is big as well.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:54.000
But sometimes, I don't always necessarily see Steam as a store as I necessarily see it as a method of delivery.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:00.000
And what I mean by that is that Steam, in some ways, is trying to be a console experience on your PC.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000
If you boot up big picture mode, that's literally what it is.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
It's a console on your PC. That's what Steam is in a lot of ways.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:14.000
And the reason why I say that is that I also find one store that I use an awful lot that you didn't name is the Humble Store and the Humble Bundle, right?

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
And all that. But what does Humble really give you?

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Steam keys! And what do other places give you, like Amazon and stuff, where I've also bought games?

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Steam keys! So it's interesting that Steam is not always the store as it necessarily is a method of delivery.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:40.000
So I think because Steam has penetrated, like, you know, you don't buy GOG codes on Steam, on Humble Bundle or any of that stuff.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:51.000
I think because Steam has managed to become not just a store but a delivery mechanism, I think that's what's kind of put it out in the lead above some of these other options.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:57.000
But, I mean, I've used others in the past as well. I had used Desura at one point before, well, we all know what happened there.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.000
But I suppose itch.io, or as I call it, itch.io, is starting to fill some of that void a little bit.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:11.000
And then Origin as well, which, you know, I know that website got a lot of shit in the early years, and rightfully so.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.000
But Steam got a lot of shit in the early years, and rightfully so.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:24.000
And Origin's come a long way. I know I'm going to have to suck it up and deal with it if I want to get Mass Effect Andromeda on the PC.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Which seems like, I kind of don't know where I'm at with the Mass Effect thing because, like, I kind of want to get it on PlayStation 4 because all of my, well, PlayStation 4 is kind of my quote-unquote main console now.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:42.000
But I also have an Xbox One, and I did play Mass Effect, the original trilogy, on Xbox 360.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:49.000
I know it's not going to import my saves, so I don't know. I really don't know. I have a lot of questions to answer.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:56.000
But I know that if I do want to get it on PC for the multiplayer, I think that's what's going to come down to. Where are all my friends from multiplayer?

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I'll probably end up having to use Origin.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Now, as a follow-up to what you were saying before, this is kind of a half-question, half-point.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:20.000
But could you make the argument that Cup of Bowls is not really a store per se, because saying that it's a store kind of implies that they're selling you something.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:34.000
They're not so much selling you something as they are taking donations for charity and in turn giving you a thank-you gift in the form of digital books or digital game codes or what have you.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Rage, if we were only considering the side of it that did the bundles, then I would agree.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:45.000
But don't forget that Humble also has a storefront, and you can pick and choose the individual games that you want.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:50.000
And they run their own sales, and I'm giving Humble Bundle my credit card information when I process that.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:57.000
So I think in that regard, and I do think they still give like 10% to charity or something like that.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:04.000
So I mean, yes, there's that going on, but they do have that more traditional storefront in addition to the bundles. Don't forget about that.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Yeah, true. By getting back to my initial question, the best overwhelming majority of my games happen to be through games.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:33.000
God knows my library is kind of all ridiculous, but at the same time, I never noticed that game X, Y, or Z happens to be on good old games.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Even though I already have it on Steam, if I see such and such a game, like let's say just a pixel thing off the top of my head, let's say Out of World Games Odyssey,

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:56.000
I notice that, hey, you know what, this version comes with wallpapers and the soundtrack.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I love video game soundtracks, even though I already got this on Steam, might as well get the God version just for shits and giggles.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Especially if it's only a couple bucks. It makes it very easy to justify that sort of thing.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Exactly. Not only that, but since it's VR on a free, God forbid, my computer takes a nose dye for whatever reason, and I have all my God games backed up onto external hydride, not so much of a problem, you know?

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Yeah. Hey, one other thing I want to throw out there before we let you go, speaking of storefronts, one that I didn't mention yet, but I think is definitely worth mentioning is the Windows 10 store.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:50.000
You know, and as much as we might kind of snicker a little bit at that, you know, because a lot of the games that are being sold on the storefront right now are very similar to what you'd get on your iPhone and all this stuff.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I think it's worth mentioning, why does Microsoft so badly want to upgrade you to Windows 10 for Windows 7 and 8 and all this stuff?

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Because that store is injected so easily right into, as part of the seamless desktop experience.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:12.000
And if you are a Microsoft gamer on Xbox to begin with, a lot of those games that are in the storefront do offer those achievements and some of those other perks.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:24.000
And let's not forget, Microsoft does own Minecraft, so there's that whole thing as well, and that's going to be a big game, and that is something that you can get on the Windows 10 store or what have you.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Not to be a party pooper on Microsoft, but you would think that after their failed attempt with games for Windows Live, they were willing to lessen.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I mean, you know, granted, like you said, people kind of poo-pooed on Steam when they first came out, but people were kind of going to love Steam.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:55.000
I mean, that's pretty much the 800-pound grill in the room, you know?

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:03.000
I mean, it's going to be kind of hard for most stores to compete with Valve and their Steam sales.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:16.000
I'd kind of liken it to competitors of Nintendo, like Sega, when it comes to handhelds, way back in the day.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:31.000
The original Game Boy was the 800-pound grill in terms of handhelds, and most other handhelds kind of flopped, whether you're talking about the Game Gear or the Neo Geo Pocket, so on and so forth.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Well, some people have a lot of love for that, but I understand. It's very hard to compete with Nintendo in that handheld space.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000
But anyway, Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in about one more call before we wrap up tonight, okay?

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000
But thanks for calling.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Sure, have a good night.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Take care of you too.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:51.000
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Checking in with Loki real quick to see if there's any last-minute stories.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Yeah, I guess there was a story about Sonic the Hedgehog, so they had that whole Sonic the Hedgehog mobile game, the Sonic Runner or whatever, and it's being shut down.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I guess it just didn't do so well for them.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Really?

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Yeah, Sonic Runners is going to be discontinuing the premium currency or sales, and then the game will close down on July 27th.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Wow, okay. I remember checking that out when it first came out. I didn't think it was bad. It does kind of surprise me that they'll just shut these things down.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:33.000
I mean, even if there's like only a hundred people playing it, there might still be money to be made there, but I guess if they're having to operate a server, maybe...

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Was it Sega that actually put the game out, or was it like somebody... I guess it was from Sonic Team.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Yeah, it was.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:43.000
I was going to say, if it's licensed, maybe they were shutting it down because they didn't want to, you know, pay the licensing again.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Yeah.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Maybe they weren't making enough money, but...

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.000
That would make sense.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.000
If they made it, then I don't know. What's the point in shutting something down if you can possibly make some money from it?

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:59.000
That would make sense. One last call for calls. Orange Lounge Radio. I'll loan a word on Skype. I know our listenership is a little lower tonight because of the Memorial Day weekend. Some people are out.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Some people are watching Game of Thrones, but I do want to remind those that are listening on the podcast feed, you know, we love to hear from new people and people we didn't even know were out there listening to the show.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Please don't be afraid to lend your voice to the show. It can be as simple as a tweet. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. I know we don't always read every single tweet here on the show, but we do read them all for sure.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:28.000
So you can always just let us know you're out there. We appreciate it for sure. Anything else you want to mention in the last minute stories here before we start to wrap up?

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.000
No.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:39.000
No? Alright. Check it in just one more time to see if we get any calls. 1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:44.000
I do want to thank Y-Y-R for being here tonight. That was really awesome to have him out here from the East Coast.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:52.000
And at some point, he wanted to play this game with me on the iPhone. We didn't get around to being able to do it tonight, but I thought I'd give it a shout out anyway because it's called Space Team.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:45:01.000
And I've never played this, but I guess this is one of those games where you have to all kind of yell at each other to coordinate. You have to play it with at least two people, and I think up to four people.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:10.000
And you have to coordinate all in one room what the others are doing. And that whole thing, it's like Bomb Corp or Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. One of those types of games.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Or there's that other one, the Starship game that people play at cons in real life in a big room or something like that.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:20.000
I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head. Maybe somebody in chat will save me there.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:26.000
But yeah, I guess this game's like that. And he had me download it, but sadly, just with time, we didn't really get around to playing it.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
And Space Team it is.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Alright. Well, Artemis. Is that the name of a tiger claw? That sounds right.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Anyway, it looks like nobody else is trying to call, so there it is. I guess we will close up the Skype line.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:44.000
But if you want to email us for a future episode, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Meanwhile, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I just want to say real quick though, as always, thank you for listening to OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the program, just tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:00.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't let the voices out there if you're not going to use them.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Meanwhile, final thoughts. Dark Sakura, I know you got to go. You got to work early in the morning.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
And not just that. The caffeine headache is kicked in.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Oh, yuck, yuck, yuck. Well, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:18.000
I retract what I said to Kaijudo because I thought you were trolling and I thought it was a very awful troll.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.000
And you really just haven't looked into the things that you love.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:28.000
If you love something, research it. That's my advice to you. Second, ow.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.000
If you love something, fall down a wiki-hole for it.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:35.000
All right. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.000
I got to probably pick up some fans on the way home. Apparently it's like 85 in my house right now.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Oh, God. Oh, you poor thing.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Do you know the ice bucket trick?

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Yeah, I tried the ice bucket trick. It does not work.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:51.000
I know it's like next to nothing, but do you want to take that fan?

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000
No, it's cool. I'm just going to pick up my own house fan.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.000
All right, I tried.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Box fan in a window. Got us through a summer.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Box fan in a window. My final thought for the night is I have this really bad feeling I'm finally going to get suckered into getting Overwatch.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Now that I have a computer. Now that I have a computer that can run it really, really well.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.000
And just like all my friends on Twitter are playing it.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
I'll give you this contention then.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
What?

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.000
Wait for the Steam sale. Because there is a Steam sale coming at the end of June.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.000
They don't sell Overwatch on Steam. It's a Blizzard game.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Oh, that makes me think of another answer to Rage Nator's question.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
The battle net is another place I get games.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Well, you're fucked.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Yep, I'm fucked.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.000
All right. That's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:39.000
We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Have a great Memorial Day weekend.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Those of you in the States that have one more day off of work.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Thank you again to the Armed Forces and remember the reason why we have this holiday.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:54.000
And a big thank you to everybody out there listening and helping the show and supporting it.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
We'll see you again in seven days. Happy gaming.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.000
