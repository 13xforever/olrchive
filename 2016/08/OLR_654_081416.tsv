0	18000	This week Rocket League wraps up its Championship Series and teases more new content bringing
18000	20880	power-ups to your favorite RC-powered soccer simulator.
20880	24160	Loosen your boots and join us for this and plenty more news on tonight's episode of the
24160	31440	show where every gamer has a voice.
31440	34320	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34320	36040	where every gamer has a voice.
36040	44320	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, August the 14th of 2016 with episode number 654 of
44320	45320	our show.
45320	49840	My name is Rob Roberts here with you in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California to talk
49840	55000	with you guys over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
55000	59280	Again I'm Rob and you can find me on Twitter at Skie and she is DarkSakura.
59280	60520	I have blue roots.
60520	65460	Yeah, actually I love this hair thing you've got going on with the blended like blue to
65460	66460	red thing.
66460	73600	I went to see Monet and my hair is blue going into red in some parts and purple in others.
73600	75440	So it's actually both.
75440	78840	It's really unfortunate that this is radio so nobody can see it.
79840	83440	Maybe if someone bribes me with cheesecake, I'll take a picture.
83440	86080	I will thank you for being a friend.
86080	90080	You'll travel around the world and back again for cheesecake.
90080	93800	Also joining us tonight, welcome back this week, Loki.
93800	98040	Yes and my breadsticks go from marinara to creamy garlic sauce.
98040	103400	Oh, I see that it's blended, blended sauces as opposed to blended hair.
103400	106040	I see, fantastic.
106040	107800	How was your couple weeks been?
107840	111480	I'm sorry you weren't here last week, but yeah, I had to deal with the kids last week.
111480	116840	I understand it happens because my wife couldn't pick them up and as a result, we had to deal
116840	117840	with Shane.
117840	118840	So thank you for that.
118840	119840	No, it's fine.
119840	120840	No, he did.
120840	121840	He did.
121840	122840	It was at Power Morphicon.
122840	123840	He did a fine job.
123840	124840	Yeah.
124840	125840	He's at Power Morphicon right now actually.
125840	128200	And this will be the second podcast today where I've brought him up.
128200	131760	His ego has got to be swelling because we did Poke Stop earlier today.
131760	132800	He wasn't able to be there.
132800	137560	So obviously because he's doing the Power Morphicon stuff of covering for Ranger Pride,
137560	138560	his show.
138560	142860	So, but I'm sure he'll be back another week to bless us with his presence again and talk
142860	145160	about how his shiny hunting is going.
145160	146160	Yep.
146160	151300	So it's basically been just a rollercoaster of karma, I guess.
151300	155960	So starting off with the bad karma, I guess for some reason, well not even really bad
155960	157920	karma, just bad shit that fucking happened.
157920	166000	So like I was at work and my pants ripped like to the point, like thankfully it was,
166000	168600	I was already at my car, you know, when that happened.
168600	172320	So it wasn't like anything embarrassing, but like, like almost to the point where like
172320	174320	one of the pant legs could literally have come off.
174320	176000	I don't even know how that happened.
176000	179800	It's just like, I'm like, where the fuck did this happen?
179800	185000	Same day, check engine light comes on, like, are you fucking kidding me?
185000	188200	And then I go home, check your engine and check your caboose.
188200	191560	And then I go home to work on my computer and everything's cool.
191560	196600	Then all of a sudden, you know, I go to shut my son's window because it's, you know, it's
196600	198840	just before bed, you know, and everything.
198840	202220	I shut his window, come back, my computer's black screen.
202220	204160	And I was like, okay, that's weird.
204160	211800	So I restart it, won't restart, have to reload windows again, reload windows, seems fine
211800	216160	for a while, start to, you know, import myself for my backup again.
216160	218440	Fucking does it again.
218440	219440	Did it again.
219440	222280	Today, I redid everything.
222280	227120	Once again, third time, finally had the reinstall windows for the third time.
227120	231880	So far, it hasn't crashed yet, but that's the shit I have to fucking deal with.
231880	233320	So wait, so that's the bad karma.
233320	234320	What's the good karma?
234320	236060	Oh, the good karma is just, you know, work shit.
236060	238600	So basically I've had lots of meetings with people.
238600	243600	The department I'm working in right now, they're very manual for everything that they do.
243600	247120	So like data entry stuff is just all very manual.
247120	249560	So by showing a little ass at work, you got a promotion?
249560	250560	No, no, no.
250560	252760	That's what it sounds like to me.
252760	259720	No, no, no, by basically, because we use a terminal program that basically emulates an
259720	265680	old mainframe system and it supports macros and those macros support Visual Basic Scripting.
265680	271400	And so out of sheer boredom or just curiosity, I've been teaching myself Visual Basic Scripting.
271400	272640	That is a great skill to have.
272640	276640	We had some people at my old job that's like, that did that stuff.
276640	277640	Yes.
277640	282640	And I've fucking rocked it basically because I've automated a ton of shit and just like
282640	283640	done stuff with her.
283640	284840	They're like, I didn't even know you could do that.
284840	289440	And just like all my boss, my boss's boss, the director of the environment, they're just
289440	291860	like all fucking static.
291860	296560	Would you say that maybe all those programming things for the game you never fucking finished?
296560	300200	I was trying to work on it twice when I've tried to work on it.
300200	302140	My computer is just self-destructed.
302140	306780	So it's like, I've tried, but the fucking universe doesn't want it to happen.
306780	307780	You're cursed.
307780	308780	Oh, hi.
308780	309780	I need to introduce as well.
309780	314940	We also have here in studio, another special guest to the show who has nothing to promote.
314940	316300	Not even a Twitter, not a show.
316300	318500	He's just here to hang out.
318500	320260	Say hello everybody to Mike.
320260	321260	What's up?
321260	322260	Hey Mike.
322260	323260	How's it going?
323260	324260	Is your mic on, Mike?
324260	325260	I don't know.
325260	326260	I don't know why we weren't hearing you.
326260	327260	Anyway.
327260	328260	Hi Mike.
328260	329260	How are you?
329260	330260	I'm doing good.
330260	331260	How are you?
331380	332380	It is the show.
332380	333380	It is.
333380	336060	I thought you were promoting a sports podcast last time you were here, but it never happened.
336060	338980	No, I just said I was, I was, uh, no, what was it?
338980	339980	Uh, Hearthstone.
339980	340980	I was doing Hearthstone.
340980	341980	Oh, Hearthstone.
341980	342980	Are you still streaming?
342980	343980	Hearthstone?
343980	346980	I haven't had the time to stream lately, but yeah, it's on my list.
346980	347980	It's on my list.
347980	348980	It's on my to do list.
348980	349980	It's a lengthy to do list.
349980	350980	But yeah.
350980	356860	Uh, Mike also joined us on Pokestop podcast this week, filled in for an absent Shane.
356860	358180	So there's that.
358180	362180	Um, and you have such a unique name that people could find too easy on the internet.
362180	363180	If you want to follow you.
363180	364180	I'm sure.
364180	365180	Exactly.
365180	367340	Well maybe this time around, I'll, I'll plug a Twitter handle or something.
367340	368340	There you go.
368340	369340	You know, believe I'm interesting enough.
369340	370340	There you go.
370340	371340	Awesome.
371340	373660	Uh, as 200 Matt in chat says, yay sports, do you play sports games?
373660	378500	I mean, this, this is a big time to be talking usually, usually the one show a year will
378500	380060	regress in a sports game.
380060	385340	Talk is, is Superbowl Sunday, but we have Olympics right now and that's kind of a big
385340	386340	deal.
386340	387340	Do you play sports games?
387500	388500	I don't play sports games.
388500	392820	Um, only because they make me want to just go play the sport instead.
392820	394780	And then you're one of those guys.
394780	396380	You're one of those guys, right?
396380	400740	Why, why would I, why would I play double dribble when I can go outside and actually
400740	401740	bounce about?
401740	404500	I want to see the look of shame on the person's face.
404500	408540	But can you, can you dunk like the game?
408540	409540	Not anymore.
409540	410540	I used to.
410540	411540	Yeah.
411540	412540	That's cool.
412540	415340	So, so, uh, do you, do you play like the Olympic games?
415340	418420	I mean, I suppose this is a topical question for me to ask you ever played any of those
418420	424380	like Mario and Sonic at the, uh, the last one I played was, Oh good God, it was, uh,
424380	426740	the 2008 Olympic one.
426740	427740	The Wii one.
427740	428740	That was, those are huge.
428740	429740	Yeah.
429740	430740	Those are huge.
430740	431740	Yeah.
431740	432740	It made your shoulders burn, man.
432740	433740	Yeah.
433740	434740	Cause you had to work it up a sweat and everything.
434740	435740	It was disgusting.
435740	437980	I was like, Oh, this is too much for a game for me.
437980	439220	Um, let's see.
439220	443940	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, where we do tape live every Sunday night
443940	448420	at the voice geeks, network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right
448420	453060	after the Bobby Blackwell show at Bobby actually starts us off here with a comment in our chat
453060	457740	at live.vognetwork.com with I played the official video game of the real Olympics grand theft
457740	458740	auto five.
458740	459740	Yes.
459740	463420	I am hearing there are some unfortunate issues going on there.
463420	467140	Um, that joke is probably an extreme USA basketball staying on a boat.
467140	472860	It's uh, it's, that joke is probably an extremely poor taste, but I did snicker, um, as it happens,
472900	476820	uh, dark to see and chat says, that's why I prefer NBA jam and NFL blitz.
476820	478540	I was never into sports.
478540	482420	What do you tell all the gamers that are like, I'm not into sports.
482420	485380	Do we need to just suck it up and try or what?
485380	486380	Try playing sports?
486380	487380	Yeah.
487380	488380	No, it's not for everyone.
488380	489380	I coach.
489380	490380	I see it.
490380	492980	It's like, yeah, it's not for everyone.
492980	496620	Do you, I don't know if I should ask this cause I don't want you to get in trouble if
496620	497620	somebody hears this.
497620	498620	Okay.
498620	503020	Do you ever have a kid that you're coaching where you're like, just seriously pull the
503020	505980	kid out of class all the time.
505980	514080	But then I, since I'm a good coach, I encourage them nonetheless and uh, understand that most
514080	515420	of it's confidence.
515420	523340	So it's like if I, you know, especially in basketball, it's not, uh, all about scoring.
523340	526560	It's like, there's so much other things that you can do to be helpful.
526560	529280	So it's like, I'm going to find something that you're going to get you that you're good
529280	530280	at.
530280	532120	That was a very PC answer that won't get you fired.
532120	533760	You handled that very well.
533760	536600	That's actually how I really, truly do it.
536600	537600	That's not just being PC.
537600	538600	That's actually how I do it.
538600	539720	That's a great answer.
539720	543560	You should go volunteer for the Donald Trump campaign and help his ass out cause he needs
543560	544560	to help him.
544560	545560	Yeah.
545560	546560	Um, where do I get cyanide?
546560	547560	A shovel.
547560	548560	Cyanide?
548560	549560	All right.
549560	550560	Not, not, not.
550560	551560	Okay.
551560	552560	Not okay.
552560	556800	A shovel will help because you're going to need a solid foundation for a giant wall like
556800	557800	that.
557800	558800	There you go.
558800	559800	Now that's a funny joke.
559800	560800	All right.
560800	561800	Okay.
561800	562800	Anyway, uh, let's see.
562800	566920	Going back to our chat live.vognetwork.com Bobby Black Wolf says, I played baseball for
566920	571760	two years as a young kid, but my stereo blindness made it hard to watch the ball, but they had
571760	574840	to play me anyway because every kid got played.
574840	575840	Yep.
575840	578280	So, so you, so you have to put the kids in.
578280	579280	Yeah.
579280	582120	But then like I get to make up my roster.
582120	587120	So like my, my lineup, so it's like, I'm going to make sure that that kid that's the weakest
587120	594720	is at least with some kid that knows what he's doing or she, you know, um, Oh, do you
594720	598920	ever get kids that think they know everything about the sport because they played video
598920	599920	games?
599920	604300	No, actually I've never, I've never had that happen.
604300	605300	I've never had that happen.
605300	609760	I think of like, like I've been coaching for like eight years and I've only had one kid
609760	612760	ever mentioned like playing 2k or anything like that.
612760	614560	Oh, no one plays them.
614560	617440	Hey, well I was, 2k is fun.
617440	619440	It's just not a game that I go out and pick up.
619440	622880	Well, I was thinking there's so many like kids that are like, well, I saw that he saw
622880	624360	somebody do this on TV.
624360	625360	It's easy.
625360	628120	So video games seems like a natural progression to watch space jam.
628120	629120	I can jam.
629120	631760	Yeah, I could dunk from half court.
631760	632760	Heck yeah.
632760	634380	Bugs Bunny could do it.
634380	635380	He's a rabbit.
635380	637580	I mean, for God's sakes.
637580	640900	Actually Loki brings up a very important question that I have to ask, you know, any
640900	644100	basketball coach I'm ever going to talk to in my life of which you're the only one I
644100	645100	know.
645100	646380	So here you go.
646380	651220	On a scale of one to 10, how culturally important is the movie Space Jam?
651220	653020	Space Jam is life.
653020	654720	So 11.
654720	655720	Maybe even a 12.
655720	656720	Okay.
656720	657720	It's important.
657720	659060	It's an important movie.
659060	662700	And at this point in time, none of the kids have seen Space Jam.
662700	663700	You know what?
663700	667280	Why don't you sit them down the first day and be like, you need to, oh no, I just avoid
667280	670800	trying to talk about that stuff with them because I'm like, uh, you're going to make
670800	673640	me feel way older than I need to feel.
673640	675200	Two truths.
675200	677480	I own it on laser disc.
677480	678480	Second truth.
678480	680760	Haven't seen it all the way through.
680760	681760	What?
681760	682760	This needs to be fixed.
682760	685200	I'll tell you something that needs to be fixed.
685200	687920	Is it too soon for spoilers on that?
687920	691400	They go to outer space and then play basketball.
691400	692560	Yes.
692560	693560	Guess who wins?
693560	695320	The Looney Tunes.
695320	696320	Let's see.
696360	700520	Art Tetsuya in chat says, I think the Space Jam official website is still up.
700520	701520	It is.
701520	702520	And it's amazing.
702520	703520	It is.
703520	704520	It is original.
704520	711040	It re it reminds you of a time when the only city in America that mattered was geo cities.
711040	716080	Oh, it just takes you back to a simpler time.
716080	718880	Uh, and STO 100 Matt says, come on, Rab slam.
718880	719880	Come on Rab.
719880	723480	Come on, Rob slam and welcome to the jam.
723480	727040	Every time they say they want going to remake that movie, I die a little bit.
727040	728040	Me too.
728040	732800	Just, just don't like Hollywood, Hollywood needs to stop with the remakes.
732800	733800	Stop.
733800	735280	Well, they didn't want to do all of the remake.
735280	739240	They wanted to do a quote unquote, seek cool.
739240	742760	Even spiritual, even sequels are getting a little worrisome.
742760	746120	Like I just, I just heard the other week they're going to make a sequel to the craft and I'm
746120	748360	like, no, no, don't touch that.
748360	752680	Well, they have the new witch movie coming out.
752680	755000	Now you see here's where I'm on the line.
755000	756960	I actually hear that's really, really good.
756960	757960	So I don't know.
757960	761360	So I guess I can't use the blanket statement of ban all sequels and ban all remakes.
761360	764960	Cause if I said ban all sequels, we wouldn't get new star Wars movies and you know, kind
764960	765960	of need those.
765960	769680	But then again, that last star Trek movie here was not very great either.
769680	772760	What do you, I hear in this, this re most recent one's the best one.
772760	773760	Really?
773760	774760	Yeah.
774760	776840	But it's not doing well at the box office.
776840	778800	Unfortunately it is the new star Trek.
778800	779800	Yeah.
779800	780800	Oh, I want to see it though.
780800	781800	Yeah.
781920	782920	I think that's a problem.
782920	783920	We're not going to see it.
783920	788680	I, and not to get, sorry, not to get too tangent because I know we're a video game show, but
788680	792840	I think this is important is I was reading a very interesting article online about why
792840	795000	isn't the movie star Trek performing better?
795000	797680	Is it because the last movie wasn't so great?
797680	799760	Is it because people are sick of the Abrams verse?
799760	803180	Is it because, and I kind of think it's those things as well, but honestly, do you know
803180	807300	what I think is the reason why star Trek is losing at the box office?
807300	809320	There's no star Trek TV series on right now.
810280	812640	Part of it, but there wasn't one with the last two movies either.
812640	815000	And they did a fine.
815000	818520	I think it's because a stranger things.
818520	823440	I think it's because Netflix is starting to change a lot of this conversation when you
823440	826500	can watch these very high quality things at home.
826500	830680	It's almost like, and this is why I think this is a good topic for significantly cheaper
830680	831680	too.
831680	832680	Yeah.
832680	839840	It's almost like what killed arcades when you could bring the, you know, gaming experience
839840	840840	home.
840840	844600	Now, I know a lot of people are going to be like, Rob, you're, you're talking like an
844600	849080	idiot because if movies were going to die because you could bring the experience home
849080	850080	that was happening back.
850080	856080	I mean, when that, when, when the beta max have killed the movie theater, I just, things
856080	861160	are getting more and higher quality and so forth where I think the things that are being
861200	866680	offered on television, especially specialty services like Netflix and so forth are like
866680	871600	on par with a lot of stuff that we go to the movies and see and for far less money.
871600	873880	And I think that's, that's what I'm talking about.
873880	876280	I'm not talking about the technology behind it.
876280	878600	I'm talking about what all is being offered.
878600	882740	Well, here's the problem is a lot of these companies that are making these movies are
882740	890240	just throwing just a ridiculous amounts of money towards these franchises, but they're
890240	891240	bad.
891240	893560	I mean, you could throw all your money, you wanted a bad movie.
893560	894560	It's still going to be bad.
894560	896320	Well, I don't know.
896320	900040	I still want to see the movie, but I didn't mean, I didn't mean to get too tangenty, but
900040	904280	I just, you know, I kind of thought that there was, there was a little bit of a relevancy
904280	905280	there when we talk about arcades.
905280	907280	I saw suicide squad and that was awesome.
907280	908280	Yeah.
908280	909280	Yeah.
909280	910280	See, and Will Smith wasn't even annoying in it.
910280	911280	I thought for sure.
911280	915360	Like, you know, when they had the first trailer, was it some sort of super suicide squad?
915360	916680	Like, Oh, come on.
916680	917680	That's so cringy.
917680	919360	Actually, it was pretty good.
919360	920360	It was pretty good.
920360	924460	But yet I, you know, what's funny, you, you have like the opposite view on movies than
924460	927720	most people I talk to because a lot of people I'm hearing suicide squad, not, not a big
927720	932540	fan of it because they're expecting like a ton of joker, you know, footage and stuff.
932540	935240	Like he wasn't in the whole time, but that's all right.
935240	936240	I thought it was fun.
936240	941060	They cut apparently a whole bunch of the scenes, especially the ones that painted his relationship
941060	944280	with Harley is a lot more abusive as what made it into the movie.
944280	949160	If you haven't seen it yet, there's a suicide squad review at voggenetwork.com and you know
949160	952480	at vog, we allow, you know, uh, response reviews and so forth.
952480	953480	Right.
953480	956640	So, um, I'm not going to spoil what our author thought of the review, but you know, he kind
956640	957640	of felt one way.
957640	960920	And what's interesting is that you don't see this happen with a lot of reviews at vog network.
960920	964120	We have both concurring and dissenting opinions.
964120	966400	So kind of interesting how that's working out.
966400	970680	You know, uh, you know, I like it when not everybody necessarily agrees, we can have
970680	975320	a civil discussion, keyword civil on, uh, the, uh, you know, kind of differences there.
975320	981040	So, um, but then I want to mention in chat over at live.vog.network.com also, um, SHO
981040	984720	100 map pointing out the cost of going to a theater cost twice as much as a monthly
984720	985720	payment to Netflix.
985720	986720	Yeah.
986720	990040	Uh, William murder face and chat says, see star Wars seven.
990040	994920	And I think, see, here's the thing, and this is important because I don't think like movies
994920	1000600	are going to like die or go away because there's still something to be said about event films.
1000600	1002920	And a movie like star Wars is still an event film.
1002920	1006440	And perhaps the reason why star Trek three is not performing as well as the others is
1006440	1010720	that star Trek is losing that sense of an event film.
1010720	1015100	And I don't know if that's because there's no TV show because the last movie wasn't so
1015100	1017320	great and people are tired of the Abrams verse.
1017320	1022800	I don't know what that is because there's no captain Jean-Luc Picard in there is why,
1022800	1024400	but then here's okay.
1024400	1028020	Dark Sakura, what movie did you see in a theater this week?
1028020	1029280	Because I thought this was interesting.
1029280	1030280	Oh yeah.
1030280	1032320	I saw how it's a movie castle.
1032320	1034600	And isn't that movie something like 10 years old?
1034600	1035600	2004.
1035600	1036600	Yeah.
1036600	1040400	So, but yet people, there was a lot of people that went to go pay and see this movie, right?
1040400	1042360	Cause they made, they made an event out of it.
1042360	1046640	I hadn't seen it before either and it had been on my list and I just never saw it.
1046640	1051680	Um, and uh, this, uh, group here in Sacramento that does a lot of the cult movies like Rocky
1051680	1056880	horn stuff, they just did a screening of the lost boys and hocus pocus, which I haven't
1056880	1061000	seen hocus pocus either are two amazing films and they, they, I don't know if they sold
1061000	1064800	out the theater, but they got several hundred people there to see these movies that are
1064800	1065800	years and years old.
1065800	1067120	Well, I love going to the crest anyway.
1067120	1068480	It's gorgeous inside there.
1068480	1071840	Sometimes it's fun to just so see cult movies with a big crowd of people who yell at the
1071840	1072840	script.
1072840	1073960	I mean, that's part of the, why I did Rocky horror for years.
1073960	1079680	They actually said, um, uh, please be quiet during the film and don't, you know, call
1079680	1080680	out at the screen.
1080680	1081760	Well, sure, sure.
1081760	1083520	And if you're just like, well, this ain't Rocky.
1083520	1084520	Yeah, it depends.
1084520	1085520	It depends on what you're seeing.
1085520	1086520	Right.
1086520	1087520	But everyone was really respectful.
1087520	1088520	Yeah.
1088520	1095920	So anyway, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, let's see, um, stopping and chats is
1095920	1101200	so crazy that the critic score on Rotten Tomatoes is like 25% and audience is like 75%.
1101200	1103040	I think that's about suicide squad.
1103040	1111120	Um, let's see also, um, uh, Sia Tabiri says like before noon, my local AMC has basically
1111120	1112120	half price tickets.
1112120	1114720	I'm cheap and go to the movies when they have deals.
1114720	1116400	Maybe movies are getting too expensive.
1116400	1117400	I don't know.
1117400	1120720	Making these other ways to consume media more attractive.
1120720	1123520	I don't, we need more of the movie grill places.
1123520	1124520	Yeah.
1124520	1125520	They need more of those.
1125520	1127360	And they also are starting to add a lot of gimmicks to it.
1127360	1130840	Like they have the D box stuff, which I've tried it before and it was fun.
1130840	1131840	Yeah.
1131840	1133800	We saw Tron in the D one was fun and D box.
1133800	1137140	It was silly, but finally, but now they've got this thing, like I don't even know what
1137140	1141920	it is necessarily, but I saw they had it during our little preview thing and it's like, it's
1141920	1144160	like a three monitors display basically.
1144160	1147440	I've heard about it like in front of you and then kind of the side, like for sort of
1147440	1149820	like a surround ish thing.
1149820	1151240	And you know what they're trying to do with that?
1151240	1152520	Something that you can't replicate in the home.
1152520	1157280	So you have to come to the theater except people have fucking three monitors plays well
1157280	1158280	already.
1158280	1159280	So, Ooh.
1159280	1160280	All right.
1160280	1161280	Anyway.
1161280	1162280	All right.
1162280	1163280	I need to, I need to shift the conversation back to games.
1163280	1165920	Although I love this talk about movies and you know, I think, I think anybody who is
1165920	1170600	a fan of games, of course you consume, I'm sure a lot of you watch Netflix while you
1170600	1172460	game or, or do other stuff as well.
1172460	1176460	But I want to get back into video games and specifically the types of stuff that we've
1176460	1177460	been playing this week.
1177460	1180060	Cause I know there's one big game we got to talk about in this segment.
1180060	1183900	And I think it's the game everybody's talking about, but everybody plays different stuff.
1183900	1185900	So let's talk about your gaming week, dark soccer.
1185900	1187700	How was your gaming week?
1187700	1189580	I played Sims four.
1189580	1192660	I played Pokemon go.
1192660	1195980	Dan played, um, another Metroid remake too.
1195980	1196980	Oh yeah.
1196980	1197980	How was that?
1197980	1198980	He likes it.
1198980	1199980	I love the music in it.
1199980	1204460	I used to turn off, um, whatever I was, uh, my music in Sims just to listen to Dan play
1204460	1207540	the music and then would watch him for a little bit cause he's playing it on his computer.
1207540	1209100	Um, it's really great.
1209100	1210100	Yeah.
1210100	1211380	They did a really good job with that remake.
1211380	1215260	I mean, but I super liked the Brinstar music in there cause it's like the super Metroid
1215260	1216260	one.
1216260	1217260	Yeah.
1217260	1218260	Only a lot more subdued.
1218260	1225220	So it has like the, the background, uh, uh, like the counter melody in it, but the, the
1225220	1226640	main tone of it is different.
1226640	1227980	So it's pretty cool.
1227980	1228980	I don't know.
1228980	1234980	I understand why Nintendo had to, you know, kind of step in and, and you know, for obvious
1234980	1235980	reasons, right?
1235980	1240100	They cease and desisted the whole Metroid thing, but I just wish there's a part of me
1240100	1245220	that kind of wishes Nintendo would kind of see the demand for this and think about maybe
1245220	1249900	if there's these people that want to make this, then try to try to work something out.
1249900	1253140	But they are seeing that there's a demand for Metroid.
1253140	1258180	That's why Metroid Federation Force, a truly Metroid game is coming out very soon.
1258180	1262500	I, here's the thing I actually think with that game, I think that was a way to keep
1262500	1263500	the trademark.
1263500	1270540	I think they, they made a Metroid game, like the Silent Hill Plinko and it actually, uh,
1270540	1272540	you mean Pachinko?
1272540	1275580	Plinko is a game that Drew Carey moderates on the Price is Right.
1275580	1276580	Sure.
1276580	1280500	But Pachinko, it keeps those trademarks alive.
1280500	1281500	Yes.
1281500	1288120	But just re-release the virtual console games or something on like a disc or something.
1288120	1294600	It would be still way better than this garbage, which is available either this week on the
1294600	1295600	3DS.
1295600	1301240	Well, until you've played it, I don't think you can call it garbage, though, have you?
1301240	1302240	Really?
1302240	1304280	I need to play it to see that it's garbage.
1304280	1305280	Here we go.
1305280	1306280	Here we go.
1306280	1309480	I mean, I've only seen the trailers and that's convincing enough.
1309480	1310880	What if it's good?
1310880	1312960	Suicide Squad had some pretty crap trailers.
1312960	1313960	What are we talking about?
1313960	1315200	All their trailers were fucking awesome.
1315200	1317120	They were pretty fucking awesome, actually.
1317120	1318120	I'm sorry.
1318120	1319120	I'm not in agreement.
1319120	1320120	All right.
1320120	1321120	All right.
1321120	1322120	I got you.
1322120	1323820	There is like nothing that screams, this is Metroid.
1323820	1326520	It's just like, hey, this is not the title.
1326520	1327520	Yeah, exactly.
1327520	1329520	The title.
1329520	1336880	Anyway, back to Dark Soccer and her gaming week, this is AM2R.
1336880	1337880	That's it.
1337880	1338880	Oh, that's it.
1338880	1339880	Oh, yeah.
1339880	1342040	I actually have been playing a bunch of Peggle lately.
1342040	1343040	Okay.
1343040	1346120	Just because it's quick and easy and I'm actually pretty good at it.
1346560	1348080	You know what I miss?
1348080	1349400	PopCap.
1349400	1350400	I miss PopCap games.
1350400	1351400	I mean, I understand.
1351400	1353440	I think they're putting out stuff.
1353440	1355560	They do the Plants vs. Zombies shooter or something like that.
1355560	1356560	I don't know.
1356560	1357560	Yeah.
1357560	1362000	I miss PopCap before EA bought them, like when they were making those silly, addictive
1362000	1363000	games.
1363000	1368640	Oh, and I also bought Legion so I can meet my demon hunter.
1368640	1369640	World of Warcraft Legion.
1369640	1370640	Yeah.
1370640	1371640	Yeah.
1371640	1372640	Fun.
1372640	1373640	Because of reasons.
1373640	1374640	Because...
1374640	1375640	I'm tired.
1376160	1377160	Rob, let's have coffee.
1377160	1378840	I could make some coffee if you need some coffee.
1378840	1380480	Wait, I already thought you can't drink coffee.
1380480	1381480	That was, that's over.
1381480	1382480	I can drink it again.
1382480	1383480	Well, then...
1383480	1385480	Well, let's get you coffee.
1385480	1386480	Rob!
1386480	1387480	Coffee!
1387480	1388480	Anyway.
1388480	1390480	We need cheesecake delivery.
1390480	1391480	All right.
1391480	1392480	Stop talking about food.
1392480	1393480	Get back to games.
1393480	1394480	All right.
1394480	1395480	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1395480	1400200	So my gaming week was pretty much consisting of mobile games because once again, my wife
1400200	1403920	is still watching Grey's Anatomy.
1403920	1407240	But I did get a few days to play No Man's Sky, so that's good.
1407240	1410680	And No Man's Sky is pretty fantastic.
1410680	1415240	The first planet I ended up on was pretty cold, I guess.
1415240	1418600	And so I ended up leaving that and ended up on a hot planet.
1418600	1422780	And then I left that planet to, I thought it was a moon, but I guess maybe it's another
1422780	1427840	planet that's actually more moderate and has some water and stuff in there.
1427840	1433000	And it's kind of funny because the planet that I was, this last planet I was on, has
1433060	1437100	all these really giant dinosaur-looking things that are friendly.
1437100	1441300	And this little fucking cow-looking thing is fucking aggressive.
1441300	1442840	Is it a shifty space cow?
1442840	1444400	Yes, it is a shifty space cow.
1444400	1446120	It comes up and it's like rawr!
1446120	1450860	And then tries to attack me, and I just shoot the laser thing into its head.
1450860	1451860	It's all...
1451860	1455680	It's just silly because it's no threat whatsoever.
1455680	1459400	It just comes up, bites me, and I shoot it in the face of the laser.
1459400	1461000	It just falls over.
1461000	1462360	And I laugh.
1462400	1464400	Until the sentinels show up and they're like...
1464400	1465400	See, we have fucking sentinels.
1465400	1466880	Did you destroy one of my rocks?
1466880	1467880	You're fucking dead.
1467880	1468880	We're gonna send a giant robot.
1468880	1471400	I'm like, dude, I just fucking blew up a rock that's in a cave.
1471400	1472840	What the fuck do you care?
1472840	1474920	So, I don't know.
1474920	1475920	I hate the sentinels.
1475920	1478720	Those are seriously the worst thing in that game.
1478720	1482640	That and the glitch where apparently your hyperdrive thing is all broken if you get
1482640	1484800	the pre-order thing, which...
1484800	1488640	I'm on a different ship now, and I was trying to repair that hyperdrive.
1488640	1491100	Probably why I can't find the part to do it, so...
1491100	1492100	That makes sense.
1492740	1494380	Are you on PC or PlayStation 4?
1494380	1495380	PlayStation 4.
1495380	1496380	Oh, okay.
1496380	1498820	I was curious if you were subject to all those issues the PC version's been having.
1498820	1504140	Yes, I'm subject to that because my PC is shit and wouldn't be able to run that at all.
1504140	1508300	It would be just like, no, sorry.
1508300	1510140	Alan's running it on PC.
1510140	1513820	He actually was watching me play it, and he watched it enough where he's like, fine, I'm
1513820	1515380	gonna get this.
1515380	1519480	And he bought it on PC, and honestly, it looks better on PlayStation 4, but I think that's
1519480	1522760	because he had to turn the settings way down to get the frame rate to work.
1522760	1523760	Yeah, they're still fixing stuff.
1523760	1527000	Because obviously, and I know we'll get to it later in some of the stories and so forth,
1527000	1531880	but obviously the PC version's been having a lot of issues, which is unfortunate, but
1531880	1533920	kind of makes you go...
1533920	1537580	With my laptop being as shitty as it was this week, I'm actually thinking about building
1537580	1539080	a PC now.
1539080	1543720	But of course, my way, not a normal PC.
1543720	1547880	It's gonna basically be this portable PC that I'll be using for VR, but it's also gonna
1547880	1552840	have a custom-built screen slash keyboard thing that's basically like my laptop that's
1552840	1557880	tethered to it that I'll be able to pull out and use on my lap as a laptop, and then shove
1557880	1565880	that big hunky thing with a 1080 GTX card in there, and I'll be set.
1565880	1570000	That's of course if I get this new job and the pay raise that comes with it and all that
1570000	1571000	stuff.
1571000	1573240	In the meantime, I'll just deal with this.
1573240	1575240	Other stuff I've been playing, mobile games again.
1575240	1578920	Of course, I've actually been playing more Ingress this week than I have been playing
1578920	1580240	Pokemon Go.
1580240	1586040	I have been playing Pokemon Go, I'm getting bored with it, honestly.
1586040	1587880	It's just...
1587880	1591720	In my neighborhood and stuff, because I don't really get to go out that far to places.
1591720	1598800	And even when I do go to different places, it ends up like Roseville, nearby, or wherever.
1598800	1600520	It's just the same shit over and over.
1600520	1604960	It's the same fucking Pokemon that are everywhere, and it's just boring.
1604960	1609960	Especially when I'm playing it and there's Rattata or something that's got a 500 CP or
1609960	1610960	something.
1610960	1613120	I'm like, I know this is gonna be a pain in the ass to catch.
1613120	1617640	I'm literally walking away from those now, because it's a waste of my time.
1617640	1622400	So I'm getting a little bored with it, but still playing it, whatever, and then Ingress,
1622400	1627160	of course I'm playing that just to keep up my streak, which is almost over at the end
1627160	1629620	of September.
1629620	1631840	So hopefully that'll be that.
1631840	1639280	And then still tap my Katamari, because when I haven't been able to have the TV, it's just
1639280	1640760	been kind of what I've been going to.
1640760	1644480	And they had another exploit in the game, which is patched out now.
1644480	1647800	But if you haven't patched yours, because I read about that, and they said, oh yeah,
1647800	1648800	we're patching that out.
1648800	1651180	I'm like, well I'm not fucking upgrading then.
1651180	1656960	So it's basically, you do the auto-step thing that they have, it's like some love thing,
1656960	1658280	I don't remember what it's called.
1658280	1661720	And then you change your language settings, and it stays on.
1661720	1664600	And you can stack it a bunch of times.
1664600	1669500	And so basically just let it sit there, and the game will play itself.
1669500	1671080	Of course I have other ways to do that as well.
1671080	1676080	But although their new update, they did add some stuff, so I may need to do that, but
1676080	1678360	right now I'm not.
1678360	1680760	I still don't know why I'm playing that game either, because there's really no point to
1680760	1681760	it.
1681760	1684480	It's like, I'm playing this, I'm like, why am I still playing this game?
1684480	1687160	There's no fucking point to this game.
1687160	1689840	I don't know.
1689840	1691960	You can say that about almost any game though, to be fair.
1691960	1695960	Well no ask I even, sometimes I'm like, I don't really know what I'm doing here, I go
1695960	1700200	to these different planets and it's just kind of like, I don't know, this creature sort
1700200	1703040	of looks like that last creature I saw.
1703040	1707840	And the sentinels really ruin it, because it'd be fun to like, here's how I thought
1707840	1713360	it was supposed to be, I thought it was, oh if you're like a fucking dick to all the wildlife
1713360	1718040	out there, you're just blowing shit up, then the sentinels come and try to stop you.
1718040	1719620	Which makes sense.
1719620	1724420	But like the fact that like, oh you harvested a rock, well we're gonna have to fucking send
1724420	1727360	like nukes on you now, it's like, that makes no sense.
1727360	1732740	That they're on every fucking planet in the fucking universe, is a dumb thing that they
1732740	1733740	added.
1733740	1736860	Yeah, I understand the need to like gamify it, but I almost wish they'd put in like a
1736860	1740140	difficulty thing where you could just turn it off, like kind of like in Minecraft, you
1740140	1743740	have peaceful mode or whatever, you could do that, but then when you're supposedly in
1743740	1748300	an online universe, I guess everything has to be stabilized, although, how online is
1748300	1749300	it really?
1749300	1753000	I'm sure we heard about the two people that, you know, tried to run into each other by
1753000	1755780	being in the same galaxy and nothing, I guess.
1755780	1761020	Well there were server issues, and I think one of them was not connected to the online
1761020	1764420	server, because if you notice in the screenshots, they were both in the same spot, but it was
1764420	1769340	different times of day, so it wasn't synced up, and so that's what they even said to their
1769340	1772700	server issues, and they have new features now that you can scan for players that are
1772700	1777140	nearby and go meet them, so they're trying to promote that, and you can do that, it's
1777140	1782380	just, their, you know, the server problems right now are just pretty bad.
1782380	1785760	Thankfully though, it doesn't rely too much on the online servers, so you can still play
1785760	1791380	the game without it really being a problem that you can't connect all the time.
1791380	1793420	So I'm definitely going to be playing a lot more of that.
1793420	1796340	Yeah, I'm still super into No Man's Sky myself, in fact, are you done with your game of the
1796340	1797340	week?
1797340	1798340	Because I want to talk about No Man's Sky.
1798340	1801620	Alright, so, obviously, I've been playing No Man's Sky as well, started with a live
1801620	1807060	stream on Monday, I got the game a day early by some miracle, just by Amazon, didn't
1807060	1810380	pull any strings or anything, so I got the game a day early, so the first thing I was
1810380	1813700	like, I'm going to do a live stream, and did like a, you know, I don't know anything about
1813700	1818980	this game live stream, and I, you know, I've been a little bit critical of No Man's Sky
1818980	1823260	in the lead up to it being, you know, we've joked, I don't think it was like actual criticism,
1823260	1827280	but like, kind of like tongue in cheek, like, where's the game, yo?
1827280	1830900	What's the game in No Man's Sky, y'all keep showing these trailers, but where's the game?
1830900	1834820	You know, now that I understand, you know, what the game is, yes, I get that it's a journey
1834820	1841260	basically, and you, it's an inventory management sim, well, in a way, in a way, yes, the game
1841260	1846980	is to live off the land with limited resources, you know, because it is in a lot of games
1846980	1851220	that you play, like let's say a role playing game like Final Fantasy, it is kind of something
1851220	1856980	how you could carry around like, you know, 970 items in your magical backpack, you know,
1856980	1861180	you can craft a hyperdrive, but for some reason, I just can't build more pockets or like a
1861180	1866340	larger backpack to hold 500 units of ore, but anyway, look, okay, all that stuff aside,
1866340	1871020	like, I get the progression of being able to expand that and the whole live off the
1871020	1872020	land element.
1872020	1875540	So, you know, I understand that that's part of the challenge.
1875540	1882820	So actually, like, I find No Man's Sky to be that really, like, great blend of zen that
1882820	1887900	I get from Minecraft, like, digging a tunnel in Minecraft is very zen for me, like, it's
1887900	1892060	just very, like, relaxing and something I could just kind of do, you know, building
1892060	1896140	a coaster or whatever, it's just like something silly, time wasting, no point, whatever.
1896140	1899660	And I kind of, I kind of get that out of No Man's Sky as well.
1899660	1904700	I think part of what's always not worked for me in Minecraft is that I'm not much of a
1904700	1905820	builder.
1905820	1909940	So it's like, I'm building like straightaway tunnels, but I'm not able to build these fancy
1909940	1914620	houses that people do and these elaborate things, you don't really have to do that in
1914620	1917260	No Man's Sky, it's just about kind of like the templates.
1917260	1922780	So I kind of get that mix of, I have a purpose for why I'm hunting for all this stuff, but
1922780	1925020	I don't, like, have to, like, build or anything like that.
1925020	1927860	But wouldn't it be cool, though, if you could build, like, settlements or like, you know,
1927860	1928860	some sort of place?
1928860	1929860	Actually, yeah, that would be rad.
1929860	1932140	I would love to build a settlement that somebody else could explore.
1932140	1934380	That would be very, very cool.
1934380	1939460	But I, you know, I don't know, I, right now I'm enjoying the whole fact that, you know,
1939460	1944540	I jump forward as I'm moving towards the center of the galaxy or the side quests or whatever
1944540	1949540	you want to call them, excuse me, that pop up, like, I'm moving a little bit more towards
1949540	1952760	this other path that I was given.
1952760	1956780	For those that have played the game, you know, the center of the galaxy is the gold path.
1956780	1959140	I got a blue path that showed up pretty early, so I'm-
1959140	1961140	I haven't noticed any paths whatsoever, so-
1961140	1965580	Yeah, I've been going down this blue path, and I got to the end of the blue path and
1965580	1974300	I liked the building, you're speaking in vague terms, I liked the building that I got to
1974300	1978260	when I got to the end of that path, that was a very cool moment, but then it was like,
1978260	1982460	and your reward is another blue path and an item to hold down your inventory that you're
1982460	1987500	not sure what it's for, so that part was a little bit annoying, but I'm just, I'm liking,
1987500	1990740	every time I land on a new planet, it's like, oh, what's going to be different about this
1990740	1991740	one?
1991740	1995900	And I understand there's criticisms about, well, a lot of planets are the same, but I
1995900	2002660	don't know, I found a lot of variety in the planets that I've been to that I've been engaged.
2002660	2007340	I'm still kind of engaged in the end game of trying to get to the center of the universe
2007340	2013520	and explore what's there, so I'm just, I'm enjoying No Man's Sky, it's just like a relaxing
2013520	2018140	kind of game that is kind of no pressure, which is also why I understand why people
2018140	2020780	don't like the sentinels.
2020780	2024860	I don't mind the sentinels because I think they're easy to pick off and kill and they're
2024860	2030160	not that big of a deal, for me, I mean, I guess, for whatever reason, I don't get bothered
2030160	2031160	by the sentinels.
2031160	2035320	Whatever bothers me, I kill it, I kill its friend and I move on.
2035320	2036600	That's what happens to sentinels.
2036600	2041800	What annoys the shit out of me are the space fights, because then you get the space, again,
2041800	2045760	I don't mean to spoil, but it's not that far in the game, you will start getting spaceships
2045760	2048040	that want to come after you and attack you.
2048040	2054240	And flying around in space and trying to do these dogfights is, the controls are a beast.
2054240	2058080	So I kind of feel like the number one thing I'd like to see No Man's Sky improve on is
2058080	2060760	like some of the controls are pretty bad.
2060760	2067920	Like down to, I don't understand why L2 is what you use to zoom in on a creature, but
2067920	2072920	to scan the creature, you need to use, I think like R3 or something, because if you hit R2,
2072920	2076120	which would be the logical second thing to hit, you're going to shoot that creature in
2076120	2080080	the face and you've just turned a timid creature into an aggressive creature.
2080080	2085240	And I can't tell you how many times I went to scan a creature and instead of scanning
2085240	2087180	it, I accidentally shot it in the face.
2087180	2091540	You can't change what they're assigned to?
2091540	2098060	You could within the PlayStation 4 architecture, because PlayStation 4 has within the firmware
2098060	2106100	that you can remap any buttons you want, but it's not within the game, if that makes sense.
2106100	2109900	It wouldn't be just for the game, it would be like everything.
2109900	2114940	Well you can toggle those on and off with multiple key presses.
2114940	2120200	I want to get to some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Dungeon
2120200	2124100	Buster in chat says, I remember getting lost in some caverns and just used my multi-tool
2124100	2126500	to explode a new exit to the surface.
2126500	2129540	I'm flying towards the center of the galaxy right now, it's been interesting, I know what
2129540	2133060	Skye is talking about, I was on that path for a bit before switching, but the building
2133060	2135120	you find is really neat in his path.
2135120	2139300	The sentinels can be super peaceful if you don't keep blowing up the landscape like Schwarzenegger
2139300	2141700	Black Wolf.
2141700	2145700	I haven't found those little fuckers to be peaceful actually.
2145700	2151980	Here's the thing, I'll land on a peaceful planet where it says the sentinels are limited
2151980	2156500	or whatever the word is that lets you know they're not going to really be aggressive,
2156500	2160260	but then I'll have to go to a building and to get in the building I have to shoot the
2160260	2164140	door down, which is even going to make the peaceful sentinels pissed off at you, so it's
2164140	2168980	like okay I'm going to have to do this battle whether I like it or not.
2168980	2176020	But honestly the best way I've found to not be harassed by those sentinels, mine the plutonium
2176020	2179900	or whatever it is you need, mine the plutonium, then run like a bitch before the sentinel gets
2179900	2180900	there.
2180900	2185200	Just run, run, run, and then they'll scan the thing, but you're gone.
2185200	2188500	If that doesn't work, run inside a nearby building.
2188500	2192940	Hopefully you're near a building, because honestly everything you need to do can be
2192940	2194500	by buildings.
2194500	2198000	There's always plutoniums near buildings, there's always thamium 9 or whatever that's
2198000	2204940	called near buildings, or get the thamium 9 in space, it's far easier, hint, there's
2204940	2208760	always plutonium near buildings and if those things mess with you just run in a building.
2208760	2209940	That's how I've been doing it.
2209940	2214360	And use the plutonium to fuel your little booster thing that lets you get in the ship
2214360	2217920	and fly to the next question mark so you don't have to walk for five minutes.
2217920	2220240	Unless you want to.
2220240	2221240	That's the beauty of it.
2221240	2222240	Do whatever the hell you want.
2222240	2223240	And what's up with the take off fuel?
2223240	2228920	Oh, you expelled, you know, a quarter of your take off fuel for just taking off one
2228920	2229920	time.
2229920	2230920	It's like...
2230920	2231920	What?
2231920	2233280	Well, it's easy to replace with plutonium.
2233280	2235120	It's really easy to replace.
2235120	2239620	But my assumption is that later on you get some type of enhancement that you could put
2239620	2242960	on your ship that will lessen the amount of fuel that you use for things like that.
2242960	2244520	That's an assumption though.
2244520	2250560	So anyway, DungeonBuster points out that you can mine plutonium underground in peace if
2250560	2251560	you really want to.
2251600	2253000	There's still sentinels down there.
2253000	2254840	They will come after you.
2254840	2255840	Even underground.
2255840	2256840	He says they won't.
2256840	2257880	I wonder how far you're going underground.
2257880	2260280	I don't recommend going underground because you'll get lost.
2260280	2261280	You'll never come up.
2261280	2266280	Unless you have the appropriate weapon to blow a hole, you know, to get out wherever
2266280	2267280	you want.
2267280	2271360	But if you don't have that weapon, I don't see the advantage of going in caves.
2271360	2275160	Except that sometimes you find a lot of green chip items.
2275160	2277180	I don't know what the hell else to call those things in there.
2277180	2278180	I don't know.
2278180	2281120	They're neutral items.
2281120	2285080	They're not alkali or whatever.
2285080	2287600	The one planet I was on actually had giant floating gold.
2287600	2291160	Like it was just, hey, here's some floating rocks of gold.
2291160	2292160	All right.
2292160	2293160	Cool.
2293160	2294160	I like this planet.
2294160	2295160	It's like flying.
2295160	2296160	Like what's that big shiny thing?
2296160	2297160	Gold.
2297160	2298160	Okay.
2298160	2299160	Cool.
2299160	2300160	Bobby Black Wolf with another tip in chat.
2300160	2305280	And I didn't know this one over at live.fognetwork.com says, if you land on a landing pad, you don't
2305280	2306880	use up plutonium to take off.
2306880	2307880	I didn't realize that.
2307880	2308880	Yeah.
2308880	2309880	I've tried that.
2309880	2314320	I looked over to where there's a landing pad, land, and it lands next to the landing pad
2314320	2315320	on the ground.
2315320	2316320	I'm like.
2316320	2319080	I think you kind of have to use a bi-chip pass to call it over to the pad.
2319080	2320080	I don't know.
2320080	2322600	I don't know how to make that word right.
2322600	2324440	And Dartitsia says, Rob is right.
2324440	2325440	I love that phrase.
2325440	2329400	I went into a cave to my minerals and I was wandering around for like 10 minutes trying
2329400	2330400	to get back to the exit.
2330400	2331400	Yeah.
2331400	2332400	Be careful.
2332400	2333400	Be careful people.
2333400	2334400	All right.
2334400	2335400	Anyway.
2335400	2336400	So No Man's Sky.
2336400	2337620	I like it, but it's not an action packed game.
2337620	2340500	I think that's the most important thing today is not an action packed game.
2340500	2344940	And just because everybody's playing in the same universe, don't expect like fricking
2344940	2347180	30 people running on the planet that you're on.
2347180	2348460	That's not going to happen.
2348460	2355540	So if you're cool with like a Minecraft ish kind of experience, that's more what No Man's
2355540	2356540	Sky.
2356540	2359180	No Man's Sky reminds me more of Minecraft than anything else.
2359180	2362380	But that's, that's me anyway.
2362380	2365380	But yet I'm more into No Man's Sky than Minecraft.
2365380	2366380	It's weird.
2366380	2367380	Okay.
2367380	2368380	Different strokes for different folks.
2368380	2375060	Other games I've been playing this week, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo 3 a little
2375060	2380060	bit, a lot of Blizzard stuff, but just, that's kind of what I play on PC, Fallout SE 14 still.
2380060	2381260	Just checking in on that.
2381260	2382540	Otherwise not a lot of new stuff.
2382540	2385540	No Man's Sky really took up my week as far as the new games go.
2385540	2387300	So Mike, hey, how was your gaming week?
2387300	2390100	What'd you play this week?
2390100	2391100	Quite a bit actually.
2391100	2392420	I think about it.
2392420	2396340	I recently got a 3DS.
2396340	2401000	So of course, I decided to play some Alpha Sapphire.
2401000	2406540	Check out the new stuff cause I haven't played, you know, I didn't play any of the, oh gosh,
2406540	2409300	between 4 and whatever the hell else we're on now.
2409300	2411020	I haven't played those ones.
2411020	2414660	Stopped after G3 so like seeing the remake, pretty cool.
2414660	2421580	Let's see, I'm playing Overwatch.
2421780	2423620	Overwatch is fun.
2423620	2425260	Play a lot of that, mostly.
2425260	2426860	What characters do you like in Overwatch?
2426860	2428220	What do you like to play as?
2428220	2430740	D.Va cause she's amazing.
2430740	2431740	D.Va's pretty cool.
2431740	2432740	D.Va.
2432740	2433740	Actually, no, I don't really play as D.Va.
2433740	2436980	I can't really, I haven't played with her since the patch though so I need to try her
2436980	2437980	again.
2437980	2439900	She's fucking fantastic since that patch.
2439900	2441060	Oh my god.
2441060	2443380	I hate other people that play D.Va on the other team.
2443380	2448480	I've figured out that, you know, the, what is it, the rocket boost, the upward rocket
2448480	2455000	boost and just launch it, then pop your ult and get it to where you can just wipe, yeah,
2455000	2456000	it's amazing.
2456000	2459880	I might want to try that cause I love playing Pharah and, you know, she flies and does all
2459880	2460880	that stuff too.
2460880	2466360	Oh, it's so great because I'll do that and then emote and sometimes I miss but whatever.
2466360	2467360	It makes me feel good.
2467360	2473000	You got some haters in chat, Rama says D.Va is trash lol.
2473000	2476200	She probably, no.
2476200	2478960	When it comes to Doritos and Mountain Dew maybe, but, yeah, pretty much.
2478960	2481000	I love, she's a trashy eater.
2481000	2482680	I love the D.Va memes online.
2482680	2488400	Oh my god, have you seen the one of Ana giving her those little strawberry candies?
2488400	2489400	No.
2489400	2491040	It's like, frick yes, grandma candy.
2491040	2492960	It's so good.
2492960	2493960	That's great.
2493960	2495360	I love it.
2495360	2502560	Yeah, uh, let's see, I also play, um, I've been playing a lot of Zenyatta surprisingly
2502560	2504120	since the patch too.
2505000	2506400	He's a lot of fun.
2506400	2510160	And then my other one is Hanzo.
2510160	2516480	I'm surprisingly good with him for not being able to aim, like see where you're aiming.
2516480	2518720	I guess I'm just, I get lucky.
2518720	2519720	You're just that good.
2519720	2520720	Oh, I guess.
2520720	2522200	No, I straight up am lucky.
2522200	2524760	It's like, uh, ooh, I didn't mean to fire that.
2524760	2526520	Oh, he just ran right in front of it.
2526520	2527520	Cool.
2527520	2528520	That works.
2528520	2536400	Outside of Overwatch, still playing Hearthstone, they just released their new adventure.
2536400	2541200	And One Night in Karazhan is really fun and really frickin' cute.
2541200	2542440	That trailer was so ridiculous.
2542440	2543440	I loved it.
2543440	2544440	It was so good.
2544440	2545440	Oh my gosh.
2545440	2551320	Um, but yeah, it's very Disney-y.
2551320	2552320	Disney-y.
2552320	2553320	Yes, Disney-y.
2553320	2554320	Okay.
2554320	2558320	The first wing is pretty cool.
2558320	2563040	It's, yeah, you've got like, it's very Beauty and the Beast and then you've got like the
2563040	2565760	mirror from Snow White and stuff and it's weird.
2565760	2568400	But I was like, I don't see how this is Karazhan, but okay.
2568400	2569480	I love Karazhan.
2569480	2570480	I love Karazhan.
2570480	2571480	I love Karazhan too.
2571480	2576120	But I mean, it's just, um, Hearthstone is a silly Warcraft.
2576120	2581880	It's a silly Warcraft universe, but I like it and the cards aren't complete trash, so
2581880	2582880	yay.
2582880	2583880	Cool.
2584440	2588160	Um, I don't think I was playing anything else this week.
2588160	2590120	I don't think I had time to play much else.
2590120	2591120	All right.
2591120	2592120	So, great.
2592120	2593120	Yeah.
2593120	2594120	All right.
2594120	2596200	Well, before we get into some gaming news, just some quick housekeeping.
2596200	2601480	We will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be out of town in Atlanta.
2601480	2606940	For Dragon Con 2016, I'm still awaiting to hear if we're doing anything like appearing
2606940	2608280	on panels or anything like that.
2608280	2611280	I'm pretty sure some of our other network shows are probably going to show up on some
2611280	2616120	of the TV track panels and so forth, so we'll be plugging those over at vognetwork.com.
2616120	2618840	But we are looking, hopefully, at doing some type of show.
2618840	2623020	It won't be live, unfortunately, because the bandwidth at the, um, you know, during a huge
2623020	2625560	convention with thousands of people, bandwidth is not reliable, right?
2625560	2631680	But we're hoping to maybe tape something in a live-esque type of element and put it on
2631680	2637000	the feed, possibly the same Sunday that we won't actually be here.
2637000	2640740	So stay tuned for that because maybe there'll be special programming from Dragon Con in
2640740	2643740	the place of Bobby and OLR that Sunday.
2643740	2646980	It's, anyway, what we're looking at right now, potentially.
2646980	2651340	More details to come in a couple weeks, which I can't believe that Dragon Con's only like
2651340	2653300	three weeks away, but here we are.
2653300	2657020	Another year has gone by.
2657020	2658020	That's really it.
2658020	2662440	And then just a reminder that, unfortunately, Dark Sakura is going to be on a bit of a hiatus
2662440	2667140	for a few months, starting actually with that same Labor Day weekend.
2667700	2672140	That also will be kind of a weekend of transition as OLR is going to go through a few changes
2672140	2674140	when we come back.
2674140	2675140	But I'll be back.
2675140	2676140	Yeah, you'll be back.
2676140	2677140	It's not forever.
2677140	2678140	That's right.
2678140	2679260	She's not, you know, going away.
2679260	2680980	And she will still be a part of the show.
2680980	2682740	It's not exactly a vacation either.
2682740	2686320	Yeah, we're just still talking about how we're going to make that work.
2686320	2689900	So we may move some segments around, do some things a little differently.
2689900	2694460	So the formula you've been used to over the past few episodes may change a little bit
2694460	2695460	in a couple weeks.
2695460	2699940	But it will still be the same great OLR that you're used to, and you still get to chat
2699940	2702700	along with us and call in and all that fun stuff.
2702700	2703700	So there you go.
2703700	2709340	All right, let's get into the news and what's been going on in gaming around the world this
2709340	2710340	week.
2710340	2711340	Starting with Loki.
2711340	2715300	All right, let's see here.
2715300	2717140	So this is pretty cool.
2717140	2721300	Sony is, I mean, we kind of expected that there's got to be an announcement for the
2721300	2726380	PlayStation Neo at some point soon, because we are getting very close to the release date
2726380	2727380	to that.
2727380	2735180	So that is going to happen September 7th, according to some, I want to say, they announced
2735180	2738540	like some sort of meeting that would happen in New York City.
2738540	2744780	And one of the things that is going to be a focus would be the PlayStation Neo, since
2744780	2746820	that is something that is coming out around October.
2746820	2752260	However, there's something else that, there's a rumor that there may be a new PlayStation
2752260	2759940	Vita or some sort of handheld system as well that might be announced around the same time.
2759940	2762220	So that's interesting.
2762220	2763220	And it's right around the corner.
2763220	2766740	So I guess we'll have to see what exactly they're talking about.
2766740	2769420	But yeah.
2769420	2776020	I'm sure it's the Neo and all this stuff and, you know, but I'm curious what else.
2776020	2777780	I am curious about a new handheld system.
2777780	2780540	That'd be kind of interesting.
2780540	2783180	I'm wondering what exactly it's going to be.
2783180	2788460	There was, I remember where the evidence came from that it was, I wanted to see maybe those
2788460	2792380	FCC filings or something to the effect of like, they're going to have like a new radio
2792380	2793700	in the Vita or something.
2793700	2797540	Maybe the support instead of like, remember how they had the 3G model and they kind of
2797540	2801620	quickly got rid of that, but there might be like a 4G LTE model or something.
2801620	2807060	So I'm wondering if they're going to try another portable system.
2807060	2808060	Cross my fingers.
2808060	2809060	Hopefully it's better than the last one.
2809060	2811820	I mean, I don't know.
2811820	2813380	The back touch thing was really stupid.
2813380	2815180	I didn't like that.
2815180	2816180	Yeah.
2816180	2821100	I think there's a lot of people that would like to see Sony take another stab at a handheld,
2821100	2822100	but I just don't.
2822100	2825780	Well, but then again, we have to remember in Japan, it's still like there's games coming
2825780	2826780	out every week.
2826780	2827780	It's still a thing.
2827780	2833980	Maybe there is a reason for Sony to do a new handheld, but I would think here's the other
2833980	2834980	thing.
2834980	2839580	I would think news like that, like a new handheld at least would hold off till the PlayStation
2839580	2844740	experience in December, unless that sucker's coming out for this holiday, which I just,
2844740	2845740	I don't know.
2845740	2847620	It just seems so fast for an announcement like that.
2847620	2848620	You know what I mean?
2848620	2851140	They usually have something that takes a lot more time to build up.
2851140	2855220	So I don't know, but I would think if they're going to tease a handheld, it would be at
2855220	2858540	the PlayStation experience, which would be a little more dedicated to the fans and not
2858540	2859780	this event in New York city.
2859780	2860980	So I don't know.
2860980	2864460	But they're like talking about like, you know, financials or something or like a plan for
2864460	2870780	what they're going to be doing for, you know, the PlayStation business line.
2870780	2874180	Maybe that's why they're bringing it up, you know, Hey, here's something that's coming.
2874180	2878400	It's not necessarily something that's coming right around the corner, but it may be like
2878400	2882180	next holiday or something like that.
2882180	2885100	Still don't know what the, you know, maybe they're thinking they're going to compete
2885100	2890860	with whatever this Nintendo system is, which we still don't know really much of anything.
2890860	2893500	Well, you're right.
2893500	2898060	We don't know much about that, but I hope, hopefully by the time this event rolls around,
2898060	2899060	we'll know a little more.
2899060	2903140	Although I imagine Nintendo is probably doing their own reveal in that same September timeframe.
2903140	2905020	At least that's what the buzz is.
2905020	2907720	So we'll see.
2907720	2911220	Interesting comment from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2911220	2916860	Dobby says, again, you don't want to get overshadowed so early on once an X is revealed.
2916860	2922200	People will be talking nothing else, but that I don't know about nothing else, but certainly
2922200	2925460	when NX is announced, it's going to dominate the conversation for a little bit.
2925460	2926460	Okay.
2926460	2929220	But I think if Sony were to announce a, announce a handheld, it's not like nobody's going to
2929220	2930220	pay attention to that.
2930220	2936540	So here was, here's what led them to thinking that there was going to be another handheld
2936540	2937540	maybe.
2937740	2943140	So basically there is an FCC wireless chip filing from Sony for a five year Hertz wireless
2943140	2951860	chip and the hardware, it says, looks like the Vita or something.
2951860	2958180	So there's a, I don't know what that could be a part of, but interesting.
2958180	2959180	We'll see.
2959180	2960180	All right.
2960180	2964220	Well, let's move on and talk about something kind of related to the Olympics.
2964220	2968860	No, video games are not showing up at the Olympics officially, but there is kind of
2968860	2971460	this like adjacent thing going on.
2971460	2975620	It's the Rio 2016 Olympics eGames showcase.
2975620	2979620	So while the Olympics are going on, there's actually going to be an eGames showcase going
2979620	2980620	on.
2980620	2985740	And I think it's actually streaming on Tuesday, August 16th, and it's starting at 11 AM in
2985740	2986740	Brazil.
2986740	2989780	So that's going to be really early for folks here on the West coast if you want to see
2989780	2993860	some of that, but I'm sure some of the highlights will be all over YouTube and such.
2993860	2997680	But in this eGames showcase, they're actually only showing a couple of games.
2997680	3002120	They're going to just be doing Super Smash Brothers for Wii U is one of the selections
3002120	3003120	that they're doing.
3003120	3007340	And then they're doing Smite, which, you know, that MOBA free to play that's on PC and all
3007340	3008340	that.
3008340	3009340	That's it.
3009340	3014940	There's no, I don't know, League of Legends or Starcraft or, you know, some of those other
3014940	3016840	big heroes, the Storm.
3016840	3018020	Those other games are not involved.
3018020	3019340	It's just those two games.
3019340	3022460	But there will be players from around the world that are going to be going to Rio to
3022460	3030820	take part, including Larry Loehr from the US, Canadian Evo champion ally.
3030820	3036020	And there's a guy in Mexico, MK Leo, who's really good at Smash that will also be there
3036020	3037020	as well.
3037020	3038220	So they are going to be doing this.
3038220	3040340	By the way, no prize money on the line.
3040340	3044860	This is just for bragging rights, national pride, if you will.
3044860	3049940	So as I, and I would say as the Olympics are, but I thought I heard a story that you actually
3049940	3052840	do get a cash prize for medals at the Olympics.
3052840	3054260	They just don't ever really talk about that.
3054260	3058820	So I guess that will not quite be the same thing, but, you know, still kind of neat to
3058820	3064820	see that gaming is, even if it's not a part of the Olympics officially, it's still kind
3064820	3068520	of being spoke in a similar sense around the same time.
3068520	3072700	So it's certainly progress from where we were at four years ago, that's for sure.
3072700	3077020	So yeah, look forward to that on Tuesday.
3077020	3079540	Meanwhile, Dark Sakura.
3079540	3083260	Well there's a game that a lot of people have been looking forward to, which is Final Fantasy
3083260	3084380	XV.
3084380	3090540	And as we know, it did of course start off its life as a different game.
3090540	3095540	It initially was Final Fantasy versus XIII and became Final Fantasy XV.
3095540	3104180	Well now after all these changes and everything, it looks like there is a delay for the game.
3104180	3113220	It's uh, well at least it's going to be on September 30th now is what's on the list,
3113220	3119100	but there's no word as if it's going to be further delayed, although that's the theory.
3119100	3124360	But yeah, it's not going to be as soon as we thought.
3124360	3129620	It was, um, hold on let me see something.
3129620	3133940	Yeah it looks like on here that there was supposed to be a two month delay after September
3133940	3136580	30th, so my apologies I misread the thing.
3136580	3140020	That September 30th is still the listed date, but the rumor is that there's going to be
3140020	3141980	a two month delay after that.
3141980	3143260	So sorry.
3143260	3146820	But what's interesting about that is that that was supposed to be announced today, because
3146820	3153140	I think the GameStop stuff was going to allow the switcheroo on Monday.
3153140	3156200	Unless they're going to announce it tomorrow morning, which I guess is certainly still
3156200	3157420	possible as well.
3157420	3162180	But it does seem like there's a lot of, it's kind of one of those where there's smoke there's
3162180	3167880	fire sort of things, and it's not like, you know, oh my roommate has a boyfriend that
3167880	3173140	works at GameStop that, you know, copied this thing, you know, it's, there seems to be some
3173140	3177420	hard evidence that yeah, Final Fantasy 15 is getting delayed.
3177420	3178840	What do you guys think if it does get delayed?
3178840	3179840	Do you think it's-
3179840	3180840	Oh well.
3180840	3186220	Yeah, it's honestly like, okay, I'm like, ah damn it, you know, that's the exact my
3186220	3187220	reaction.
3187220	3188220	Ah damn it.
3188260	3192860	If it makes the game better, like especially going back to No Man's Sky PC and all that,
3192860	3198180	like I cannot sit here and go, man, what the hell are they doing with No Man's Sky?
3198180	3202300	They shouldn't have released this buggy piece of shit on PC and all that.
3202300	3203460	I can't say that.
3203460	3208180	And then in the same breath say, how dare they delay No Man's- or how dare they delay
3208180	3210660	Final Fantasy 15 for two months, you know?
3210660	3214380	I honestly don't care enough about the game to care about it being delayed.
3214380	3215380	What?
3215380	3217100	I'm super ready for it.
3217100	3218500	I'm excited to play 15.
3218500	3219660	I'm not too excited about it.
3219660	3226380	I wasn't too happy with 13 and 14 I got bored with after a while for being the MMO.
3226380	3230020	I'm going to give it a shot, but like the demos haven't been that great.
3230020	3231660	Yeah, I wasn't impressed with the demos either.
3231660	3232660	I'm excited for it.
3232660	3233660	Yeah, I'm with you.
3233660	3234660	I'm excited for it.
3234660	3235660	Like I preordered it.
3235660	3241460	I'm just so used to like the turn-based battle system that I really like that and I'm just
3241460	3242460	kind of sad that-
3242460	3243580	That was a while ago.
3243580	3247220	That was several Final Fantasy games ago, so it's like-
3247220	3248220	That was 13, okay?
3248220	3251940	That was the last fucking Final Fantasy game that was out.
3251940	3253820	It was so long ago, the last one.
3253820	3256580	It was, because they've had two sequels for it.
3256580	3257580	13 wasn't-
3257580	3258580	It's basically-
3258580	3259580	Really turn-based.
3259580	3260580	Sure was.
3260580	3261580	The last turn-based-
3261580	3262580	No, 10.2.
3262580	3263580	It had the whole active time-
3263580	3264580	Okay, fine.
3264580	3267100	Active time battle system, whatever.
3267100	3268100	Same shit.
3268100	3269100	No, no, no, no.
3269100	3270100	It's just a different twist on it.
3270100	3271100	No, no, no, no.
3271100	3272320	Yeah, 10.2 was the same as 13.
3272320	3278360	It was the auto-battling and you only did the whole special moves in that thing, remember?
3278360	3281240	Right, but this is totally different from that.
3281240	3285760	You're basically running around and actually engaging in stuff, which-
3285760	3287960	This would worry me if I were Square Enix.
3287960	3293540	This whole fact that maybe half of us are hyped and half of us aren't, because it definitely
3293540	3297520	seems like they've poured a ton of money into this game and they need it to do well, so
3297520	3298520	they need that hype to be there.
3298880	3304760	I'm fine with going into it not being that hyped about it, but it's like, for me, I don't
3304760	3305760	know.
3305760	3310200	The great Final Fantasy games I think of are the ones that are, for me, the easiest to
3310200	3311680	pick up the story.
3311680	3320240	Seven I thought was pretty easy to pick up, even, you know, six, 13 kind of confused me.
3320240	3323440	15, I have no fucking clue what the hell's going on.
3323440	3324840	The movie trailer looks fucking awesome, though.
3324840	3325840	I do want to see that.
3325920	3329680	To be fair, 13 wasn't that great, if you ask me.
3329680	3334160	I love 13, I'll defend it, but I get it's not for everybody.
3334160	3335160	I don't want to have that talk today.
3335160	3341440	I'm just saying, like, you know, I go back to, like, Lost Odyssey, which I think was
3341440	3348080	more Final Fantasy game than Final Fantasy was, Final Fantasy 13 was, so I don't know.
3348080	3349080	It looked cool?
3349080	3352320	But yet, Lost Odyssey didn't sell.
3352320	3353320	It's unfortunate.
3353320	3354320	That's too bad.
3354440	3356800	If they'd put it on PlayStation 3, it probably would have.
3356800	3361200	It's because, you know, it's because people, there's people on both sides out there, there's
3361200	3365080	people who complain, ah, another turn-based game.
3365080	3366880	No one fights like that.
3366880	3371320	You're not just going to, oh, I'm going to wait while you attack me.
3371320	3374320	And then those people want this, and then they're going to, there's people that don't
3374320	3375320	want that.
3375320	3376320	I don't know.
3376320	3379880	I didn't really care for, I thought it was a hassle.
3380120	3386000	The new demo, a little bit better, but I still thought it was a little chaotic.
3386000	3388400	Like I just, it's hard to keep track of what the hell's going on.
3388400	3390080	I'd rather just have it.
3390080	3391080	It's fine.
3391080	3392080	You don't need an active time battle system.
3392080	3393080	That's, that's cool.
3393080	3396840	But just like the same presentation is fine because that's what made it a Final Fantasy
3396840	3398640	game.
3398640	3402920	William Murderface in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn is
3402920	3404440	a pretty good story so far.
3404440	3407600	Everyone seems to forget about that part, but it's an important one that is well done
3407600	3408600	in my opinion.
3408840	3410480	I actually like agree with that.
3410480	3413160	And Heaven's Word, the expansion is even better.
3413160	3418160	It's so like, I think the Heaven's Word story is like the best story in the Final Fantasy
3418160	3420680	universe since like six.
3420680	3421680	It's that good.
3421680	3427520	And unfortunately most people will never see it because it's an MMO.
3427520	3429640	It's an MMO, which puts people off.
3429640	3432320	It's end game, which puts people off.
3432320	3435960	It's it's, but just the reality is it's a magnificent story.
3435960	3437040	If you can get there.
3437040	3442440	The problem with Final Fantasy 14 is that there is no way to level without doing some
3442440	3444600	of those instances.
3444600	3450200	And it's horrible because I made it all the way through to when I got to 85 in World of
3450200	3456800	Warcraft, I hadn't done a single instance, a single one, and I didn't craft either.
3456800	3460560	And you shouldn't have to have to do those if you don't want to.
3460560	3462720	But they were some really fucking cool fights.
3462720	3464600	But I don't care.
3464600	3465600	Really cool fights.
3465600	3466600	I don't care.
3466600	3468680	That's what I was into.
3468680	3473440	The whole point is that it should have something for everybody and you shouldn't be forced
3473440	3476720	to play a game the way they think you should play it.
3476720	3477720	Yeah.
3477720	3479720	Yeah, you're right.
3479720	3483000	Comparing it to WoW in that in that regard, you're right.
3483000	3484600	I did the same exact thing in Warcraft.
3484600	3490080	Like I made it up to, no, well, at the time it was, I think the cap was 90.
3490080	3494600	Yeah, I made it all the way up to 90 without doing any instances and stuff.
3495360	3496880	It's so funny because I have been playing World of Warcraft.
3496880	3500200	I'm doing nothing but instances because I'm like, questing is too slow.
3500200	3505920	The questing has actually been super fast and I'm playing through now Sakurina when
3505920	3509240	I left at like 86 when I left.
3509240	3515520	And the leveling is actually much faster now for the the Pandaria content.
3515520	3517880	So it's been pretty fun.
3517880	3525480	I'm actually looking forward to doing a Horde side for the other, for whatever.
3525480	3526480	Draenor?
3526480	3531600	Yeah, but I was trying to think of dude's name, the asshole, former war chief.
3531600	3532600	Garrosh?
3532600	3534960	Yeah, because I just like seeing him die.
3534960	3537160	I really just like seeing him fail.
3537160	3539640	It's awesome because I hated him.
3539640	3540640	All right.
3540640	3544000	Well, let's move on to some other stuff.
3544000	3547480	Back to rumors about upcoming consoles, right, Logi?
3547480	3553840	Of course, we do love our rumors and love our leaks about said rumors.
3553840	3558040	So Nintendo, of course, you know, they have their wonderful NX coming out.
3558040	3560200	We still don't know what the fuck it is.
3560200	3564760	But there's all sorts of rumors regarding, you know, maybe it's this controller that,
3564760	3568200	you know, attaches to some sort of tablet thing.
3568200	3574360	And then now there's this new trademark filing that they have or copyright filing or patent
3574360	3579160	filing, I should say, for a clip on controller.
3579160	3583440	And the device almost looks like what they were describing with those NX rumors.
3583440	3588960	So basically, it looks like some sort of controller that in this case, it looks like the left
3588960	3591800	or right half of like a SNES controller.
3591800	3598640	So they show four buttons and there's like a, I don't know if it's like a metal pad or
3598640	3604760	something that connects to maybe magnetically and it allows it to, you know, send data electricity
3604760	3607560	or whatever to the actual attachment.
3607560	3613280	Neat, I guess, but I don't know.
3613280	3617000	I don't know why, but it sounds like wireless charging to me or something is what that kind
3617000	3618400	of reminds me of.
3618400	3622840	I mean, sort of like I'm surprised like something like this can be patented because, I mean,
3622840	3627600	it's just it's basically just like having some sort of thing.
3627600	3631320	I don't know, some add-on controller or something, which I know a lot of devices have.
3631320	3634800	They have it for mobile where you can pass through, you know, stuff through their charge
3634800	3637800	board.
3637800	3638800	I don't know.
3638800	3642960	I guess we'll have to see what it is and see what exactly this gimmick the NX is.
3642960	3647600	But it would be more fuel for those rumors, I guess.
3647600	3650280	It would be nice for Nintendo to say something already.
3650280	3651960	I understand that why they're not.
3651960	3653880	But it's just like, God, I'm so sick of rumors.
3654880	3660080	Every time I hear a new one, I'm like, this sounds like just so like.
3660080	3665880	I'm worried about it, and the reason I'm worried about Nintendo is I think that some of their
3665880	3670800	like big like, OK, we're really going to like disrupt everything by the motion controls
3670800	3674800	and that that worked out well for them, then they're like, oh, we're going to disrupt everything
3674800	3679920	by having the second screen tablet thing that didn't work out so well.
3679960	3685200	And I'm worried that like this is going to be something that's just going to be kind
3685200	3690880	of here's this really cool gimmick we thought of and no one gives a shit.
3690880	3694960	Interesting comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying
3694960	3699840	rumors killed No Man's Sky and Shadow Next Gen follows that up with unchecked expectations.
3699840	3700840	Yeah.
3700840	3706360	Is that, you know, a lot of people, because there was so such vagueness about No Man's
3706360	3709520	Sky, a lot of people kind of filled in the blanks with their headcanon.
3709520	3712440	And then when that wasn't met, it's a disappointment.
3712440	3715920	And people, I think what you're getting at is that people are doing the same thing with
3715920	3716920	the NX.
3716920	3719600	Is that because, you know, we think it's going to be this.
3719600	3723960	And then when Nintendo announces, well, it's it's it's not as grand as you thought it was.
3723960	3729560	I just you know what this screams to me like, remember the Wii and all the fucking attachments
3729560	3734560	that attached to the Wii and how much of a fucking nightmare that was.
3734560	3735560	This is kind of what it was.
3735560	3736560	So cool.
3736560	3737560	I'm kidding.
3737560	3743040	This is like, you know, kind of in that they didn't have like they had a lot of weird plastic
3743040	3744040	shit that was unnecessary.
3744040	3746000	So I'm not really talking about that.
3746000	3749560	I'm talking about like, you know, they had the classic controller, they had the nunchuck
3749560	3750560	thing.
3750560	3754280	They had maybe those were the only two things that they had, but they had some other stuff
3754280	3756360	that I thought connected to it as well.
3756360	3761080	They I know definitely in planning had a lot more things, but it just kind of seems like
3761080	3762080	that.
3762080	3765320	Like, is this what's going to do like, oh, hey, we need some more buttons here.
3765320	3770360	We're just going to release this game with another button half controller thing or something
3770360	3773120	that we're going to attach here.
3773120	3775880	You can customize where your controls are or something.
3775880	3776880	I mean, I don't know what this is.
3776880	3777880	Well, let's see.
3777880	3781960	We're all speculating about this until I see what exactly this is.
3781960	3785880	I just don't really care too much right now.
3785880	3786880	That's it.
3786880	3789200	I mean, I need to see what exactly this thing's putting out, because if it's just basically
3789200	3796760	a Wii U without being tethered to a console, I mean, that's cool, but I'm not super excited
3796760	3797760	for it.
3797760	3804440	I may pick it up because that's a neat idea, but it's not like, shit, I need to have one
3804440	3805440	of these right away.
3805440	3810480	I just think it's going to be shadowed by cooler things that are going to come out,
3810480	3813040	especially more VR stuff.
3813040	3815800	I mean, we're talking like six months time.
3815800	3819560	I mean, VR technology is getting better and better each day.
3819560	3820560	I will say this.
3820560	3825200	We've played our Wii U more than anything in our house as far as the newer systems.
3825200	3827240	So I'm really looking forward to the NX.
3827240	3831600	If it gives me more of all the stuff that I like for the Wii U, I'm happy.
3831600	3833560	Yeah, I'm excited for NX.
3833560	3837800	I just kind of, it's like, I don't know what to get excited for.
3837800	3838800	So I'm making it up.
3838800	3842760	And I don't give a shit about VR, so.
3842760	3843760	I have to admit.
3843760	3848120	I'm starting to wonder if I might cancel the PlayStation VR pre-order, but that is, I still
3848120	3849240	like VR.
3849240	3853440	This has more to do with, I'm really worried about this whole fact that they're putting
3853440	3855200	out the Neo.
3855200	3859320	And does that mean that VR doesn't work as well on the old system?
3859320	3860320	That's more my problem.
3860320	3861320	That's exactly it.
3861320	3864600	And if they didn't talk about the Neo or anything, you know, if this was something that's coming
3864600	3867400	out next year, then I might not be so worried about it.
3867400	3871560	But it's like, you just met, you know, you mentioned that VR is going to be better on
3871560	3872960	it somehow.
3872960	3873960	How exactly?
3873960	3877160	Because that kind of stuff worries me, and I'm kind of with you on that.
3877160	3883040	Like if I get a PC built before then that runs, you know, the Rift or the Vive, and
3883040	3886960	it's definitely going to go with the Vive, then fuck that, I'm canceling that shit.
3886960	3890120	Because a lot of those things that they're showing off, don't get me wrong, Rez looks
3890120	3895400	awesome, but like everything else is a really short experience.
3895400	3897920	And I want like a full-fledged game with it.
3897920	3900680	I don't want this like, cool, I did a mission.
3900680	3901680	We're done.
3901680	3903280	You know, or cool, I looked around a room.
3903280	3904280	I don't care.
3904280	3905280	I've done that.
3905280	3906280	I've done that already.
3906280	3909720	I want something that's a full experience.
3909720	3913640	All right, well, I want to move on.
3913640	3915120	Actually, did you talk about this other thing?
3915120	3916120	Oh, I was going to say, yeah.
3916120	3921160	And also, one of the things, good things though about the NX is Dragon Quest X has been confirmed
3921160	3922520	to be coming to the NX.
3922520	3924680	So that's cool.
3924680	3927760	So they're going to get an MMO.
3927760	3932600	And an anticipated one that we've needed for a long time, to be quite honest.
3932600	3933600	Yep.
3933600	3935440	And apparently it is also coming out for PlayStation 4.
3935440	3941320	I'm not sure if that's going to be confirmed.
3941320	3944580	It's not necessarily confirmed to be coming over here.
3944580	3946120	And that could be the same with the NX.
3946120	3947520	It may be in Japan though.
3947520	3953800	Well, anyhow, I want to move on to another story about a comment from Bethesda about
3953800	3956640	the Nintendo NX that a lot of people are going, hmm.
3956640	3962240	And in this interview with an Australian news publication, Finder, excuse me, they were
3962240	3966080	talking to Pete Hines, who's the vice president of Bethesda Softworks, and they're asking
3966080	3967520	about the Nintendo NX.
3967520	3971160	And Pete Hines said, yeah, they know what Nintendo is doing with NX.
3971160	3975160	They've been briefed on the situation, but they're not really committing to the platform
3975160	3977760	saying this, we talk to Nintendo all the time.
3977760	3980560	We're pretty well briefed in on what they're doing.
3980560	3982000	It's definitely something we will look at.
3982000	3985320	And our philosophy is that we will put our games out on any format that supports the
3985320	3987440	games as we envision and make them.
3987440	3991660	If the NX fits that from a technical standpoint, and it fits the game that a developer in our
3991660	3995020	stable is making, I don't see why we would not put it out on NX.
3995020	3998580	But it's too early to say we'll definitely be putting games out or not.
3998580	4001520	Like with mobile, we want to have the right fit for the right formats.
4001520	4005280	You know, he could be dancing the line a little bit and just not wanting to show his cards
4005280	4006600	if they do have something to announce.
4006600	4009160	I mean, there's a million ways you could read this.
4009160	4014420	But I definitely just pick up this sense of the NX might not be as technically superior
4014420	4020180	as what's going on with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which we kind of knew is a potential,
4020180	4021180	right?
4021180	4026860	And, you know, Bethesda tends to make pretty intense games that really push things graphically,
4026860	4027860	right?
4027860	4032580	Like your Skyrim at that time, your Doom at this time, you know, and you kind of wonder,
4032580	4035220	like, would these games really run on Nintendo NX?
4035220	4039340	You know, it's probably going to be challenged.
4039340	4041340	And so I get it from that regard.
4041340	4045780	But let's not forget Bethesda also has that card game for Elder Scrolls.
4045780	4048580	The Fallout Shelter is a pretty big thing.
4048580	4050500	These are things that probably would work on NX.
4050500	4051500	Right.
4051500	4055820	Though I'm not saying put those games on NX, but those future developments in that same
4055820	4056820	way.
4056820	4057820	Once again, that worries me.
4057820	4064020	I mean, like, I understand that, that like on the 3DS, their first party titles do well
4064020	4067760	and they've got a good library of games on the 3DS.
4067760	4068980	That's fine.
4068980	4070900	The Wii U, they have great first party titles.
4070900	4073860	No one's arguing that their first party titles aren't great.
4073860	4074940	It's the third party titles.
4074940	4079900	And when you have that hardware that can't run these engines that run these modern games,
4079900	4082700	like all the fucking shit that's coming from EA is in Frostbite.
4082700	4084860	That shit does not run on the Wii U.
4084860	4089620	And if it doesn't run on the NX, we're just looking at the same fucking scenario again.
4089620	4090620	And that's fine.
4090620	4091620	I know people are like, oh, well, fuck it.
4091620	4093580	I don't need EA games.
4093580	4098600	But you're getting, as stuff goes along, they're pushing better graphics and more stuff on
4098600	4101440	screen and they're going to have more sophisticated engines.
4101440	4106440	That shit is not going to run on these, the system, if it's that underpowered and they're
4106440	4108920	going to have a problem because yeah, great.
4108920	4110880	First party tells me help that system.
4110880	4115240	But if that's all they got, we're going to be in a scenario right now where look at the
4115240	4117320	release schedule for the Wii U.
4117320	4122380	I mean, it's just every couple months or something coming out for it.
4122380	4123380	And that's it.
4123380	4124740	There's like nothing in between.
4124740	4126560	It's just deserted.
4126560	4130000	It's just, I don't know.
4130000	4131320	I'm just worried about it.
4131320	4136000	I really do think though NX was pushed back from this year so that that's not going to
4136000	4138200	happen in Nintendo's first year.
4138200	4139200	I really think that's what they're doing.
4139200	4140200	I hope that's the case.
4140200	4141200	I really do.
4141200	4143040	Because when I hear that they're thinking about VR and thinking about this, it makes
4143040	4147360	me wonder that they don't have a fucking idea of what this thing is going to be.
4147360	4149200	They're just still up in the air about it.
4149200	4151040	And I don't know.
4151040	4155440	I'm just very worried about what they have to say about this.
4155440	4157760	I'm not having high expectations for it.
4157760	4158760	All right.
4158760	4163240	Well, also in that same interview, I just want to mention with Bethesda, this is on
4163240	4167260	a different note, has nothing to do with Nintendo NX or does it?
4167260	4171120	Apparently the comment was that the evil within did make enough money to justify a sequel.
4171120	4172440	That actually surprised me to hear that.
4172440	4175480	I didn't think that game did so hot, but apparently it did.
4175480	4181680	So the evil within may be getting a signal, a sequel and rage also performs well enough
4181680	4183000	to justify a sequel.
4183000	4187640	So now again, they're not confirming or denying anything, not saying what is happening for
4187640	4191600	sure or when, but don't take it off the table essentially.
4191600	4199040	But we'll have to wait for a future E3 or some other type of event to find the confirmation
4199040	4200360	in those.
4200360	4201760	So we'll see.
4201760	4204160	All right.
4204160	4205160	Let's move on.
4205160	4206680	Next story, Dark Saga, before we get to release dates.
4206680	4213400	Well in the wake of the Metroid 2 fan remake, there was another one that was called Pokemon
4213400	4218840	Uranium and Nintendo's put down the C and D on that one.
4218840	4224640	It was done by a nonprofit, it was put out on PC for free and 1.5 million people downloaded
4224640	4225640	it.
4225640	4231420	It had been in development for over nine years and had 150 custom Pokemon and a type called
4231420	4232420	nuclear.
4232420	4236460	So Nintendo's like, uh-uh, no, stop.
4236460	4243820	So I'm sure you can still find it in places, but yeah, they finally put out a note on there
4243820	4247260	and it said they took it down.
4247260	4254220	You can still talk about it, still share content about the game, but we aren't going to make
4254220	4256780	it available on the site anymore.
4256780	4257820	I think no one's surprised.
4257820	4258820	They put it up.
4258820	4259820	They know it's going to get taken down.
4259820	4262660	They know that someone's going to grab it and once it's on the internet, it's always
4262660	4263660	on the internet.
4263660	4268980	So I think it's naive to believe that any of these people that are developing these
4268980	4273980	fan games about Nintendo properties are surprised that they're getting a C and D from Nintendo
4273980	4275860	regarding that.
4275860	4278100	I think that's just part of the plan.
4278100	4283420	That get it up, get people to download it and just wait for the C and D, take it down,
4283420	4285520	but it's too late.
4285520	4288260	It's already there and that's it.
4288780	4289780	Yeah.
4289780	4293300	I mean, they, they have to know that these things are going to get C and D'd and you
4293300	4295580	know, I'm curious how that game is though.
4295580	4297460	I heard that one was not so good.
4297460	4298620	What, the Pokemon Uranium?
4298620	4301700	Their Uranium one is not so good.
4301700	4304660	There's another, there's not even Pokemon Uranium.
4304660	4308220	There's some like MMO Pokemon thing that I see on Twitch all the time that certainly
4308220	4311580	can't be permissible either, but it's still floating around out there.
4311580	4314340	I don't know if that's something that was released a long time ago that was pulled,
4314340	4317340	but yeah, things have a way of getting on the internet and then never getting off.
4317340	4321180	And you know, again, don't, don't share the link here as Bobby saying in our chat room
4321180	4324860	because you know, we don't want the C's and D's but seriously, it's not that hard
4324860	4330980	to go out there onto a torrent site of your choosing and find it.
4330980	4331980	Or other forums.
4331980	4335660	I'm sure they've got a fan game set at one time I found one that was for like Mario games
4335660	4336660	and stuff like that.
4336660	4340540	So I know that those exists and you can probably find a link on there for it.
4340540	4341540	That was it.
4341540	4345040	Thank you Act F. Pokemon Omicron is the one I was thinking of that MMO one that I see
4345040	4347880	on Twitch sometimes.
4347880	4352720	So by the way, did you know, um, no, I know we talked last week about the AM2R and all
4352720	4353720	that.
4353720	4356320	Did you know also the Nintendo power archive got pulled?
4356320	4357720	Yeah, I saw that.
4357720	4358720	Yeah.
4358720	4364040	That's like, again, it's like these magazines are how old it's like in a way I'm like,
4364040	4368340	would you go to a library and take them out of the library and like, okay, I get that
4368340	4374000	an online resource is not the same thing as a library, but you know, times are changing
4374000	4378920	and for people to look at, you know, I really got a kick out of looking at some of the games
4378920	4380080	the way gaming used to be.
4380080	4381080	Yeah.
4381080	4382080	I don't get it.
4382080	4384800	If they're not selling back, are they selling reprints of those?
4384800	4385800	Can you even purchase those?
4385800	4386800	I don't think so.
4386800	4387800	I really don't.
4387800	4388800	What is the point?
4388800	4389800	Yeah, it's just, it's just unfortunate, you know.
4389800	4392680	It's just lawyers going crazy to protect their IPs or probably.
4392680	4396600	And at the same time, I can't say, well, it's completely unjustified.
4396600	4398520	Nintendo has no right to do that.
4398520	4399520	They own it.
4399520	4400520	They of course have the right.
4400520	4401520	Yeah, exactly.
4402040	4406360	I have to realize that that is true as well, but there's that part of me that goes, but
4406360	4407360	do they have to?
4407360	4412000	But then again, once again, it is on the internet and therefore since it's on the internet,
4412000	4413000	it's always on the internet.
4413000	4414840	So it's probably somewhere out there.
4414840	4418680	Well, but not at the source because there was that retro mags or whatever that was the
4418680	4421600	source and it's no longer there.
4421600	4426280	So, but after a discussion about this on our last week show, I did actually start looking
4426280	4430200	for, and I did find like old scans because I just, you know, use my Google.
4430280	4433720	I went and I found like, you know, Compute Skazette and all that stuff.
4433720	4435680	And I was reading like old type in programs and stuff.
4435680	4436680	And I was like, Oh my God.
4436680	4440600	And I never realized like how intensely those magazines talked about programming.
4440600	4443920	I don't remember that from a kid, but it was kind of like, again, it's fun to read this
4443920	4449000	stuff that I remember one way as a kid and then read it now with my 38 year old brain
4449000	4450440	as opposed to my five year old brain.
4450440	4452440	And like, I'm just totally seeing it a different way.
4452440	4453440	It's crazy.
4453440	4459680	So, so on a completely different tangent since you mentioned your 38 old brain.
4459680	4465320	So my wife, because she's watching Grey's Anatomy, mentioned to me that she's like,
4465320	4468280	you do realize on the show that all these people are supposed to be like younger than
4468280	4469280	we are right now.
4469280	4470280	I'm like, what?
4470280	4473480	She's like, yeah, even that guy right there with the gray hair.
4473480	4474480	Yeah.
4474480	4477440	He's supposed to be like in his like, like early thirties or something.
4477440	4481440	And I'm just like, no fucking way.
4481440	4482440	I just thought that was funny.
4482440	4483440	No, yeah.
4483440	4484440	I love seeing people.
4484440	4488880	I love seeing very incredibly successful, talented people on television who are like
4488880	4490240	15 years younger than me.
4490240	4491240	Oh, I love that.

4588740	4589740	Just despite Loki.
4589740	4590740	I okay.
4590740	4591740	That's your game.
4591740	4593860	If you want to, if you want to buy crap, that's fine.
4593860	4595380	You're eating this weird chips.
4595380	4599940	So I know that you're delicious for the chips.
4599940	4606100	Do not come for the chips just because you don't like Brazilian or Brazilian steak or,
4606100	4607100	or whatever.
4607100	4608660	The Brazilian steak is really good.
4608660	4610540	It's very flavorful and not horrible.
4610540	4611540	Come for the chips.
4611540	4612540	Loki.
4612540	4613540	Oh, it's weird.
4613540	4614540	Cut somebody.
4614540	4615540	Yeah.
4615540	4619640	Listen, weirdly.
4619640	4623360	That is, that is you spitefully chewing down on the chip.
4623360	4624360	All right.
4624360	4625360	All right.
4625360	4626360	Okay.
4626360	4627360	Seriously though, don't chew in the mic.
4627360	4628360	That's gross.
4628360	4629360	All right.
4629360	4633980	Going, going to the PlayStation three over in Japan, uh, tales of Biseria, uh, also being
4633980	4637320	released there in a regular and a Famitsu deluxe pack.
4637320	4643140	Cause we know they love the deluxe packs over there in Japan, uh, PlayStation four also
4643140	4645560	getting that same release of tales of Syria.
4645560	4650080	So look forward to that, uh, on the Wii U this week, some tumbleweed is rolling by
4650080	4653400	because there's nothing coming out on the Wii U in Japan.
4653400	4657640	But if we go to the Vita, we have collar cross malice and regular and limited edition.
4657640	4660600	Uh, that is out this week on the 18th.
4660600	4665640	And then lastly, looking at the Nintendo three DS this week, uh, we don't have anything in
4665640	4666640	Japan.
4666640	4669400	In fact, they get Metroid prime a week after we do so.
4669400	4670400	Oh, sorry.
4670400	4671400	They're calling.
4671400	4672880	Was it Metroid prime Federation force over there?
4672880	4673880	I don't.
4673880	4674880	Okay.
4674880	4675880	That game is not.
4675880	4676880	I already closed the window.
4676880	4678080	That game is not out of Japan for another week.
4678080	4679960	So lucky them.
4679960	4684120	Well, they have a chance to see how we react and make a decision from there.
4684120	4687500	But you know, Metroid was always a bigger game here than it was in Japan.
4687500	4689880	So I mean, it does make sense in that regard.
4689880	4694560	Although yes, Loki, I understand this is not the Metroid experience that everybody's waiting
4694560	4695560	for.
4695560	4696560	All right.
4696560	4697560	Uh, dark soccer.
4697560	4698560	How about the UK?
4698560	4700080	What will we find on the shelves in the UK this week?
4700080	4701080	Not a damn thing.
4701080	4702080	Nothing.
4702080	4703080	It's new.
4703080	4704080	All right.
4704080	4705080	Nope.
4705080	4707360	A chance to revisit games that you need to catch up on.
4707360	4712240	Time to drink tea and read a book.
4712240	4716920	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at vognetwork.com,
4716920	4718320	use the pass phrase, note.
4718320	4719320	All right.
4719320	4721240	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
4721240	4724880	And then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4724880	4726920	All right.
4726920	4734240	So Hello Games is currently testing some patch for the PC version because as you may know,
4734240	4738780	the PC version, kind of a fucking mess right now of No Man's Sky.
4738780	4742240	So it's supposed to improve support for AMD CPUs.
4742240	4745820	It fixes some frame rate stuttering.
4745820	4752320	And the setting, the max frames per second to 30 or 60 is not working.
4752320	4754960	So you can, that'll be working as well.
4754960	4760000	House stuttering and crashes when you're alt tabbing out of the game.
4760000	4766440	Also they're saying that apparently they're going to fix some other issues if caused by
4766440	4768440	G-Sync and stuff.
4768440	4774160	So, all right, cool.
4774160	4778320	So you can, what, you can like beta test this patch now or something, right?
4778320	4779320	Yeah.
4779320	4780320	The real one's not out yet.
4780320	4781320	Right.
4781320	4784240	So you can go to your Steam library and then if you go to the properties on the game, you
4784240	4790840	can get into, select the betas tab and you can, if you type in the codes experimental
4790840	4796740	with a three instead of an E in the beginning, then you can download it early.
4796740	4798640	Apparently it's been working pretty well.
4798640	4803400	You know, they've gotten the game to work at 60 frames per second at 1440p.
4803400	4804400	So my bad.
4804400	4805400	All right.
4805400	4811560	Well, I'm going to ask Alan to install that later so I can see what that looks like on
4811560	4816320	his PC because I, I wonder if it'll improve the graphic quality for him.
4816320	4817320	So I mean, it doesn't look terrible.
4817320	4819960	It's just, it doesn't look the same that it looks on PlayStation four.
4819960	4824520	I wish that framer is higher, but I mean, you're simulating that many plants.
4824520	4825920	I'm kind of okay with that.
4825920	4826920	Gotcha.
4826920	4830040	Well, before we get to the classic game of the week, a interesting update on what's going
4830040	4835920	on with league of legends and a riot games is actually suing a league of legends cheating
4835920	4840600	service called league sharp, which I guess charges between, and again, I'm not as up
4840600	4847240	and up on league of legends because, um, I'm just not great on it, but, uh, uh, league
4847240	4853920	sharp is charging between 15 and $50 a month for hacks and bots, uh, that I guess we'll
4853920	4855720	edit the game or what have you.
4855720	4862280	Um, so, uh, league sharp will allow you to see hidden information, automate gameplay
4862280	4866680	to perform with enhanced or in human accuracy and accumulate levels, experience and items
4866680	4869640	at a rate that is not possible for a normal human player.
4869640	4870960	That is all according to the lawsuit.
4870960	4872400	That's the lawsuits words.
4872400	4877420	Um, they had originally tried to contact the site owners directly riot did, uh, but that
4877420	4878420	didn't work.
4878420	4880960	So they called the lawyers and got them involved.
4880960	4886520	So riot wants to put a stop to that enterprise that's charging the money to basically cheat
4886520	4887760	in the game.
4887760	4888760	And we'll see what happens.
4888760	4891280	The defendants have 21 days to respond.
4891280	4893880	It'll be very interesting to see what develops with that.
4893880	4898800	All right, let's travel to a time when things, things were a little more simpler than this.
4898800	4901000	You couldn't, you could just cheat in games.
4901000	4902000	Yeah, you could.
4902000	4903000	Well, you could.
4903000	4904000	You had a game genie.
4904000	4906360	You didn't have to pay somebody $15 a month to do it for you.
4906360	4910880	You paid 60 bucks for a little device and found codes that would come in the little
4910880	4911880	book.
4911880	4912880	I fair enough.
4912880	4915280	It's a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the week.
4915280	4916280	Huh?
4916280	4917920	There it is.
4917920	4920000	There's the music.
4920000	4923920	Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,
4923920	4924920	you should play this game.
4924920	4927120	It is over 10 years old, believe it or not.
4927120	4928840	And therefore it's a classic.
4928840	4931080	It's Barbies for Grown Straight Men.
4931080	4935080	I'm sorry, Dead or Alive Xtreme beat volleyball.
4935080	4940120	So this game is awful.
4940120	4943000	And Dan played so much of it.
4943000	4947600	So I basically picked this game to give him shit.
4947600	4956860	Basically it's a volleyball game with the Dead or Alive ladies in bikinis and all kinds
4956860	4959400	of outfits.
4959400	4966820	And you have one guy in the entire theme and it's Zach, the human Teletubby.
4966820	4976420	So anyway, no fighting, just volleyball and bikinis and sunshine and shopping.
4976420	4981980	You basically just dress them up and take pictures and watch them walk around.
4981980	4987140	And you have, they build relationships with each other and sometimes they do dances and
4987140	4995580	then you play volleyball, but it really is just Barbie for, for grown men, really.
4995580	4997200	It's just completely crazy.
4997200	5004260	So anyway, as you go through the game, you can get gifts and date and sorry, influence
5004260	5011780	other characters cause dating sim, you know, and then you earn Zach bucks, which you use
5011780	5020420	on, you know, each character as you go through the game to buy new outfits with varying degrees
5020420	5023100	of modesty attached to them.
5023100	5031660	So the characters in the first game were Ayane, Kristy, Helena, Hitomi, Kasumi, Leifang, Lisa,
5031660	5034020	and Tina.
5034020	5040540	And now we're like, what, on the fourth one of the series, fifth one of the series.
5040540	5046140	And there was a big, big bit of drama about this, but the soundtrack for the game actually
5046140	5047540	was pretty decent.
5047540	5058540	It had some Bob Marley, it had some Christina, had real big fish and some other people that
5058540	5064620	I'd never heard of, um, but people liked it.
5064620	5065860	It was okay.
5065860	5070520	And then, Oh, and there was, um, a kind of a bit of a controversy over an April fool's
5070520	5077700	day joke is that EGM back in the day did, um, a nude code for the game that said you
5077700	5081020	could play with them topless in nude mode.
5081020	5085620	And then it was a hoax and they got a bunch of pissed off people because apparently I
5085620	5087300	was promised some titty.
5087300	5092020	I was promised some anime titty and you robbed me of my titty.
5092020	5093020	And you know what that meant?
5093020	5098860	That meant of course, um, you know, enterprising people because the X-Box was very exploitable
5098860	5099860	then made it a reality.
5099860	5100860	God, this game looks awful.
5100860	5102300	I'm going to hack my titties.
5102300	5103300	Yeah.
5103300	5109340	This was, um, uh, some different hobbyist, uh, hobbyists actually reverse engineered
5109340	5116160	the game and modified texture models to be able to make them completely naked in very
5116160	5118100	high detail.
5118100	5124540	And, um, Tecmo actually took them to court, um, for breaching the digital millennium copyright
5124540	5131660	act, um, with that and as well for Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive 2 and, uh, tried to get
5131660	5138340	some pretty, uh, uh, big money, like between one grand and 10 grand for every skin that
5138340	5141760	was swapped over the website that they offered.
5141760	5145700	So that's it.
5145700	5148740	So it's basically Barbies for grown men.
5148740	5155940	SSG100 Matt in chat says tear down that wall that is hiding those titties.
5155940	5156940	You know what?
5156940	5160980	A little, a little excess in games sometimes is just fine.
5160980	5165740	In my opinion, you know, you, you, you have ridiculous over the top movies that I love
5165740	5167180	like showgirls.
5167180	5172340	I think if you're going to have the showgirls of games in something like Dead or Alive beach
5172340	5175980	volleyball, which is basically what it is, uh, then you know what?
5175980	5176980	That's great.
5176980	5185180	So, uh, although I would like to see something that, you know, uh, sexualizes and, and, you
5185180	5189060	know, makes, uh, characters of men in the same way, I think, yes, I think everybody
5189060	5190660	deserves that too.
5190660	5197180	I think that there should be like the banana hammock game with scantily clad dudes of various
5197180	5200700	isn't there that showering guys game on steam.
5200700	5202140	That game's like weird.
5202140	5207620	It's not even shower with your dad shower with your dad.
5207620	5212520	You want men to be subject to, uh, titty titty, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5212520	5213520	Not even the same thing.
5213520	5214520	Nine.
5214520	5217620	So here's the, here's, here's what I, here's what the perfect game would be.
5217620	5222260	And I'm going to go back to, you remember the days here's, I'm going to take it back
5222260	5226080	ready for ready for old man Roberts reference here.
5226080	5232280	Remember when you had like a laser disc or a DVD that on one side was one presentation
5232280	5236880	of the movie, but if you flip it over, it was another presentation of the movie.
5236880	5243440	So how about a game that on one side is anime titty and on the other side is anime dong.
5243440	5245440	Like is it, is it that hard people?
5245440	5246440	Is it that hard?
5246440	5248400	Why can't we just have them all in the same game?
5248400	5251960	Well, and I would, I would be perfectly fine with that too.
5251960	5256360	But you know, for those that wish to have nothing but titty today or nothing but dong
5256360	5258600	today, we can have floppy boob physics.
5258600	5263680	There can be floppy dick physics or bouncy ball physics, whatever, right?
5263680	5268720	We can have pantsless rage.
5268720	5270400	We can have pantsless rage.
5270400	5271400	All right.
5271400	5275920	Uh, we're going to take a break and a question our lives and our priority in gaming.
5275920	5277480	And then we're going to come back with even more news.
5277480	5284680	And of course your phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one
5284680	5285680	word.
5285680	5288960	So we're gonna take a break, but we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio right
5288960	5296200	after this.
5296200	5301640	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 654 for this
5301640	5306360	August the 14th of 2016 of course our show is already in progress.
5306360	5311320	We've been talking a bit about no man's sky, the final fantasy 15 rumored delay, uh, more
5311320	5313200	NX rumors and so on.
5313200	5314880	And there's still plenty more to come.
5314880	5320000	Um, I wanted to, um, mention that, uh, dark Sakura, you brought me something I've been
5320000	5325640	looking for for the past couple of weeks that I have not been able to find myself, but you
5325640	5328440	found it and you brought it here and that is the crystal Pepsi.
5328440	5329440	Yes.
5329440	5332520	I just happened to look over and went, shit.
5332520	5336300	Is this a permanent thing that they're doing or is this just like, I think it's a limit
5336300	5338580	to like, don't you all love the nineties?
5338580	5339800	Here it is again.
5339800	5345740	But if I miss Pokemon and blink when I do too, I wish that they'd had the diet one so
5345740	5346740	I could have.
5346740	5347740	Yeah.
5347740	5348740	Because, okay, here's the thing.
5348740	5349780	I love crystal Pepsi, right?
5349780	5352420	I loved it when I was a kid and now that I'm drinking this again, I'm like, okay, yeah,
5352420	5353740	this is really good.
5353740	5357300	Now that I'm 20 years older, I'm realizing why this is so good.
5357300	5358780	Uh, this is nothing but sugar.
5358780	5360340	This is 250 calories a bottle.
5360340	5361340	Oh my God.
5361340	5362340	Let's see.
5362340	5366380	Does soda only have like 160 or let's find out myself.
5366380	5371420	I feel like, well, usually one can has one serving a 20 ounces, two servings.
5371420	5374940	Oh, my red, my red bowl is only at 110.
5374940	5380440	My Pellegrino, uh, pump Elmo is 140.
5380440	5383820	Now see this crystal me drinking this bottle of crystal Pepsi wouldn't be so bad if I was
5383820	5387140	still playing DDR, but, uh, at least, Hey, you know what?
5387140	5392320	At least I walked around a lot yesterday because I'm an out of town friend of mine from Ingress
5392320	5396040	was visiting over the weekend and we decided we wanted to do a big banner because you can
5396040	5398160	do these things in Ingress called missions.
5398160	5400840	And you know, when you string a bunch of missions together, you can do a banner.
5400840	5404000	So we did a series of 60 missions downtown yesterday.
5404000	5407400	Um, because it was, I wanted to get it done before I went to Atlanta.
5407400	5411300	So I'd have it on my profile for when I meet other Ingersers there and so forth.
5411300	5414020	And this was the weekend that it worked out for us to be able to do that.
5414020	5417240	So, uh, we went out, yeah, did 60 missions.
5417240	5420520	By the way, we had planned all this when the forecast for the weekend was supposed to be
5420520	5424520	a more reasonable 90 and not the 102 that it ended up really becoming.
5424520	5427080	And yes, those 12 degrees make quite a difference.
5427080	5429960	And I did it in the heat and I'm crazy.
5429960	5430960	You did it in the heat.
5430960	5436880	Yes, but I've earned every drop of this crystal Pepsi from yesterday's exercise.
5436880	5437880	You go.
5437880	5439000	That's for sure.
5439000	5440000	Will do.
5440000	5441000	I will go.
5441000	5445120	I will go and unveil the rapid fire news that we're going to get into next.
5445120	5446120	Loki.
5446120	5447200	All right.
5447200	5452200	So there's some new Nintendo games that have entered in their selects program.
5452200	5455280	So that means that they're going to be cheaper now because you know, Nintendo doesn't really
5455280	5457400	do price drops pretty regularly.
5457400	5463240	So on the three DS, you can look forward to a few games, a animal crossing new leaf, a
5463240	5464560	Lego city undercover.
5464560	5471640	The chase begins Luigi's mansion, dark moon, and then 10 dogs, cats, um, or plus cats,
5471640	5475320	golden retriever and new friends and Tomodachi life.
5475320	5480440	And then of course on the Wii U we're getting the legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, Lego city
5480440	5485800	undercover and Nintendo land may have to pick up Wind Waker cause that's not bad.
5485800	5490340	And then Lego city undercover looked pretty cool as grand theft auto with Legos, which
5490340	5496680	I think is what originally was supposed to be within a backed off from that too bad.
5496680	5503580	Also there's going to be some, um, new bundles that are going to be a game plus an amiibo.
5503580	5507260	And so those are going to be coming out starting September 9th and those are going to be priced
5507260	5508700	at $40.
5508700	5512700	So something that you can look forward to captain toad treasure tracker with toad Mario
5512700	5519820	party 10 with Bowser, Mario party with peach Yoshi's wooly world, uh, with light blue yarn
5519820	5524740	Yoshi or pink yarn Yoshi.
5524740	5525740	That's cool.
5525740	5528580	I guess if you don't own those games yet, if you're, if you're going to finally take
5528580	5532740	the plunge on a Wii U this Christmas, Hey, at least you could stock up on games for reasonable
5532740	5533740	price.
5533740	5534740	Black Friday, just wait for the black Friday.
5534740	5535740	Ooh, good.
5535740	5536740	Good call.
5536740	5538300	Um, but yeah, I mean, we wake her definitely.
5538300	5539540	I mean, cause I like Wind Waker.
5539540	5541340	I have it on the game cube somewhere.
5541340	5546900	It's actually, it's in my sister's storage cause she has my game cube, but I wanted to
5546900	5547900	play it again.
5547900	5552620	I'm like, but $40, man, that's a lot, you know, for that, I'm just going to wait until
5552620	5553620	it drops in price.
5553620	5554620	Well now it's dropped in price.
5554620	5555620	So maybe I will.
5555620	5560340	Um, and then this is kind of funny, a little tongue in cheek, I guess.
5561060	5567380	So South Park, the fracture, but home, they released a brand new, uh, that title's always
5567380	5568380	going to make me giggle.
5568380	5573820	I hear Mike over there, they released a new teaser for the game.
5573820	5583300	Um, that was pimping a, a device called the nostrils rift, which is basically this device
5583300	5587660	that plugs onto your face and allows you to smell smells.
5587660	5592260	So this apparently is going to be a thing that you're going to get to experience if
5592260	5598060	you're at games com and you will be able to smell farts with it as you play the game.
5598060	5599460	What else would you do?
5599460	5600460	Exactly.
5600460	5606780	So, uh, go check that out if you're having to be in, you know, going to games com.
5606780	5607780	I don't know.
5607780	5608780	That's fantastic.
5608780	5609780	It looks awesome.
5609780	5610780	All right.
5611780	5614780	Too bad it's not like a pre-order item or something like that.
5614780	5616780	No, that'd be kind of funny, but.
5616780	5617780	All right.
5617780	5621780	Well, something Jason was talking about in the intro tonight was a rocket league in this
5621780	5622780	game.
5622780	5623780	You know, Hey, rocket league is still a lot of fun.
5623780	5626780	I don't know if you guys have checked it out lately, but they keep doing a lot of updates
5626780	5627780	to it.
5627780	5629780	And there's more free DLC coming to rocket league.
5629780	5634780	And now rumble mode is happening in September and that's on all platforms.
5634780	5638780	Now what's happening with this is that it's going to be bringing items like the boot,
5639780	5643780	which will allow you to kick an enemy car in its proverbial face.
5643780	5645780	I'm assuming so you can kick cars.
5645780	5649780	There's a grappling hook, which will pull the players towards the ball.
5649780	5654780	So I guess like, you know, any, any game adding grappling hooks is always a good thing.
5654780	5655780	Exactly.
5655780	5657780	Uh, so yeah, that's, that's pretty cool.
5657780	5661780	Uh, that they're adding these silly things to it to do a little more, uh, uh, I guess
5661780	5662780	fighting in it.
5662780	5667780	Uh, you can also, there's other, uh, powerups as well, such as, uh, a plunger, which will
5667780	5670780	grab the ball via, via a plunger and a cord.
5670780	5674780	Um, a spike will allow you to attach the ball to your car when you bump into it.
5674780	5679780	And a swapper will allow you to instantly change fields on the, uh, change a position
5679780	5681780	on the field with your opponent.
5681780	5684780	So this just sounds like clusterfuck 5000.
5684780	5686780	And, uh, I think it'll be fun.
5686780	5691780	Uh, Hey, would you like to get a Ubisoft game for free?
5691780	5692780	Yes, that's right.
5692780	5696780	Now that you're paying attention, Rayman Origins is going to be free on PC starting
5696780	5697780	on August 17th.
5697780	5698780	How do you get it?
5698780	5702780	You go to the Ubi 30 website and click get the game.
5702780	5708780	And they're doing that each month too, but you do have to have a Uplay account to get
5708780	5709780	the game in your library.
5709780	5712780	But I mean, if you played Ubisoft game, they forced you to do that.
5712780	5713780	Yeah.
5713780	5714780	So you probably have one.
5714780	5716780	So you just need to remember your lock.
5716780	5721780	If you've ever played Assassin's Creed or just dancer and South Park, then you have
5721780	5722780	a Uplay account.
5722780	5725780	So, uh, log into it and you can do that by the way.
5725780	5730780	You could still grab splitter cell if you want, uh, before that goes up on the 17th.
5730780	5733780	Uh, once you download it, it is yours forever.
5733780	5737780	Four more free Ubisoft games coming, uh, through the end of 2016.
5737780	5742780	That's some, you know what, Hey, it is hard to be upset with free and Rayman's a solid
5742780	5743780	platformer too.
5743780	5746780	So, I mean, for that reason alone, they did do Yaris.
5746780	5749780	Remember Yaris existed and it was free and it was bad.
5749780	5750780	Okay.
5750780	5752780	But to be fair, Ubisoft had nothing to do with Yaris.
5752780	5755780	I think the bar for quad, I realized Ubisoft may have put out a couple of stinkers over
5755780	5757780	the years, but there's, there's some really good stuff too.
5757780	5759780	And Rayman's Rayman's on the good side.
5759780	5761780	Rayman is, but you can't bulk it free.
5761780	5762780	True.
5762780	5763780	All right.
5763780	5768780	Then again, they do also have that weird bird combat game that's coming out.
5768780	5770780	That's VR or something like that.
5770780	5771780	Why not?
5771780	5777780	That you like, I don't know what you do in this game, but you're a bird.
5777780	5778780	All right.
5778780	5780780	And you do battle.
5780780	5781780	You're a Pidgey.
5781780	5783780	Uh, last up, Dar Sakura.
5783780	5788780	Um, Florence and the Machine has three songs out that are for Final Fantasy 15 and they're
5788780	5789780	all on iTunes right now.
5789780	5795780	I may have just bought all of them, but the songs are Too Much is Never Enough, I Will
5795780	5797780	Be, and Stand By Me.
5797780	5800780	Um, and yep.
5800780	5804780	The last one, actually, it is a cover of the original Stand By Me.
5804780	5808780	If there's not going to be poking dead bodies in Final Fantasy 15, I'm going to be slightly
5808780	5809780	disappointed.
5809780	5811780	Hey, want to see a dead body?
5811780	5816780	I will say this, uh, the minute that I found out that those tracks were on Spotify, which,
5816780	5820780	you know, it went up Friday and all the big music services got it Friday, uh, I went and
5820780	5821780	listened to the whole thing.
5821780	5822780	I was not disappointed.
5822780	5825780	I love that cover of Stand By Me and I love how it incorporates the Final Fantasy theme
5825780	5826780	into it.
5826780	5830780	I mean, you kind of already knew that from the trailer, but the two original songs are
5830780	5831780	really good as well.
5831780	5835780	Like, you know, Florence is a phenomenal artist and, um,
5835780	5837780	And she's not on, what, Heroine?
5837780	5838780	What was she on?
5838780	5840780	She was on something.
5840780	5845780	Well, I guess a lot of artists were, but anyway, all that aside, she's a fantastic musician
5845780	5849780	and I loved the, even though it's a three song soundtrack, I loved it.
5849780	5851780	So, um, yeah, check it out.
5851780	5852780	Listen to it.
5852780	5853780	I think there's a YouTube out there.
5853780	5857780	They officially put out with scenes for the game from one of the other songs, not Stand
5857780	5859780	By Me, but the first song on the soundtrack.
5859780	5860780	So, uh, yeah.
5860780	5865780	ImmortalKing in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love Florence and the machines.
5865780	5867780	And now that it's on Final Fantasy 15 is awesome.
5867780	5872780	Uh, and then Bobby Blackwolf says, I actually love Too Much is Never Enough more than Stand
5872780	5873780	By Me.
5873780	5875780	That's the song, um, that is first on the soundtrack.
5875780	5876780	Yeah.
5876780	5879780	Honestly, the Too Much is Never Enough is a fabulous song.
5879780	5885780	And I really hope it's used artfully in the game because if that is with a climatic moment
5885780	5888780	in the game, that could be a beautiful thing.
5888780	5889780	It was just alcoholism.
5889780	5891780	Oh, only.
5891780	5892780	All right.
5892780	5896780	Anyhow, you can get over alcoholism a lot easier than you can heroin.
5896780	5897780	Fair enough.
5897780	5898780	So moving on.
5898780	5899780	All right.
5899780	5904780	In other news, um, Sega has renewed the license for Virtua Fighter.
5904780	5905780	Oh, sorry.
5905780	5907780	The trademark for Virtua Fighter.
5907780	5910780	So maybe we shall have more of those coming out.
5910780	5914780	I'm never, I'm not a big fan of the Virtua Fighter series myself, but a lot of people
5914780	5915780	are.
5915780	5916780	I'm a Tekken girl.
5916780	5920780	Well, writer, we've got Virtuality coming out.
5920780	5921780	Maybe Virtua Fighter.
5921780	5922780	No.
5922780	5923780	Yes.
5923780	5924780	Kick Punch.
5925780	5926780	That's it.
5926780	5927780	All right.
5927780	5930780	Uh, we're going to get back into some, uh, long form news here.
5930780	5933780	I do want to mention though, something that had come up in chat, as I saw people talking
5933780	5938780	there over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, I saw that, uh, uh, earlier after the break, SH2100
5938780	5942780	Matt was letting people know that tickets for MAGFest are on sale, the music and games
5942780	5945780	fest, which I went to for the first time this year.
5945780	5946780	And I had a great time.
5946780	5953780	Uh, so the hotels went up for MAGFest earlier this week and it was, it was controversial
5953780	5954780	to say the least.
5954780	5955780	Let's put it like that.
5955780	5958780	Were there some servers humbled by your presence or whatever?
5958780	5959780	Kinda.
5959780	5963780	I mean, I don't think it was that the servers fried, but it's just that hotel rooms were
5963780	5964780	gone instantly.
5964780	5966780	And that hasn't really happened with MAGFest before.
5966780	5969780	Like last year, I feel like it took like a day.
5969780	5973780	And the year before that, like it just wasn't like MAGFest is getting really, really, really,
5973780	5974780	really popular.
5974780	5978780	And it's being constricted by that space that they hold it at.
5978780	5982780	Although that is a beautiful hotel, it's just National Harbor is only so big in itself.
5982780	5985780	So, you know, there's just, there's just some growing pains in that regard.
5985780	5988780	And then there's the whole, they put it up at a really weird time.
5988780	5993780	They put it up at one o'clock Pacific, which for most people that go to MAGFest was four
5993780	5995780	o'clock Eastern, which, you know, a lot of people are still at work.
5995780	5999780	So it was a weird time for them to put out and they did it unannounced unless you're
5999780	6000780	on Twitter.
6000780	6002780	So they're getting a little bit of heat for it.
6002780	6006780	You know, I, I do feel like that team is very responsive and chatty.
6006780	6008780	And so I feel like they're listening to the feedback at least.
6008780	6011780	So, I mean, you know, what's done is done.
6011780	6016780	And then the tickets for actual MAGFest went on sale just, I think yesterday.
6016780	6019780	And the servers did melt down for that, but I think they've stabilized now.
6019780	6023780	Although they say that MAGFest will not sell out as fast as the hotels did.
6023780	6024780	But I don't know.
6024780	6030780	I don't know if I believe that anymore, but I did want to say some of the same people
6030780	6033780	I went to MAGFest with last year decided to go again.
6033780	6036780	And I have decided to go with them again.
6036780	6041780	We did, we did not get the official hotel cause we were 15 minutes late, but we did
6041780	6043780	get the hotel next door.
6043780	6044780	So we did get a hotel.
6044780	6045780	So it's not that bad.
6045780	6046780	Yeah, it's whatever.
6046780	6047780	Yeah, whatever.
6047780	6049780	So I just, my only thing, and this is always my paranoid thing.
6049780	6053780	We're going to Washington DC in January is please no Snowmageddon.
6053780	6054780	That's my only wish.
6054780	6056780	Please no Snowmageddon.
6056780	6060780	Uh, so, uh, but I will be flying out there and going to MAGFest.
6060780	6062780	I, I, our friend just booked the tickets.
6062780	6064780	They're doing the group rate thing cause there's like at least eight of us going.
6064780	6069780	Uh, so I will be going to MAGFest 2017 and I'm really excited to, um, be there.
6069780	6072780	Uh, this year I am going to try to lobby to get on some panels.
6072780	6075780	I would love to do that now that I know a little more about what the convention is all
6075780	6076780	about.
6076780	6078780	I would really, really love to get involved in that capacity.
6078780	6080780	Um, and I'm looking forward to representing VOG.
6080780	6084780	Um, I don't know if I know Bobby is unable to go cause the earlier timeframe of the year
6084780	6086780	makes it not able to work for him.
6086780	6089780	I'm not sure what other VOG hosts we have that might be going.
6089780	6095780	Uh, but I look forward to, uh, representing, uh, VOG and being hopefully a part of some
6095780	6096780	of the hosts that can go.
6096780	6098780	So, and MAGFest is going to be a lot of fun.
6098780	6099780	Excited.
6099780	6100780	All right.
6100780	6105780	Rama in chat, uh, over at live.vognetwork.com says Sky working on it.
6105780	6106780	Yeah.
6106780	6107780	All right.
6107780	6108780	Ooh, wow.
6108780	6111780	And MXC says the cheapest tier of tickets sold out a few minutes ago.
6111780	6112780	Wow.
6112780	6114780	So there's going to be slightly more expensive now.
6114780	6117780	Well, hopefully my pal already got those tickets.
6117780	6119780	I better, uh, beep him or what we can do.
6119780	6120780	All right.
6120780	6122780	Uh, we're gonna get back into some other long news at this point.
6122780	6123780	So Loki.
6123780	6125780	So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Go.
6125780	6131780	Uh, Niantic is finally cracking down on players that are cheating in Pokemon Go by using bots
6131780	6132780	or other programs.
6132780	6138780	They've made some changes or additions to their FAQ and they are now sending out the
6138780	6145780	ban hammer and also sending out cease and desists to some of the, um, websites creating
6145780	6148780	these bots, including one such bot called Necrobot.
6148780	6153780	Uh, they sent out a cease and desist letter and basically they've shut down, you know,
6153780	6159780	shop and you know, they comment, do the legal action being started against, um, other bot
6159780	6160780	creators and devs.
6160780	6164780	Uh, we did not receive the letter yet, but the project development will be stocked.
6164780	6168780	And then of course, you know, there's other, uh, what was some of the other bought ones
6168780	6174780	that other bot creators have also received, um, cease and desist letters though for that.
6174780	6179780	Um, one of the other things they included on there as well, using an emulator, um, modified
6179780	6183780	software to access Pokemon Go or clients or backends.
6183780	6187780	So they're saying that maybe they might ban you for using some of those Pokemon tracking
6187780	6191780	things because there's still some of them out there and you create, you know, accounts
6191780	6192780	to do that.
6192780	6193780	But let's be honest.
6193780	6197780	I mean, you can create as many fucking accounts as you want and they're not really going to
6197780	6199780	stop you.
6199780	6200780	So it gets banned.
6200780	6201780	Big deal.
6201780	6202780	Yeah.
6202780	6205780	Unfortunately, it's very easy to make a new account and keep playing.
6205780	6210280	Um, but at least I'm glad Niantic is doing something about it, but I'll, I'll just give
6210280	6213320	a cheap plug for Pokestop podcast this week because we talked a little more about this
6213320	6219660	at length and some of, I kind of feel like we, there's some false positives, unfortunately,
6219660	6223980	that it makes it hard to be excited about this when that's going on.
6223980	6226580	It's definitely a step in the right direction at least.
6226580	6227580	It is.
6227580	6228580	It is.
6228580	6229580	It's better than nothing.
6229580	6230580	That's true.
6230580	6231580	That's a common theme with Niantic.
6231580	6232580	It's better than nothing.
6232580	6237420	Not only is Niantic sending out cease and desist letters, but they're also getting sued.
6237420	6241680	They're getting sued by a guy from West Orange, New Jersey.
6241680	6247300	He's pursuing a class action lawsuit against Niantic Labs because his house or I guess
6247300	6253980	apparently his house is labeled in game as either, um, or something nearby, maybe as
6253980	6256100	a Pokestop or a gym.
6256100	6260700	Um, yeah, I'm not really sure.
6260700	6264980	Say if it's specifically his house or something, but basically those darn kids are on my lawn
6264980	6269780	playing Pokemon Go and, and I'm not happy about it.
6269780	6273820	And so basically he says, you know, at least five individuals knocked on the plaintiff's
6273820	6279700	door and asked the, asked the plaintiff's, um, access to the backyard to catch Pokemon.
6279700	6280700	Someone explain this to me.
6280700	6284580	I never fucking understand this because I've never had to walk anywhere to get a Poke.
6284580	6288500	I mean you can catch a Pokemon that's like several, I don't get it.
6288500	6292540	Like it's, are people dumb enough to like not realize that you don't have to be on top
6292540	6293860	of the Pokemon to catch them?
6293860	6298420	We talked about this a little bit on Pokestop last week and, uh, the theory I threw out
6298420	6303840	there was that it wasn't the Pokemon themselves, but it was the whole searching feature that
6303840	6308140	was causing people to triangulate the Pokemon in this person's backyard.
6308140	6311400	And that's cause you know, back East and these other places, they have much bigger backyards
6311400	6312540	than we do here.
6312540	6317820	So it was, and we, we, I'm speculating again, tinfoil hatting, I have nothing to go on,
6317820	6322500	but this could be part of the reason why Niantic said we needed to get rid of the searching
6322500	6324840	the way it was and replace it with something else.
6324840	6327160	So I worry about this loss.
6327160	6329760	I mean, I, I know a lot of us are kind of laughing it off.
6329760	6330800	This one worries me.
6330800	6337000	Like I kind of feel like this is going to be a really interesting precedent for AR gaming.
6337000	6343700	I just, I have the, maybe I'm just like, you know, that Ingress player that's like, ah,
6343700	6345700	I've been doing this longer than you guys.
6345700	6351260	But it seems like just, it's really like new bitch to think that you got to walk right
6351260	6352260	up to that stuff.
6352260	6355860	Like, I mean, seriously, just driving around, you can catch it, learn how to hop a fence
6355860	6356860	like the rest of us.
6356860	6357860	Just like forget it.
6357860	6361740	I mean, you'll have to, if it's on your screen, you can tap it in, you know, attack it.
6361740	6366780	It could be like several blocks down the road, but, but it could be again, the backyards
6366780	6368940	in some of these neighborhoods are huge.
6368940	6372940	So somebody is triangulating it in this person's gigantic backyard and they need to get in
6372940	6375380	the backyard to actually even though that's not a pokey stop.
6375380	6380300	That's just in general people being dumb, but you know, I don't know, whatever.
6380300	6381300	We'll see.
6381300	6383900	I, I, again, this, this one worries me a little bit.
6383900	6390180	I feel like at the end of the day, it's the choice of the kids to ring the doorbell, not
6390180	6391180	Niantic.
6391180	6392180	So talk to their parents.
6392180	6393180	Yeah.
6393180	6396940	So I kind of feel like that might be the escape here, but I, I just, I worry a little bit.
6396940	6400900	Did you hear about the bad egg for Pokemon Go?
6400900	6405700	There was an article up that said that, um, people were able to, through some kind of
6405700	6409260	glitch, put an egg as, um, with the gym.
6409260	6412580	Oh, I heard somebody was doing that at one of the local communities here.
6412580	6413580	Yeah, yeah.
6413580	6414580	And I'm trying to find the picture of it.
6414580	6421740	Basically the egg has no CP, so it can't be killed and it will just reap all those ongoing
6421740	6425500	benefits of being a gym leader and you can't knock it out.
6425500	6433380	People, you can file a report with Niantic to have it removed, but, um, it's just happening,
6433380	6437260	I think for the most part on the East coast, um, gyms, but still a nuisance.
6437260	6438260	Yeah.
6438260	6441820	So something else to consider, you know, William Murderface, I just, before we move on to the
6441820	6447100	next story, William Murderface poses a, a, a good question in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6447100	6449980	William Murderface says, how is ringing a doorbell a crime?
6449980	6450980	The fuck?
6450980	6455260	Um, I suppose they're going to have to prove that it was a nuisance.
6455260	6459380	You know, if it was at weird hours the night, I mean that that's going to be the, the, the,
6459380	6462620	it would have to legally be a nuisance for that to happen.
6462620	6467340	That's why, you know, you don't go ring your neighbor's doorbell at 2 AM just to say, Hey,
6467340	6468340	sup, I'm bored.
6468340	6470820	What you up to, you know, don't do that.
6470820	6471820	No.
6471820	6472820	Well, I w okay.
6472820	6478820	It's different if you work overnights, Mike, you can do things like that, but, uh, you know,
6478820	6479820	yeah.
6479820	6480820	Anyway, well, we'll see.
6480820	6481820	I don't, I don't know.
6481820	6483300	I think that's a good question.
6483300	6487220	And one that will probably be asked in court that Niantic will say, what's illegal about
6487220	6488220	ringing a doorbell.
6488220	6489220	Anyway.
6489220	6493100	Uh, let's move on to a story about something that's definitely illegal.
6493100	6496500	And that is hacking a forum to get people's passwords.
6496500	6498320	Yes, it's happened again.
6498320	6503360	Feel like we have one of these stories every month, but the forums for Dota 2 were hacked
6503360	6505160	on July 10th.
6505160	6509540	And apparently they got 2 million records in the hack, usernames, email addresses, passwords
6509540	6510720	and IPs.
6510720	6515000	So if you didn't use a unique password on the Dota 2 website, you should probably do
6515000	6516500	that next time.
6516500	6521560	And as always change your password, which at this point, you might as well just change
6521560	6528000	your effing password on all your sites every couple months, just to be safe or use, I realized
6528000	6532800	everybody, some people use the app that does the one password generator, whatever works
6532800	6539240	for you, just realize you can't, you know, name all your passwords, you know, Mr. Kitty
6539240	6543960	123 or whatever silly passwords people come up with, it has to be a lot more complex than
6543960	6546080	that or things are going to get hacked.
6546080	6548680	All right.
6548680	6550680	Moving on, DarkSakura.
6550680	6554320	Well, again, business can be shady.
6554320	6555800	Business is super shady.
6555800	6559540	Microsoft bought its Twitch competitor.
6559540	6565680	They acquired Beam Interactive, they are not saying for how much, basically it's pretty
6565680	6573880	much, you know, like Twitch is, it's to watch realtime gaming and commentary.
6573880	6579200	And so they're calling it a convergence, it's a takeover.
6579200	6581680	It's just shady business.
6581680	6588920	So the one thing about Beam is that it is completely realtime.
6588920	6592800	It doesn't have that 10 to 20 second delay that Twitch has.
6592800	6599700	And it also has different tools that allow the different viewers to influence the stream.
6599700	6604140	So like they'll let a viewer select the weapon that they have to in a shooter or other things
6604140	6605600	like that.
6605600	6612520	So yeah, shady, but it's business.
6612520	6619480	Well, I could see why Microsoft wants to get in on that business as well is that, you know,
6619480	6623880	Twitch obviously has a huge audience and nobody's really competing with them.
6623880	6629320	I mean, YouTube kind of trying, but like even YouTube isn't taking off the way the Twitch
6629320	6630320	is.
6630320	6631680	So Twitch really has a lock on that.
6631680	6634080	So they're very interesting.
6634080	6638620	So it's just, it seems to me that they're just going to turn it around and use it for
6638620	6645600	their own promotion, which I like the idea of a streaming service being independent.
6645600	6647680	And then the name of this is Beam, right?
6647680	6648680	Beam.
6648880	6650800	Somebody was asking in chat.
6650800	6655360	Well also, I think Beam also is very much about, you know how like when you play Tomb
6655360	6659720	Raider on Twitch, you may not know this, but when you play Tomb Raider on Twitch, people
6659720	6663440	can like help or hurt you by the chat commands.
6663440	6669480	Beam does that type of stuff where it's like, vote on what item the player should get next
6669480	6670480	type of thing.
6670480	6673560	So there's a little more interaction than there is on Twitch, which is actually kind
6673560	6675480	of cool at the same time.
6675480	6678260	This just opens yourself up to rampant trolling.
6678840	6684060	But if there's something a little more structured, like actually, maybe the Jackbox Party Pack
6684060	6686340	is a really good explanation of that.
6686340	6689900	Because like in the Jackbox Party Pack, you might be streaming a game online that you
6689900	6695100	and your friends are playing in one room, but anybody can join to help vote on answers
6695100	6697340	and maybe change the flow of the game and things like that.
6697340	6701080	I think that might be more the type of technology that Microsoft's getting into.
6701080	6706780	So if Microsoft is really looking at making games more interactive, that could be a pretty
6706780	6710940	cool thing and something that puts it a notch past Twitch.
6710940	6711940	We'll see.
6711940	6714020	I'm curious to see what they do with this.
6714020	6715660	Very, very curious.
6715660	6719580	So all right.
6719580	6720580	Let's move on.
6720580	6722180	Loki, before we get to the mailbag.
6722180	6723180	All right.
6723180	6724780	So this is kind of funny.
6724780	6727140	Apparently THQ is coming back.
6727140	6728140	Yeah.
6728140	6734260	THQ is coming back as THQ Nordic because you may remember Nordic games when they had that
6734260	6736980	huge buyout where they were selling all their properties off.
6736980	6741620	Nordic was one of the ones that purchased a lot of the older backlog stuff that they
6741620	6742620	had.
6742620	6747220	So like the Darksiders, MX versus ATV, Red Faction, just around human properties.
6747220	6754260	Now on top of that, they're just going to be renaming themselves to THQ Nordic, which
6754260	6756460	is neat.
6756460	6762340	And they're going to be publishing under the THQ name, possibly.
6762340	6763980	I guess that's cool.
6764020	6765740	Good luck to them with that name.
6765740	6766740	I guess they really want that.
6766740	6769900	I just want to see more games coming out from that stuff because, I mean, hell, Destroy
6769900	6770900	All Humans.
6770900	6772780	That was pretty awesome.
6772780	6775060	Stoppy's with you in our chat at live.vognetware.com.
6775060	6777500	Stoppy says, I really hope they bring back Red Faction.
6777500	6779020	Red Faction is pretty cool, yeah.
6779020	6781780	So maybe it's going to be a throwback to some of these old series.
6781780	6782780	Who knows?
6782780	6785140	Well, you know, Volition really does want to make a Red Faction game because that's
6785140	6789020	what Saints Row 4 basically was in space.
6789020	6790020	I don't know.
6790020	6791020	It's silly.
6792020	6793860	Well, I think this is awesome.
6793860	6796980	And that is that Parappa the Rappa is coming back.
6796980	6797980	Yay!
6797980	6798980	Wait, hold on.
6798980	6799980	I gotta believe.
6799980	6800980	Hold on.
6800980	6801980	What?
6801980	6802980	Not in a game.
6802980	6803980	Sorry.
6803980	6804980	It's not a game.
6804980	6805980	It's not a game.
6805980	6806980	Why would you do that to me?
6806980	6808980	Because the truth, it was my clickbait.
6808980	6812540	Parappa the Rappa is coming back, but it's just not a game.
6812540	6817620	It's going to be some anime shorts that are actually coming out.
6817620	6818620	These are...
6818620	6819620	I don't...
6819620	6820620	But why?
6821220	6822220	That's already an anime.
6822220	6825700	But these are new anime shorts.
6825700	6833100	It is a series of shorts that I guess PJ Berry is actually getting the title role in this.
6833100	6837940	It's not Parappa, but it's PJ Berry, which is the little bear friend that always looks
6837940	6838940	a little hungover.
6838940	6841060	If you remember the games.
6841060	6846660	So that is going to be starting in October and it will be actually, actually, no, why
6846660	6847660	does...
6847660	6852180	It says starting in October, but it says, oh, the pilot episode will be August 18th,
6852180	6854060	then the rest of them in October.
6854060	6856300	They're doing an early preview type of thing.
6856300	6859140	So you could check that out if you want.
6859140	6860980	I want the Lemmy and Remy show.
6860980	6864500	And maybe if this does very successful, maybe there'll be a Parappa 3.
6864500	6865500	I gotta believe.
6865500	6867660	Parappa would be the perfect digital game.
6867660	6869100	We need a Lemmy sequel.
6869100	6871940	Yeah, I would totally be down with the Umjama Lemmy.
6871940	6875220	I would be down with a game starring both of them again.
6875220	6876220	Give them co-billing.
6876220	6877220	Don't give a fuck.
6877220	6878220	Just bring back this series.
6878220	6879220	Add Knuckles.
6879220	6880220	Fuck off.
6880220	6887540	Did you guys see the comic?
6887540	6890220	What if Sonic was in Pokemon?
6890220	6894180	He was going around telling all the Pokemon to rise against their human masters and trap
6894180	6895740	them all in Pokeballs.
6895740	6896740	That's what I see going on.
6896740	6901540	If Knuckles was in the game, he'd just be like, the fuck am I doing here?
6901540	6907260	And teach Parappa about hardcore.
6907260	6910780	I would actually love to see a third friend that comes in.
6910780	6911780	So what?
6911780	6912780	Parappa raps.
6912780	6915060	Umjama Lemmy plays the guitar.
6915060	6917780	How about like Marimba Mel or something?
6917780	6918780	Didgeridoo Dave.
6918780	6922060	Yeah, Didgeridoo Dave that plays the didgeridoo.
6922060	6924980	And then implement Lucio from Overwatch.
6924980	6926460	There we go.
6926460	6927460	Drop the beat.
6927460	6929700	Let's get the beat down.
6929700	6933520	But like, no, seriously, if they had Didgeridoo Dave, then you could actually go back and
6933520	6939580	play the older games with the didgeridoo enhanced soundtrack.
6939580	6944020	So you could go back and do like, you know, the toilet wrap with the, you know, ominous
6944020	6945020	didgeridoo noise.
6945020	6951860	And his didgeridoo is like the sewage pipes.
6951860	6956180	I feel like that's on the cusp of being an OLR dream game is didgeridoo Dave.
6956180	6959940	That's it.
6959940	6963100	The third game in the Parappa the Rapa series didgeridoo Dave.
6963100	6964100	All right.
6964100	6965740	I like that.
6965740	6969940	It's a dream game adjacent because it's not an original idea, but it's one that needs
6969940	6970940	to happen for sure.
6970940	6971940	It's a dream sequel.
6971940	6973180	It's a dream cool.
6973180	6974180	A dream cool.
6974180	6975180	It's a dream cool.
6975180	6976180	All right.
6976180	6978660	Didn't we open this show talking about sequels and remakes and how we don't want them anymore?
6978660	6979660	Here we are.
6979660	6980660	All right.
6980660	6982180	Anyway, we're allowed to change our minds.
6982180	6983180	That's right.
6983180	6984180	You know what?
6984180	6987220	This is your show and not yours.
6987220	6991260	Opinions in the gaming industry changing, contradicting themselves.
6991260	6994660	Get out, get out right now.
6994660	6995660	Let's get to the mailbag.
6995660	6996660	Really?
6996660	6997660	Really?
6997660	7002300	I was going to say, you know, just kind of going back to that topic we were just on there
7002300	7003300	a second ago.
7003300	7004300	Yes.
7004300	7005300	Really?
7005300	7006300	They should just add T-Pain as you know, the third character.
7006300	7007300	Why not?
7007300	7008300	Oh, Auto-2 now.
7008300	7009300	T-Pain is Auto-2 now.
7010300	7011300	T-Pain is Auto-2 now.
7016300	7017300	I think Rob just lost this.
7017300	7019300	Why is this so funny?
7019300	7020300	Because it's incredible.
7020300	7022300	Hey, I smell a list list coming.
7022300	7025300	Oh, who should Parappa's new shitty friend be?
7025300	7026300	Exactly.
7026300	7029300	Why not all of them?
7029300	7031300	All right.
7031300	7035300	Hey, if you have a shitty friend you'd like to see in the Parappa universe, email us.
7035300	7038300	My shitty friend is in my mind.
7040300	7045300	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can email us and tell us about
7045300	7050300	all your imaginary shitty friends or whatever's on your mind this week about gaming and the
7050300	7051300	gaming industry and so forth.
7051300	7054300	So, what's in the mailbag this week, DarkSakura?
7054300	7055300	One email.
7055300	7056300	One email?
7056300	7057300	One.
7057300	7058300	All right.
7058300	7059300	Well, at least it's an email.
7059300	7060300	Hello.
7060300	7061300	Hi.
7061300	7064300	I just wanted to extend well wishes to everyone at the OLR and VOG family.
7064300	7065300	I love you guys.
7065300	7066300	That's it.
7066300	7067300	Smile hearts, Ryan.
7067300	7068300	Thank you, Ryan.
7069300	7072300	That's the email?
7072300	7076300	That literally is an email that just was like, no, please, I'm laughing.
7076300	7078300	The music was great for it too.
7078300	7084300	No, I'm laughing as I'm still laughing at Auto 2 now, but I love that we just got an
7084300	7087300	email that's like, I just called to say I love you.
7087300	7093300	I just called to say I care.
7093300	7094300	I love it.
7094300	7095300	Thank you.
7095300	7096300	You want to know what's funny?
7096300	7097300	I love you too.
7097300	7098300	I love you too.
7098300	7102300	I actually was listening to that song last night because I was on a Stevie Wonder kick.
7102300	7103300	All right.
7103300	7105300	There's no inappropriate time for a Stevie Wonder kick.
7105300	7108300	Do you know what though was really wrong to follow that song with?
7108300	7109300	Superstition.
7109300	7110300	Anyway.
7110300	7115300	The only time that that might be inappropriate is if in the middle of Inception because they
7115300	7119300	don't really need a kick that early, especially the Stevie Wonder.
7119300	7122300	Anyway, thank you for the email.
7122300	7123300	I'll see what you did.
7123300	7129300	You know what, even though there was no question or observation, I appreciate a pat on the
7129300	7131300	ass and a job well done once in a great while.
7131300	7136300	But you don't want a pat on the ass so hard your ass falls off, tries to grant you a wish
7136300	7137300	and flies away.
7137300	7139300	Nobody understands this reference.
7139300	7140300	It sounds amazing.
7140300	7143300	Darsucker's referencing a webcomic that none of you read.
7143300	7148300	The rest of the webcomic is actually pretty dirty, but I'll link it to you guys in the
7148300	7149300	chat.
7149300	7155300	By the way, can I just mention in chat over at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster saying,
7155300	7159300	I'm going to name a planet Parappa shitty friend and hope it doesn't get reported.
7159300	7160300	Great.
7160300	7161300	Let's see.
7161300	7164300	And we have Sia Tabiri in chat says, Clogger Clay.
7164300	7167300	Raginator suggests Triangle Tim.
7167300	7172300	Fifth Dream suggests base player that no one knows his name.
7172300	7174300	They just put flea in it.
7174300	7175300	It's so fucking good.
7175300	7177300	He could be like a rapper's name.
7177300	7178300	Base playa.
7178300	7184300	Sia Tabiri suggests Molly Marimba or Orange Wright suggests Xylophone Xandar.
7184300	7187300	Sia Tabiri says saxophone Xin-chan.
7187300	7188300	Xin-chan.
7188300	7189300	You know what?
7189300	7192300	See, this is what they need to do in the next Mega Man game.
7192300	7193300	Tuna base.
7193300	7196300	Trying to do like a musical spin on it where the rumor was that they're all going to be
7196300	7199300	named after like music, you know, Sonata and that type of stuff.
7199300	7201300	No, they need to be all fucking rapper names.
7201300	7205300	Like, you know, that kind of base playa or I don't know.
7205300	7207300	Actually tuna fish.
7207300	7209300	That's or excuse me, tuna base.
7209300	7210300	That's a great name.
7210300	7211300	Maybe a drag name.
7211300	7215300	Well, it could actually be a little fish that plays the bass guitar.
7215300	7218300	That's I think that's a great idea.
7218300	7219300	Act Deaf.
7219300	7220300	You should make Parappa games.
7220300	7222300	How about tuna piano?
7222300	7223300	Tuna piano.
7223300	7225300	All right.
7225300	7230300	Let's get to the FUs of the week because when the show totally derails, we just derail it further.
7238300	7249300	Harpsichord Henry said harp core Henry.
7249300	7250300	Oh, I read harpsichord.
7250300	7251300	All right.
7251300	7252300	Anyway, go ahead.
7252300	7258300	If you if you to wanting so much cheesecake that I can't fucking stand it.
7258300	7266300	And so Becky and I are going to get cheesecake because Becky with the good hair.
7266300	7268300	Actually, Jamie has the good.
7268300	7271300	Jamie has the good hair today.
7271300	7274300	I it's it's a Beyonce reference.
7274300	7275300	Oh, OK. Don't worry about it.
7275300	7276300	Sorry. Don't worry.
7276300	7279300	She's not my queen bee.
7279300	7281300	But cheesecake is all the best stuff in the universe.
7281300	7284300	And I also have blue roots.
7284300	7290300	I said when I get old, I'm going to bleach on my hair and make it blue so I can be a blue haired old lady.
7290300	7299300	And now I have like deep blue roots with my red and purple hair, and it's pretty fucking good.
7299300	7305300	Raginator says Lira Lisa and I just keep thinking Lisa Lisa and cult jam.
7305300	7306300	Yeah.
7306300	7307300	All right.
7307300	7308300	Moving on.
7308300	7311300	Loki, how about your FU of the week before my FU of the week?
7311300	7313300	I have to say accordion owls.
7313300	7315300	And of course, played by Weird Al Yankovic.
7315300	7316300	Yes.
7316300	7317300	Brilliant.
7317300	7319300	I think that really is already in my little pony.
7319300	7321300	He may as well do that to sell it.
7321300	7322300	OK.
7322300	7326300	FU to my fucking computer for being just retarded and randomly crashing.
7326300	7330300	It hasn't crashed yet, but that doesn't mean there's still potential.
7330300	7332300	I'll try to work on my game tonight.
7332300	7337300	I'm sure they'll get the crash and then just send FU to my car.
7337300	7345300	But thankfully, though, that was fixed and it was kind of weird because it's one of those like transmission things where the check engine light came on and it goes off.
7345300	7350300	And then it would be like several months where the car's driving just fine and one stutter here or there.
7350300	7352300	And then finally it stayed on so they could fix it.
7352300	7354300	So that's good.
7354300	7355300	Oh, my God.
7355300	7357300	I just heard a gay gasp.
7357300	7359300	Someone created.
7359300	7360300	I know.
7360300	7361300	And it wasn't me or Mike.
7361300	7364300	Someone created.
7364300	7365300	The Picaturo.
7365300	7366300	The Picaturo.
7366300	7367300	What?
7367300	7368300	Yeah.
7368300	7369300	And it's in California, too.
7369300	7370300	OK.
7370300	7371300	Stop derailing the FUs.
7371300	7372300	All right.
7372300	7374300	I wanted Picaturo.
7374300	7379300	My FU of the week goes to my snack food addiction because I've eaten tons of snack foods today.
7379300	7381300	And then I had a Crystal Pepsi.
7381300	7382300	Did you have a Picaturo?
7382300	7384300	I don't think so.
7384300	7386300	I have not.
7386300	7388300	Life squad goals.
7388300	7390300	It's at this place called The Loop.
7390300	7391300	Where's that?
7391300	7392300	Is it in fucking L.A.?
7392300	7393300	Everything's in L.A.
7393300	7394300	I'll find out.
7394300	7395300	It's in L.A.
7395300	7398300	I already know like mega California burrito.
7398300	7399300	Oh, my God.
7399300	7400300	Look how big it is.
7401300	7402300	I'm going to put in the chat room.
7402300	7404300	And it's served in ice cream.
7404300	7405300	It is a joke.
7405300	7408300	Since it's radio, it's a giant.
7408300	7415300	It's a giant churro that you actually wrapped around your face and has little Pikachu ears on it.
7415300	7416300	Can you put that in chat?
7416300	7417300	Yeah, I'm gonna.
7417300	7419300	Sorry for the folks listening on the podcast.
7419300	7420300	Oh, my God.
7420300	7421300	Google Picaturo.
7421300	7424300	The Picaturo has to be inside of my stomach right now.
7424300	7425300	That's amazing.
7425300	7427300	I think it would kill you if it was inside your stomach.
7427300	7428300	I don't care.
7428300	7429300	It does look alive.
7430300	7431300	Picaturo used Nuzzle.
7432300	7433300	It's super effective.
7433300	7435300	Picaturo used IBS.
7437300	7439300	It's super effective.
7439300	7441300	Picaturo uses Thunder Shark.
7441300	7442300	It was extremely effective.
7442300	7443300	What's that?
7443300	7444300	Is that the new Alola Pikachu?
7444300	7445300	Yeah, it's Alola form.
7445300	7447300	It's the Dole Whip form.
7447300	7448300	All right.
7449300	7450300	Oh, my God.
7450300	7453300	The thing's also coated in something like golden delicious.
7453300	7454300	Stop talking about fucking food.
7454300	7456300	It's a video game show.
7456300	7458300	It was half related.
7458300	7460300	Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line.
7460300	7461300	Loki.
7462300	7467300	So Spotify has now, they've unveiled a dedicated gaming section.
7467300	7472300	They have game soundtracks and playlists for games.
7472300	7474300	So some of the games that they have on there.
7474300	7476300	Rocket League.
7476300	7478300	There's some Ultimate Rock Gaming.
7480300	7482300	Gaming Anthems.
7482300	7484300	So, yeah, you can go check it out.
7484300	7485300	They're so bad.
7485300	7492300	Just if you want to check some of those out in that, just browse and scroll down to the genre section, big gaming.
7492300	7501300	I actually, I was unable to find it in the Spotify app, but I went to that dedicated website and there actually was some playlists that were actually really good.
7501300	7505300	Like, I like Spotify a lot myself.
7505300	7507300	Like, I realized you can kind of pick that or Apple Music.
7507300	7514300	But one thing Spotify has done very, very well that no other service for me has done is that the playlist that it curates.
7514300	7518300	Like, We Think You'll Like This have been spot on.
7518300	7519300	Like, they're so good.
7519300	7520300	I have never used Spotify.
7520300	7522300	Really? I don't think Apple Music does that.
7522300	7524300	It just has a list.
7524300	7529300	Well, I got suckered into the whole pay 99 cents for three months and then oops, I didn't cancel my credit card.
7529300	7531300	But, I mean, I really do like it.
7531300	7536300	So it's like, okay, yeah, they suckered me into paying the monthly fee and I kind of don't buy music anymore.
7536300	7537300	I just use Spotify.
7537300	7542300	So, which is probably not what record labels want to hear, but that's the direction things are going.
7542300	7545300	You get to listen to new music whenever you want.
7545300	7546300	I do.
7546300	7548300	That's just basically what you want.
7548300	7549300	You don't want to necessarily buy.
7549300	7551300	I have a curated playlist for new music.
7551300	7553300	And you can still search on there, right?
7553300	7555300	And it knows I want to hear every new Britney song.
7555300	7556300	It knows.
7556300	7557300	All right.
7557300	7564300	Anyhow, let's go on to one last story tonight.
7564300	7567300	Oh, this could maybe be a use for the Pikachu Dark Sakura.
7567300	7569300	Digestion?
7569300	7570300	Digestion.
7570300	7578300	Do you remember a few weeks ago here on the show, we were talking about Pokemon inspired dildos.
7578300	7579300	That's right.
7579300	7582300	Adult toys inspired by Pokemon.
7582300	7590300	Well, apparently a adult film company out there called Brazzers was the name of this company.
7590300	7591300	Never heard of them.
7591300	7597300	Well, I can't imagine why.
7597300	7600300	They're like memes worthy.
7600300	7602300	You put Brazzers on anything and it's dirty.
7602300	7610300	Anyway, they have Porn Star Go, which is a Pokemon Go inspired triple X film.
7610300	7613300	And there actually is a trailer.
7613300	7615300	And wouldn't you all like to see that trailer right now?
7615300	7616300	Absolutely.
7616300	7618300	Let's do it.
7618300	7620300	Because it's going to be great radio.
7620300	7623300	The porn stars try to catch them all.
7623300	7626300	Imagine porn stars in the real world.
7627300	7629300	They are in the real world.
7629300	7630300	I'm confused.
7630300	7634300	Get ready for the ultimate showdown.
7634300	7636300	Oh my God.
7636300	7638300	Was that anal beads she pulled out of his pocket?
7644300	7648300	And shows that she caught the beads.
7648300	7650300	What the fuck did you do to my yard?
7650300	7654300	That's the guy who's doing Niantic for all these people being in his yard.
7654300	7657300	This is like cosplay porn.
7657300	7658300	Is this a parody?
7658300	7659300	Is this serious?
7664300	7665300	Okay.
7665300	7666300	Is this legit or is this?
7666300	7667300	Oh my God.
7667300	7668300	It says August 8th.
7668300	7670300	I guess it's already out.
7670300	7671300	This is legit.
7671300	7672300	This isn't like a parody somebody did.
7672300	7675300	No, it's just a really terrible film.
7675300	7676300	Not like Google.
7676300	7677300	Just go to Brazzers.
7677300	7679300	All right.
7679300	7680300	Wow.
7680300	7683300	Now I've seen everything.
7683300	7685300	The ladies are really cute though.
7685300	7688300	They look really adorable in those outfits.
7688300	7689300	Sure.
7689300	7694300	You know there will be significantly less clothing in the actual thing.
7694300	7696300	So they're not going to look as cute, Rob.
7696300	7698300	I'm fine having just seen the trailer.
7698300	7699300	That's fine.
7699300	7700300	There you go.
7700300	7701300	It's straight on their front page.
7701300	7702300	So yes, I would definitely say that.
7702300	7703300	Oh my God.
7703300	7704300	Getting in on the...
7704300	7705300	That looks so stupid.
7705300	7706300	Getting in on the...
7706300	7707300	Did they do a Candy Crush porn?
7707300	7709300	I don't think so.
7710300	7717300	No, but they have Sex Fighter, a triple X parody, Vega gets vagina.
7717300	7721300	Yes, that's a thing.
7721300	7724300	So yes, apparently that is a thing.
7724300	7725300	That's fantastic.
7725300	7726300	All right.
7726300	7727300	Let's...
7727300	7729300	A parody title popped into my head.
7729300	7730300	I don't know if it's appropriate.
7730300	7731300	Oh no.
7731300	7732300	What's this?
7732300	7733300	Dare I ask?
7733300	7734300	No.
7734300	7735300	We won't go there.
7735300	7736300	Thanks.
7736300	7737300	That was a great radio.
7738300	7740300	Fifth Dream and Chat suggest Panty Crush Saga.
7740300	7741300	Well, here's what I was going to do.
7741300	7744300	I was going to go to their parody page because that's going to be where they have all the
7744300	7745300	different stuff.
7745300	7752300	So on top of that, they also have Sex Fighter with Chun-Li versus Cammy, of course.
7752300	7753300	Some other parodies.
7753300	7755300	Several Ghostbusters triple X parody videos.
7755300	7756300	Of course.
7756300	7759300	Star Trek's...
7759300	7761300	What would be the plot of a Ghostbuster?
7761300	7763300	Is it your vagina is haunted?
7763300	7764300	X-Men.
7764300	7771300	They also have Spider-Man, Star Whores, Storm of Kings, which I'm not really sure what the
7771300	7772300	fuck that's supposed...
7772300	7773300	I guess Game of Thrones.
7773300	7776300	Just so you know, the X-Men thing exists in the gay porn universe as well.
7776300	7777300	Or so I've heard.
7777300	7778300	Oh.
7778300	7779300	Oh.
7779300	7780300	On Twitter.
7780300	7781300	You know, people are so nasty on Twitter.
7781300	7782300	Right.
7782300	7783300	All right.
7783300	7784300	The Skype line is open.
7784300	7787300	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7787300	7789300	If you want to give us a call.
7789300	7792300	Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype if you would like to participate with
7792300	7794300	the program tonight.
7794300	7798300	Meanwhile, while we wait for any calls that may be coming in, I want to check with Loki
7798300	7799300	for any last minute stories.
7799300	7801300	Unless he's too busy looking at pornography.
7801300	7805300	No, they just have, like, they really, after that first page of parodies, they just kind
7805300	7807300	of go downhill from there because there's not really anything...
7807300	7809300	When was it ever uphill?
7809300	7813300	Well, I thought that there'd be, like, more movie parodies and stuff like that, but it's
7813300	7814300	really not.
7814300	7815300	Like, I mean, come on.
7815300	7816300	Womb Raider means shit.
7816300	7817300	That's like fucking grade school shit.
7817300	7818300	That's art.
7818300	7819300	That's just, like, stupid.
7819300	7820300	Whatever.
7820300	7821300	That title is...
7821300	7823300	Alright, the phone's ringing.
7823300	7827300	Let's get to it so we can get through some folks that want to be on the show tonight.
7827300	7828300	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7828300	7829300	Who's this?
7829300	7830300	Hi, Rob.
7830300	7831300	It's Rama.
7831300	7832300	Hi, Rama.
7832300	7833300	How are you?
7833300	7834300	I'm good.
7834300	7843300	I just want to know, are you becoming the official, how do we say, per slash adult material
7843300	7845300	collector of the show?
7845300	7846300	Sure.
7846300	7848300	It appears to be Loki right now.
7848300	7850300	How am I supposed to fucking answer that?
7850300	7851300	I don't know.
7851300	7854300	Like, what gives you that impression that I'm the official curator of all the adult
7854300	7856300	collections on OLR?
7856300	7860300	It sounds like you got a little more excited about the parodies that were being discussed
7860300	7862300	with Loki about a couple of minutes ago.
7862300	7865300	You're the one that does the show about cosplay.
7865300	7869300	You should see how cute some of these costumes are, Rama.
7869300	7871300	The costumes were YouTube appropriate, to be fair.
7871300	7874300	To be honest, the costumes were pretty great in Final Fuck X.
7874300	7878300	No, seriously, it was disappointing, though, because the female, like, porn stars were
7879300	7882300	all done up like, you know, they're Final Fantasy characters.
7882300	7885300	The male porn stars were like, ah, fuck it, we're just not doing anything at all.
7885300	7889300	Yeah, no, they should have also dressed up and, you know, anyway.
7889300	7890300	Commitment, dammit.
7890300	7895300	Stoppy in chat says, as your attorney, I'm going to advise you to not answer that, Sky.
7895300	7897300	So, I plead the fifth, Rama.
7897300	7901300	Well, that's all fine, because I tell you what, if Mako-chan was awake, she'd be joining
7901300	7905300	forces with you, because on our show, she's our residential hentai connoisseur.
7905300	7908300	Can I come on anime jam session sometime to talk about pornography?
7908300	7912300	I don't see why not, I think Mako-chan would be all for that.
7912300	7914300	Alright, make it happen.
7917300	7919300	I don't watch anime, but I do watch porn.
7921300	7925300	Yeah, I don't watch that either, anime.
7925300	7926300	You're lying.
7926300	7930300	Alright, actually, one of these, I do need to catch, now that I have the Pokemon show,
7930300	7934300	I keep meaning to watch some of the episodes of the Pokemon anime and check that out, so.
7934300	7937300	My son's been watching it, and I've been watching it with him, and yeah, it's pretty
7937300	7938300	good.
7938300	7940300	It gets pretty dark in places.
7940300	7941300	Does it?
7941300	7944300	I'm like, I'm all shit, man, like that one where they went to fight the psychic one,
7944300	7948300	she's like, yes, I'm going to trap you here and keep you as my toys and kill you and steal
7948300	7949300	your souls.
7949300	7951300	Wasn't that the plot of Return to Oz?
7951300	7952300	Terrifying.
7952300	7953300	I'm like, dude.
7953300	7954300	That was keep their heads.
7954300	7956300	I'm like, this is a little dark.
7956300	7960300	Like, my youngest sounds like, I'm scared, I'm scared.
7960300	7962300	I'm like, it's just a show.
7962300	7966300	Oh, and Rama's probably sitting there going, literally, I can think of 50 different animes
7966300	7969300	that you should be watching before that.
7969300	7971300	More like 25.
7971300	7972300	More like 25, alright.
7972300	7974300	I'm actually watching anime right now.
7974300	7975300	Are you?
7975300	7976300	What are you watching?
7976300	7978300	I'm watching Danganronpa 3, the future arc and despair arc.
7978300	7980300	Because of your obsession with the games.
7980300	7981300	Pretty much.
7981300	7982300	Yeah, fair enough.
7982300	7984300	And so, and Shane and I actually just like, we're both watching them, so we talk about
7984300	7985300	it the next day at work.
7985300	7989300	Sometimes the obsession with games carries over an anime, it just happens, it happens.
7989300	7991300	Well, it's the only way they're finishing the story.
7991300	7994300	Uh, what, Rama, what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?
7994300	7998300	I was going to talk to you about Magfest and all that goodness.
7998300	7999300	Yeah.
7999300	8001300	AKA VOGCON Winter Edition.
8001300	8002300	Yeah, right?
8002300	8003300	Yeah, definitely.
8003300	8005300	Are you going?
8005300	8007300	I am going.
8007300	8012300	And I'm also, I got peoples that's trying to secure me at least two rooms for all of
8012300	8013300	us to help out.
8013300	8014300	Believe you me.
8014300	8019300	Because let me tell you, I forgot that the rooms were going up that afternoon.
8019300	8023300	I'm checking Facebook, and I get them, and somebody's talking about it, I was like, oh,
8023300	8024300	okay.
8024300	8028300	I totally forgot because I was working, and then I go to check my phone, and so I was
8028300	8029300	like, I got a room.
8029300	8033300	I started tapping as hard as I could on my phone to reserve a room.
8033300	8036300	And then I was this close, I was like, I made one mistake.
8036300	8040300	I realized I only had one room, I need to grab a second room.
8040300	8044300	And the site wouldn't let you get two rooms, by the way, because we tried to do the same
8044300	8045300	thing.
8045300	8046300	And that's how we got locked out of the main hotel.
8046300	8051300	No, that's, yeah, because it seems that you have to go into the full desktop view of the
8051300	8052300	page.
8052300	8053300	I go to that.
8053300	8054300	Already gone.
8054300	8055300	I'm like, you know what?
8055300	8056300	This.
8056300	8057300	You know what?
8057300	8058300	They're going to have to do next year.
8058300	8059300	They need to start requiring a deposit.
8059300	8063300	I know nobody likes that, but it'll deter people from just holding rooms for the sake
8063300	8064300	of holding rooms.
8064300	8070300	But, I'll get into that in one sec, but thankfully I have friends who are traveling or going.
8070300	8074300	I will know, probably in a month or so, I'll have two rooms coming to me, so I'm good to
8074300	8075300	go about that.
8075300	8081300	As for the whole deposit thing, you're right about that, because Captain Khan is in the
8081300	8086300	same hotel, does the same thing, and every year the same people, bitch.
8086300	8089300	They're like, I have never heard of a Khan doing this.
8089300	8090300	How long have you been doing this?
8090300	8091300	This is new to me.
8091300	8094300	You could tell the people who don't read the website.
8094300	8096300	Dragon Khan has insane deposits.
8096300	8102300	I had to pay a full night's stay in advance, and if I canceled after the first of the year,
8102300	8104300	I'd lose half of the deposit.
8104300	8107300	And if I cancel now, I'll lose it all.
8107300	8111300	Rob, this is why I have a dedicated credit card just for hotel rooms.
8111300	8112300	I don't have to worry about that.
8112300	8115300	It's probably not a terrible idea.
8115300	8120300	This year we are taking over the Travis Donovan suite, and we're repurposing it as the VOG
8120300	8122300	suite this year, so we're going to have fun.
8122300	8125300	It's going to be expensive, but you know what?
8125300	8129300	I'm in an age where I fucking earned it.
8129300	8132300	I can't be humble about it, Rama.
8132300	8137300	I've reached that point in my life where I'm like, I ain't cramming four people in a Motel 6 anymore.
8137300	8142300	I fucking earned a suite when I'm on vacation, and I'm a motherfucking adult.
8142300	8144300	Rob, brother.
8144300	8145300	What?
8145300	8146300	Brother, let me tell you something.
8146300	8154300	There are con-goers that are our age that still pack six to ten people in a room.
8154300	8160300	And if they can do it, God bless you, but I ain't doing that shit.
8160300	8163300	Poor bastard that is stuck in the bathroom.
8163300	8170300	No, look, I have slept on the bathroom floor of a Motel 6, and I wasn't even fucking drunk.
8170300	8172300	It was probably E3 or something.
8172300	8174300	I've been there, done that.
8174300	8177300	My 38-year-old ass is not doing it anymore.
8177300	8180300	I'll wake up, and I'll be like, my back, my back.
8180300	8186300	There's a reason I used to play live-action vampire at Mobicon so that I would be guaranteed
8186300	8193300	a bed when everybody else got up, and I could go lay down for my four hours of sleep before
8193300	8195300	doing my go-for duty.
8195300	8201300	Yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, being in the room at MAGFest with just my girlfriend
8201300	8202300	was nice.
8202300	8205300	We were also in the closest room to the con on the second floor.
8205300	8209300	Yeah, when you can do it.
8209300	8213300	Again, I'm sitting here going, look, I realize that not everybody is in a situation where
8213300	8214300	they can do that.
8214300	8219300	And when I was in my 20s, believe me, I did all the roughing it up in rooms and all that
8219300	8221300	stuff, and I'm just like, you know what?
8221300	8225300	I stopped going to Disneyland and doing all these other extravagant vacations I do.
8225300	8230300	Pretty much all I do is cons now, so I save my money, and I buy myself something pretty
8230300	8231300	at cons.
8231300	8232300	Mm-hmm.
8232300	8233300	And you are three cons.
8233300	8235300	We've been being a certified con whore.
8235300	8237300	I think I will hit that.
8237300	8239300	We have Dragon Con in three weeks.
8239300	8241300	We have Gamer X4 a month after that.
8241300	8244300	We have Final Fantasy Fan Fest like two weeks after that.
8244300	8245300	And now we have MAGFest.
8245300	8250300	That's four cons in the next, what, through January 2017.
8250300	8251300	Four?
8251300	8253300	Damn it, Rob, you're such a whore.
8253300	8254300	Yes.
8254300	8257300	Wow, and this is Rama.
8257300	8259300	Talk about pot and kettle.
8259300	8260300	Jesus, Rama.
8260300	8261300	I know, right?
8261300	8264300	All right.
8264300	8270300	Kossin in chat says, hmm, so Rob actually knows if you can catch a VD from sleeping
8270300	8272300	on a Motel 6 floor.
8272300	8274300	Just so you know.
8274300	8275300	Yes.
8275300	8276300	Yes, no.
8276300	8277300	Brother.
8277300	8279300	Luckily, I did not.
8279300	8281300	However, I want to point this out.
8281300	8289300	The Motel 6, where I slept, and I will never do this again in my entire life, was on Hollywood
8289300	8293300	Boulevard in Hollywood.
8293300	8297300	I, and everybody has these dreams of Hollywood.
8297300	8298300	Did it smell like prostitute on the floor?
8298300	8299300	Glitz and glamour.
8299300	8301300	Oh, no, there's prostitutes, that's for sure.
8301300	8302300	Oh, yeah, no, no.
8302300	8303300	Weren't you there?
8303300	8308300	Yeah, I was there because, like, it was, we went with our friend Brad, and he had gone
8308300	8311300	out for a smoke or something like that, and he ran into a couple prostitutes in the hallway
8311300	8315300	that were, like, trying to hit him up for stuff, and he's like, no, it's cool.
8315300	8316300	Um, but.
8316300	8321300	When OLR does E3, we hang out with hookers.
8321300	8325300	WhoreLR.
8325300	8328300	Hashtag WhoreLR.
8328300	8331300	Some day we'll have the parody movie.
8331300	8333300	That's what we can aspire for.
8333300	8336300	Maybe for our quiciniera, somebody will make a porn.
8336300	8337300	Alright.
8337300	8339300	Obviously, you know, I know peoples, okay?
8339300	8342300	We can get this shit done.
8342300	8346300	Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go so we can try to get more calls, but anything else you
8346300	8348300	want to share with us tonight?
8348300	8353300	I have a half a case of Sprite Remix and a half a case of Crystal Pepsi in my fridge.
8353300	8356300	I didn't hear Surge, so I'm not interested.
8356300	8357300	I want Surge.
8357300	8358300	Save me some.
8358300	8360300	And Josta needs to come back.
8360300	8366300	And Rama, I was going to say, you probably already know this, but call that hotel every
8366300	8370300	day until MAGFest, because people are going to cancel those rooms.
8370300	8374300	And if I do that, they're going to tell me to refer back to the booking system, so like
8374300	8375300	I said, I'm on this.
8375300	8377300	I've been doing this shit for almost 20 years.
8377300	8378300	I got you, fam.
8378300	8379300	I got you.
8379300	8380300	Alright.
8380300	8381300	Thanks for looking out, bro.
8381300	8385300	By the way, apparently the cheapest level of MAGFest tickets are already gone.
8385300	8390300	I just heard that as a few minutes ago, because our group guy was still waiting to hear back
8390300	8392300	on the final count, so we missed it.
8392300	8396300	So, and now we're kind of sitting here going, well, god damn it, you know, so we're going
8396300	8399300	to have to make a move on that really soon, so it looks like MAGFest may sell out this
8399300	8400300	year.
8400300	8402300	MAGFest never sells out.
8402300	8404300	They're going to keep selling and so on and so forth.
8404300	8407300	No, they sold out during the con last year.
8407300	8409300	Well, shit, look.
8409300	8413300	That place can handle at least 15,000 people, so you know, hey.
8413300	8414300	Yeah, I know.
8414300	8415300	I know.
8415300	8417300	It's, but move sooner rather than later.
8417300	8419300	Alright, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you.
8419300	8420300	Hey, no problem.
8420300	8421300	Stay fabulous, brother.
8421300	8422300	I will.
8422300	8423300	Stay black.
8423300	8424300	I'll try.
8424300	8425300	Alright, bye.
8425300	8426300	Bye.
8426300	8427300	Alright.
8427300	8428300	Did you say stay black?
8428300	8429300	It's an inside joke.
8429300	8430300	Okay.
8430300	8431300	Something that Dan says.
8431300	8435300	Look, for those that think I'm being like insensitive or rude, it's like, one day, for
8435300	8442300	those that don't know the joke, one day Rama called in and Rama said something like that,
8442300	8450300	like, stay whatever, brother, and Dan was like, stay black, and it just turned into
8450300	8453300	this hilarious thing, and we all had a laugh at it, and Rama thinks it's funny.
8453300	8455300	We all think it's funny, so.
8455300	8458300	If you don't think it's funny, I'm sorry.
8458300	8459300	Next call.
8459300	8460300	Hi, you're on Order of Songs Radio.
8460300	8461300	Who's this?
8461300	8462300	Yeah, what's up?
8462300	8463300	This is Kaijuto.
8463300	8464300	Hey, Kaijuto, what's up?
8464300	8466300	First, I just wanted to let you know, I heard you earlier.
8466300	8470300	I've been busy, so I haven't been able to, like, really listen to the show, and I think
8470300	8477300	I heard you mention that you might be taking away your pre-order for the PlayStation VR,
8477300	8479300	because you're not sure about the new, right?
8479300	8481300	You said something like that, right?
8481300	8482300	Yep, I did.
8482300	8490300	Yeah, I think somewhere, Sony confirmed that the VR and the new PlayStation are gonna be
8490300	8494300	like, kind of like separate from each other, like, you'll probably be able to use the VR
8494300	8499300	sometime later in the future, but they really do intend for it to run on the PlayStation
8499300	8502300	that we have right now, so you don't really have to worry too much.
8502300	8509300	Well, that's refreshing to hear, so I do, I get a little nervous sometimes with what
8509300	8514300	they say versus what actually happens when things hit the streets, but I also realize
8514300	8518300	if I want to get a PlayStation VR, I'm gonna need to be one of those people that takes
8518300	8519300	the plunge.
8519300	8522300	I think, Kaijuto, at the end of the day, I'm gonna stick with my pre-order, and I'm probably
8522300	8526300	gonna get it, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I haven't thought about canceling it.
8526300	8531300	But, hey, there's the rumor, I think that they're gonna add VR support to No Man's Sky,
8531300	8532300	which would be pretty awesome.
8532300	8536300	That would be fucking rad, actually, and No Man's Sky is the type of game that I think
8536300	8539300	could do it with, I mean, I don't know about the space flight, that's the only thing I
8539300	8543300	worry about is that the space flight could be a little barfy, but I think maybe if they
8543300	8547300	tune some things and, like, you don't run into a space station and start spinning 360s
8547300	8551300	and stuff, I think if they can tune some of that down, it might actually be really awesome.
8551300	8553300	I would love to play No Man's Sky in VR.
8553300	8555300	Yeah, it's funny that you say that, because that's what I was calling about, I was calling
8555300	8560300	about No Man's Sky, and I was streaming the game for a friend of mine, and I told her
8560300	8564300	that very thing, I was like, you know what, I think they should put this in VR, but I
8564300	8568300	don't know how well it would work, but I'm just calling to say that I have it on the
8568300	8571300	PlayStation 4, and I absolutely love the game.
8571300	8573300	It's, like, one of my favorite games right now.
8573300	8575300	It's probably my game of the year.
8575300	8576300	I'm, like, really enjoying it.
8576300	8579300	I know that it's been getting a lot of heat online, because people were expecting it to
8579300	8585300	be one thing that it wasn't, but I went in there with no expectations, and basically
8585300	8591300	what it is is, like, a part space simulator, part survival game, with some exploration
8591300	8592300	in it.
8592300	8596300	You know, it's not, like, this big, heavy, action-packed, you know, adventure game, and
8596300	8598300	that's not what I was looking for, so I'm really enjoying it.
8598300	8601300	Yeah, actually, and since you missed earlier in the show, just to kind of summarize without
8601300	8605300	restating what I said, I also have been playing No Man's Sky, and I find that I really, we
8605300	8608300	agree on this one, Kaijuto, I really enjoy it as well.
8608300	8612300	I, and it's, for me, it's a little harder to put my finger on, like, I'm not sure why
8612300	8618300	I keep drawn to this, but I think it's just, I love the exploration fact, and yeah, okay,
8618300	8624300	so the planets have a lot of similar-ish looking creatures, but there's just enough differentiation
8624300	8629300	and just enough subtle, the story pushing forward every time I find a new building that
8629300	8632300	I still am inspired to move forward.
8632300	8637300	Like, it's just enough, and I realize it's not for everybody, but I'm so into it right
8637300	8638300	now.
8638300	8642300	Yeah, what about the fact that, like, the game really doesn't hold your hand, like,
8642300	8646300	you know, there's some walkthrough to it, but at the same time, it kind of forces you
8646300	8650300	to figure out what is going on, and I really like that aspect of it as well, because, like,
8650300	8655300	when I, when I first played it, and I was, like, crash land on that planet, and I'm looking
8655300	8659300	for stuff, and I really didn't know what the heck I was doing, and I just, like, took my
8659300	8665300	time with it, you know, I started scanning areas, I started finding things, and I slowly
8665300	8670300	started to understand the game, just on my own, like, not going on Twitch, or not going
8670300	8674300	to YouTube, and I like that, like, I miss doing that in games, because, I mean, we,
8674300	8677300	you know, with the internet, you know, we get so used to, you know, right at the, you
8677300	8681300	know, the click of our finger, we can just go and Google something, or look something
8681300	8685300	up online, and, you know, that's how you get through it, like, I love the fact that I didn't
8685300	8688300	have to do any of that, and at the same time, it still felt like somewhat of a challenge,
8688300	8689300	you know?
8689300	8693300	Yeah, most of it I figured out on my own, although, in full disclosure, I did stream
8693300	8697300	the first night, because I was fortunate enough to get the game on Monday, so I streamed,
8697300	8700300	and some of the streamers were yelling out, or some of the, excuse me, the chatters on
8700300	8704300	the stream were yelling out things that I'd missed, I guess, as I was going through the
8704300	8709300	tutorial, like, I totally missed that R3 could sprint, and that is such an important thing
8709300	8713300	for the sake, even though it's limited, you can't just sprint everywhere, and that's
8713300	8717300	important, you do have, like, a stamina thing, but I guess you can increase that with items,
8717300	8718300	like, other stuff.
8718300	8719300	Yeah, you get birds to do that.
8719300	8723300	But, yeah, I mean, there were some little things that I missed, but yeah, trying to
8723300	8728300	kind of figure out that game about the inventory management, and as I used this term earlier
8728300	8733300	in the show, living off the land, because yes, No Man's Sky is very much about moving
8733300	8738300	forward, but like, you know, you run out of materials, and you have to find more, you
8738300	8742300	know, you've got to be able to keep moving forward by using what's in front of you to
8742300	8743300	move forward, if that makes sense.
8743300	8745300	That's the real adventure, No Man's Sky.
8746300	8751300	Yep, and I like the fact that you're not, you're not whoring items, like, I know, like,
8751300	8755300	games like Skyrim, you know, people go in their area, they just want to collect weapon
8755300	8759300	after weapon, stock it up in their house, and never really do anything with it, like
8759300	8763300	this game, you really have to, like, watch what you're collecting, you know, you have
8763300	8766300	to, you have to balance the pros and the cons, should I hold on to this thing, or should
8766300	8770300	I dump it to get this, because I really need this right now, but I might need that later,
8770300	8774300	you know, I love that whole challenge of it, you know, and the crafting, I do have to nitpick
8774300	8779300	a little bit about the crafting, because, like, it's not a bad system, I mean, it is
8779300	8784300	a crafting system, but coming from Minecraft, I'm, like, looking for my crafting table,
8784300	8788300	I'm like, okay, where do I go to craft this stuff, like, I didn't realize that in your
8788300	8792300	slot, you have to, like, you have to craft within one of your empty slots, so that was
8792300	8796300	kind of weird for me, and I was like, you know, are they cutting corners, or did they
8796300	8797300	just want it to be that way?
8797300	8802300	Well, it's annoying, too, like, you can store, like, several tons of, you know, ore in one
8802300	8806300	slot, but, oh, that chip, yeah, that's only gonna, you can't stack those.
8806300	8807300	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8807300	8815300	What was I gonna say about the, ah, I lost my thought about the game, and all this, nah,
8815300	8818300	dammit, oh well, I'll think about it later.
8818300	8822300	Yeah, but, yeah, I'll let somebody else get in on the call, but I'm really enjoying the
8822300	8827300	game, I hope, hope they keep it as is, because, you know, like, in this day and age, it's
8827300	8832300	like, developers get so, ah, they get so scared, as once they start getting some negative
8832300	8836300	comments, and they try to go out of their way to change the game, I swear, I hope that
8836300	8841300	they don't fuck with this game, you know, like, they need to just leave it as is, you
8841300	8845300	know No Man's Sky 2, do an online No Man's Sky for those people that want that shit,
8845300	8849300	but leave this game as is, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.
8849300	8854300	I will say, the one thing I do that does, and I said this earlier in the show, but I,
8854300	8857300	the one thing that does kind of bug me about the game that I do want to get a little better,
8857300	8861300	at least it annoys me right now, is space fighting, like, when the, when the Raider
8861300	8867300	ships come, I, I just, like, the ship is not, does not control well for, like, a afterburner
8867300	8871300	type of fighting thing, I, I just, that could be better for me, um, you know, but it's
8871300	8875300	Yeah, but at the same time, at the same time, if you think about it, I'm not 100% sure,
8875300	8879300	because, like, I'm taking my time through the game, but, I think you can go through
8879300	8882300	the game just being peaceful, like, you don't even have to fight anything, so,
8882300	8886300	No, they, they, they do, they do rage you if you're carrying expensive cargo, so you
8886300	8888300	have to be mindful not to carry that, so.
8888300	8889300	Yeah, I didn't know that.
8889300	8892300	Yeah, so anyway, anyway, I'm going to let you go, buddy, but thank you for the call.
8892300	8893300	No problem.
8893300	8894300	Alright, bye-bye.
8894300	8901300	Alright, um, I think that is going to do it, I don't see, yeah, so, I think it's almost
8901300	8905300	about nine o'clock, so we do want to wrap up, so, if for whatever reason you didn't
8905300	8910300	get through tonight, please consider sending us an email, that would again be participate
8910300	8916300	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash o-l-r, many
8916300	8921300	other ways to participate with the program, but thank you guys very much for participating
8921300	8926300	tonight, whether it be that you listen live or listen on the podcast, as we say at the
8926300	8930300	end of every episode, tell a friend or five about the show, help us spread the word, because
8930300	8934300	we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we don't know that the voices are out
8934300	8939300	there if they're not here, so, yeah, help us spread the word, a nice five star review
8939300	8944300	on a place like iTunes, Google Play, wherever you found this podcast, it goes a very long
8944300	8946300	way and we are extremely appreciative of all that.
8946300	8949300	Hey, Mike, thanks so much for being here tonight and sitting in on the show, I hope you had
8949300	8950300	a good time.
8950300	8951300	I did.
8951300	8952300	Yeah?
8952300	8953300	It was entertaining.
8953300	8955300	Thank you for filling in, thank you for doing PokeStop earlier today as well.
8955300	8956300	Oh, no problem, that was fun too.
8956300	8959300	Yeah, if folks haven't heard that yet and they want to hear a little bit about Pokemon
8959300	8963300	Go and the new Sun Moon trailer, check that out over at PokeStopPodcast.com.
8963300	8965300	It was pretty cool and I was a lot more talkative on there, so.
8965300	8970300	You were, but that's okay, you know, sometimes Loki's so loud, he just overpowers all the
8970300	8971300	guests.
8971300	8972300	Oh, yeah.
8972300	8973300	I'm just kidding.
8973300	8974300	Nah.
8974300	8978300	All right, but no, it's great that you could be here and I know you listen to the show
8978300	8981300	a lot, because I'll get text messages from you about something I said and I'll be like,
8981300	8983300	what, did I say that on the show?
8983300	8984300	You did.
8984300	8986300	Yeah, so you keep me in check.
8986300	8990300	Is it fun to see here play it out live as opposed to listening on the...
8990300	8993300	It's a lot more entertaining because I listen to it at work, so.
8993300	8994300	Yeah.
8994300	9000300	And better than sitting by myself at work, listening to, you know, and like kind of talking
9000300	9001300	to myself.
9001300	9005300	What do you think people out there listening in Radio Land or whatever, what do you think
9005300	9010300	people out there don't really realize about what this show really is live?
9010300	9012300	The setup, I guess.
9012300	9013300	Really?
9013300	9017300	I don't know what initially I thought it was going to be before, but like...
9017300	9021300	It's like set your expectations and then lower them and lower them some more.
9021300	9023300	Hey, I think this setup we have here...
9024300	9028300	This setup here is one of the, you know, like we have space, a lot of space.
9028300	9033300	Yeah, no, like it's surprisingly comfy.
9033300	9035300	Yeah, it's not a radio.
9035300	9038300	It's not like you guys are like hugged up on each other, you know?
9038300	9041300	No, that was the studio before this when we were at my apartment.
9041300	9043300	I don't hug.
9043300	9044300	I cut.
9044300	9047300	So I'm over here for everybody's safety.
9047300	9048300	Oh, okay.
9048300	9050300	But you share chips, Brazilian barbecue chips.
9050300	9051300	Aren't those good?
9051300	9052300	They are pretty fucking good.
9052300	9055300	This studio puts the lounge in Orange Lounge.
9055300	9056300	Yes, it does.
9056300	9059300	But yet there's not a single piece of orange furniture in here, so we'll work on that.
9061300	9063300	There's a folder right here, it's orange.
9063300	9065300	There we go, that's my observation.
9065300	9067300	There is nothing orange about Orange Lounge Radio.
9067300	9068300	It's a fucking lie.
9068300	9069300	Except for Rob.
9069300	9071300	Hey, fuck off, my beard.
9071300	9073300	My beard is the orange in Orange Lounge Radio.
9073300	9074300	Alright.
9074300	9078300	Yeah, SG100Matt mentions the garage studio looked good though with the couch and the lights hanging up.
9078300	9081300	The garage is the closest thing to what we have now.
9081300	9083300	That's what you need in here.
9083300	9085300	The garage had the 100 degree heat.
9085300	9087300	You need lights strung around the ceiling.
9087300	9089300	Oh my god, that sounds terrible.
9089300	9091300	It was pretty terrible bad.
9091300	9094300	I hate like, I hate streaming upstairs.
9094300	9097300	It was an insulated garage, so it wasn't as bad.
9097300	9103300	But Rob, you should totally do like holiday lights all around like the roof perimeter.
9103300	9104300	Like Stranger Things?
9104300	9106300	Well, not like that bad.
9106300	9110300	When you let me put a video camera in here, I'll put the lights up.
9110300	9114300	You know what? You can put a video camera in here, you just can't point it at me.
9114300	9116300	Just put it like right there.
9116300	9120300	And it should be like a surveillance cam view.
9120300	9125300	It could be like Five Nights at Freddy's and you could switch cams and in like one moment I'll just run up to the camera.
9125300	9131300	We gotta get the future. I gotta be on a quadcopter because that's not dangerous or anything.
9131300	9133300	Let the listeners fly a drone around the studio.
9133300	9136300	The whole time it's like, yeah.
9136300	9139300	It's coming dangerous close to my face.
9139300	9141300	Sounds great.
9141300	9145300	Alright, anyway, I hope you had fun, Mike. We'll see you again soon, I'm sure.
9145300	9148300	Thank you for blessing us with your presence. Do you have anything to promote?
9148300	9151300	This time, sure, might as well. I'll just plug my Twitter.
9151300	9159300	It's at mnav3. My Hearthstone one is the same, but just at HS for Hearthstone.
9159300	9162300	Is that your Twitch channel too, mnav3?
9162300	9164300	Yep. It's all my gaming stuff.
9164300	9166300	Go get some Twitch followers.
9166300	9176300	Yeah, why not? And then if any of you guys are on Battle.net, if you go to my Hearthstone Twitter, because I don't remember my battle tag info, it's on there.
9176300	9181300	So, if you play Hearthstone, we can play some games and hopefully I won't lose.
9181300	9183300	He's way better at Hearthstone than I am, that's for sure.
9183300	9184300	Yeah, a little bit.
9184300	9188300	Alright, thank you again for being here and have a great time. We'll see you again in the future.
9188300	9189300	Thank you.
9189300	9202300	So, going around to everybody else. Final thoughts. I'll start. My final thought is I think I'm going to play a little more No Man's Sky before I go to bed tonight and face the week tomorrow.
9202300	9209300	And I can't believe time is running out until Dragon Con and there's all this other stuff going on over the next couple weekends.
9209300	9213300	So, it's going to be a busy couple weeks, so everybody that knows me, please bear with me.
9213300	9218300	But I'm very excited for Dragon Con. Very, very excited. Loki, your final thought?
9218300	9221300	So, yeah, hopefully I'll work on my game if my computer doesn't fuck up again.
9221300	9233300	Oh, and another bonus to that is I had my bookmarks in Firefox, which a lot of resources for things I was using to research my game engine and everything and all the pages I had open are gone.
9233300	9238300	Because for some fucking reason they decided that, hey, we're going to keep all your files in the same spot.
9238300	9241300	Oh, except for your bookmarks. Fuck those, we decided to delete them.
9241300	9248300	Because they were there before, because I backed them up and now they're fucking gone. Because fuck you, we're Windows and we'll do fucking one.
9248300	9249300	No more porn for you.
9249300	9250300	Fuck your bookmarks.
9250300	9256300	Oh, porn. God, that's all in my head. I'm talking about like, you know, no one needs shit.
9256300	9261300	How am I going to remember Pornhub? That's going to be so hard for me to remember that website.
9261300	9266300	I mean, porn is just dumb. Who needs bookmarks for porn?
9266300	9267300	The good shit.
9268300	9273300	Please. It's a fucking buffet that's ever-changing all the time. We don't need a good shit.
9273300	9275300	A buffet full of crap.
9275300	9279300	Alright. And last but not least, Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.
9279300	9281300	Cheesecake.
9281300	9289300	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will see you in seven days to do it all over again. Good night and have fun.
