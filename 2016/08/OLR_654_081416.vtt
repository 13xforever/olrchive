This week Rocket League wraps up its Championship Series and teases more new content bringing

00:18.000 --> 00:20.880
power-ups to your favorite RC-powered soccer simulator.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.160
Loosen your boots and join us for this and plenty more news on tonight's episode of the

00:24.160 --> 00:31.440
show where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.320 --> 00:36.040
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.040 --> 00:44.320
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, August the 14th of 2016 with episode number 654 of

00:44.320 --> 00:45.320
our show.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.840
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California to talk

00:49.840 --> 00:55.000
with you guys over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.280
Again I'm Rob and you can find me on Twitter at Skie and she is DarkSakura.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.520
I have blue roots.

01:00.520 --> 01:05.460
Yeah, actually I love this hair thing you've got going on with the blended like blue to

01:05.460 --> 01:06.460
red thing.

01:06.460 --> 01:13.600
I went to see Monet and my hair is blue going into red in some parts and purple in others.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.440
So it's actually both.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.840
It's really unfortunate that this is radio so nobody can see it.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.440
Maybe if someone bribes me with cheesecake, I'll take a picture.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.080
I will thank you for being a friend.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.080
You'll travel around the world and back again for cheesecake.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.800
Also joining us tonight, welcome back this week, Loki.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.040
Yes and my breadsticks go from marinara to creamy garlic sauce.

01:38.040 --> 01:43.400
Oh, I see that it's blended, blended sauces as opposed to blended hair.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.040
I see, fantastic.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.800
How was your couple weeks been?

01:47.840 --> 01:51.480
I'm sorry you weren't here last week, but yeah, I had to deal with the kids last week.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.840
I understand it happens because my wife couldn't pick them up and as a result, we had to deal

01:56.840 --> 01:57.840
with Shane.

01:57.840 --> 01:58.840
So thank you for that.

01:58.840 --> 01:59.840
No, it's fine.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.840
No, he did.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.840
He did.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
It was at Power Morphicon.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
He did a fine job.

02:03.840 --> 02:04.840
Yeah.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
He's at Power Morphicon right now actually.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.200
And this will be the second podcast today where I've brought him up.

02:08.200 --> 02:11.760
His ego has got to be swelling because we did Poke Stop earlier today.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.800
He wasn't able to be there.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.560
So obviously because he's doing the Power Morphicon stuff of covering for Ranger Pride,

02:17.560 --> 02:18.560
his show.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.860
So, but I'm sure he'll be back another week to bless us with his presence again and talk

02:22.860 --> 02:25.160
about how his shiny hunting is going.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.160
Yep.

02:26.160 --> 02:31.300
So it's basically been just a rollercoaster of karma, I guess.

02:31.300 --> 02:35.960
So starting off with the bad karma, I guess for some reason, well not even really bad

02:35.960 --> 02:37.920
karma, just bad shit that fucking happened.

02:37.920 --> 02:46.000
So like I was at work and my pants ripped like to the point, like thankfully it was,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.600
I was already at my car, you know, when that happened.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.320
So it wasn't like anything embarrassing, but like, like almost to the point where like

02:52.320 --> 02:54.320
one of the pant legs could literally have come off.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.000
I don't even know how that happened.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.800
It's just like, I'm like, where the fuck did this happen?

02:59.800 --> 03:05.000
Same day, check engine light comes on, like, are you fucking kidding me?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.200
And then I go home, check your engine and check your caboose.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.560
And then I go home to work on my computer and everything's cool.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.600
Then all of a sudden, you know, I go to shut my son's window because it's, you know, it's

03:16.600 --> 03:18.840
just before bed, you know, and everything.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.220
I shut his window, come back, my computer's black screen.

03:22.220 --> 03:24.160
And I was like, okay, that's weird.

03:24.160 --> 03:31.800
So I restart it, won't restart, have to reload windows again, reload windows, seems fine

03:31.800 --> 03:36.160
for a while, start to, you know, import myself for my backup again.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.440
Fucking does it again.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
Did it again.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.280
Today, I redid everything.

03:42.280 --> 03:47.120
Once again, third time, finally had the reinstall windows for the third time.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.880
So far, it hasn't crashed yet, but that's the shit I have to fucking deal with.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.320
So wait, so that's the bad karma.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.320
What's the good karma?

03:54.320 --> 03:56.060
Oh, the good karma is just, you know, work shit.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.600
So basically I've had lots of meetings with people.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.600
The department I'm working in right now, they're very manual for everything that they do.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.120
So like data entry stuff is just all very manual.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.560
So by showing a little ass at work, you got a promotion?

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
No, no, no.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.760
That's what it sounds like to me.

04:12.760 --> 04:19.720
No, no, no, by basically, because we use a terminal program that basically emulates an

04:19.720 --> 04:25.680
old mainframe system and it supports macros and those macros support Visual Basic Scripting.

04:25.680 --> 04:31.400
And so out of sheer boredom or just curiosity, I've been teaching myself Visual Basic Scripting.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.640
That is a great skill to have.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.640
We had some people at my old job that's like, that did that stuff.

04:36.640 --> 04:37.640
Yes.

04:37.640 --> 04:42.640
And I've fucking rocked it basically because I've automated a ton of shit and just like

04:42.640 --> 04:43.640
done stuff with her.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.840
They're like, I didn't even know you could do that.

04:44.840 --> 04:49.440
And just like all my boss, my boss's boss, the director of the environment, they're just

04:49.440 --> 04:51.860
like all fucking static.

04:51.860 --> 04:56.560
Would you say that maybe all those programming things for the game you never fucking finished?

04:56.560 --> 05:00.200
I was trying to work on it twice when I've tried to work on it.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.140
My computer is just self-destructed.

05:02.140 --> 05:06.780
So it's like, I've tried, but the fucking universe doesn't want it to happen.

05:06.780 --> 05:07.780
You're cursed.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.780
Oh, hi.

05:08.780 --> 05:09.780
I need to introduce as well.

05:09.780 --> 05:14.940
We also have here in studio, another special guest to the show who has nothing to promote.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.300
Not even a Twitter, not a show.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.500
He's just here to hang out.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.260
Say hello everybody to Mike.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.260
What's up?

05:21.260 --> 05:22.260
Hey Mike.

05:22.260 --> 05:23.260
How's it going?

05:23.260 --> 05:24.260
Is your mic on, Mike?

05:24.260 --> 05:25.260
I don't know.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.260
I don't know why we weren't hearing you.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.260
Anyway.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.260
Hi Mike.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.260
How are you?

05:29.260 --> 05:30.260
I'm doing good.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.260
How are you?

05:31.380 --> 05:32.380
It is the show.

05:32.380 --> 05:33.380
It is.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.060
I thought you were promoting a sports podcast last time you were here, but it never happened.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.980
No, I just said I was, I was, uh, no, what was it?

05:38.980 --> 05:39.980
Uh, Hearthstone.

05:39.980 --> 05:40.980
I was doing Hearthstone.

05:40.980 --> 05:41.980
Oh, Hearthstone.

05:41.980 --> 05:42.980
Are you still streaming?

05:42.980 --> 05:43.980
Hearthstone?

05:43.980 --> 05:46.980
I haven't had the time to stream lately, but yeah, it's on my list.

05:46.980 --> 05:47.980
It's on my list.

05:47.980 --> 05:48.980
It's on my to do list.

05:48.980 --> 05:49.980
It's a lengthy to do list.

05:49.980 --> 05:50.980
But yeah.

05:50.980 --> 05:56.860
Uh, Mike also joined us on Pokestop podcast this week, filled in for an absent Shane.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.180
So there's that.

05:58.180 --> 06:02.180
Um, and you have such a unique name that people could find too easy on the internet.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.180
If you want to follow you.

06:03.180 --> 06:04.180
I'm sure.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.180
Exactly.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.340
Well maybe this time around, I'll, I'll plug a Twitter handle or something.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.340
There you go.

06:08.340 --> 06:09.340
You know, believe I'm interesting enough.

06:09.340 --> 06:10.340
There you go.

06:10.340 --> 06:11.340
Awesome.

06:11.340 --> 06:13.660
Uh, as 200 Matt in chat says, yay sports, do you play sports games?

06:13.660 --> 06:18.500
I mean, this, this is a big time to be talking usually, usually the one show a year will

06:18.500 --> 06:20.060
regress in a sports game.

06:20.060 --> 06:25.340
Talk is, is Superbowl Sunday, but we have Olympics right now and that's kind of a big

06:25.340 --> 06:26.340
deal.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.340
Do you play sports games?

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
I don't play sports games.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.820
Um, only because they make me want to just go play the sport instead.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.780
And then you're one of those guys.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.380
You're one of those guys, right?

06:36.380 --> 06:40.740
Why, why would I, why would I play double dribble when I can go outside and actually

06:40.740 --> 06:41.740
bounce about?

06:41.740 --> 06:44.500
I want to see the look of shame on the person's face.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.540
But can you, can you dunk like the game?

06:48.540 --> 06:49.540
Not anymore.

06:49.540 --> 06:50.540
I used to.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.540
Yeah.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.540
That's cool.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.340
So, so, uh, do you, do you play like the Olympic games?

06:55.340 --> 06:58.420
I mean, I suppose this is a topical question for me to ask you ever played any of those

06:58.420 --> 07:04.380
like Mario and Sonic at the, uh, the last one I played was, Oh good God, it was, uh,

07:04.380 --> 07:06.740
the 2008 Olympic one.

07:06.740 --> 07:07.740
The Wii one.

07:07.740 --> 07:08.740
That was, those are huge.

07:08.740 --> 07:09.740
Yeah.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.740
Those are huge.

07:10.740 --> 07:11.740
Yeah.

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
It made your shoulders burn, man.

07:12.740 --> 07:13.740
Yeah.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.740
Cause you had to work it up a sweat and everything.

07:14.740 --> 07:15.740
It was disgusting.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.980
I was like, Oh, this is too much for a game for me.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.220
Um, let's see.

07:19.220 --> 07:23.940
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, where we do tape live every Sunday night

07:23.940 --> 07:28.420
at the voice geeks, network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right

07:28.420 --> 07:33.060
after the Bobby Blackwell show at Bobby actually starts us off here with a comment in our chat

07:33.060 --> 07:37.740
at live.vognetwork.com with I played the official video game of the real Olympics grand theft

07:37.740 --> 07:38.740
auto five.

07:38.740 --> 07:39.740
Yes.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.420
I am hearing there are some unfortunate issues going on there.

07:43.420 --> 07:47.140
Um, that joke is probably an extreme USA basketball staying on a boat.

07:47.140 --> 07:52.860
It's uh, it's, that joke is probably an extremely poor taste, but I did snicker, um, as it happens,

07:52.900 --> 07:56.820
uh, dark to see and chat says, that's why I prefer NBA jam and NFL blitz.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.540
I was never into sports.

07:58.540 --> 08:02.420
What do you tell all the gamers that are like, I'm not into sports.

08:02.420 --> 08:05.380
Do we need to just suck it up and try or what?

08:05.380 --> 08:06.380
Try playing sports?

08:06.380 --> 08:07.380
Yeah.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.380
No, it's not for everyone.

08:08.380 --> 08:09.380
I coach.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.380
I see it.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.980
It's like, yeah, it's not for everyone.

08:12.980 --> 08:16.620
Do you, I don't know if I should ask this cause I don't want you to get in trouble if

08:16.620 --> 08:17.620
somebody hears this.

08:17.620 --> 08:18.620
Okay.

08:18.620 --> 08:23.020
Do you ever have a kid that you're coaching where you're like, just seriously pull the

08:23.020 --> 08:25.980
kid out of class all the time.

08:25.980 --> 08:34.080
But then I, since I'm a good coach, I encourage them nonetheless and uh, understand that most

08:34.080 --> 08:35.420
of it's confidence.

08:35.420 --> 08:43.340
So it's like if I, you know, especially in basketball, it's not, uh, all about scoring.

08:43.340 --> 08:46.560
It's like, there's so much other things that you can do to be helpful.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.280
So it's like, I'm going to find something that you're going to get you that you're good

08:49.280 --> 08:50.280
at.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.120
That was a very PC answer that won't get you fired.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.760
You handled that very well.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.600
That's actually how I really, truly do it.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
That's not just being PC.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
That's actually how I do it.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.720
That's a great answer.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.560
You should go volunteer for the Donald Trump campaign and help his ass out cause he needs

09:03.560 --> 09:04.560
to help him.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.560
Yeah.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
Um, where do I get cyanide?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
A shovel.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
Cyanide?

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
All right.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.560
Not, not, not.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.560
Okay.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.560
Not okay.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.800
A shovel will help because you're going to need a solid foundation for a giant wall like

09:16.800 --> 09:17.800
that.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.800
There you go.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.800
Now that's a funny joke.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.800
All right.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.800
Okay.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
Anyway, uh, let's see.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.920
Going back to our chat live.vognetwork.com Bobby Black Wolf says, I played baseball for

09:26.920 --> 09:31.760
two years as a young kid, but my stereo blindness made it hard to watch the ball, but they had

09:31.760 --> 09:34.840
to play me anyway because every kid got played.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
Yep.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.280
So, so you, so you have to put the kids in.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
Yeah.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.120
But then like I get to make up my roster.

09:42.120 --> 09:47.120
So like my, my lineup, so it's like, I'm going to make sure that that kid that's the weakest

09:47.120 --> 09:54.720
is at least with some kid that knows what he's doing or she, you know, um, Oh, do you

09:54.720 --> 09:58.920
ever get kids that think they know everything about the sport because they played video

09:58.920 --> 09:59.920
games?

09:59.920 --> 10:04.300
No, actually I've never, I've never had that happen.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.300
I've never had that happen.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.760
I think of like, like I've been coaching for like eight years and I've only had one kid

10:09.760 --> 10:12.760
ever mentioned like playing 2k or anything like that.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.560
Oh, no one plays them.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.440
Hey, well I was, 2k is fun.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.440
It's just not a game that I go out and pick up.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.880
Well, I was thinking there's so many like kids that are like, well, I saw that he saw

10:22.880 --> 10:24.360
somebody do this on TV.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.360
It's easy.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.120
So video games seems like a natural progression to watch space jam.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
I can jam.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.760
Yeah, I could dunk from half court.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.760
Heck yeah.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.380
Bugs Bunny could do it.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.380
He's a rabbit.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.580
I mean, for God's sakes.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.900
Actually Loki brings up a very important question that I have to ask, you know, any

10:40.900 --> 10:44.100
basketball coach I'm ever going to talk to in my life of which you're the only one I

10:44.100 --> 10:45.100
know.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.380
So here you go.

10:46.380 --> 10:51.220
On a scale of one to 10, how culturally important is the movie Space Jam?

10:51.220 --> 10:53.020
Space Jam is life.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.720
So 11.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.720
Maybe even a 12.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.720
Okay.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.720
It's important.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.060
It's an important movie.

10:59.060 --> 11:02.700
And at this point in time, none of the kids have seen Space Jam.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.700
You know what?

11:03.700 --> 11:07.280
Why don't you sit them down the first day and be like, you need to, oh no, I just avoid

11:07.280 --> 11:10.800
trying to talk about that stuff with them because I'm like, uh, you're going to make

11:10.800 --> 11:13.640
me feel way older than I need to feel.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.200
Two truths.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.480
I own it on laser disc.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.480
Second truth.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.760
Haven't seen it all the way through.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
What?

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
This needs to be fixed.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.200
I'll tell you something that needs to be fixed.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.920
Is it too soon for spoilers on that?

11:27.920 --> 11:31.400
They go to outer space and then play basketball.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.560
Yes.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
Guess who wins?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.320
The Looney Tunes.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
Let's see.

11:36.360 --> 11:40.520
Art Tetsuya in chat says, I think the Space Jam official website is still up.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.520
It is.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.520
And it's amazing.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.520
It is.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
It is original.

11:44.520 --> 11:51.040
It re it reminds you of a time when the only city in America that mattered was geo cities.

11:51.040 --> 11:56.080
Oh, it just takes you back to a simpler time.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.880
Uh, and STO 100 Matt says, come on, Rab slam.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.880
Come on Rab.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.480
Come on, Rob slam and welcome to the jam.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.040
Every time they say they want going to remake that movie, I die a little bit.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.040
Me too.

12:08.040 --> 12:12.800
Just, just don't like Hollywood, Hollywood needs to stop with the remakes.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
Stop.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.280
Well, they didn't want to do all of the remake.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.240
They wanted to do a quote unquote, seek cool.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.760
Even spiritual, even sequels are getting a little worrisome.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.120
Like I just, I just heard the other week they're going to make a sequel to the craft and I'm

12:26.120 --> 12:28.360
like, no, no, don't touch that.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.680
Well, they have the new witch movie coming out.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.000
Now you see here's where I'm on the line.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.960
I actually hear that's really, really good.

12:36.960 --> 12:37.960
So I don't know.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.360
So I guess I can't use the blanket statement of ban all sequels and ban all remakes.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.960
Cause if I said ban all sequels, we wouldn't get new star Wars movies and you know, kind

12:44.960 --> 12:45.960
of need those.

12:45.960 --> 12:49.680
But then again, that last star Trek movie here was not very great either.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.760
What do you, I hear in this, this re most recent one's the best one.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.760
Really?

12:53.760 --> 12:54.760
Yeah.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.840
But it's not doing well at the box office.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.800
Unfortunately it is the new star Trek.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
Yeah.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
Oh, I want to see it though.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
Yeah.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
I think that's a problem.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
We're not going to see it.

13:03.920 --> 13:08.680
I, and not to get, sorry, not to get too tangent because I know we're a video game show, but

13:08.680 --> 13:12.840
I think this is important is I was reading a very interesting article online about why

13:12.840 --> 13:15.000
isn't the movie star Trek performing better?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.680
Is it because the last movie wasn't so great?

13:17.680 --> 13:19.760
Is it because people are sick of the Abrams verse?

13:19.760 --> 13:23.180
Is it because, and I kind of think it's those things as well, but honestly, do you know

13:23.180 --> 13:27.300
what I think is the reason why star Trek is losing at the box office?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.320
There's no star Trek TV series on right now.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.640
Part of it, but there wasn't one with the last two movies either.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.000
And they did a fine.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.520
I think it's because a stranger things.

13:38.520 --> 13:43.440
I think it's because Netflix is starting to change a lot of this conversation when you

13:43.440 --> 13:46.500
can watch these very high quality things at home.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.680
It's almost like, and this is why I think this is a good topic for significantly cheaper

13:50.680 --> 13:51.680
too.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
Yeah.

13:52.680 --> 13:59.840
It's almost like what killed arcades when you could bring the, you know, gaming experience

13:59.840 --> 14:00.840
home.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.600
Now, I know a lot of people are going to be like, Rob, you're, you're talking like an

14:04.600 --> 14:09.080
idiot because if movies were going to die because you could bring the experience home

14:09.080 --> 14:10.080
that was happening back.

14:10.080 --> 14:16.080
I mean, when that, when, when the beta max have killed the movie theater, I just, things

14:16.080 --> 14:21.160
are getting more and higher quality and so forth where I think the things that are being

14:21.200 --> 14:26.680
offered on television, especially specialty services like Netflix and so forth are like

14:26.680 --> 14:31.600
on par with a lot of stuff that we go to the movies and see and for far less money.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.880
And I think that's, that's what I'm talking about.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.280
I'm not talking about the technology behind it.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.600
I'm talking about what all is being offered.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.740
Well, here's the problem is a lot of these companies that are making these movies are

14:42.740 --> 14:50.240
just throwing just a ridiculous amounts of money towards these franchises, but they're

14:50.240 --> 14:51.240
bad.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.560
I mean, you could throw all your money, you wanted a bad movie.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.560
It's still going to be bad.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.320
Well, I don't know.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.040
I still want to see the movie, but I didn't mean, I didn't mean to get too tangenty, but

15:00.040 --> 15:04.280
I just, you know, I kind of thought that there was, there was a little bit of a relevancy

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
there when we talk about arcades.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.280
I saw suicide squad and that was awesome.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
Yeah.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.280
Yeah.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.280
See, and Will Smith wasn't even annoying in it.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.280
I thought for sure.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.360
Like, you know, when they had the first trailer, was it some sort of super suicide squad?

15:15.360 --> 15:16.680
Like, Oh, come on.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
That's so cringy.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.360
Actually, it was pretty good.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.360
It was pretty good.

15:20.360 --> 15:24.460
But yet I, you know, what's funny, you, you have like the opposite view on movies than

15:24.460 --> 15:27.720
most people I talk to because a lot of people I'm hearing suicide squad, not, not a big

15:27.720 --> 15:32.540
fan of it because they're expecting like a ton of joker, you know, footage and stuff.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.240
Like he wasn't in the whole time, but that's all right.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.240
I thought it was fun.

15:36.240 --> 15:41.060
They cut apparently a whole bunch of the scenes, especially the ones that painted his relationship

15:41.060 --> 15:44.280
with Harley is a lot more abusive as what made it into the movie.

15:44.280 --> 15:49.160
If you haven't seen it yet, there's a suicide squad review at voggenetwork.com and you know

15:49.160 --> 15:52.480
at vog, we allow, you know, uh, response reviews and so forth.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.480
Right.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.640
So, um, I'm not going to spoil what our author thought of the review, but you know, he kind

15:56.640 --> 15:57.640
of felt one way.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.920
And what's interesting is that you don't see this happen with a lot of reviews at vog network.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.120
We have both concurring and dissenting opinions.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.400
So kind of interesting how that's working out.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.680
You know, uh, you know, I like it when not everybody necessarily agrees, we can have

16:10.680 --> 16:15.320
a civil discussion, keyword civil on, uh, the, uh, you know, kind of differences there.

16:15.320 --> 16:21.040
So, um, but then I want to mention in chat over at live.vog.network.com also, um, SHO

16:21.040 --> 16:24.720
100 map pointing out the cost of going to a theater cost twice as much as a monthly

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720
payment to Netflix.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.720
Yeah.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.040
Uh, William murder face and chat says, see star Wars seven.

16:30.040 --> 16:34.920
And I think, see, here's the thing, and this is important because I don't think like movies

16:34.920 --> 16:40.600
are going to like die or go away because there's still something to be said about event films.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.920
And a movie like star Wars is still an event film.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.440
And perhaps the reason why star Trek three is not performing as well as the others is

16:46.440 --> 16:50.720
that star Trek is losing that sense of an event film.

16:50.720 --> 16:55.100
And I don't know if that's because there's no TV show because the last movie wasn't so

16:55.100 --> 16:57.320
great and people are tired of the Abrams verse.

16:57.320 --> 17:02.800
I don't know what that is because there's no captain Jean-Luc Picard in there is why,

17:02.800 --> 17:04.400
but then here's okay.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.020
Dark Sakura, what movie did you see in a theater this week?

17:08.020 --> 17:09.280
Because I thought this was interesting.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
Oh yeah.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.320
I saw how it's a movie castle.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.600
And isn't that movie something like 10 years old?

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
2004.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
Yeah.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.400
So, but yet people, there was a lot of people that went to go pay and see this movie, right?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.360
Cause they made, they made an event out of it.

17:22.360 --> 17:26.640
I hadn't seen it before either and it had been on my list and I just never saw it.

17:26.640 --> 17:31.680
Um, and uh, this, uh, group here in Sacramento that does a lot of the cult movies like Rocky

17:31.680 --> 17:36.880
horn stuff, they just did a screening of the lost boys and hocus pocus, which I haven't

17:36.880 --> 17:41.000
seen hocus pocus either are two amazing films and they, they, I don't know if they sold

17:41.000 --> 17:44.800
out the theater, but they got several hundred people there to see these movies that are

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
years and years old.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.120
Well, I love going to the crest anyway.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.480
It's gorgeous inside there.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.840
Sometimes it's fun to just so see cult movies with a big crowd of people who yell at the

17:51.840 --> 17:52.840
script.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.960
I mean, that's part of the, why I did Rocky horror for years.

17:53.960 --> 17:59.680
They actually said, um, uh, please be quiet during the film and don't, you know, call

17:59.680 --> 18:00.680
out at the screen.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.760
Well, sure, sure.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.520
And if you're just like, well, this ain't Rocky.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
Yeah, it depends.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.520
It depends on what you're seeing.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.520
Right.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.520
But everyone was really respectful.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.520
Yeah.

18:08.520 --> 18:15.920
So anyway, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, let's see, um, stopping and chats is

18:15.920 --> 18:21.200
so crazy that the critic score on Rotten Tomatoes is like 25% and audience is like 75%.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.040
I think that's about suicide squad.

18:23.040 --> 18:31.120
Um, let's see also, um, uh, Sia Tabiri says like before noon, my local AMC has basically

18:31.120 --> 18:32.120
half price tickets.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.720
I'm cheap and go to the movies when they have deals.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.400
Maybe movies are getting too expensive.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.400
I don't know.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.720
Making these other ways to consume media more attractive.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.520
I don't, we need more of the movie grill places.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.520
Yeah.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
They need more of those.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.360
And they also are starting to add a lot of gimmicks to it.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.840
Like they have the D box stuff, which I've tried it before and it was fun.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
Yeah.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.800
We saw Tron in the D one was fun and D box.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.140
It was silly, but finally, but now they've got this thing, like I don't even know what

18:57.140 --> 19:01.920
it is necessarily, but I saw they had it during our little preview thing and it's like, it's

19:01.920 --> 19:04.160
like a three monitors display basically.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.440
I've heard about it like in front of you and then kind of the side, like for sort of

19:07.440 --> 19:09.820
like a surround ish thing.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.240
And you know what they're trying to do with that?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.520
Something that you can't replicate in the home.

19:12.520 --> 19:17.280
So you have to come to the theater except people have fucking three monitors plays well

19:17.280 --> 19:18.280
already.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.280
So, Ooh.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
All right.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.280
Anyway.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.280
All right.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
I need to, I need to shift the conversation back to games.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.920
Although I love this talk about movies and you know, I think, I think anybody who is

19:25.920 --> 19:30.600
a fan of games, of course you consume, I'm sure a lot of you watch Netflix while you

19:30.600 --> 19:32.460
game or, or do other stuff as well.

19:32.460 --> 19:36.460
But I want to get back into video games and specifically the types of stuff that we've

19:36.460 --> 19:37.460
been playing this week.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.060
Cause I know there's one big game we got to talk about in this segment.

19:40.060 --> 19:43.900
And I think it's the game everybody's talking about, but everybody plays different stuff.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.900
So let's talk about your gaming week, dark soccer.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.700
How was your gaming week?

19:47.700 --> 19:49.580
I played Sims four.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.660
I played Pokemon go.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.980
Dan played, um, another Metroid remake too.

19:55.980 --> 19:56.980
Oh yeah.

19:56.980 --> 19:57.980
How was that?

19:57.980 --> 19:58.980
He likes it.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.980
I love the music in it.

19:59.980 --> 20:04.460
I used to turn off, um, whatever I was, uh, my music in Sims just to listen to Dan play

20:04.460 --> 20:07.540
the music and then would watch him for a little bit cause he's playing it on his computer.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.100
Um, it's really great.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.100
Yeah.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.380
They did a really good job with that remake.

20:11.380 --> 20:15.260
I mean, but I super liked the Brinstar music in there cause it's like the super Metroid

20:15.260 --> 20:16.260
one.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.260
Yeah.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.260
Only a lot more subdued.

20:18.260 --> 20:25.220
So it has like the, the background, uh, uh, like the counter melody in it, but the, the

20:25.220 --> 20:26.640
main tone of it is different.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.980
So it's pretty cool.

20:27.980 --> 20:28.980
I don't know.

20:28.980 --> 20:34.980
I understand why Nintendo had to, you know, kind of step in and, and you know, for obvious

20:34.980 --> 20:35.980
reasons, right?

20:35.980 --> 20:40.100
They cease and desisted the whole Metroid thing, but I just wish there's a part of me

20:40.100 --> 20:45.220
that kind of wishes Nintendo would kind of see the demand for this and think about maybe

20:45.220 --> 20:49.900
if there's these people that want to make this, then try to try to work something out.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.140
But they are seeing that there's a demand for Metroid.

20:53.140 --> 20:58.180
That's why Metroid Federation Force, a truly Metroid game is coming out very soon.

20:58.180 --> 21:02.500
I, here's the thing I actually think with that game, I think that was a way to keep

21:02.500 --> 21:03.500
the trademark.

21:03.500 --> 21:10.540
I think they, they made a Metroid game, like the Silent Hill Plinko and it actually, uh,

21:10.540 --> 21:12.540
you mean Pachinko?

21:12.540 --> 21:15.580
Plinko is a game that Drew Carey moderates on the Price is Right.

21:15.580 --> 21:16.580
Sure.

21:16.580 --> 21:20.500
But Pachinko, it keeps those trademarks alive.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.500
Yes.

21:21.500 --> 21:28.120
But just re-release the virtual console games or something on like a disc or something.

21:28.120 --> 21:34.600
It would be still way better than this garbage, which is available either this week on the

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
3DS.

21:35.600 --> 21:41.240
Well, until you've played it, I don't think you can call it garbage, though, have you?

21:41.240 --> 21:42.240
Really?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.280
I need to play it to see that it's garbage.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
Here we go.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.280
Here we go.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.480
I mean, I've only seen the trailers and that's convincing enough.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.880
What if it's good?

21:50.880 --> 21:52.960
Suicide Squad had some pretty crap trailers.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
What are we talking about?

21:53.960 --> 21:55.200
All their trailers were fucking awesome.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.120
They were pretty fucking awesome, actually.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.120
I'm sorry.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.120
I'm not in agreement.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.120
All right.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.120
All right.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.120
I got you.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.820
There is like nothing that screams, this is Metroid.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.520
It's just like, hey, this is not the title.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
Yeah, exactly.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.520
The title.

22:09.520 --> 22:16.880
Anyway, back to Dark Soccer and her gaming week, this is AM2R.

22:16.880 --> 22:17.880
That's it.

22:17.880 --> 22:18.880
Oh, that's it.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.880
Oh, yeah.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.040
I actually have been playing a bunch of Peggle lately.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.040
Okay.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.120
Just because it's quick and easy and I'm actually pretty good at it.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.080
You know what I miss?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.400
PopCap.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.400
I miss PopCap games.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.400
I mean, I understand.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.440
I think they're putting out stuff.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.560
They do the Plants vs. Zombies shooter or something like that.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
I don't know.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.560
Yeah.

22:37.560 --> 22:42.000
I miss PopCap before EA bought them, like when they were making those silly, addictive

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
games.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.640
Oh, and I also bought Legion so I can meet my demon hunter.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
World of Warcraft Legion.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.640
Yeah.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.640
Yeah.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.640
Fun.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.640
Because of reasons.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.640
Because...

22:54.640 --> 22:55.640
I'm tired.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.160
Rob, let's have coffee.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.840
I could make some coffee if you need some coffee.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.480
Wait, I already thought you can't drink coffee.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.480
That was, that's over.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.480
I can drink it again.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.480
Well, then...

23:03.480 --> 23:05.480
Well, let's get you coffee.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.480
Rob!

23:06.480 --> 23:07.480
Coffee!

23:07.480 --> 23:08.480
Anyway.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.480
We need cheesecake delivery.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.480
All right.

23:11.480 --> 23:12.480
Stop talking about food.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.480
Get back to games.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.480
All right.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.480
Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:15.480 --> 23:20.200
So my gaming week was pretty much consisting of mobile games because once again, my wife

23:20.200 --> 23:23.920
is still watching Grey's Anatomy.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.240
But I did get a few days to play No Man's Sky, so that's good.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.680
And No Man's Sky is pretty fantastic.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.240
The first planet I ended up on was pretty cold, I guess.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.600
And so I ended up leaving that and ended up on a hot planet.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.780
And then I left that planet to, I thought it was a moon, but I guess maybe it's another

23:42.780 --> 23:47.840
planet that's actually more moderate and has some water and stuff in there.

23:47.840 --> 23:53.000
And it's kind of funny because the planet that I was, this last planet I was on, has

23:53.060 --> 23:57.100
all these really giant dinosaur-looking things that are friendly.

23:57.100 --> 24:01.300
And this little fucking cow-looking thing is fucking aggressive.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.840
Is it a shifty space cow?

24:02.840 --> 24:04.400
Yes, it is a shifty space cow.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.120
It comes up and it's like rawr!

24:06.120 --> 24:10.860
And then tries to attack me, and I just shoot the laser thing into its head.

24:10.860 --> 24:11.860
It's all...

24:11.860 --> 24:15.680
It's just silly because it's no threat whatsoever.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.400
It just comes up, bites me, and I shoot it in the face of the laser.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.000
It just falls over.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.360
And I laugh.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
Until the sentinels show up and they're like...

24:24.400 --> 24:25.400
See, we have fucking sentinels.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.880
Did you destroy one of my rocks?

24:26.880 --> 24:27.880
You're fucking dead.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.880
We're gonna send a giant robot.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.400
I'm like, dude, I just fucking blew up a rock that's in a cave.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.840
What the fuck do you care?

24:32.840 --> 24:34.920
So, I don't know.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.920
I hate the sentinels.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.720
Those are seriously the worst thing in that game.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.640
That and the glitch where apparently your hyperdrive thing is all broken if you get

24:42.640 --> 24:44.800
the pre-order thing, which...

24:44.800 --> 24:48.640
I'm on a different ship now, and I was trying to repair that hyperdrive.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.100
Probably why I can't find the part to do it, so...

24:51.100 --> 24:52.100
That makes sense.

24:52.740 --> 24:54.380
Are you on PC or PlayStation 4?

24:54.380 --> 24:55.380
PlayStation 4.

24:55.380 --> 24:56.380
Oh, okay.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.820
I was curious if you were subject to all those issues the PC version's been having.

24:58.820 --> 25:04.140
Yes, I'm subject to that because my PC is shit and wouldn't be able to run that at all.

25:04.140 --> 25:08.300
It would be just like, no, sorry.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.140
Alan's running it on PC.

25:10.140 --> 25:13.820
He actually was watching me play it, and he watched it enough where he's like, fine, I'm

25:13.820 --> 25:15.380
gonna get this.

25:15.380 --> 25:19.480
And he bought it on PC, and honestly, it looks better on PlayStation 4, but I think that's

25:19.480 --> 25:22.760
because he had to turn the settings way down to get the frame rate to work.

25:22.760 --> 25:23.760
Yeah, they're still fixing stuff.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.000
Because obviously, and I know we'll get to it later in some of the stories and so forth,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.880
but obviously the PC version's been having a lot of issues, which is unfortunate, but

25:31.880 --> 25:33.920
kind of makes you go...

25:33.920 --> 25:37.580
With my laptop being as shitty as it was this week, I'm actually thinking about building

25:37.580 --> 25:39.080
a PC now.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.720
But of course, my way, not a normal PC.

25:43.720 --> 25:47.880
It's gonna basically be this portable PC that I'll be using for VR, but it's also gonna

25:47.880 --> 25:52.840
have a custom-built screen slash keyboard thing that's basically like my laptop that's

25:52.840 --> 25:57.880
tethered to it that I'll be able to pull out and use on my lap as a laptop, and then shove

25:57.880 --> 26:05.880
that big hunky thing with a 1080 GTX card in there, and I'll be set.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.000
That's of course if I get this new job and the pay raise that comes with it and all that

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
stuff.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.240
In the meantime, I'll just deal with this.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.240
Other stuff I've been playing, mobile games again.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.920
Of course, I've actually been playing more Ingress this week than I have been playing

26:18.920 --> 26:20.240
Pokemon Go.

26:20.240 --> 26:26.040
I have been playing Pokemon Go, I'm getting bored with it, honestly.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.880
It's just...

26:27.880 --> 26:31.720
In my neighborhood and stuff, because I don't really get to go out that far to places.

26:31.720 --> 26:38.800
And even when I do go to different places, it ends up like Roseville, nearby, or wherever.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.520
It's just the same shit over and over.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.960
It's the same fucking Pokemon that are everywhere, and it's just boring.

26:44.960 --> 26:49.960
Especially when I'm playing it and there's Rattata or something that's got a 500 CP or

26:49.960 --> 26:50.960
something.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.120
I'm like, I know this is gonna be a pain in the ass to catch.

26:53.120 --> 26:57.640
I'm literally walking away from those now, because it's a waste of my time.

26:57.640 --> 27:02.400
So I'm getting a little bored with it, but still playing it, whatever, and then Ingress,

27:02.400 --> 27:07.160
of course I'm playing that just to keep up my streak, which is almost over at the end

27:07.160 --> 27:09.620
of September.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.840
So hopefully that'll be that.

27:11.840 --> 27:19.280
And then still tap my Katamari, because when I haven't been able to have the TV, it's just

27:19.280 --> 27:20.760
been kind of what I've been going to.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.480
And they had another exploit in the game, which is patched out now.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.800
But if you haven't patched yours, because I read about that, and they said, oh yeah,

27:27.800 --> 27:28.800
we're patching that out.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.180
I'm like, well I'm not fucking upgrading then.

27:31.180 --> 27:36.960
So it's basically, you do the auto-step thing that they have, it's like some love thing,

27:36.960 --> 27:38.280
I don't remember what it's called.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.720
And then you change your language settings, and it stays on.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.600
And you can stack it a bunch of times.

27:44.600 --> 27:49.500
And so basically just let it sit there, and the game will play itself.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.080
Of course I have other ways to do that as well.

27:51.080 --> 27:56.080
But although their new update, they did add some stuff, so I may need to do that, but

27:56.080 --> 27:58.360
right now I'm not.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.760
I still don't know why I'm playing that game either, because there's really no point to

28:00.760 --> 28:01.760
it.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.480
It's like, I'm playing this, I'm like, why am I still playing this game?

28:04.480 --> 28:07.160
There's no fucking point to this game.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.840
I don't know.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.960
You can say that about almost any game though, to be fair.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.960
Well no ask I even, sometimes I'm like, I don't really know what I'm doing here, I go

28:15.960 --> 28:20.200
to these different planets and it's just kind of like, I don't know, this creature sort

28:20.200 --> 28:23.040
of looks like that last creature I saw.

28:23.040 --> 28:27.840
And the sentinels really ruin it, because it'd be fun to like, here's how I thought

28:27.840 --> 28:33.360
it was supposed to be, I thought it was, oh if you're like a fucking dick to all the wildlife

28:33.360 --> 28:38.040
out there, you're just blowing shit up, then the sentinels come and try to stop you.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.620
Which makes sense.

28:39.620 --> 28:44.420
But like the fact that like, oh you harvested a rock, well we're gonna have to fucking send

28:44.420 --> 28:47.360
like nukes on you now, it's like, that makes no sense.

28:47.360 --> 28:52.740
That they're on every fucking planet in the fucking universe, is a dumb thing that they

28:52.740 --> 28:53.740
added.

28:53.740 --> 28:56.860
Yeah, I understand the need to like gamify it, but I almost wish they'd put in like a

28:56.860 --> 29:00.140
difficulty thing where you could just turn it off, like kind of like in Minecraft, you

29:00.140 --> 29:03.740
have peaceful mode or whatever, you could do that, but then when you're supposedly in

29:03.740 --> 29:08.300
an online universe, I guess everything has to be stabilized, although, how online is

29:08.300 --> 29:09.300
it really?

29:09.300 --> 29:13.000
I'm sure we heard about the two people that, you know, tried to run into each other by

29:13.000 --> 29:15.780
being in the same galaxy and nothing, I guess.

29:15.780 --> 29:21.020
Well there were server issues, and I think one of them was not connected to the online

29:21.020 --> 29:24.420
server, because if you notice in the screenshots, they were both in the same spot, but it was

29:24.420 --> 29:29.340
different times of day, so it wasn't synced up, and so that's what they even said to their

29:29.340 --> 29:32.700
server issues, and they have new features now that you can scan for players that are

29:32.700 --> 29:37.140
nearby and go meet them, so they're trying to promote that, and you can do that, it's

29:37.140 --> 29:42.380
just, their, you know, the server problems right now are just pretty bad.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.760
Thankfully though, it doesn't rely too much on the online servers, so you can still play

29:45.760 --> 29:51.380
the game without it really being a problem that you can't connect all the time.

29:51.380 --> 29:53.420
So I'm definitely going to be playing a lot more of that.

29:53.420 --> 29:56.340
Yeah, I'm still super into No Man's Sky myself, in fact, are you done with your game of the

29:56.340 --> 29:57.340
week?

29:57.340 --> 29:58.340
Because I want to talk about No Man's Sky.

29:58.340 --> 30:01.620
Alright, so, obviously, I've been playing No Man's Sky as well, started with a live

30:01.620 --> 30:07.060
stream on Monday, I got the game a day early by some miracle, just by Amazon, didn't

30:07.060 --> 30:10.380
pull any strings or anything, so I got the game a day early, so the first thing I was

30:10.380 --> 30:13.700
like, I'm going to do a live stream, and did like a, you know, I don't know anything about

30:13.700 --> 30:18.980
this game live stream, and I, you know, I've been a little bit critical of No Man's Sky

30:18.980 --> 30:23.260
in the lead up to it being, you know, we've joked, I don't think it was like actual criticism,

30:23.260 --> 30:27.280
but like, kind of like tongue in cheek, like, where's the game, yo?

30:27.280 --> 30:30.900
What's the game in No Man's Sky, y'all keep showing these trailers, but where's the game?

30:30.900 --> 30:34.820
You know, now that I understand, you know, what the game is, yes, I get that it's a journey

30:34.820 --> 30:41.260
basically, and you, it's an inventory management sim, well, in a way, in a way, yes, the game

30:41.260 --> 30:46.980
is to live off the land with limited resources, you know, because it is in a lot of games

30:46.980 --> 30:51.220
that you play, like let's say a role playing game like Final Fantasy, it is kind of something

30:51.220 --> 30:56.980
how you could carry around like, you know, 970 items in your magical backpack, you know,

30:56.980 --> 31:01.180
you can craft a hyperdrive, but for some reason, I just can't build more pockets or like a

31:01.180 --> 31:06.340
larger backpack to hold 500 units of ore, but anyway, look, okay, all that stuff aside,

31:06.340 --> 31:11.020
like, I get the progression of being able to expand that and the whole live off the

31:11.020 --> 31:12.020
land element.

31:12.020 --> 31:15.540
So, you know, I understand that that's part of the challenge.

31:15.540 --> 31:22.820
So actually, like, I find No Man's Sky to be that really, like, great blend of zen that

31:22.820 --> 31:27.900
I get from Minecraft, like, digging a tunnel in Minecraft is very zen for me, like, it's

31:27.900 --> 31:32.060
just very, like, relaxing and something I could just kind of do, you know, building

31:32.060 --> 31:36.140
a coaster or whatever, it's just like something silly, time wasting, no point, whatever.

31:36.140 --> 31:39.660
And I kind of, I kind of get that out of No Man's Sky as well.

31:39.660 --> 31:44.700
I think part of what's always not worked for me in Minecraft is that I'm not much of a

31:44.700 --> 31:45.820
builder.

31:45.820 --> 31:49.940
So it's like, I'm building like straightaway tunnels, but I'm not able to build these fancy

31:49.940 --> 31:54.620
houses that people do and these elaborate things, you don't really have to do that in

31:54.620 --> 31:57.260
No Man's Sky, it's just about kind of like the templates.

31:57.260 --> 32:02.780
So I kind of get that mix of, I have a purpose for why I'm hunting for all this stuff, but

32:02.780 --> 32:05.020
I don't, like, have to, like, build or anything like that.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.860
But wouldn't it be cool, though, if you could build, like, settlements or like, you know,

32:07.860 --> 32:08.860
some sort of place?

32:08.860 --> 32:09.860
Actually, yeah, that would be rad.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.140
I would love to build a settlement that somebody else could explore.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.380
That would be very, very cool.

32:14.380 --> 32:19.460
But I, you know, I don't know, I, right now I'm enjoying the whole fact that, you know,

32:19.460 --> 32:24.540
I jump forward as I'm moving towards the center of the galaxy or the side quests or whatever

32:24.540 --> 32:29.540
you want to call them, excuse me, that pop up, like, I'm moving a little bit more towards

32:29.540 --> 32:32.760
this other path that I was given.

32:32.760 --> 32:36.780
For those that have played the game, you know, the center of the galaxy is the gold path.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.140
I got a blue path that showed up pretty early, so I'm-

32:39.140 --> 32:41.140
I haven't noticed any paths whatsoever, so-

32:41.140 --> 32:45.580
Yeah, I've been going down this blue path, and I got to the end of the blue path and

32:45.580 --> 32:54.300
I liked the building, you're speaking in vague terms, I liked the building that I got to

32:54.300 --> 32:58.260
when I got to the end of that path, that was a very cool moment, but then it was like,

32:58.260 --> 33:02.460
and your reward is another blue path and an item to hold down your inventory that you're

33:02.460 --> 33:07.500
not sure what it's for, so that part was a little bit annoying, but I'm just, I'm liking,

33:07.500 --> 33:10.740
every time I land on a new planet, it's like, oh, what's going to be different about this

33:10.740 --> 33:11.740
one?

33:11.740 --> 33:15.900
And I understand there's criticisms about, well, a lot of planets are the same, but I

33:15.900 --> 33:22.660
don't know, I found a lot of variety in the planets that I've been to that I've been engaged.

33:22.660 --> 33:27.340
I'm still kind of engaged in the end game of trying to get to the center of the universe

33:27.340 --> 33:33.520
and explore what's there, so I'm just, I'm enjoying No Man's Sky, it's just like a relaxing

33:33.520 --> 33:38.140
kind of game that is kind of no pressure, which is also why I understand why people

33:38.140 --> 33:40.780
don't like the sentinels.

33:40.780 --> 33:44.860
I don't mind the sentinels because I think they're easy to pick off and kill and they're

33:44.860 --> 33:50.160
not that big of a deal, for me, I mean, I guess, for whatever reason, I don't get bothered

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
by the sentinels.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.320
Whatever bothers me, I kill it, I kill its friend and I move on.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.600
That's what happens to sentinels.

33:56.600 --> 34:01.800
What annoys the shit out of me are the space fights, because then you get the space, again,

34:01.800 --> 34:05.760
I don't mean to spoil, but it's not that far in the game, you will start getting spaceships

34:05.760 --> 34:08.040
that want to come after you and attack you.

34:08.040 --> 34:14.240
And flying around in space and trying to do these dogfights is, the controls are a beast.

34:14.240 --> 34:18.080
So I kind of feel like the number one thing I'd like to see No Man's Sky improve on is

34:18.080 --> 34:20.760
like some of the controls are pretty bad.

34:20.760 --> 34:27.920
Like down to, I don't understand why L2 is what you use to zoom in on a creature, but

34:27.920 --> 34:32.920
to scan the creature, you need to use, I think like R3 or something, because if you hit R2,

34:32.920 --> 34:36.120
which would be the logical second thing to hit, you're going to shoot that creature in

34:36.120 --> 34:40.080
the face and you've just turned a timid creature into an aggressive creature.

34:40.080 --> 34:45.240
And I can't tell you how many times I went to scan a creature and instead of scanning

34:45.240 --> 34:47.180
it, I accidentally shot it in the face.

34:47.180 --> 34:51.540
You can't change what they're assigned to?

34:51.540 --> 34:58.060
You could within the PlayStation 4 architecture, because PlayStation 4 has within the firmware

34:58.060 --> 35:06.100
that you can remap any buttons you want, but it's not within the game, if that makes sense.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.900
It wouldn't be just for the game, it would be like everything.

35:09.900 --> 35:14.940
Well you can toggle those on and off with multiple key presses.

35:14.940 --> 35:20.200
I want to get to some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Dungeon

35:20.200 --> 35:24.100
Buster in chat says, I remember getting lost in some caverns and just used my multi-tool

35:24.100 --> 35:26.500
to explode a new exit to the surface.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.540
I'm flying towards the center of the galaxy right now, it's been interesting, I know what

35:29.540 --> 35:33.060
Skye is talking about, I was on that path for a bit before switching, but the building

35:33.060 --> 35:35.120
you find is really neat in his path.

35:35.120 --> 35:39.300
The sentinels can be super peaceful if you don't keep blowing up the landscape like Schwarzenegger

35:39.300 --> 35:41.700
Black Wolf.

35:41.700 --> 35:45.700
I haven't found those little fuckers to be peaceful actually.

35:45.700 --> 35:51.980
Here's the thing, I'll land on a peaceful planet where it says the sentinels are limited

35:51.980 --> 35:56.500
or whatever the word is that lets you know they're not going to really be aggressive,

35:56.500 --> 36:00.260
but then I'll have to go to a building and to get in the building I have to shoot the

36:00.260 --> 36:04.140
door down, which is even going to make the peaceful sentinels pissed off at you, so it's

36:04.140 --> 36:08.980
like okay I'm going to have to do this battle whether I like it or not.

36:08.980 --> 36:16.020
But honestly the best way I've found to not be harassed by those sentinels, mine the plutonium

36:16.020 --> 36:19.900
or whatever it is you need, mine the plutonium, then run like a bitch before the sentinel gets

36:19.900 --> 36:20.900
there.

36:20.900 --> 36:25.200
Just run, run, run, and then they'll scan the thing, but you're gone.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.500
If that doesn't work, run inside a nearby building.

36:28.500 --> 36:32.940
Hopefully you're near a building, because honestly everything you need to do can be

36:32.940 --> 36:34.500
by buildings.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.000
There's always plutoniums near buildings, there's always thamium 9 or whatever that's

36:38.000 --> 36:44.940
called near buildings, or get the thamium 9 in space, it's far easier, hint, there's

36:44.940 --> 36:48.760
always plutonium near buildings and if those things mess with you just run in a building.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.940
That's how I've been doing it.

36:49.940 --> 36:54.360
And use the plutonium to fuel your little booster thing that lets you get in the ship

36:54.360 --> 36:57.920
and fly to the next question mark so you don't have to walk for five minutes.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.240
Unless you want to.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.240
That's the beauty of it.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.240
Do whatever the hell you want.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.240
And what's up with the take off fuel?

37:03.240 --> 37:08.920
Oh, you expelled, you know, a quarter of your take off fuel for just taking off one

37:08.920 --> 37:09.920
time.

37:09.920 --> 37:10.920
It's like...

37:10.920 --> 37:11.920
What?

37:11.920 --> 37:13.280
Well, it's easy to replace with plutonium.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.120
It's really easy to replace.

37:15.120 --> 37:19.620
But my assumption is that later on you get some type of enhancement that you could put

37:19.620 --> 37:22.960
on your ship that will lessen the amount of fuel that you use for things like that.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.520
That's an assumption though.

37:24.520 --> 37:30.560
So anyway, DungeonBuster points out that you can mine plutonium underground in peace if

37:30.560 --> 37:31.560
you really want to.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.000
There's still sentinels down there.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.840
They will come after you.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
Even underground.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
He says they won't.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.880
I wonder how far you're going underground.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.280
I don't recommend going underground because you'll get lost.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.280
You'll never come up.

37:41.280 --> 37:46.280
Unless you have the appropriate weapon to blow a hole, you know, to get out wherever

37:46.280 --> 37:47.280
you want.

37:47.280 --> 37:51.360
But if you don't have that weapon, I don't see the advantage of going in caves.

37:51.360 --> 37:55.160
Except that sometimes you find a lot of green chip items.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.180
I don't know what the hell else to call those things in there.

37:57.180 --> 37:58.180
I don't know.

37:58.180 --> 38:01.120
They're neutral items.

38:01.120 --> 38:05.080
They're not alkali or whatever.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.600
The one planet I was on actually had giant floating gold.

38:07.600 --> 38:11.160
Like it was just, hey, here's some floating rocks of gold.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.160
All right.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.160
Cool.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.160
I like this planet.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.160
It's like flying.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.160
Like what's that big shiny thing?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.160
Gold.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.160
Okay.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.160
Cool.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.160
Bobby Black Wolf with another tip in chat.

38:20.160 --> 38:25.280
And I didn't know this one over at live.fognetwork.com says, if you land on a landing pad, you don't

38:25.280 --> 38:26.880
use up plutonium to take off.

38:26.880 --> 38:27.880
I didn't realize that.

38:27.880 --> 38:28.880
Yeah.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.880
I've tried that.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.320
I looked over to where there's a landing pad, land, and it lands next to the landing pad

38:34.320 --> 38:35.320
on the ground.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
I'm like.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.080
I think you kind of have to use a bi-chip pass to call it over to the pad.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
I don't know.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.600
I don't know how to make that word right.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.440
And Dartitsia says, Rob is right.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.440
I love that phrase.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.400
I went into a cave to my minerals and I was wandering around for like 10 minutes trying

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
to get back to the exit.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
Yeah.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
Be careful.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
Be careful people.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
All right.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
Anyway.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
So No Man's Sky.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.620
I like it, but it's not an action packed game.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.500
I think that's the most important thing today is not an action packed game.

39:00.500 --> 39:04.940
And just because everybody's playing in the same universe, don't expect like fricking

39:04.940 --> 39:07.180
30 people running on the planet that you're on.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.460
That's not going to happen.

39:08.460 --> 39:15.540
So if you're cool with like a Minecraft ish kind of experience, that's more what No Man's

39:15.540 --> 39:16.540
Sky.

39:16.540 --> 39:19.180
No Man's Sky reminds me more of Minecraft than anything else.

39:19.180 --> 39:22.380
But that's, that's me anyway.

39:22.380 --> 39:25.380
But yet I'm more into No Man's Sky than Minecraft.

39:25.380 --> 39:26.380
It's weird.

39:26.380 --> 39:27.380
Okay.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.380
Different strokes for different folks.

39:28.380 --> 39:35.060
Other games I've been playing this week, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo 3 a little

39:35.060 --> 39:40.060
bit, a lot of Blizzard stuff, but just, that's kind of what I play on PC, Fallout SE 14 still.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.260
Just checking in on that.

39:41.260 --> 39:42.540
Otherwise not a lot of new stuff.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.540
No Man's Sky really took up my week as far as the new games go.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.300
So Mike, hey, how was your gaming week?

39:47.300 --> 39:50.100
What'd you play this week?

39:50.100 --> 39:51.100
Quite a bit actually.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.420
I think about it.

39:52.420 --> 39:56.340
I recently got a 3DS.

39:56.340 --> 40:01.000
So of course, I decided to play some Alpha Sapphire.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.540
Check out the new stuff cause I haven't played, you know, I didn't play any of the, oh gosh,

40:06.540 --> 40:09.300
between 4 and whatever the hell else we're on now.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.020
I haven't played those ones.

40:11.020 --> 40:14.660
Stopped after G3 so like seeing the remake, pretty cool.

40:14.660 --> 40:21.580
Let's see, I'm playing Overwatch.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.620
Overwatch is fun.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.260
Play a lot of that, mostly.

40:25.260 --> 40:26.860
What characters do you like in Overwatch?

40:26.860 --> 40:28.220
What do you like to play as?

40:28.220 --> 40:30.740
D.Va cause she's amazing.

40:30.740 --> 40:31.740
D.Va's pretty cool.

40:31.740 --> 40:32.740
D.Va.

40:32.740 --> 40:33.740
Actually, no, I don't really play as D.Va.

40:33.740 --> 40:36.980
I can't really, I haven't played with her since the patch though so I need to try her

40:36.980 --> 40:37.980
again.

40:37.980 --> 40:39.900
She's fucking fantastic since that patch.

40:39.900 --> 40:41.060
Oh my god.

40:41.060 --> 40:43.380
I hate other people that play D.Va on the other team.

40:43.380 --> 40:48.480
I've figured out that, you know, the, what is it, the rocket boost, the upward rocket

40:48.480 --> 40:55.000
boost and just launch it, then pop your ult and get it to where you can just wipe, yeah,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
it's amazing.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.880
I might want to try that cause I love playing Pharah and, you know, she flies and does all

40:59.880 --> 41:00.880
that stuff too.

41:00.880 --> 41:06.360
Oh, it's so great because I'll do that and then emote and sometimes I miss but whatever.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.360
It makes me feel good.

41:07.360 --> 41:13.000
You got some haters in chat, Rama says D.Va is trash lol.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.200
She probably, no.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.960
When it comes to Doritos and Mountain Dew maybe, but, yeah, pretty much.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.000
I love, she's a trashy eater.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.680
I love the D.Va memes online.

41:22.680 --> 41:28.400
Oh my god, have you seen the one of Ana giving her those little strawberry candies?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
No.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.040
It's like, frick yes, grandma candy.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.960
It's so good.

41:32.960 --> 41:33.960
That's great.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.360
I love it.

41:35.360 --> 41:42.560
Yeah, uh, let's see, I also play, um, I've been playing a lot of Zenyatta surprisingly

41:42.560 --> 41:44.120
since the patch too.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.400
He's a lot of fun.

41:46.400 --> 41:50.160
And then my other one is Hanzo.

41:50.160 --> 41:56.480
I'm surprisingly good with him for not being able to aim, like see where you're aiming.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.720
I guess I'm just, I get lucky.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.720
You're just that good.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.720
Oh, I guess.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.200
No, I straight up am lucky.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.760
It's like, uh, ooh, I didn't mean to fire that.

42:04.760 --> 42:06.520
Oh, he just ran right in front of it.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.520
Cool.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.520
That works.

42:08.520 --> 42:16.400
Outside of Overwatch, still playing Hearthstone, they just released their new adventure.

42:16.400 --> 42:21.200
And One Night in Karazhan is really fun and really frickin' cute.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.440
That trailer was so ridiculous.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.440
I loved it.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.440
It was so good.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.440
Oh my gosh.

42:25.440 --> 42:31.320
Um, but yeah, it's very Disney-y.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.320
Disney-y.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.320
Yes, Disney-y.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.320
Okay.

42:34.320 --> 42:38.320
The first wing is pretty cool.

42:38.320 --> 42:43.040
It's, yeah, you've got like, it's very Beauty and the Beast and then you've got like the

42:43.040 --> 42:45.760
mirror from Snow White and stuff and it's weird.

42:45.760 --> 42:48.400
But I was like, I don't see how this is Karazhan, but okay.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.480
I love Karazhan.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.480
I love Karazhan.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.480
I love Karazhan too.

42:51.480 --> 42:56.120
But I mean, it's just, um, Hearthstone is a silly Warcraft.

42:56.120 --> 43:01.880
It's a silly Warcraft universe, but I like it and the cards aren't complete trash, so

43:01.880 --> 43:02.880
yay.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.880
Cool.

43:04.440 --> 43:08.160
Um, I don't think I was playing anything else this week.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.120
I don't think I had time to play much else.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.120
All right.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.120
So, great.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.120
Yeah.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.120
All right.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.200
Well, before we get into some gaming news, just some quick housekeeping.

43:16.200 --> 43:21.480
We will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be out of town in Atlanta.

43:21.480 --> 43:26.940
For Dragon Con 2016, I'm still awaiting to hear if we're doing anything like appearing

43:26.940 --> 43:28.280
on panels or anything like that.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.280
I'm pretty sure some of our other network shows are probably going to show up on some

43:31.280 --> 43:36.120
of the TV track panels and so forth, so we'll be plugging those over at vognetwork.com.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.840
But we are looking, hopefully, at doing some type of show.

43:38.840 --> 43:43.020
It won't be live, unfortunately, because the bandwidth at the, um, you know, during a huge

43:43.020 --> 43:45.560
convention with thousands of people, bandwidth is not reliable, right?

43:45.560 --> 43:51.680
But we're hoping to maybe tape something in a live-esque type of element and put it on

43:51.680 --> 43:57.000
the feed, possibly the same Sunday that we won't actually be here.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.740
So stay tuned for that because maybe there'll be special programming from Dragon Con in

44:00.740 --> 44:03.740
the place of Bobby and OLR that Sunday.

44:03.740 --> 44:06.980
It's, anyway, what we're looking at right now, potentially.

44:06.980 --> 44:11.340
More details to come in a couple weeks, which I can't believe that Dragon Con's only like

44:11.340 --> 44:13.300
three weeks away, but here we are.

44:13.300 --> 44:17.020
Another year has gone by.

44:17.020 --> 44:18.020
That's really it.

44:18.020 --> 44:22.440
And then just a reminder that, unfortunately, Dark Sakura is going to be on a bit of a hiatus

44:22.440 --> 44:27.140
for a few months, starting actually with that same Labor Day weekend.

44:27.700 --> 44:32.140
That also will be kind of a weekend of transition as OLR is going to go through a few changes

44:32.140 --> 44:34.140
when we come back.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.140
But I'll be back.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.140
Yeah, you'll be back.

44:36.140 --> 44:37.140
It's not forever.

44:37.140 --> 44:38.140
That's right.

44:38.140 --> 44:39.260
She's not, you know, going away.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.980
And she will still be a part of the show.

44:40.980 --> 44:42.740
It's not exactly a vacation either.

44:42.740 --> 44:46.320
Yeah, we're just still talking about how we're going to make that work.

44:46.320 --> 44:49.900
So we may move some segments around, do some things a little differently.

44:49.900 --> 44:54.460
So the formula you've been used to over the past few episodes may change a little bit

44:54.460 --> 44:55.460
in a couple weeks.

44:55.460 --> 44:59.940
But it will still be the same great OLR that you're used to, and you still get to chat

44:59.940 --> 45:02.700
along with us and call in and all that fun stuff.

45:02.700 --> 45:03.700
So there you go.

45:03.700 --> 45:09.340
All right, let's get into the news and what's been going on in gaming around the world this

45:09.340 --> 45:10.340
week.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.340
Starting with Loki.

45:11.340 --> 45:15.300
All right, let's see here.

45:15.300 --> 45:17.140
So this is pretty cool.

45:17.140 --> 45:21.300
Sony is, I mean, we kind of expected that there's got to be an announcement for the

45:21.300 --> 45:26.380
PlayStation Neo at some point soon, because we are getting very close to the release date

45:26.380 --> 45:27.380
to that.

45:27.380 --> 45:35.180
So that is going to happen September 7th, according to some, I want to say, they announced

45:35.180 --> 45:38.540
like some sort of meeting that would happen in New York City.

45:38.540 --> 45:44.780
And one of the things that is going to be a focus would be the PlayStation Neo, since

45:44.780 --> 45:46.820
that is something that is coming out around October.

45:46.820 --> 45:52.260
However, there's something else that, there's a rumor that there may be a new PlayStation

45:52.260 --> 45:59.940
Vita or some sort of handheld system as well that might be announced around the same time.

45:59.940 --> 46:02.220
So that's interesting.

46:02.220 --> 46:03.220
And it's right around the corner.

46:03.220 --> 46:06.740
So I guess we'll have to see what exactly they're talking about.

46:06.740 --> 46:09.420
But yeah.

46:09.420 --> 46:16.020
I'm sure it's the Neo and all this stuff and, you know, but I'm curious what else.

46:16.020 --> 46:17.780
I am curious about a new handheld system.

46:17.780 --> 46:20.540
That'd be kind of interesting.

46:20.540 --> 46:23.180
I'm wondering what exactly it's going to be.

46:23.180 --> 46:28.460
There was, I remember where the evidence came from that it was, I wanted to see maybe those

46:28.460 --> 46:32.380
FCC filings or something to the effect of like, they're going to have like a new radio

46:32.380 --> 46:33.700
in the Vita or something.

46:33.700 --> 46:37.540
Maybe the support instead of like, remember how they had the 3G model and they kind of

46:37.540 --> 46:41.620
quickly got rid of that, but there might be like a 4G LTE model or something.

46:41.620 --> 46:47.060
So I'm wondering if they're going to try another portable system.

46:47.060 --> 46:48.060
Cross my fingers.

46:48.060 --> 46:49.060
Hopefully it's better than the last one.

46:49.060 --> 46:51.820
I mean, I don't know.

46:51.820 --> 46:53.380
The back touch thing was really stupid.

46:53.380 --> 46:55.180
I didn't like that.

46:55.180 --> 46:56.180
Yeah.

46:56.180 --> 47:01.100
I think there's a lot of people that would like to see Sony take another stab at a handheld,

47:01.100 --> 47:02.100
but I just don't.

47:02.100 --> 47:05.780
Well, but then again, we have to remember in Japan, it's still like there's games coming

47:05.780 --> 47:06.780
out every week.

47:06.780 --> 47:07.780
It's still a thing.

47:07.780 --> 47:13.980
Maybe there is a reason for Sony to do a new handheld, but I would think here's the other

47:13.980 --> 47:14.980
thing.

47:14.980 --> 47:19.580
I would think news like that, like a new handheld at least would hold off till the PlayStation

47:19.580 --> 47:24.740
experience in December, unless that sucker's coming out for this holiday, which I just,

47:24.740 --> 47:25.740
I don't know.

47:25.740 --> 47:27.620
It just seems so fast for an announcement like that.

47:27.620 --> 47:28.620
You know what I mean?

47:28.620 --> 47:31.140
They usually have something that takes a lot more time to build up.

47:31.140 --> 47:35.220
So I don't know, but I would think if they're going to tease a handheld, it would be at

47:35.220 --> 47:38.540
the PlayStation experience, which would be a little more dedicated to the fans and not

47:38.540 --> 47:39.780
this event in New York city.

47:39.780 --> 47:40.980
So I don't know.

47:40.980 --> 47:44.460
But they're like talking about like, you know, financials or something or like a plan for

47:44.460 --> 47:50.780
what they're going to be doing for, you know, the PlayStation business line.

47:50.780 --> 47:54.180
Maybe that's why they're bringing it up, you know, Hey, here's something that's coming.

47:54.180 --> 47:58.400
It's not necessarily something that's coming right around the corner, but it may be like

47:58.400 --> 48:02.180
next holiday or something like that.

48:02.180 --> 48:05.100
Still don't know what the, you know, maybe they're thinking they're going to compete

48:05.100 --> 48:10.860
with whatever this Nintendo system is, which we still don't know really much of anything.

48:10.860 --> 48:13.500
Well, you're right.

48:13.500 --> 48:18.060
We don't know much about that, but I hope, hopefully by the time this event rolls around,

48:18.060 --> 48:19.060
we'll know a little more.

48:19.060 --> 48:23.140
Although I imagine Nintendo is probably doing their own reveal in that same September timeframe.

48:23.140 --> 48:25.020
At least that's what the buzz is.

48:25.020 --> 48:27.720
So we'll see.

48:27.720 --> 48:31.220
Interesting comment from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:31.220 --> 48:36.860
Dobby says, again, you don't want to get overshadowed so early on once an X is revealed.

48:36.860 --> 48:42.200
People will be talking nothing else, but that I don't know about nothing else, but certainly

48:42.200 --> 48:45.460
when NX is announced, it's going to dominate the conversation for a little bit.

48:45.460 --> 48:46.460
Okay.

48:46.460 --> 48:49.220
But I think if Sony were to announce a, announce a handheld, it's not like nobody's going to

48:49.220 --> 48:50.220
pay attention to that.

48:50.220 --> 48:56.540
So here was, here's what led them to thinking that there was going to be another handheld

48:56.540 --> 48:57.540
maybe.

48:57.740 --> 49:03.140
So basically there is an FCC wireless chip filing from Sony for a five year Hertz wireless

49:03.140 --> 49:11.860
chip and the hardware, it says, looks like the Vita or something.

49:11.860 --> 49:18.180
So there's a, I don't know what that could be a part of, but interesting.

49:18.180 --> 49:19.180
We'll see.

49:19.180 --> 49:20.180
All right.

49:20.180 --> 49:24.220
Well, let's move on and talk about something kind of related to the Olympics.

49:24.220 --> 49:28.860
No, video games are not showing up at the Olympics officially, but there is kind of

49:28.860 --> 49:31.460
this like adjacent thing going on.

49:31.460 --> 49:35.620
It's the Rio 2016 Olympics eGames showcase.

49:35.620 --> 49:39.620
So while the Olympics are going on, there's actually going to be an eGames showcase going

49:39.620 --> 49:40.620
on.

49:40.620 --> 49:45.740
And I think it's actually streaming on Tuesday, August 16th, and it's starting at 11 AM in

49:45.740 --> 49:46.740
Brazil.

49:46.740 --> 49:49.780
So that's going to be really early for folks here on the West coast if you want to see

49:49.780 --> 49:53.860
some of that, but I'm sure some of the highlights will be all over YouTube and such.

49:53.860 --> 49:57.680
But in this eGames showcase, they're actually only showing a couple of games.

49:57.680 --> 50:02.120
They're going to just be doing Super Smash Brothers for Wii U is one of the selections

50:02.120 --> 50:03.120
that they're doing.

50:03.120 --> 50:07.340
And then they're doing Smite, which, you know, that MOBA free to play that's on PC and all

50:07.340 --> 50:08.340
that.

50:08.340 --> 50:09.340
That's it.

50:09.340 --> 50:14.940
There's no, I don't know, League of Legends or Starcraft or, you know, some of those other

50:14.940 --> 50:16.840
big heroes, the Storm.

50:16.840 --> 50:18.020
Those other games are not involved.

50:18.020 --> 50:19.340
It's just those two games.

50:19.340 --> 50:22.460
But there will be players from around the world that are going to be going to Rio to

50:22.460 --> 50:30.820
take part, including Larry Loehr from the US, Canadian Evo champion ally.

50:30.820 --> 50:36.020
And there's a guy in Mexico, MK Leo, who's really good at Smash that will also be there

50:36.020 --> 50:37.020
as well.

50:37.020 --> 50:38.220
So they are going to be doing this.

50:38.220 --> 50:40.340
By the way, no prize money on the line.

50:40.340 --> 50:44.860
This is just for bragging rights, national pride, if you will.

50:44.860 --> 50:49.940
So as I, and I would say as the Olympics are, but I thought I heard a story that you actually

50:49.940 --> 50:52.840
do get a cash prize for medals at the Olympics.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.260
They just don't ever really talk about that.

50:54.260 --> 50:58.820
So I guess that will not quite be the same thing, but, you know, still kind of neat to

50:58.820 --> 51:04.820
see that gaming is, even if it's not a part of the Olympics officially, it's still kind

51:04.820 --> 51:08.520
of being spoke in a similar sense around the same time.

51:08.520 --> 51:12.700
So it's certainly progress from where we were at four years ago, that's for sure.

51:12.700 --> 51:17.020
So yeah, look forward to that on Tuesday.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.540
Meanwhile, Dark Sakura.

51:19.540 --> 51:23.260
Well there's a game that a lot of people have been looking forward to, which is Final Fantasy

51:23.260 --> 51:24.380
XV.

51:24.380 --> 51:30.540
And as we know, it did of course start off its life as a different game.

51:30.540 --> 51:35.540
It initially was Final Fantasy versus XIII and became Final Fantasy XV.

51:35.540 --> 51:44.180
Well now after all these changes and everything, it looks like there is a delay for the game.

51:44.180 --> 51:53.220
It's uh, well at least it's going to be on September 30th now is what's on the list,

51:53.220 --> 51:59.100
but there's no word as if it's going to be further delayed, although that's the theory.

51:59.100 --> 52:04.360
But yeah, it's not going to be as soon as we thought.

52:04.360 --> 52:09.620
It was, um, hold on let me see something.

52:09.620 --> 52:13.940
Yeah it looks like on here that there was supposed to be a two month delay after September

52:13.940 --> 52:16.580
30th, so my apologies I misread the thing.

52:16.580 --> 52:20.020
That September 30th is still the listed date, but the rumor is that there's going to be

52:20.020 --> 52:21.980
a two month delay after that.

52:21.980 --> 52:23.260
So sorry.

52:23.260 --> 52:26.820
But what's interesting about that is that that was supposed to be announced today, because

52:26.820 --> 52:33.140
I think the GameStop stuff was going to allow the switcheroo on Monday.

52:33.140 --> 52:36.200
Unless they're going to announce it tomorrow morning, which I guess is certainly still

52:36.200 --> 52:37.420
possible as well.

52:37.420 --> 52:42.180
But it does seem like there's a lot of, it's kind of one of those where there's smoke there's

52:42.180 --> 52:47.880
fire sort of things, and it's not like, you know, oh my roommate has a boyfriend that

52:47.880 --> 52:53.140
works at GameStop that, you know, copied this thing, you know, it's, there seems to be some

52:53.140 --> 52:57.420
hard evidence that yeah, Final Fantasy 15 is getting delayed.

52:57.420 --> 52:58.840
What do you guys think if it does get delayed?

52:58.840 --> 52:59.840
Do you think it's-

52:59.840 --> 53:00.840
Oh well.

53:00.840 --> 53:06.220
Yeah, it's honestly like, okay, I'm like, ah damn it, you know, that's the exact my

53:06.220 --> 53:07.220
reaction.

53:07.220 --> 53:08.220
Ah damn it.

53:08.260 --> 53:12.860
If it makes the game better, like especially going back to No Man's Sky PC and all that,

53:12.860 --> 53:18.180
like I cannot sit here and go, man, what the hell are they doing with No Man's Sky?

53:18.180 --> 53:22.300
They shouldn't have released this buggy piece of shit on PC and all that.

53:22.300 --> 53:23.460
I can't say that.

53:23.460 --> 53:28.180
And then in the same breath say, how dare they delay No Man's- or how dare they delay

53:28.180 --> 53:30.660
Final Fantasy 15 for two months, you know?

53:30.660 --> 53:34.380
I honestly don't care enough about the game to care about it being delayed.

53:34.380 --> 53:35.380
What?

53:35.380 --> 53:37.100
I'm super ready for it.

53:37.100 --> 53:38.500
I'm excited to play 15.

53:38.500 --> 53:39.660
I'm not too excited about it.

53:39.660 --> 53:46.380
I wasn't too happy with 13 and 14 I got bored with after a while for being the MMO.

53:46.380 --> 53:50.020
I'm going to give it a shot, but like the demos haven't been that great.

53:50.020 --> 53:51.660
Yeah, I wasn't impressed with the demos either.

53:51.660 --> 53:52.660
I'm excited for it.

53:52.660 --> 53:53.660
Yeah, I'm with you.

53:53.660 --> 53:54.660
I'm excited for it.

53:54.660 --> 53:55.660
Like I preordered it.

53:55.660 --> 54:01.460
I'm just so used to like the turn-based battle system that I really like that and I'm just

54:01.460 --> 54:02.460
kind of sad that-

54:02.460 --> 54:03.580
That was a while ago.

54:03.580 --> 54:07.220
That was several Final Fantasy games ago, so it's like-

54:07.220 --> 54:08.220
That was 13, okay?

54:08.220 --> 54:11.940
That was the last fucking Final Fantasy game that was out.

54:11.940 --> 54:13.820
It was so long ago, the last one.

54:13.820 --> 54:16.580
It was, because they've had two sequels for it.

54:16.580 --> 54:17.580
13 wasn't-

54:17.580 --> 54:18.580
It's basically-

54:18.580 --> 54:19.580
Really turn-based.

54:19.580 --> 54:20.580
Sure was.

54:20.580 --> 54:21.580
The last turn-based-

54:21.580 --> 54:22.580
No, 10.2.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.580
It had the whole active time-

54:23.580 --> 54:24.580
Okay, fine.

54:24.580 --> 54:27.100
Active time battle system, whatever.

54:27.100 --> 54:28.100
Same shit.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.100
No, no, no, no.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.100
It's just a different twist on it.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.100
No, no, no, no.

54:31.100 --> 54:32.320
Yeah, 10.2 was the same as 13.

54:32.320 --> 54:38.360
It was the auto-battling and you only did the whole special moves in that thing, remember?

54:38.360 --> 54:41.240
Right, but this is totally different from that.

54:41.240 --> 54:45.760
You're basically running around and actually engaging in stuff, which-

54:45.760 --> 54:47.960
This would worry me if I were Square Enix.

54:47.960 --> 54:53.540
This whole fact that maybe half of us are hyped and half of us aren't, because it definitely

54:53.540 --> 54:57.520
seems like they've poured a ton of money into this game and they need it to do well, so

54:57.520 --> 54:58.520
they need that hype to be there.

54:58.880 --> 55:04.760
I'm fine with going into it not being that hyped about it, but it's like, for me, I don't

55:04.760 --> 55:05.760
know.

55:05.760 --> 55:10.200
The great Final Fantasy games I think of are the ones that are, for me, the easiest to

55:10.200 --> 55:11.680
pick up the story.

55:11.680 --> 55:20.240
Seven I thought was pretty easy to pick up, even, you know, six, 13 kind of confused me.

55:20.240 --> 55:23.440
15, I have no fucking clue what the hell's going on.

55:23.440 --> 55:24.840
The movie trailer looks fucking awesome, though.

55:24.840 --> 55:25.840
I do want to see that.

55:25.920 --> 55:29.680
To be fair, 13 wasn't that great, if you ask me.

55:29.680 --> 55:34.160
I love 13, I'll defend it, but I get it's not for everybody.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.160
I don't want to have that talk today.

55:35.160 --> 55:41.440
I'm just saying, like, you know, I go back to, like, Lost Odyssey, which I think was

55:41.440 --> 55:48.080
more Final Fantasy game than Final Fantasy was, Final Fantasy 13 was, so I don't know.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.080
It looked cool?

55:49.080 --> 55:52.320
But yet, Lost Odyssey didn't sell.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.320
It's unfortunate.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.320
That's too bad.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.800
If they'd put it on PlayStation 3, it probably would have.

55:56.800 --> 56:01.200
It's because, you know, it's because people, there's people on both sides out there, there's

56:01.200 --> 56:05.080
people who complain, ah, another turn-based game.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.880
No one fights like that.

56:06.880 --> 56:11.320
You're not just going to, oh, I'm going to wait while you attack me.

56:11.320 --> 56:14.320
And then those people want this, and then they're going to, there's people that don't

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
want that.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.320
I don't know.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.880
I didn't really care for, I thought it was a hassle.

56:20.120 --> 56:26.000
The new demo, a little bit better, but I still thought it was a little chaotic.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.400
Like I just, it's hard to keep track of what the hell's going on.

56:28.400 --> 56:30.080
I'd rather just have it.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.080
It's fine.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.080
You don't need an active time battle system.

56:32.080 --> 56:33.080
That's, that's cool.

56:33.080 --> 56:36.840
But just like the same presentation is fine because that's what made it a Final Fantasy

56:36.840 --> 56:38.640
game.

56:38.640 --> 56:42.920
William Murderface in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn is

56:42.920 --> 56:44.440
a pretty good story so far.

56:44.440 --> 56:47.600
Everyone seems to forget about that part, but it's an important one that is well done

56:47.600 --> 56:48.600
in my opinion.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.480
I actually like agree with that.

56:50.480 --> 56:53.160
And Heaven's Word, the expansion is even better.

56:53.160 --> 56:58.160
It's so like, I think the Heaven's Word story is like the best story in the Final Fantasy

56:58.160 --> 57:00.680
universe since like six.

57:00.680 --> 57:01.680
It's that good.

57:01.680 --> 57:07.520
And unfortunately most people will never see it because it's an MMO.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.640
It's an MMO, which puts people off.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.320
It's end game, which puts people off.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.960
It's it's, but just the reality is it's a magnificent story.

57:15.960 --> 57:17.040
If you can get there.

57:17.040 --> 57:22.440
The problem with Final Fantasy 14 is that there is no way to level without doing some

57:22.440 --> 57:24.600
of those instances.

57:24.600 --> 57:30.200
And it's horrible because I made it all the way through to when I got to 85 in World of

57:30.200 --> 57:36.800
Warcraft, I hadn't done a single instance, a single one, and I didn't craft either.

57:36.800 --> 57:40.560
And you shouldn't have to have to do those if you don't want to.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.720
But they were some really fucking cool fights.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.600
But I don't care.

57:44.600 --> 57:45.600
Really cool fights.

57:45.600 --> 57:46.600
I don't care.

57:46.600 --> 57:48.680
That's what I was into.

57:48.680 --> 57:53.440
The whole point is that it should have something for everybody and you shouldn't be forced

57:53.440 --> 57:56.720
to play a game the way they think you should play it.

57:56.720 --> 57:57.720
Yeah.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.720
Yeah, you're right.

57:59.720 --> 58:03.000
Comparing it to WoW in that in that regard, you're right.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.600
I did the same exact thing in Warcraft.

58:04.600 --> 58:10.080
Like I made it up to, no, well, at the time it was, I think the cap was 90.

58:10.080 --> 58:14.600
Yeah, I made it all the way up to 90 without doing any instances and stuff.

58:15.360 --> 58:16.880
It's so funny because I have been playing World of Warcraft.

58:16.880 --> 58:20.200
I'm doing nothing but instances because I'm like, questing is too slow.

58:20.200 --> 58:25.920
The questing has actually been super fast and I'm playing through now Sakurina when

58:25.920 --> 58:29.240
I left at like 86 when I left.

58:29.240 --> 58:35.520
And the leveling is actually much faster now for the the Pandaria content.

58:35.520 --> 58:37.880
So it's been pretty fun.

58:37.880 --> 58:45.480
I'm actually looking forward to doing a Horde side for the other, for whatever.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.480
Draenor?

58:46.480 --> 58:51.600
Yeah, but I was trying to think of dude's name, the asshole, former war chief.

58:51.600 --> 58:52.600
Garrosh?

58:52.600 --> 58:54.960
Yeah, because I just like seeing him die.

58:54.960 --> 58:57.160
I really just like seeing him fail.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.640
It's awesome because I hated him.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
All right.

59:00.640 --> 59:04.000
Well, let's move on to some other stuff.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.480
Back to rumors about upcoming consoles, right, Logi?

59:07.480 --> 59:13.840
Of course, we do love our rumors and love our leaks about said rumors.

59:13.840 --> 59:18.040
So Nintendo, of course, you know, they have their wonderful NX coming out.

59:18.040 --> 59:20.200
We still don't know what the fuck it is.

59:20.200 --> 59:24.760
But there's all sorts of rumors regarding, you know, maybe it's this controller that,

59:24.760 --> 59:28.200
you know, attaches to some sort of tablet thing.

59:28.200 --> 59:34.360
And then now there's this new trademark filing that they have or copyright filing or patent

59:34.360 --> 59:39.160
filing, I should say, for a clip on controller.

59:39.160 --> 59:43.440
And the device almost looks like what they were describing with those NX rumors.

59:43.440 --> 59:48.960
So basically, it looks like some sort of controller that in this case, it looks like the left

59:48.960 --> 59:51.800
or right half of like a SNES controller.

59:51.800 --> 59:58.640
So they show four buttons and there's like a, I don't know if it's like a metal pad or

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.760
something that connects to maybe magnetically and it allows it to, you know, send data electricity

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.560
or whatever to the actual attachment.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:13.280
Neat, I guess, but I don't know.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.000
I don't know why, but it sounds like wireless charging to me or something is what that kind

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.400
of reminds me of.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.840
I mean, sort of like I'm surprised like something like this can be patented because, I mean,

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.600
it's just it's basically just like having some sort of thing.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.320
I don't know, some add-on controller or something, which I know a lot of devices have.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.800
They have it for mobile where you can pass through, you know, stuff through their charge

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.800
board.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800
I don't know.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.960
I guess we'll have to see what it is and see what exactly this gimmick the NX is.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.600
But it would be more fuel for those rumors, I guess.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.280
It would be nice for Nintendo to say something already.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.960
I understand that why they're not.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.880
But it's just like, God, I'm so sick of rumors.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.080
Every time I hear a new one, I'm like, this sounds like just so like.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:05.880
I'm worried about it, and the reason I'm worried about Nintendo is I think that some of their

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.800
like big like, OK, we're really going to like disrupt everything by the motion controls

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.800
and that that worked out well for them, then they're like, oh, we're going to disrupt everything

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.920
by having the second screen tablet thing that didn't work out so well.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.200
And I'm worried that like this is going to be something that's just going to be kind

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.880
of here's this really cool gimmick we thought of and no one gives a shit.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.960
Interesting comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:39.840
rumors killed No Man's Sky and Shadow Next Gen follows that up with unchecked expectations.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840
Yeah.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.360
Is that, you know, a lot of people, because there was so such vagueness about No Man's

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.520
Sky, a lot of people kind of filled in the blanks with their headcanon.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.440
And then when that wasn't met, it's a disappointment.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.920
And people, I think what you're getting at is that people are doing the same thing with

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920
the NX.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.600
Is that because, you know, we think it's going to be this.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.960
And then when Nintendo announces, well, it's it's it's not as grand as you thought it was.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:09.560
I just you know what this screams to me like, remember the Wii and all the fucking attachments

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.560
that attached to the Wii and how much of a fucking nightmare that was.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560
This is kind of what it was.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560
So cool.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560
I'm kidding.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:23.040
This is like, you know, kind of in that they didn't have like they had a lot of weird plastic

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
shit that was unnecessary.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.000
So I'm not really talking about that.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.560
I'm talking about like, you know, they had the classic controller, they had the nunchuck

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560
thing.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.280
They had maybe those were the only two things that they had, but they had some other stuff

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.360
that I thought connected to it as well.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.080
They I know definitely in planning had a lot more things, but it just kind of seems like

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.080
that.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.320
Like, is this what's going to do like, oh, hey, we need some more buttons here.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.360
We're just going to release this game with another button half controller thing or something

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.120
that we're going to attach here.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.880
You can customize where your controls are or something.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880
I mean, I don't know what this is.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880
Well, let's see.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.960
We're all speculating about this until I see what exactly this is.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.880
I just don't really care too much right now.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.880
That's it.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.200
I mean, I need to see what exactly this thing's putting out, because if it's just basically

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:16.760
a Wii U without being tethered to a console, I mean, that's cool, but I'm not super excited

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760
for it.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:24.440
I may pick it up because that's a neat idea, but it's not like, shit, I need to have one

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440
of these right away.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.480
I just think it's going to be shadowed by cooler things that are going to come out,

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.040
especially more VR stuff.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.800
I mean, we're talking like six months time.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.560
I mean, VR technology is getting better and better each day.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560
I will say this.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.200
We've played our Wii U more than anything in our house as far as the newer systems.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.240
So I'm really looking forward to the NX.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.600
If it gives me more of all the stuff that I like for the Wii U, I'm happy.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.560
Yeah, I'm excited for NX.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.800
I just kind of, it's like, I don't know what to get excited for.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800
So I'm making it up.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.760
And I don't give a shit about VR, so.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760
I have to admit.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.120
I'm starting to wonder if I might cancel the PlayStation VR pre-order, but that is, I still

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.240
like VR.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.440
This has more to do with, I'm really worried about this whole fact that they're putting

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.200
out the Neo.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.320
And does that mean that VR doesn't work as well on the old system?

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320
That's more my problem.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320
That's exactly it.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.600
And if they didn't talk about the Neo or anything, you know, if this was something that's coming

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.400
out next year, then I might not be so worried about it.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.560
But it's like, you just met, you know, you mentioned that VR is going to be better on

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.960
it somehow.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.960
How exactly?

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.160
Because that kind of stuff worries me, and I'm kind of with you on that.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:43.040
Like if I get a PC built before then that runs, you know, the Rift or the Vive, and

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.960
it's definitely going to go with the Vive, then fuck that, I'm canceling that shit.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.120
Because a lot of those things that they're showing off, don't get me wrong, Rez looks

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:55.400
awesome, but like everything else is a really short experience.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.920
And I want like a full-fledged game with it.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.680
I don't want this like, cool, I did a mission.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.680
We're done.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.280
You know, or cool, I looked around a room.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.280
I don't care.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280
I've done that.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280
I've done that already.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.720
I want something that's a full experience.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.640
All right, well, I want to move on.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.120
Actually, did you talk about this other thing?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120
Oh, I was going to say, yeah.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:21.160
And also, one of the things, good things though about the NX is Dragon Quest X has been confirmed

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.520
to be coming to the NX.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.680
So that's cool.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.760
So they're going to get an MMO.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.600
And an anticipated one that we've needed for a long time, to be quite honest.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
Yep.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.440
And apparently it is also coming out for PlayStation 4.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:41.320
I'm not sure if that's going to be confirmed.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.580
It's not necessarily confirmed to be coming over here.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.120
And that could be the same with the NX.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.520
It may be in Japan though.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.800
Well, anyhow, I want to move on to another story about a comment from Bethesda about

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.640
the Nintendo NX that a lot of people are going, hmm.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:02.240
And in this interview with an Australian news publication, Finder, excuse me, they were

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.080
talking to Pete Hines, who's the vice president of Bethesda Softworks, and they're asking

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.520
about the Nintendo NX.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.160
And Pete Hines said, yeah, they know what Nintendo is doing with NX.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.160
They've been briefed on the situation, but they're not really committing to the platform

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.760
saying this, we talk to Nintendo all the time.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.560
We're pretty well briefed in on what they're doing.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.000
It's definitely something we will look at.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.320
And our philosophy is that we will put our games out on any format that supports the

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.440
games as we envision and make them.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.660
If the NX fits that from a technical standpoint, and it fits the game that a developer in our

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.020
stable is making, I don't see why we would not put it out on NX.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.580
But it's too early to say we'll definitely be putting games out or not.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:41.520
Like with mobile, we want to have the right fit for the right formats.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.280
You know, he could be dancing the line a little bit and just not wanting to show his cards

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.600
if they do have something to announce.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.160
I mean, there's a million ways you could read this.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:54.420
But I definitely just pick up this sense of the NX might not be as technically superior

01:06:54.420 --> 01:07:00.180
as what's going on with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which we kind of knew is a potential,

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.180
right?

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.860
And, you know, Bethesda tends to make pretty intense games that really push things graphically,

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.860
right?

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.580
Like your Skyrim at that time, your Doom at this time, you know, and you kind of wonder,

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.220
like, would these games really run on Nintendo NX?

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:19.340
You know, it's probably going to be challenged.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.340
And so I get it from that regard.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.780
But let's not forget Bethesda also has that card game for Elder Scrolls.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.580
The Fallout Shelter is a pretty big thing.

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.500
These are things that probably would work on NX.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.500
Right.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.820
Though I'm not saying put those games on NX, but those future developments in that same

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:36.820
way.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.820
Once again, that worries me.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:44.020
I mean, like, I understand that, that like on the 3DS, their first party titles do well

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:47.760
and they've got a good library of games on the 3DS.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.980
That's fine.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.900
The Wii U, they have great first party titles.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.860
No one's arguing that their first party titles aren't great.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.940
It's the third party titles.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:59.900
And when you have that hardware that can't run these engines that run these modern games,

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.700
like all the fucking shit that's coming from EA is in Frostbite.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.860
That shit does not run on the Wii U.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:09.620
And if it doesn't run on the NX, we're just looking at the same fucking scenario again.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.620
And that's fine.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620
I know people are like, oh, well, fuck it.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.580
I don't need EA games.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:18.600
But you're getting, as stuff goes along, they're pushing better graphics and more stuff on

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.440
screen and they're going to have more sophisticated engines.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.440
That shit is not going to run on these, the system, if it's that underpowered and they're

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.920
going to have a problem because yeah, great.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.880
First party tells me help that system.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.240
But if that's all they got, we're going to be in a scenario right now where look at the

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.320
release schedule for the Wii U.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.380
I mean, it's just every couple months or something coming out for it.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.380
And that's it.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.740
There's like nothing in between.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.560
It's just deserted.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.000
It's just, I don't know.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.320
I'm just worried about it.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.000
I really do think though NX was pushed back from this year so that that's not going to

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.200
happen in Nintendo's first year.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.200
I really think that's what they're doing.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200
I hope that's the case.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200
I really do.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.040
Because when I hear that they're thinking about VR and thinking about this, it makes

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.360
me wonder that they don't have a fucking idea of what this thing is going to be.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.200
They're just still up in the air about it.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.040
And I don't know.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.440
I'm just very worried about what they have to say about this.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.760
I'm not having high expectations for it.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:18.760
All right.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.240
Well, also in that same interview, I just want to mention with Bethesda, this is on

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.260
a different note, has nothing to do with Nintendo NX or does it?

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.120
Apparently the comment was that the evil within did make enough money to justify a sequel.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.440
That actually surprised me to hear that.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.480
I didn't think that game did so hot, but apparently it did.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:41.680
So the evil within may be getting a signal, a sequel and rage also performs well enough

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.000
to justify a sequel.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.640
So now again, they're not confirming or denying anything, not saying what is happening for

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.600
sure or when, but don't take it off the table essentially.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:59.040
But we'll have to wait for a future E3 or some other type of event to find the confirmation

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.360
in those.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.760
So we'll see.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.160
All right.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160
Let's move on.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.680
Next story, Dark Saga, before we get to release dates.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.400
Well in the wake of the Metroid 2 fan remake, there was another one that was called Pokemon

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.840
Uranium and Nintendo's put down the C and D on that one.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.640
It was done by a nonprofit, it was put out on PC for free and 1.5 million people downloaded

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640
it.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.420
It had been in development for over nine years and had 150 custom Pokemon and a type called

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.420
nuclear.

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:36.460
So Nintendo's like, uh-uh, no, stop.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:43.820
So I'm sure you can still find it in places, but yeah, they finally put out a note on there

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.260
and it said they took it down.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:54.220
You can still talk about it, still share content about the game, but we aren't going to make

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.780
it available on the site anymore.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.820
I think no one's surprised.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.820
They put it up.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.820
They know it's going to get taken down.

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.660
They know that someone's going to grab it and once it's on the internet, it's always

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:03.660
on the internet.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.980
So I think it's naive to believe that any of these people that are developing these

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:13.980
fan games about Nintendo properties are surprised that they're getting a C and D from Nintendo

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.860
regarding that.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.100
I think that's just part of the plan.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:23.420
That get it up, get people to download it and just wait for the C and D, take it down,

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.520
but it's too late.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.260
It's already there and that's it.

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780
Yeah.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.300
I mean, they, they have to know that these things are going to get C and D'd and you

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.580
know, I'm curious how that game is though.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.460
I heard that one was not so good.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.620
What, the Pokemon Uranium?

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.700
Their Uranium one is not so good.

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.660
There's another, there's not even Pokemon Uranium.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:48.220
There's some like MMO Pokemon thing that I see on Twitch all the time that certainly

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.580
can't be permissible either, but it's still floating around out there.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.340
I don't know if that's something that was released a long time ago that was pulled,

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.340
but yeah, things have a way of getting on the internet and then never getting off.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:01.180
And you know, again, don't, don't share the link here as Bobby saying in our chat room

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.860
because you know, we don't want the C's and D's but seriously, it's not that hard

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:10.980
to go out there onto a torrent site of your choosing and find it.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.980
Or other forums.

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:15.660
I'm sure they've got a fan game set at one time I found one that was for like Mario games

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.660
and stuff like that.

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.540
So I know that those exists and you can probably find a link on there for it.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.540
That was it.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.040
Thank you Act F. Pokemon Omicron is the one I was thinking of that MMO one that I see

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.880
on Twitch sometimes.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.720
So by the way, did you know, um, no, I know we talked last week about the AM2R and all

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720
that.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.320
Did you know also the Nintendo power archive got pulled?

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.720
Yeah, I saw that.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720
Yeah.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.040
That's like, again, it's like these magazines are how old it's like in a way I'm like,

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.340
would you go to a library and take them out of the library and like, okay, I get that

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:54.000
an online resource is not the same thing as a library, but you know, times are changing

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.920
and for people to look at, you know, I really got a kick out of looking at some of the games

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.080
the way gaming used to be.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.080
Yeah.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080
I don't get it.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.800
If they're not selling back, are they selling reprints of those?

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
Can you even purchase those?

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.800
I don't think so.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.800
I really don't.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.800
What is the point?

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.800
Yeah, it's just, it's just unfortunate, you know.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.680
It's just lawyers going crazy to protect their IPs or probably.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.600
And at the same time, I can't say, well, it's completely unjustified.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.520
Nintendo has no right to do that.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520
They own it.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520
They of course have the right.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520
Yeah, exactly.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:26.360
I have to realize that that is true as well, but there's that part of me that goes, but

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.360
do they have to?

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.000
But then again, once again, it is on the internet and therefore since it's on the internet,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
it's always on the internet.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.840
So it's probably somewhere out there.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.680
Well, but not at the source because there was that retro mags or whatever that was the

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.600
source and it's no longer there.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.280
So, but after a discussion about this on our last week show, I did actually start looking

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.200
for, and I did find like old scans because I just, you know, use my Google.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.720
I went and I found like, you know, Compute Skazette and all that stuff.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.680
And I was reading like old type in programs and stuff.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.680
And I was like, Oh my God.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.600
And I never realized like how intensely those magazines talked about programming.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.920
I don't remember that from a kid, but it was kind of like, again, it's fun to read this

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:09.000
stuff that I remember one way as a kid and then read it now with my 38 year old brain

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.440
as opposed to my five year old brain.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440
And like, I'm just totally seeing it a different way.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440
It's crazy.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.680
So, so on a completely different tangent since you mentioned your 38 old brain.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.320
So my wife, because she's watching Grey's Anatomy, mentioned to me that she's like,

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.280
you do realize on the show that all these people are supposed to be like younger than

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280
we are right now.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.280
I'm like, what?

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.480
She's like, yeah, even that guy right there with the gray hair.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480
Yeah.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.440
He's supposed to be like in his like, like early thirties or something.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.440
And I'm just like, no fucking way.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.440
I just thought that was funny.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.440
No, yeah.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.440
I love seeing people.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.880
I love seeing very incredibly successful, talented people on television who are like

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.240
15 years younger than me.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.240
Oh, I love that.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240
Loki.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240
I love it.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.320
They're like, they're like, I'm like, I thought he was like in his fifties or something like,

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.320
I don't know.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.320
He's in his thirties.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.160
All these, all these people that have their shit together that I'm like, wow.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160
And I was that age.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:10.560
I was a dumb ass bastards totally blew the realism.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.900
All right.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.400
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some things that are coming

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.640
out that Nintendo can't pull starting in the U S Loki or something.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.640
Yeah.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.960
So this week we've got absolute drift Zen edition.

And this will be the definitive Metroid game of them all Metro plan for Federation force

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.420
on three DS.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.740
I'm going to preorder that today.

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:29.740
Just despite Loki.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.740
I okay.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740
That's your game.

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.860
If you want to, if you want to buy crap, that's fine.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.380
You're eating this weird chips.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.940
So I know that you're delicious for the chips.

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:46.100
Do not come for the chips just because you don't like Brazilian or Brazilian steak or,

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.100
or whatever.

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:48.660
The Brazilian steak is really good.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.540
It's very flavorful and not horrible.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.540
Come for the chips.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.540
Loki.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.540
Oh, it's weird.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.540
Cut somebody.

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.540
Yeah.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:59.640
Listen, weirdly.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.360
That is, that is you spitefully chewing down on the chip.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.360
All right.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360
All right.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360
Okay.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360
Seriously though, don't chew in the mic.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360
That's gross.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360
All right.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.980
Going, going to the PlayStation three over in Japan, uh, tales of Biseria, uh, also being

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.320
released there in a regular and a Famitsu deluxe pack.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:23.140
Cause we know they love the deluxe packs over there in Japan, uh, PlayStation four also

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:25.560
getting that same release of tales of Syria.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:30.080
So look forward to that, uh, on the Wii U this week, some tumbleweed is rolling by

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.400
because there's nothing coming out on the Wii U in Japan.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.640
But if we go to the Vita, we have collar cross malice and regular and limited edition.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.600
Uh, that is out this week on the 18th.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.640
And then lastly, looking at the Nintendo three DS this week, uh, we don't have anything in

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640
Japan.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.400
In fact, they get Metroid prime a week after we do so.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400
Oh, sorry.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400
They're calling.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.880
Was it Metroid prime Federation force over there?

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880
I don't.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880
Okay.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880
That game is not.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880
I already closed the window.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.080
That game is not out of Japan for another week.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.960
So lucky them.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:04.120
Well, they have a chance to see how we react and make a decision from there.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.500
But you know, Metroid was always a bigger game here than it was in Japan.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.880
So I mean, it does make sense in that regard.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.560
Although yes, Loki, I understand this is not the Metroid experience that everybody's waiting

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560
for.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560
All right.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560
Uh, dark soccer.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
How about the UK?

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.080
What will we find on the shelves in the UK this week?

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080
Not a damn thing.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.080
Nothing.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.080
It's new.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.080
All right.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.080
Nope.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.360
A chance to revisit games that you need to catch up on.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.240
Time to drink tea and read a book.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.920
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.320
use the pass phrase, note.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320
All right.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.240
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.880
And then the classic game of the week, Loki.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.920
All right.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:54.240
So Hello Games is currently testing some patch for the PC version because as you may know,

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.780
the PC version, kind of a fucking mess right now of No Man's Sky.

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:02.240
So it's supposed to improve support for AMD CPUs.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.820
It fixes some frame rate stuttering.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:12.320
And the setting, the max frames per second to 30 or 60 is not working.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.960
So you can, that'll be working as well.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.000
House stuttering and crashes when you're alt tabbing out of the game.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.440
Also they're saying that apparently they're going to fix some other issues if caused by

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440
G-Sync and stuff.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.160
So, all right, cool.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.320
So you can, what, you can like beta test this patch now or something, right?

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.320
Yeah.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.320
The real one's not out yet.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320
Right.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.240
So you can go to your Steam library and then if you go to the properties on the game, you

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:50.840
can get into, select the betas tab and you can, if you type in the codes experimental

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.740
with a three instead of an E in the beginning, then you can download it early.

01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.640
Apparently it's been working pretty well.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:03.400
You know, they've gotten the game to work at 60 frames per second at 1440p.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.400
So my bad.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.400
All right.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.560
Well, I'm going to ask Alan to install that later so I can see what that looks like on

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:16.320
his PC because I, I wonder if it'll improve the graphic quality for him.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320
So I mean, it doesn't look terrible.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.960
It's just, it doesn't look the same that it looks on PlayStation four.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.520
I wish that framer is higher, but I mean, you're simulating that many plants.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.920
I'm kind of okay with that.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920
Gotcha.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.040
Well, before we get to the classic game of the week, a interesting update on what's going

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:35.920
on with league of legends and a riot games is actually suing a league of legends cheating

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.600
service called league sharp, which I guess charges between, and again, I'm not as up

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:47.240
and up on league of legends because, um, I'm just not great on it, but, uh, uh, league

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:53.920
sharp is charging between 15 and $50 a month for hacks and bots, uh, that I guess we'll

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.720
edit the game or what have you.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:02.280
Um, so, uh, league sharp will allow you to see hidden information, automate gameplay

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.680
to perform with enhanced or in human accuracy and accumulate levels, experience and items

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.640
at a rate that is not possible for a normal human player.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.960
That is all according to the lawsuit.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.400
That's the lawsuits words.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.420
Um, they had originally tried to contact the site owners directly riot did, uh, but that

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.420
didn't work.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.960
So they called the lawyers and got them involved.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:26.520
So riot wants to put a stop to that enterprise that's charging the money to basically cheat

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.760
in the game.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.760
And we'll see what happens.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.280
The defendants have 21 days to respond.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.880
It'll be very interesting to see what develops with that.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:38.800
All right, let's travel to a time when things, things were a little more simpler than this.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.000
You couldn't, you could just cheat in games.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Yeah, you could.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Well, you could.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
You had a game genie.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.360
You didn't have to pay somebody $15 a month to do it for you.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.880
You paid 60 bucks for a little device and found codes that would come in the little

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.880
book.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880
I fair enough.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.280
It's a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the week.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280
Huh?

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.920
There it is.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.000
There's the music.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.920
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.920
you should play this game.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.120
It is over 10 years old, believe it or not.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.840
And therefore it's a classic.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.080
It's Barbies for Grown Straight Men.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.080
I'm sorry, Dead or Alive Xtreme beat volleyball.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:20.120
So this game is awful.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.000
And Dan played so much of it.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.600
So I basically picked this game to give him shit.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:36.860
Basically it's a volleyball game with the Dead or Alive ladies in bikinis and all kinds

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.400
of outfits.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:46.820
And you have one guy in the entire theme and it's Zach, the human Teletubby.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:56.420
So anyway, no fighting, just volleyball and bikinis and sunshine and shopping.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.980
You basically just dress them up and take pictures and watch them walk around.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:07.140
And you have, they build relationships with each other and sometimes they do dances and

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:15.580
then you play volleyball, but it really is just Barbie for, for grown men, really.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.200
It's just completely crazy.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:24.260
So anyway, as you go through the game, you can get gifts and date and sorry, influence

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:31.780
other characters cause dating sim, you know, and then you earn Zach bucks, which you use

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:40.420
on, you know, each character as you go through the game to buy new outfits with varying degrees

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.100
of modesty attached to them.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:51.660
So the characters in the first game were Ayane, Kristy, Helena, Hitomi, Kasumi, Leifang, Lisa,

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:54.020
and Tina.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:24:00.540
And now we're like, what, on the fourth one of the series, fifth one of the series.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:06.140
And there was a big, big bit of drama about this, but the soundtrack for the game actually

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.540
was pretty decent.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:18.540
It had some Bob Marley, it had some Christina, had real big fish and some other people that

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:24.620
I'd never heard of, um, but people liked it.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.860
It was okay.

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.520
And then, Oh, and there was, um, a kind of a bit of a controversy over an April fool's

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:37.700
day joke is that EGM back in the day did, um, a nude code for the game that said you

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.020
could play with them topless in nude mode.

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:45.620
And then it was a hoax and they got a bunch of pissed off people because apparently I

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:47.300
was promised some titty.

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:52.020
I was promised some anime titty and you robbed me of my titty.

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:53.020
And you know what that meant?

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:58.860
That meant of course, um, you know, enterprising people because the X-Box was very exploitable

01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.860
then made it a reality.

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:00.860
God, this game looks awful.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.300
I'm going to hack my titties.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.300
Yeah.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:09.340
This was, um, uh, some different hobbyist, uh, hobbyists actually reverse engineered

01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:16.160
the game and modified texture models to be able to make them completely naked in very

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.100
high detail.

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:24.540
And, um, Tecmo actually took them to court, um, for breaching the digital millennium copyright

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:31.660
act, um, with that and as well for Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive 2 and, uh, tried to get

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:38.340
some pretty, uh, uh, big money, like between one grand and 10 grand for every skin that

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.760
was swapped over the website that they offered.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.700
So that's it.

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.740
So it's basically Barbies for grown men.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:55.940
SSG100 Matt in chat says tear down that wall that is hiding those titties.

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:56.940
You know what?

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.980
A little, a little excess in games sometimes is just fine.

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:05.740
In my opinion, you know, you, you, you have ridiculous over the top movies that I love

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.180
like showgirls.

01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:12.340
I think if you're going to have the showgirls of games in something like Dead or Alive beach

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.980
volleyball, which is basically what it is, uh, then you know what?

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:16.980
That's great.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:25.180
So, uh, although I would like to see something that, you know, uh, sexualizes and, and, you

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.060
know, makes, uh, characters of men in the same way, I think, yes, I think everybody

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.660
deserves that too.

01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:37.180
I think that there should be like the banana hammock game with scantily clad dudes of various

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:40.700
isn't there that showering guys game on steam.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.140
That game's like weird.

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:47.620
It's not even shower with your dad shower with your dad.

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:52.520
You want men to be subject to, uh, titty titty, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520
Not even the same thing.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.520
Nine.

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.620
So here's the, here's, here's what I, here's what the perfect game would be.

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.260
And I'm going to go back to, you remember the days here's, I'm going to take it back

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.080
ready for ready for old man Roberts reference here.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:12.280
Remember when you had like a laser disc or a DVD that on one side was one presentation

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.880
of the movie, but if you flip it over, it was another presentation of the movie.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.440
So how about a game that on one side is anime titty and on the other side is anime dong.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440
Like is it, is it that hard people?

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.440
Is it that hard?

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.400
Why can't we just have them all in the same game?

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.960
Well, and I would, I would be perfectly fine with that too.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.360
But you know, for those that wish to have nothing but titty today or nothing but dong

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.600
today, we can have floppy boob physics.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.680
There can be floppy dick physics or bouncy ball physics, whatever, right?

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.720
We can have pantsless rage.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.400
We can have pantsless rage.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400
All right.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.920
Uh, we're going to take a break and a question our lives and our priority in gaming.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.480
And then we're going to come back with even more news.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:04.680
And of course your phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680
word.

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.960
So we're gonna take a break, but we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio right

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:16.200
after this.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:21.640
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 654 for this

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:26.360
August the 14th of 2016 of course our show is already in progress.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.320
We've been talking a bit about no man's sky, the final fantasy 15 rumored delay, uh, more

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.200
NX rumors and so on.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.880
And there's still plenty more to come.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.000
Um, I wanted to, um, mention that, uh, dark Sakura, you brought me something I've been

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.640
looking for for the past couple of weeks that I have not been able to find myself, but you

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.440
found it and you brought it here and that is the crystal Pepsi.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.440
Yes.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.520
I just happened to look over and went, shit.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.300
Is this a permanent thing that they're doing or is this just like, I think it's a limit

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.580
to like, don't you all love the nineties?

01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:59.800
Here it is again.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:05.740
But if I miss Pokemon and blink when I do too, I wish that they'd had the diet one so

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740
I could have.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740
Yeah.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.740
Because, okay, here's the thing.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.780
I love crystal Pepsi, right?

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.420
I loved it when I was a kid and now that I'm drinking this again, I'm like, okay, yeah,

01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:13.740
this is really good.

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:17.300
Now that I'm 20 years older, I'm realizing why this is so good.

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.780
Uh, this is nothing but sugar.

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.340
This is 250 calories a bottle.

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.340
Oh my God.

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:22.340
Let's see.

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:26.380
Does soda only have like 160 or let's find out myself.

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:31.420
I feel like, well, usually one can has one serving a 20 ounces, two servings.

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.940
Oh, my red, my red bowl is only at 110.

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:40.440
My Pellegrino, uh, pump Elmo is 140.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.820
Now see this crystal me drinking this bottle of crystal Pepsi wouldn't be so bad if I was

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.140
still playing DDR, but, uh, at least, Hey, you know what?

01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:52.320
At least I walked around a lot yesterday because I'm an out of town friend of mine from Ingress

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.040
was visiting over the weekend and we decided we wanted to do a big banner because you can

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.160
do these things in Ingress called missions.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.840
And you know, when you string a bunch of missions together, you can do a banner.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.000
So we did a series of 60 missions downtown yesterday.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.400
Um, because it was, I wanted to get it done before I went to Atlanta.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.300
So I'd have it on my profile for when I meet other Ingersers there and so forth.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.020
And this was the weekend that it worked out for us to be able to do that.

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:17.240
So, uh, we went out, yeah, did 60 missions.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.520
By the way, we had planned all this when the forecast for the weekend was supposed to be

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.520
a more reasonable 90 and not the 102 that it ended up really becoming.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.080
And yes, those 12 degrees make quite a difference.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.960
And I did it in the heat and I'm crazy.

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.960
You did it in the heat.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:36.880
Yes, but I've earned every drop of this crystal Pepsi from yesterday's exercise.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:37.880
You go.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.000
That's for sure.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Will do.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I will go.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.120
I will go and unveil the rapid fire news that we're going to get into next.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.120
Loki.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.200
All right.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.200
So there's some new Nintendo games that have entered in their selects program.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.280
So that means that they're going to be cheaper now because you know, Nintendo doesn't really

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.400
do price drops pretty regularly.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:03.240
So on the three DS, you can look forward to a few games, a animal crossing new leaf, a

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.560
Lego city undercover.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:11.640
The chase begins Luigi's mansion, dark moon, and then 10 dogs, cats, um, or plus cats,

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.320
golden retriever and new friends and Tomodachi life.

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:20.440
And then of course on the Wii U we're getting the legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, Lego city

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.800
undercover and Nintendo land may have to pick up Wind Waker cause that's not bad.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:30.340
And then Lego city undercover looked pretty cool as grand theft auto with Legos, which

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:36.680
I think is what originally was supposed to be within a backed off from that too bad.

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:43.580
Also there's going to be some, um, new bundles that are going to be a game plus an amiibo.

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:47.260
And so those are going to be coming out starting September 9th and those are going to be priced

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.700
at $40.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.700
So something that you can look forward to captain toad treasure tracker with toad Mario

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:59.820
party 10 with Bowser, Mario party with peach Yoshi's wooly world, uh, with light blue yarn

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:04.740
Yoshi or pink yarn Yoshi.

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.740
That's cool.

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:08.580
I guess if you don't own those games yet, if you're, if you're going to finally take

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:12.740
the plunge on a Wii U this Christmas, Hey, at least you could stock up on games for reasonable

01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:13.740
price.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.740
Black Friday, just wait for the black Friday.

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.740
Ooh, good.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.740
Good call.

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.300
Um, but yeah, I mean, we wake her definitely.

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.540
I mean, cause I like Wind Waker.

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.340
I have it on the game cube somewhere.

01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:26.900
It's actually, it's in my sister's storage cause she has my game cube, but I wanted to

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:27.900
play it again.

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:32.620
I'm like, but $40, man, that's a lot, you know, for that, I'm just going to wait until

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.620
it drops in price.

01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:34.620
Well now it's dropped in price.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:35.620
So maybe I will.

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:40.340
Um, and then this is kind of funny, a little tongue in cheek, I guess.

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:47.380
So South Park, the fracture, but home, they released a brand new, uh, that title's always

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.380
going to make me giggle.

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:53.820
I hear Mike over there, they released a new teaser for the game.

01:32:53.820 --> 01:33:03.300
Um, that was pimping a, a device called the nostrils rift, which is basically this device

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:07.660
that plugs onto your face and allows you to smell smells.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.260
So this apparently is going to be a thing that you're going to get to experience if

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:18.060
you're at games com and you will be able to smell farts with it as you play the game.

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.460
What else would you do?

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:20.460
Exactly.

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:26.780
So, uh, go check that out if you're having to be in, you know, going to games com.

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780
I don't know.

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.780
That's fantastic.

01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.780
It looks awesome.

01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:30.780
All right.

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:34.780
Too bad it's not like a pre-order item or something like that.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.780
No, that'd be kind of funny, but.

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:37.780
All right.

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.780
Well, something Jason was talking about in the intro tonight was a rocket league in this

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.780
game.

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.780
You know, Hey, rocket league is still a lot of fun.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.780
I don't know if you guys have checked it out lately, but they keep doing a lot of updates

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:47.780
to it.

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:49.780
And there's more free DLC coming to rocket league.

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.780
And now rumble mode is happening in September and that's on all platforms.

01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:58.780
Now what's happening with this is that it's going to be bringing items like the boot,

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:03.780
which will allow you to kick an enemy car in its proverbial face.

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.780
I'm assuming so you can kick cars.

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.780
There's a grappling hook, which will pull the players towards the ball.

01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:14.780
So I guess like, you know, any, any game adding grappling hooks is always a good thing.

01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.780
Exactly.

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.780
Uh, so yeah, that's, that's pretty cool.

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:21.780
Uh, that they're adding these silly things to it to do a little more, uh, uh, I guess

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:22.780
fighting in it.

01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:27.780
Uh, you can also, there's other, uh, powerups as well, such as, uh, a plunger, which will

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.780
grab the ball via, via a plunger and a cord.

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:34.780
Um, a spike will allow you to attach the ball to your car when you bump into it.

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:39.780
And a swapper will allow you to instantly change fields on the, uh, change a position

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.780
on the field with your opponent.

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.780
So this just sounds like clusterfuck 5000.

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.780
And, uh, I think it'll be fun.

01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:51.780
Uh, Hey, would you like to get a Ubisoft game for free?

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.780
Yes, that's right.

01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:56.780
Now that you're paying attention, Rayman Origins is going to be free on PC starting

01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:57.780
on August 17th.

01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:58.780
How do you get it?

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:02.780
You go to the Ubi 30 website and click get the game.

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:08.780
And they're doing that each month too, but you do have to have a Uplay account to get

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780
the game in your library.

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:12.780
But I mean, if you played Ubisoft game, they forced you to do that.

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:13.780
Yeah.

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:14.780
So you probably have one.

01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.780
So you just need to remember your lock.

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:21.780
If you've ever played Assassin's Creed or just dancer and South Park, then you have

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.780
a Uplay account.

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.780
So, uh, log into it and you can do that by the way.

01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:30.780
You could still grab splitter cell if you want, uh, before that goes up on the 17th.

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:33.780
Uh, once you download it, it is yours forever.

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:37.780
Four more free Ubisoft games coming, uh, through the end of 2016.

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:42.780
That's some, you know what, Hey, it is hard to be upset with free and Rayman's a solid

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:43.780
platformer too.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.780
So, I mean, for that reason alone, they did do Yaris.

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:49.780
Remember Yaris existed and it was free and it was bad.

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:50.780
Okay.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.780
But to be fair, Ubisoft had nothing to do with Yaris.

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.780
I think the bar for quad, I realized Ubisoft may have put out a couple of stinkers over

01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:57.780
the years, but there's, there's some really good stuff too.

01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.780
And Rayman's Rayman's on the good side.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.780
Rayman is, but you can't bulk it free.

01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:02.780
True.

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.780
All right.

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:08.780
Then again, they do also have that weird bird combat game that's coming out.

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.780
That's VR or something like that.

01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:11.780
Why not?

01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:17.780
That you like, I don't know what you do in this game, but you're a bird.

01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.780
All right.

01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.780
And you do battle.

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:21.780
You're a Pidgey.

01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.780
Uh, last up, Dar Sakura.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.780
Um, Florence and the Machine has three songs out that are for Final Fantasy 15 and they're

01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:29.780
all on iTunes right now.

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:35.780
I may have just bought all of them, but the songs are Too Much is Never Enough, I Will

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.780
Be, and Stand By Me.

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.780
Um, and yep.

01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:44.780
The last one, actually, it is a cover of the original Stand By Me.

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:48.780
If there's not going to be poking dead bodies in Final Fantasy 15, I'm going to be slightly

01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:49.780
disappointed.

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.780
Hey, want to see a dead body?

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:56.780
I will say this, uh, the minute that I found out that those tracks were on Spotify, which,

01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:00.780
you know, it went up Friday and all the big music services got it Friday, uh, I went and

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.780
listened to the whole thing.

01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:02.780
I was not disappointed.

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.780
I love that cover of Stand By Me and I love how it incorporates the Final Fantasy theme

01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:06.780
into it.

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:10.780
I mean, you kind of already knew that from the trailer, but the two original songs are

01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:11.780
really good as well.

01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:15.780
Like, you know, Florence is a phenomenal artist and, um,

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:17.780
And she's not on, what, Heroine?

01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.780
What was she on?

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:20.780
She was on something.

01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:25.780
Well, I guess a lot of artists were, but anyway, all that aside, she's a fantastic musician

01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:29.780
and I loved the, even though it's a three song soundtrack, I loved it.

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:31.780
So, um, yeah, check it out.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:32.780
Listen to it.

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:33.780
I think there's a YouTube out there.

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:37.780
They officially put out with scenes for the game from one of the other songs, not Stand

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.780
By Me, but the first song on the soundtrack.

01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:40.780
So, uh, yeah.

01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:45.780
ImmortalKing in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love Florence and the machines.

01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.780
And now that it's on Final Fantasy 15 is awesome.

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.780
Uh, and then Bobby Blackwolf says, I actually love Too Much is Never Enough more than Stand

01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:53.780
By Me.

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.780
That's the song, um, that is first on the soundtrack.

01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:56.780
Yeah.

01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.780
Honestly, the Too Much is Never Enough is a fabulous song.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:05.780
And I really hope it's used artfully in the game because if that is with a climatic moment

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.780
in the game, that could be a beautiful thing.

01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:09.780
It was just alcoholism.

01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:11.780
Oh, only.

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:12.780
All right.

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.780
Anyhow, you can get over alcoholism a lot easier than you can heroin.

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.780
Fair enough.

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:18.780
So moving on.

01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.780
All right.

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:24.780
In other news, um, Sega has renewed the license for Virtua Fighter.

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780
Oh, sorry.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.780
The trademark for Virtua Fighter.

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:30.780
So maybe we shall have more of those coming out.

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.780
I'm never, I'm not a big fan of the Virtua Fighter series myself, but a lot of people

01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:35.780
are.

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:36.780
I'm a Tekken girl.

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.780
Well, writer, we've got Virtuality coming out.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.780
Maybe Virtua Fighter.

01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:42.780
No.

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:43.780
Yes.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:44.780
Kick Punch.

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.780
That's it.

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:47.780
All right.

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.780
Uh, we're going to get back into some, uh, long form news here.

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.780
I do want to mention though, something that had come up in chat, as I saw people talking

01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:58.780
there over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, I saw that, uh, uh, earlier after the break, SH2100

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:02.780
Matt was letting people know that tickets for MAGFest are on sale, the music and games

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.780
fest, which I went to for the first time this year.

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:06.780
And I had a great time.

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:13.780
Uh, so the hotels went up for MAGFest earlier this week and it was, it was controversial

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:14.780
to say the least.

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:15.780
Let's put it like that.

01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:18.780
Were there some servers humbled by your presence or whatever?

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.780
Kinda.

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:23.780
I mean, I don't think it was that the servers fried, but it's just that hotel rooms were

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:24.780
gone instantly.

01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.780
And that hasn't really happened with MAGFest before.

01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.780
Like last year, I feel like it took like a day.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:33.780
And the year before that, like it just wasn't like MAGFest is getting really, really, really,

01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.780
really popular.

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:38.780
And it's being constricted by that space that they hold it at.

01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:42.780
Although that is a beautiful hotel, it's just National Harbor is only so big in itself.

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:45.780
So, you know, there's just, there's just some growing pains in that regard.

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.780
And then there's the whole, they put it up at a really weird time.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:53.780
They put it up at one o'clock Pacific, which for most people that go to MAGFest was four

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.780
o'clock Eastern, which, you know, a lot of people are still at work.

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.780
So it was a weird time for them to put out and they did it unannounced unless you're

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.780
on Twitter.

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.780
So they're getting a little bit of heat for it.

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:06.780
You know, I, I do feel like that team is very responsive and chatty.

01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.780
And so I feel like they're listening to the feedback at least.

01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.780
So, I mean, you know, what's done is done.

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:16.780
And then the tickets for actual MAGFest went on sale just, I think yesterday.

01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:19.780
And the servers did melt down for that, but I think they've stabilized now.

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:23.780
Although they say that MAGFest will not sell out as fast as the hotels did.

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:24.780
But I don't know.

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:30.780
I don't know if I believe that anymore, but I did want to say some of the same people

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:33.780
I went to MAGFest with last year decided to go again.

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:36.780
And I have decided to go with them again.

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.780
We did, we did not get the official hotel cause we were 15 minutes late, but we did

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:43.780
get the hotel next door.

01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.780
So we did get a hotel.

01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:45.780
So it's not that bad.

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:46.780
Yeah, it's whatever.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:47.780
Yeah, whatever.

01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.780
So I just, my only thing, and this is always my paranoid thing.

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.780
We're going to Washington DC in January is please no Snowmageddon.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:54.780
That's my only wish.

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.780
Please no Snowmageddon.

01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:00.780
Uh, so, uh, but I will be flying out there and going to MAGFest.

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:02.780
I, I, our friend just booked the tickets.

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.780
They're doing the group rate thing cause there's like at least eight of us going.

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.780
Uh, so I will be going to MAGFest 2017 and I'm really excited to, um, be there.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.780
Uh, this year I am going to try to lobby to get on some panels.

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.780
I would love to do that now that I know a little more about what the convention is all

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:16.780
about.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:18.780
I would really, really love to get involved in that capacity.

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.780
Um, and I'm looking forward to representing VOG.

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:24.780
Um, I don't know if I know Bobby is unable to go cause the earlier timeframe of the year

01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.780
makes it not able to work for him.

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:29.780
I'm not sure what other VOG hosts we have that might be going.

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:35.780
Uh, but I look forward to, uh, representing, uh, VOG and being hopefully a part of some

01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.780
of the hosts that can go.

01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.780
So, and MAGFest is going to be a lot of fun.

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:39.780
Excited.

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:40.780
All right.

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:45.780
Rama in chat, uh, over at live.vognetwork.com says Sky working on it.

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:46.780
Yeah.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:47.780
All right.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:48.780
Ooh, wow.

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.780
And MXC says the cheapest tier of tickets sold out a few minutes ago.

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:52.780
Wow.

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.780
So there's going to be slightly more expensive now.

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.780
Well, hopefully my pal already got those tickets.

01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:59.780
I better, uh, beep him or what we can do.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.780
All right.

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:02.780
Uh, we're gonna get back into some other long news at this point.

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:03.780
So Loki.

01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.780
So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Go.

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:11.780
Uh, Niantic is finally cracking down on players that are cheating in Pokemon Go by using bots

01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.780
or other programs.

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:18.780
They've made some changes or additions to their FAQ and they are now sending out the

01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:25.780
ban hammer and also sending out cease and desists to some of the, um, websites creating

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.780
these bots, including one such bot called Necrobot.

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:33.780
Uh, they sent out a cease and desist letter and basically they've shut down, you know,

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:39.780
shop and you know, they comment, do the legal action being started against, um, other bot

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.780
creators and devs.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:44.780
Uh, we did not receive the letter yet, but the project development will be stocked.

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:48.780
And then of course, you know, there's other, uh, what was some of the other bought ones

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:54.780
that other bot creators have also received, um, cease and desist letters though for that.

01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:59.780
Um, one of the other things they included on there as well, using an emulator, um, modified

01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:03.780
software to access Pokemon Go or clients or backends.

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.780
So they're saying that maybe they might ban you for using some of those Pokemon tracking

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:11.780
things because there's still some of them out there and you create, you know, accounts

01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.780
to do that.

01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:13.780
But let's be honest.

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.780
I mean, you can create as many fucking accounts as you want and they're not really going to

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:19.780
stop you.

01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.780
So it gets banned.

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:21.780
Big deal.

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:22.780
Yeah.

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.780
Unfortunately, it's very easy to make a new account and keep playing.

01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:30.280
Um, but at least I'm glad Niantic is doing something about it, but I'll, I'll just give

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.320
a cheap plug for Pokestop podcast this week because we talked a little more about this

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:39.660
at length and some of, I kind of feel like we, there's some false positives, unfortunately,

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:43.980
that it makes it hard to be excited about this when that's going on.

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:46.580
It's definitely a step in the right direction at least.

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:47.580
It is.

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.580
It is.

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:49.580
It's better than nothing.

01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:50.580
That's true.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.580
That's a common theme with Niantic.

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:52.580
It's better than nothing.

01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.420
Not only is Niantic sending out cease and desist letters, but they're also getting sued.

01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.680
They're getting sued by a guy from West Orange, New Jersey.

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:07.300
He's pursuing a class action lawsuit against Niantic Labs because his house or I guess

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:13.980
apparently his house is labeled in game as either, um, or something nearby, maybe as

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:16.100
a Pokestop or a gym.

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:20.700
Um, yeah, I'm not really sure.

01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:24.980
Say if it's specifically his house or something, but basically those darn kids are on my lawn

01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:29.780
playing Pokemon Go and, and I'm not happy about it.

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.820
And so basically he says, you know, at least five individuals knocked on the plaintiff's

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:39.700
door and asked the, asked the plaintiff's, um, access to the backyard to catch Pokemon.

01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:40.700
Someone explain this to me.

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:44.580
I never fucking understand this because I've never had to walk anywhere to get a Poke.

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:48.500
I mean you can catch a Pokemon that's like several, I don't get it.

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:52.540
Like it's, are people dumb enough to like not realize that you don't have to be on top

01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.860
of the Pokemon to catch them?

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:58.420
We talked about this a little bit on Pokestop last week and, uh, the theory I threw out

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:03.840
there was that it wasn't the Pokemon themselves, but it was the whole searching feature that

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.140
was causing people to triangulate the Pokemon in this person's backyard.

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.400
And that's cause you know, back East and these other places, they have much bigger backyards

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.540
than we do here.

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:17.820
So it was, and we, we, I'm speculating again, tinfoil hatting, I have nothing to go on,

01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:22.500
but this could be part of the reason why Niantic said we needed to get rid of the searching

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.840
the way it was and replace it with something else.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.160
So I worry about this loss.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.760
I mean, I, I know a lot of us are kind of laughing it off.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.800
This one worries me.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.000
Like I kind of feel like this is going to be a really interesting precedent for AR gaming.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.700
I just, I have the, maybe I'm just like, you know, that Ingress player that's like, ah,

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.700
I've been doing this longer than you guys.

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:51.260
But it seems like just, it's really like new bitch to think that you got to walk right

01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.260
up to that stuff.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:55.860
Like, I mean, seriously, just driving around, you can catch it, learn how to hop a fence

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:56.860
like the rest of us.

01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:57.860
Just like forget it.

01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:01.740
I mean, you'll have to, if it's on your screen, you can tap it in, you know, attack it.

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:06.780
It could be like several blocks down the road, but, but it could be again, the backyards

01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.940
in some of these neighborhoods are huge.

01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:12.940
So somebody is triangulating it in this person's gigantic backyard and they need to get in

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:15.380
the backyard to actually even though that's not a pokey stop.

01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:20.300
That's just in general people being dumb, but you know, I don't know, whatever.

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.300
We'll see.

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.900
I, I, again, this, this one worries me a little bit.

01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:30.180
I feel like at the end of the day, it's the choice of the kids to ring the doorbell, not

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:31.180
Niantic.

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.180
So talk to their parents.

01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.180
Yeah.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:36.940
So I kind of feel like that might be the escape here, but I, I just, I worry a little bit.

01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:40.900
Did you hear about the bad egg for Pokemon Go?

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:45.700
There was an article up that said that, um, people were able to, through some kind of

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:49.260
glitch, put an egg as, um, with the gym.

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:52.580
Oh, I heard somebody was doing that at one of the local communities here.

01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:54.580
And I'm trying to find the picture of it.

01:46:54.580 --> 01:47:01.740
Basically the egg has no CP, so it can't be killed and it will just reap all those ongoing

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.500
benefits of being a gym leader and you can't knock it out.

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:13.380
People, you can file a report with Niantic to have it removed, but, um, it's just happening,

01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:17.260
I think for the most part on the East coast, um, gyms, but still a nuisance.

01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:18.260
Yeah.

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.820
So something else to consider, you know, William Murderface, I just, before we move on to the

01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:27.100
next story, William Murderface poses a, a, a good question in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.980
William Murderface says, how is ringing a doorbell a crime?

01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:30.980
The fuck?

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:35.260
Um, I suppose they're going to have to prove that it was a nuisance.

01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:39.380
You know, if it was at weird hours the night, I mean that that's going to be the, the, the,

01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:42.620
it would have to legally be a nuisance for that to happen.

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:47.340
That's why, you know, you don't go ring your neighbor's doorbell at 2 AM just to say, Hey,

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:48.340
sup, I'm bored.

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.820
What you up to, you know, don't do that.

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.820
No.

01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:52.820
Well, I w okay.

01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:58.820
It's different if you work overnights, Mike, you can do things like that, but, uh, you know,

01:47:58.820 --> 01:47:59.820
yeah.

01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:00.820
Anyway, well, we'll see.

01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.820
I don't, I don't know.

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.300
I think that's a good question.

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:07.220
And one that will probably be asked in court that Niantic will say, what's illegal about

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.220
ringing a doorbell.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:09.220
Anyway.

01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:13.100
Uh, let's move on to a story about something that's definitely illegal.

01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:16.500
And that is hacking a forum to get people's passwords.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.320
Yes, it's happened again.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.360
Feel like we have one of these stories every month, but the forums for Dota 2 were hacked

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.160
on July 10th.

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.540
And apparently they got 2 million records in the hack, usernames, email addresses, passwords

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:30.720
and IPs.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.000
So if you didn't use a unique password on the Dota 2 website, you should probably do

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.500
that next time.

01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:41.560
And as always change your password, which at this point, you might as well just change

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:48.000
your effing password on all your sites every couple months, just to be safe or use, I realized

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.800
everybody, some people use the app that does the one password generator, whatever works

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:59.240
for you, just realize you can't, you know, name all your passwords, you know, Mr. Kitty

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.960
123 or whatever silly passwords people come up with, it has to be a lot more complex than

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.080
that or things are going to get hacked.

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.680
All right.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:10.680
Moving on, DarkSakura.

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.320
Well, again, business can be shady.

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.800
Business is super shady.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.540
Microsoft bought its Twitch competitor.

01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:25.680
They acquired Beam Interactive, they are not saying for how much, basically it's pretty

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:33.880
much, you know, like Twitch is, it's to watch realtime gaming and commentary.

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:39.200
And so they're calling it a convergence, it's a takeover.

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.680
It's just shady business.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:48.920
So the one thing about Beam is that it is completely realtime.

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.800
It doesn't have that 10 to 20 second delay that Twitch has.

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:59.700
And it also has different tools that allow the different viewers to influence the stream.

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:04.140
So like they'll let a viewer select the weapon that they have to in a shooter or other things

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.600
like that.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:12.520
So yeah, shady, but it's business.

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:19.480
Well, I could see why Microsoft wants to get in on that business as well is that, you know,

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.880
Twitch obviously has a huge audience and nobody's really competing with them.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:29.320
I mean, YouTube kind of trying, but like even YouTube isn't taking off the way the Twitch

01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.320
is.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.680
So Twitch really has a lock on that.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.080
So they're very interesting.

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.620
So it's just, it seems to me that they're just going to turn it around and use it for

01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:45.600
their own promotion, which I like the idea of a streaming service being independent.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.680
And then the name of this is Beam, right?

01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.680
Beam.

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.800
Somebody was asking in chat.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:55.360
Well also, I think Beam also is very much about, you know how like when you play Tomb

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.720
Raider on Twitch, you may not know this, but when you play Tomb Raider on Twitch, people

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:03.440
can like help or hurt you by the chat commands.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:09.480
Beam does that type of stuff where it's like, vote on what item the player should get next

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480
type of thing.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.560
So there's a little more interaction than there is on Twitch, which is actually kind

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.480
of cool at the same time.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.260
This just opens yourself up to rampant trolling.

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:24.060
But if there's something a little more structured, like actually, maybe the Jackbox Party Pack

01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:26.340
is a really good explanation of that.

01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:29.900
Because like in the Jackbox Party Pack, you might be streaming a game online that you

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:35.100
and your friends are playing in one room, but anybody can join to help vote on answers

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.340
and maybe change the flow of the game and things like that.

01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:41.080
I think that might be more the type of technology that Microsoft's getting into.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:46.780
So if Microsoft is really looking at making games more interactive, that could be a pretty

01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:50.940
cool thing and something that puts it a notch past Twitch.

01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:51.940
We'll see.

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.020
I'm curious to see what they do with this.

01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:55.660
Very, very curious.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:59.580
So all right.

01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.580
Let's move on.

01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.180
Loki, before we get to the mailbag.

01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.180
All right.

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.780
So this is kind of funny.

01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.140
Apparently THQ is coming back.

01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:08.140
Yeah.

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:14.260
THQ is coming back as THQ Nordic because you may remember Nordic games when they had that

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.980
huge buyout where they were selling all their properties off.

01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:21.620
Nordic was one of the ones that purchased a lot of the older backlog stuff that they

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:22.620
had.

01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:27.220
So like the Darksiders, MX versus ATV, Red Faction, just around human properties.

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:34.260
Now on top of that, they're just going to be renaming themselves to THQ Nordic, which

01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:36.460
is neat.

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:42.340
And they're going to be publishing under the THQ name, possibly.

01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.980
I guess that's cool.

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.740
Good luck to them with that name.

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:46.740
I guess they really want that.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.900
I just want to see more games coming out from that stuff because, I mean, hell, Destroy

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:50.900
All Humans.

01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.780
That was pretty awesome.

01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:55.060
Stoppy's with you in our chat at live.vognetware.com.

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.500
Stoppy says, I really hope they bring back Red Faction.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:59.020
Red Faction is pretty cool, yeah.

01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.780
So maybe it's going to be a throwback to some of these old series.

01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:02.780
Who knows?

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.140
Well, you know, Volition really does want to make a Red Faction game because that's

01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:09.020
what Saints Row 4 basically was in space.

01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.020
I don't know.

01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.020
It's silly.

01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:13.860
Well, I think this is awesome.

01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:16.980
And that is that Parappa the Rappa is coming back.

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:17.980
Yay!

01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:18.980
Wait, hold on.

01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:19.980
I gotta believe.

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:20.980
Hold on.

01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:21.980
What?

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:22.980
Not in a game.

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:23.980
Sorry.

01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:24.980
It's not a game.

01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:25.980
It's not a game.

01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:26.980
Why would you do that to me?

01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:28.980
Because the truth, it was my clickbait.

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:32.540
Parappa the Rappa is coming back, but it's just not a game.

01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:37.620
It's going to be some anime shorts that are actually coming out.

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.620
These are...

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:39.620
I don't...

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:40.620
But why?

01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.220
That's already an anime.

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:45.700
But these are new anime shorts.

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:53.100
It is a series of shorts that I guess PJ Berry is actually getting the title role in this.

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:57.940
It's not Parappa, but it's PJ Berry, which is the little bear friend that always looks

01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:58.940
a little hungover.

01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:01.060
If you remember the games.

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:06.660
So that is going to be starting in October and it will be actually, actually, no, why

01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:07.660
does...

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:12.180
It says starting in October, but it says, oh, the pilot episode will be August 18th,

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:14.060
then the rest of them in October.

01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.300
They're doing an early preview type of thing.

01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:19.140
So you could check that out if you want.

01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.980
I want the Lemmy and Remy show.

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.500
And maybe if this does very successful, maybe there'll be a Parappa 3.

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:25.500
I gotta believe.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.660
Parappa would be the perfect digital game.

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.100
We need a Lemmy sequel.

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.940
Yeah, I would totally be down with the Umjama Lemmy.

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:35.220
I would be down with a game starring both of them again.

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.220
Give them co-billing.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.220
Don't give a fuck.

01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.220
Just bring back this series.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:39.220
Add Knuckles.

01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:40.220
Fuck off.

01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:47.540
Did you guys see the comic?

01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:50.220
What if Sonic was in Pokemon?

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:54.180
He was going around telling all the Pokemon to rise against their human masters and trap

01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.740
them all in Pokeballs.

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:56.740
That's what I see going on.

01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.540
If Knuckles was in the game, he'd just be like, the fuck am I doing here?

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:07.260
And teach Parappa about hardcore.

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:10.780
I would actually love to see a third friend that comes in.

01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:11.780
So what?

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:12.780
Parappa raps.

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:15.060
Umjama Lemmy plays the guitar.

01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.780
How about like Marimba Mel or something?

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.780
Didgeridoo Dave.

01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:22.060
Yeah, Didgeridoo Dave that plays the didgeridoo.

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:24.980
And then implement Lucio from Overwatch.

01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:26.460
There we go.

01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:27.460
Drop the beat.

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:29.700
Let's get the beat down.

01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:33.520
But like, no, seriously, if they had Didgeridoo Dave, then you could actually go back and

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:39.580
play the older games with the didgeridoo enhanced soundtrack.

01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:44.020
So you could go back and do like, you know, the toilet wrap with the, you know, ominous

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.020
didgeridoo noise.

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:51.860
And his didgeridoo is like the sewage pipes.

01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:56.180
I feel like that's on the cusp of being an OLR dream game is didgeridoo Dave.

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:59.940
That's it.

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:03.100
The third game in the Parappa the Rapa series didgeridoo Dave.

01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:04.100
All right.

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:05.740
I like that.

01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:09.940
It's a dream game adjacent because it's not an original idea, but it's one that needs

01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:10.940
to happen for sure.

01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.940
It's a dream sequel.

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:13.180
It's a dream cool.

01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:14.180
A dream cool.

01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:15.180
It's a dream cool.

01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:16.180
All right.

01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:18.660
Didn't we open this show talking about sequels and remakes and how we don't want them anymore?

01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:19.660
Here we are.

01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:20.660
All right.

01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.180
Anyway, we're allowed to change our minds.

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180
That's right.

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.180
You know what?

01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:27.220
This is your show and not yours.

01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:31.260
Opinions in the gaming industry changing, contradicting themselves.

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:34.660
Get out, get out right now.

01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:35.660
Let's get to the mailbag.

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:36.660
Really?

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:37.660
Really?

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:42.300
I was going to say, you know, just kind of going back to that topic we were just on there

01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.300
a second ago.

01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:44.300
Yes.

01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:45.300
Really?

01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.300
They should just add T-Pain as you know, the third character.

01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:47.300
Why not?

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:48.300
Oh, Auto-2 now.

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.300
T-Pain is Auto-2 now.

01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.300
T-Pain is Auto-2 now.

01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.300
I think Rob just lost this.

01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.300
Why is this so funny?

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.300
Because it's incredible.

01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:02.300
Hey, I smell a list list coming.

01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:05.300
Oh, who should Parappa's new shitty friend be?

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.300
Exactly.

01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:09.300
Why not all of them?

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.300
All right.

01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:15.300
Hey, if you have a shitty friend you'd like to see in the Parappa universe, email us.

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:18.300
My shitty friend is in my mind.

01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:25.300
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can email us and tell us about

01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:30.300
all your imaginary shitty friends or whatever's on your mind this week about gaming and the

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:31.300
gaming industry and so forth.

01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:34.300
So, what's in the mailbag this week, DarkSakura?

01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:35.300
One email.

01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:36.300
One email?

01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:37.300
One.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.300
All right.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:39.300
Well, at least it's an email.

01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:40.300
Hello.

01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:41.300
Hi.

01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:44.300
I just wanted to extend well wishes to everyone at the OLR and VOG family.

01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:45.300
I love you guys.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:46.300
That's it.

01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:47.300
Smile hearts, Ryan.

01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.300
Thank you, Ryan.

01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:52.300
That's the email?

01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:56.300
That literally is an email that just was like, no, please, I'm laughing.

01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:58.300
The music was great for it too.

01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:04.300
No, I'm laughing as I'm still laughing at Auto 2 now, but I love that we just got an

01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:07.300
email that's like, I just called to say I love you.

01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:13.300
I just called to say I care.

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.300
I love it.

01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.300
Thank you.

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.300
You want to know what's funny?

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:17.300
I love you too.

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.300
I love you too.

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:22.300
I actually was listening to that song last night because I was on a Stevie Wonder kick.

01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.300
All right.

01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.300
There's no inappropriate time for a Stevie Wonder kick.

01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:28.300
Do you know what though was really wrong to follow that song with?

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:29.300
Superstition.

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:30.300
Anyway.

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:35.300
The only time that that might be inappropriate is if in the middle of Inception because they

01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:39.300
don't really need a kick that early, especially the Stevie Wonder.

01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:42.300
Anyway, thank you for the email.

01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:43.300
I'll see what you did.

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:49.300
You know what, even though there was no question or observation, I appreciate a pat on the

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:51.300
ass and a job well done once in a great while.

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:56.300
But you don't want a pat on the ass so hard your ass falls off, tries to grant you a wish

01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:57.300
and flies away.

01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:59.300
Nobody understands this reference.

01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:00.300
It sounds amazing.

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.300
Darsucker's referencing a webcomic that none of you read.

01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:08.300
The rest of the webcomic is actually pretty dirty, but I'll link it to you guys in the

01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:09.300
chat.

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:15.300
By the way, can I just mention in chat over at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster saying,

01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:19.300
I'm going to name a planet Parappa shitty friend and hope it doesn't get reported.

01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:20.300
Great.

01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:21.300
Let's see.

01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:24.300
And we have Sia Tabiri in chat says, Clogger Clay.

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:27.300
Raginator suggests Triangle Tim.

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:32.300
Fifth Dream suggests base player that no one knows his name.

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:34.300
They just put flea in it.

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.300
It's so fucking good.

01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:37.300
He could be like a rapper's name.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.300
Base playa.

01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:44.300
Sia Tabiri suggests Molly Marimba or Orange Wright suggests Xylophone Xandar.

01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:47.300
Sia Tabiri says saxophone Xin-chan.

01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:48.300
Xin-chan.

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:49.300
You know what?

01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:52.300
See, this is what they need to do in the next Mega Man game.

01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:53.300
Tuna base.

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:56.300
Trying to do like a musical spin on it where the rumor was that they're all going to be

01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:59.300
named after like music, you know, Sonata and that type of stuff.

01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:01.300
No, they need to be all fucking rapper names.

02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:05.300
Like, you know, that kind of base playa or I don't know.

02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:07.300
Actually tuna fish.

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.300
That's or excuse me, tuna base.

02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:10.300
That's a great name.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:11.300
Maybe a drag name.

02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:15.300
Well, it could actually be a little fish that plays the bass guitar.

02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:18.300
That's I think that's a great idea.

02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:19.300
Act Deaf.

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:20.300
You should make Parappa games.

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:22.300
How about tuna piano?

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.300
Tuna piano.

02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:25.300
All right.

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:30.300
Let's get to the FUs of the week because when the show totally derails, we just derail it further.

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:49.300
Harpsichord Henry said harp core Henry.

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:50.300
Oh, I read harpsichord.

02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.300
All right.

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.300
Anyway, go ahead.

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:58.300
If you if you to wanting so much cheesecake that I can't fucking stand it.

02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:06.300
And so Becky and I are going to get cheesecake because Becky with the good hair.

02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:08.300
Actually, Jamie has the good.

02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:11.300
Jamie has the good hair today.

02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:14.300
I it's it's a Beyonce reference.

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:15.300
Oh, OK. Don't worry about it.

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:16.300
Sorry. Don't worry.

02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:19.300
She's not my queen bee.

02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:21.300
But cheesecake is all the best stuff in the universe.

02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.300
And I also have blue roots.

02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:30.300
I said when I get old, I'm going to bleach on my hair and make it blue so I can be a blue haired old lady.

02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:39.300
And now I have like deep blue roots with my red and purple hair, and it's pretty fucking good.

02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:45.300
Raginator says Lira Lisa and I just keep thinking Lisa Lisa and cult jam.

02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:46.300
Yeah.

02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:47.300
All right.

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:48.300
Moving on.

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:51.300
Loki, how about your FU of the week before my FU of the week?

02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:53.300
I have to say accordion owls.

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.300
And of course, played by Weird Al Yankovic.

02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:56.300
Yes.

02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:57.300
Brilliant.

02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:59.300
I think that really is already in my little pony.

02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:01.300
He may as well do that to sell it.

02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:02.300
OK.

02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:06.300
FU to my fucking computer for being just retarded and randomly crashing.

02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:10.300
It hasn't crashed yet, but that doesn't mean there's still potential.

02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:12.300
I'll try to work on my game tonight.

02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:17.300
I'm sure they'll get the crash and then just send FU to my car.

02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:25.300
But thankfully, though, that was fixed and it was kind of weird because it's one of those like transmission things where the check engine light came on and it goes off.

02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:30.300
And then it would be like several months where the car's driving just fine and one stutter here or there.

02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:32.300
And then finally it stayed on so they could fix it.

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.300
So that's good.

02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:35.300
Oh, my God.

02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.300
I just heard a gay gasp.

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:39.300
Someone created.

02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:40.300
I know.

02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:41.300
And it wasn't me or Mike.

02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:44.300
Someone created.

02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:45.300
The Picaturo.

02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:46.300
The Picaturo.

02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:47.300
What?

02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:48.300
Yeah.

02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:49.300
And it's in California, too.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:50.300
OK.

02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.300
Stop derailing the FUs.

02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:52.300
All right.

02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.300
I wanted Picaturo.

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:59.300
My FU of the week goes to my snack food addiction because I've eaten tons of snack foods today.

02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:01.300
And then I had a Crystal Pepsi.

02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:02.300
Did you have a Picaturo?

02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:04.300
I don't think so.

02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:06.300
I have not.

02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:08.300
Life squad goals.

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.300
It's at this place called The Loop.

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:11.300
Where's that?

02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:12.300
Is it in fucking L.A.?

02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:13.300
Everything's in L.A.

02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:14.300
I'll find out.

02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:15.300
It's in L.A.

02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:18.300
I already know like mega California burrito.

02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:19.300
Oh, my God.

02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:20.300
Look how big it is.

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.300
I'm going to put in the chat room.

02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:24.300
And it's served in ice cream.

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:25.300
It is a joke.

02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:28.300
Since it's radio, it's a giant.

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:35.300
It's a giant churro that you actually wrapped around your face and has little Pikachu ears on it.

02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:36.300
Can you put that in chat?

02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.300
Yeah, I'm gonna.

02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:39.300
Sorry for the folks listening on the podcast.

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.300
Oh, my God.

02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:41.300
Google Picaturo.

02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:44.300
The Picaturo has to be inside of my stomach right now.

02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:45.300
That's amazing.

02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.300
I think it would kill you if it was inside your stomach.

02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:48.300
I don't care.

02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:49.300
It does look alive.

02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.300
Picaturo used Nuzzle.

02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:53.300
It's super effective.

02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:55.300
Picaturo used IBS.

02:03:57.300 --> 02:03:59.300
It's super effective.

02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:01.300
Picaturo uses Thunder Shark.

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.300
It was extremely effective.

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.300
What's that?

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.300
Is that the new Alola Pikachu?

02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:05.300
Yeah, it's Alola form.

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.300
It's the Dole Whip form.

02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:08.300
All right.

02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.300
Oh, my God.

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:13.300
The thing's also coated in something like golden delicious.

02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:14.300
Stop talking about fucking food.

02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:16.300
It's a video game show.

02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:18.300
It was half related.

02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:20.300
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line.

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.300
Loki.

02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:27.300
So Spotify has now, they've unveiled a dedicated gaming section.

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:32.300
They have game soundtracks and playlists for games.

02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:34.300
So some of the games that they have on there.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.300
Rocket League.

02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:38.300
There's some Ultimate Rock Gaming.

02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.300
Gaming Anthems.

02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:44.300
So, yeah, you can go check it out.

02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:45.300
They're so bad.

02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:52.300
Just if you want to check some of those out in that, just browse and scroll down to the genre section, big gaming.

02:04:52.300 --> 02:05:01.300
I actually, I was unable to find it in the Spotify app, but I went to that dedicated website and there actually was some playlists that were actually really good.

02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:05.300
Like, I like Spotify a lot myself.

02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:07.300
Like, I realized you can kind of pick that or Apple Music.

02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:14.300
But one thing Spotify has done very, very well that no other service for me has done is that the playlist that it curates.

02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:18.300
Like, We Think You'll Like This have been spot on.

02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.300
Like, they're so good.

02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:20.300
I have never used Spotify.

02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.300
Really? I don't think Apple Music does that.

02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:24.300
It just has a list.

02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:29.300
Well, I got suckered into the whole pay 99 cents for three months and then oops, I didn't cancel my credit card.

02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:31.300
But, I mean, I really do like it.

02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:36.300
So it's like, okay, yeah, they suckered me into paying the monthly fee and I kind of don't buy music anymore.

02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:37.300
I just use Spotify.

02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:42.300
So, which is probably not what record labels want to hear, but that's the direction things are going.

02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:45.300
You get to listen to new music whenever you want.

02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:46.300
I do.

02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:48.300
That's just basically what you want.

02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:49.300
You don't want to necessarily buy.

02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:51.300
I have a curated playlist for new music.

02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.300
And you can still search on there, right?

02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:55.300
And it knows I want to hear every new Britney song.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:56.300
It knows.

02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:57.300
All right.

02:05:57.300 --> 02:06:04.300
Anyhow, let's go on to one last story tonight.

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:07.300
Oh, this could maybe be a use for the Pikachu Dark Sakura.

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:09.300
Digestion?

02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:10.300
Digestion.

02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:18.300
Do you remember a few weeks ago here on the show, we were talking about Pokemon inspired dildos.

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.300
That's right.

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:22.300
Adult toys inspired by Pokemon.

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:30.300
Well, apparently a adult film company out there called Brazzers was the name of this company.

02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:31.300
Never heard of them.

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:37.300
Well, I can't imagine why.

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:40.300
They're like memes worthy.

02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:42.300
You put Brazzers on anything and it's dirty.

02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:50.300
Anyway, they have Porn Star Go, which is a Pokemon Go inspired triple X film.

02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:53.300
And there actually is a trailer.

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.300
And wouldn't you all like to see that trailer right now?

02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:56.300
Absolutely.

02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:58.300
Let's do it.

02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:00.300
Because it's going to be great radio.

02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:03.300
The porn stars try to catch them all.

02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:06.300
Imagine porn stars in the real world.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:09.300
They are in the real world.

02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:10.300
I'm confused.

02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:14.300
Get ready for the ultimate showdown.

02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:16.300
Oh my God.

02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.300
Was that anal beads she pulled out of his pocket?

02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:28.300
And shows that she caught the beads.

02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:30.300
What the fuck did you do to my yard?

02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:34.300
That's the guy who's doing Niantic for all these people being in his yard.

02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:37.300
This is like cosplay porn.

02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:38.300
Is this a parody?

02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.300
Is this serious?

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:45.300
Okay.

02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:46.300
Is this legit or is this?

02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:47.300
Oh my God.

02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:48.300
It says August 8th.

02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:50.300
I guess it's already out.

02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:51.300
This is legit.

02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:52.300
This isn't like a parody somebody did.

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.300
No, it's just a really terrible film.

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:56.300
Not like Google.

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:57.300
Just go to Brazzers.

02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:59.300
All right.

02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:00.300
Wow.

02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:03.300
Now I've seen everything.

02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:05.300
The ladies are really cute though.

02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:08.300
They look really adorable in those outfits.

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:09.300
Sure.

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:14.300
You know there will be significantly less clothing in the actual thing.

02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:16.300
So they're not going to look as cute, Rob.

02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:18.300
I'm fine having just seen the trailer.

02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:19.300
That's fine.

02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:20.300
There you go.

02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:21.300
It's straight on their front page.

02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:22.300
So yes, I would definitely say that.

02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:23.300
Oh my God.

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:24.300
Getting in on the...

02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:25.300
That looks so stupid.

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:26.300
Getting in on the...

02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:27.300
Did they do a Candy Crush porn?

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.300
I don't think so.

02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:37.300
No, but they have Sex Fighter, a triple X parody, Vega gets vagina.

02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:41.300
Yes, that's a thing.

02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:44.300
So yes, apparently that is a thing.

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:45.300
That's fantastic.

02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:46.300
All right.

02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:47.300
Let's...

02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:49.300
A parody title popped into my head.

02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:50.300
I don't know if it's appropriate.

02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:51.300
Oh no.

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.300
What's this?

02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:53.300
Dare I ask?

02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:54.300
No.

02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:55.300
We won't go there.

02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:56.300
Thanks.

02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:57.300
That was a great radio.

02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:00.300
Fifth Dream and Chat suggest Panty Crush Saga.

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:01.300
Well, here's what I was going to do.

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:04.300
I was going to go to their parody page because that's going to be where they have all the

02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:05.300
different stuff.

02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:12.300
So on top of that, they also have Sex Fighter with Chun-Li versus Cammy, of course.

02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:13.300
Some other parodies.

02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:15.300
Several Ghostbusters triple X parody videos.

02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:16.300
Of course.

02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:19.300
Star Trek's...

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.300
What would be the plot of a Ghostbuster?

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:23.300
Is it your vagina is haunted?

02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:24.300
X-Men.

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:31.300
They also have Spider-Man, Star Whores, Storm of Kings, which I'm not really sure what the

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.300
fuck that's supposed...

02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:33.300
I guess Game of Thrones.

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:36.300
Just so you know, the X-Men thing exists in the gay porn universe as well.

02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:37.300
Or so I've heard.

02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:38.300
Oh.

02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:39.300
Oh.

02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:40.300
On Twitter.

02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:41.300
You know, people are so nasty on Twitter.

02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:42.300
Right.

02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:43.300
All right.

02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:44.300
The Skype line is open.

02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:47.300
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:49.300
If you want to give us a call.

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:52.300
Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype if you would like to participate with

02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.300
the program tonight.

02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:58.300
Meanwhile, while we wait for any calls that may be coming in, I want to check with Loki

02:09:58.300 --> 02:09:59.300
for any last minute stories.

02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:01.300
Unless he's too busy looking at pornography.

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:05.300
No, they just have, like, they really, after that first page of parodies, they just kind

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:07.300
of go downhill from there because there's not really anything...

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:09.300
When was it ever uphill?

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:13.300
Well, I thought that there'd be, like, more movie parodies and stuff like that, but it's

02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:14.300
really not.

02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:15.300
Like, I mean, come on.

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:16.300
Womb Raider means shit.

02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:17.300
That's like fucking grade school shit.

02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:18.300
That's art.

02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:19.300
That's just, like, stupid.

02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:20.300
Whatever.

02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:21.300
That title is...

02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.300
Alright, the phone's ringing.

02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:27.300
Let's get to it so we can get through some folks that want to be on the show tonight.

02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:28.300
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:29.300
Who's this?

02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:30.300
Hi, Rob.

02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:31.300
It's Rama.

02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:32.300
Hi, Rama.

02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:33.300
How are you?

02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.300
I'm good.

02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:43.300
I just want to know, are you becoming the official, how do we say, per slash adult material

02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:45.300
collector of the show?

02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:46.300
Sure.

02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:48.300
It appears to be Loki right now.

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.300
How am I supposed to fucking answer that?

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:51.300
I don't know.

02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:54.300
Like, what gives you that impression that I'm the official curator of all the adult

02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.300
collections on OLR?

02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:00.300
It sounds like you got a little more excited about the parodies that were being discussed

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.300
with Loki about a couple of minutes ago.

02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:05.300
You're the one that does the show about cosplay.

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:09.300
You should see how cute some of these costumes are, Rama.

02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.300
The costumes were YouTube appropriate, to be fair.

02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:14.300
To be honest, the costumes were pretty great in Final Fuck X.

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:18.300
No, seriously, it was disappointing, though, because the female, like, porn stars were

02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:22.300
all done up like, you know, they're Final Fantasy characters.

02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.300
The male porn stars were like, ah, fuck it, we're just not doing anything at all.

02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:29.300
Yeah, no, they should have also dressed up and, you know, anyway.

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:30.300
Commitment, dammit.

02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:35.300
Stoppy in chat says, as your attorney, I'm going to advise you to not answer that, Sky.

02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:37.300
So, I plead the fifth, Rama.

02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:41.300
Well, that's all fine, because I tell you what, if Mako-chan was awake, she'd be joining

02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:45.300
forces with you, because on our show, she's our residential hentai connoisseur.

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:48.300
Can I come on anime jam session sometime to talk about pornography?

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:52.300
I don't see why not, I think Mako-chan would be all for that.

02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:54.300
Alright, make it happen.

02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.300
I don't watch anime, but I do watch porn.

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:05.300
Yeah, I don't watch that either, anime.

02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.300
You're lying.

02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:10.300
Alright, actually, one of these, I do need to catch, now that I have the Pokemon show,

02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:14.300
I keep meaning to watch some of the episodes of the Pokemon anime and check that out, so.

02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:17.300
My son's been watching it, and I've been watching it with him, and yeah, it's pretty

02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:18.300
good.

02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:20.300
It gets pretty dark in places.

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.300
Does it?

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:24.300
I'm like, I'm all shit, man, like that one where they went to fight the psychic one,

02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:28.300
she's like, yes, I'm going to trap you here and keep you as my toys and kill you and steal

02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:29.300
your souls.

02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:31.300
Wasn't that the plot of Return to Oz?

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:32.300
Terrifying.

02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:33.300
I'm like, dude.

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:34.300
That was keep their heads.

02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:36.300
I'm like, this is a little dark.

02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:40.300
Like, my youngest sounds like, I'm scared, I'm scared.

02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:42.300
I'm like, it's just a show.

02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:46.300
Oh, and Rama's probably sitting there going, literally, I can think of 50 different animes

02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:49.300
that you should be watching before that.

02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:51.300
More like 25.

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:52.300
More like 25, alright.

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:54.300
I'm actually watching anime right now.

02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.300
Are you?

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.300
What are you watching?

02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.300
I'm watching Danganronpa 3, the future arc and despair arc.

02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:00.300
Because of your obsession with the games.

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:01.300
Pretty much.

02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.300
Yeah, fair enough.

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:04.300
And so, and Shane and I actually just like, we're both watching them, so we talk about

02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:05.300
it the next day at work.

02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:09.300
Sometimes the obsession with games carries over an anime, it just happens, it happens.

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:11.300
Well, it's the only way they're finishing the story.

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:14.300
Uh, what, Rama, what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:18.300
I was going to talk to you about Magfest and all that goodness.

02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:19.300
Yeah.

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.300
AKA VOGCON Winter Edition.

02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:22.300
Yeah, right?

02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:23.300
Yeah, definitely.

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:25.300
Are you going?

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:27.300
I am going.

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:32.300
And I'm also, I got peoples that's trying to secure me at least two rooms for all of

02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:33.300
us to help out.

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:34.300
Believe you me.

02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:39.300
Because let me tell you, I forgot that the rooms were going up that afternoon.

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:43.300
I'm checking Facebook, and I get them, and somebody's talking about it, I was like, oh,

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:44.300
okay.

02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:48.300
I totally forgot because I was working, and then I go to check my phone, and so I was

02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:49.300
like, I got a room.

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:53.300
I started tapping as hard as I could on my phone to reserve a room.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:56.300
And then I was this close, I was like, I made one mistake.

02:13:56.300 --> 02:14:00.300
I realized I only had one room, I need to grab a second room.

02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:04.300
And the site wouldn't let you get two rooms, by the way, because we tried to do the same

02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:05.300
thing.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.300
And that's how we got locked out of the main hotel.

02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:11.300
No, that's, yeah, because it seems that you have to go into the full desktop view of the

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.300
page.

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:13.300
I go to that.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:14.300
Already gone.

02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:15.300
I'm like, you know what?

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.300
This.

02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:17.300
You know what?

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:18.300
They're going to have to do next year.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:19.300
They need to start requiring a deposit.

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:23.300
I know nobody likes that, but it'll deter people from just holding rooms for the sake

02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:24.300
of holding rooms.

02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:30.300
But, I'll get into that in one sec, but thankfully I have friends who are traveling or going.

02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:34.300
I will know, probably in a month or so, I'll have two rooms coming to me, so I'm good to

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.300
go about that.

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:41.300
As for the whole deposit thing, you're right about that, because Captain Khan is in the

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:46.300
same hotel, does the same thing, and every year the same people, bitch.

02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:49.300
They're like, I have never heard of a Khan doing this.

02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:50.300
How long have you been doing this?

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:51.300
This is new to me.

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:54.300
You could tell the people who don't read the website.

02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:56.300
Dragon Khan has insane deposits.

02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:02.300
I had to pay a full night's stay in advance, and if I canceled after the first of the year,

02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:04.300
I'd lose half of the deposit.

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:07.300
And if I cancel now, I'll lose it all.

02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:11.300
Rob, this is why I have a dedicated credit card just for hotel rooms.

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:12.300
I don't have to worry about that.

02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:15.300
It's probably not a terrible idea.

02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:20.300
This year we are taking over the Travis Donovan suite, and we're repurposing it as the VOG

02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:22.300
suite this year, so we're going to have fun.

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:25.300
It's going to be expensive, but you know what?

02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:29.300
I'm in an age where I fucking earned it.

02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:32.300
I can't be humble about it, Rama.

02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:37.300
I've reached that point in my life where I'm like, I ain't cramming four people in a Motel 6 anymore.

02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:42.300
I fucking earned a suite when I'm on vacation, and I'm a motherfucking adult.

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.300
Rob, brother.

02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:45.300
What?

02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.300
Brother, let me tell you something.

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:54.300
There are con-goers that are our age that still pack six to ten people in a room.

02:15:54.300 --> 02:16:00.300
And if they can do it, God bless you, but I ain't doing that shit.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:03.300
Poor bastard that is stuck in the bathroom.

02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:10.300
No, look, I have slept on the bathroom floor of a Motel 6, and I wasn't even fucking drunk.

02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:12.300
It was probably E3 or something.

02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:14.300
I've been there, done that.

02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:17.300
My 38-year-old ass is not doing it anymore.

02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:20.300
I'll wake up, and I'll be like, my back, my back.

02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:26.300
There's a reason I used to play live-action vampire at Mobicon so that I would be guaranteed

02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:33.300
a bed when everybody else got up, and I could go lay down for my four hours of sleep before

02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:35.300
doing my go-for duty.

02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:41.300
Yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, being in the room at MAGFest with just my girlfriend

02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:42.300
was nice.

02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:45.300
We were also in the closest room to the con on the second floor.

02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:49.300
Yeah, when you can do it.

02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:53.300
Again, I'm sitting here going, look, I realize that not everybody is in a situation where

02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:54.300
they can do that.

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:59.300
And when I was in my 20s, believe me, I did all the roughing it up in rooms and all that

02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:01.300
stuff, and I'm just like, you know what?

02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:05.300
I stopped going to Disneyland and doing all these other extravagant vacations I do.

02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:10.300
Pretty much all I do is cons now, so I save my money, and I buy myself something pretty

02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:11.300
at cons.

02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:12.300
Mm-hmm.

02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:13.300
And you are three cons.

02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:15.300
We've been being a certified con whore.

02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:17.300
I think I will hit that.

02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:19.300
We have Dragon Con in three weeks.

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:21.300
We have Gamer X4 a month after that.

02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:24.300
We have Final Fantasy Fan Fest like two weeks after that.

02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:25.300
And now we have MAGFest.

02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:30.300
That's four cons in the next, what, through January 2017.

02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:31.300
Four?

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:33.300
Damn it, Rob, you're such a whore.

02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:34.300
Yes.

02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:37.300
Wow, and this is Rama.

02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:39.300
Talk about pot and kettle.

02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:40.300
Jesus, Rama.

02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:41.300
I know, right?

02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:44.300
All right.

02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:50.300
Kossin in chat says, hmm, so Rob actually knows if you can catch a VD from sleeping

02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:52.300
on a Motel 6 floor.

02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:54.300
Just so you know.

02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:55.300
Yes.

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:56.300
Yes, no.

02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:57.300
Brother.

02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:59.300
Luckily, I did not.

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.300
However, I want to point this out.

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:09.300
The Motel 6, where I slept, and I will never do this again in my entire life, was on Hollywood

02:18:09.300 --> 02:18:13.300
Boulevard in Hollywood.

02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:17.300
I, and everybody has these dreams of Hollywood.

02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:18.300
Did it smell like prostitute on the floor?

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:19.300
Glitz and glamour.

02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:21.300
Oh, no, there's prostitutes, that's for sure.

02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:22.300
Oh, yeah, no, no.

02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.300
Weren't you there?

02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:28.300
Yeah, I was there because, like, it was, we went with our friend Brad, and he had gone

02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:31.300
out for a smoke or something like that, and he ran into a couple prostitutes in the hallway

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:35.300
that were, like, trying to hit him up for stuff, and he's like, no, it's cool.

02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:36.300
Um, but.

02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:41.300
When OLR does E3, we hang out with hookers.

02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:45.300
WhoreLR.

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:48.300
Hashtag WhoreLR.

02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:51.300
Some day we'll have the parody movie.

02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:53.300
That's what we can aspire for.

02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:56.300
Maybe for our quiciniera, somebody will make a porn.

02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:57.300
Alright.

02:18:57.300 --> 02:18:59.300
Obviously, you know, I know peoples, okay?

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:02.300
We can get this shit done.

02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:06.300
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go so we can try to get more calls, but anything else you

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:08.300
want to share with us tonight?

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:13.300
I have a half a case of Sprite Remix and a half a case of Crystal Pepsi in my fridge.

02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:16.300
I didn't hear Surge, so I'm not interested.

02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:17.300
I want Surge.

02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:18.300
Save me some.

02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:20.300
And Josta needs to come back.

02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:26.300
And Rama, I was going to say, you probably already know this, but call that hotel every

02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:30.300
day until MAGFest, because people are going to cancel those rooms.

02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:34.300
And if I do that, they're going to tell me to refer back to the booking system, so like

02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:35.300
I said, I'm on this.

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:37.300
I've been doing this shit for almost 20 years.

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:38.300
I got you, fam.

02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:39.300
I got you.

02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:40.300
Alright.

02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.300
Thanks for looking out, bro.

02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:45.300
By the way, apparently the cheapest level of MAGFest tickets are already gone.

02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:50.300
I just heard that as a few minutes ago, because our group guy was still waiting to hear back

02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:52.300
on the final count, so we missed it.

02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:56.300
So, and now we're kind of sitting here going, well, god damn it, you know, so we're going

02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:59.300
to have to make a move on that really soon, so it looks like MAGFest may sell out this

02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:00.300
year.

02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:02.300
MAGFest never sells out.

02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:04.300
They're going to keep selling and so on and so forth.

02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:07.300
No, they sold out during the con last year.

02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:09.300
Well, shit, look.

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:13.300
That place can handle at least 15,000 people, so you know, hey.

02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:14.300
Yeah, I know.

02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:15.300
I know.

02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:17.300
It's, but move sooner rather than later.

02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:19.300
Alright, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you.

02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:20.300
Hey, no problem.

02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.300
Stay fabulous, brother.

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:22.300
I will.

02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:23.300
Stay black.

02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:24.300
I'll try.

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:25.300
Alright, bye.

02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:26.300
Bye.

02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:27.300
Alright.

02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:28.300
Did you say stay black?

02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:29.300
It's an inside joke.

02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:30.300
Okay.

02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:31.300
Something that Dan says.

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:35.300
Look, for those that think I'm being like insensitive or rude, it's like, one day, for

02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:42.300
those that don't know the joke, one day Rama called in and Rama said something like that,

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:50.300
like, stay whatever, brother, and Dan was like, stay black, and it just turned into

02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:53.300
this hilarious thing, and we all had a laugh at it, and Rama thinks it's funny.

02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:55.300
We all think it's funny, so.

02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:58.300
If you don't think it's funny, I'm sorry.

02:20:58.300 --> 02:20:59.300
Next call.

02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:00.300
Hi, you're on Order of Songs Radio.

02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:01.300
Who's this?

02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:02.300
Yeah, what's up?

02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:03.300
This is Kaijuto.

02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:04.300
Hey, Kaijuto, what's up?

02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:06.300
First, I just wanted to let you know, I heard you earlier.

02:21:06.300 --> 02:21:10.300
I've been busy, so I haven't been able to, like, really listen to the show, and I think

02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:17.300
I heard you mention that you might be taking away your pre-order for the PlayStation VR,

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:19.300
because you're not sure about the new, right?

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:21.300
You said something like that, right?

02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:22.300
Yep, I did.

02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:30.300
Yeah, I think somewhere, Sony confirmed that the VR and the new PlayStation are gonna be

02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:34.300
like, kind of like separate from each other, like, you'll probably be able to use the VR

02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:39.300
sometime later in the future, but they really do intend for it to run on the PlayStation

02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:42.300
that we have right now, so you don't really have to worry too much.

02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:49.300
Well, that's refreshing to hear, so I do, I get a little nervous sometimes with what

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:54.300
they say versus what actually happens when things hit the streets, but I also realize

02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:58.300
if I want to get a PlayStation VR, I'm gonna need to be one of those people that takes

02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:59.300
the plunge.

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:02.300
I think, Kaijuto, at the end of the day, I'm gonna stick with my pre-order, and I'm probably

02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:06.300
gonna get it, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I haven't thought about canceling it.

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:11.300
But, hey, there's the rumor, I think that they're gonna add VR support to No Man's Sky,

02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:12.300
which would be pretty awesome.

02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:16.300
That would be fucking rad, actually, and No Man's Sky is the type of game that I think

02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:19.300
could do it with, I mean, I don't know about the space flight, that's the only thing I

02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:23.300
worry about is that the space flight could be a little barfy, but I think maybe if they

02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:27.300
tune some things and, like, you don't run into a space station and start spinning 360s

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:31.300
and stuff, I think if they can tune some of that down, it might actually be really awesome.

02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:33.300
I would love to play No Man's Sky in VR.

02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:35.300
Yeah, it's funny that you say that, because that's what I was calling about, I was calling

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:40.300
about No Man's Sky, and I was streaming the game for a friend of mine, and I told her

02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:44.300
that very thing, I was like, you know what, I think they should put this in VR, but I

02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:48.300
don't know how well it would work, but I'm just calling to say that I have it on the

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:51.300
PlayStation 4, and I absolutely love the game.

02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.300
It's, like, one of my favorite games right now.

02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:55.300
It's probably my game of the year.

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:56.300
I'm, like, really enjoying it.

02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:59.300
I know that it's been getting a lot of heat online, because people were expecting it to

02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:05.300
be one thing that it wasn't, but I went in there with no expectations, and basically

02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:11.300
what it is is, like, a part space simulator, part survival game, with some exploration

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:12.300
in it.

02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:16.300
You know, it's not, like, this big, heavy, action-packed, you know, adventure game, and

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.300
that's not what I was looking for, so I'm really enjoying it.

02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:21.300
Yeah, actually, and since you missed earlier in the show, just to kind of summarize without

02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:25.300
restating what I said, I also have been playing No Man's Sky, and I find that I really, we

02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:28.300
agree on this one, Kaijuto, I really enjoy it as well.

02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:32.300
I, and it's, for me, it's a little harder to put my finger on, like, I'm not sure why

02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:38.300
I keep drawn to this, but I think it's just, I love the exploration fact, and yeah, okay,

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:44.300
so the planets have a lot of similar-ish looking creatures, but there's just enough differentiation

02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:49.300
and just enough subtle, the story pushing forward every time I find a new building that

02:23:49.300 --> 02:23:52.300
I still am inspired to move forward.

02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:57.300
Like, it's just enough, and I realize it's not for everybody, but I'm so into it right

02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:58.300
now.

02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:02.300
Yeah, what about the fact that, like, the game really doesn't hold your hand, like,

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:06.300
you know, there's some walkthrough to it, but at the same time, it kind of forces you

02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:10.300
to figure out what is going on, and I really like that aspect of it as well, because, like,

02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:15.300
when I, when I first played it, and I was, like, crash land on that planet, and I'm looking

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:19.300
for stuff, and I really didn't know what the heck I was doing, and I just, like, took my

02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:25.300
time with it, you know, I started scanning areas, I started finding things, and I slowly

02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:30.300
started to understand the game, just on my own, like, not going on Twitch, or not going

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:34.300
to YouTube, and I like that, like, I miss doing that in games, because, I mean, we,

02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:37.300
you know, with the internet, you know, we get so used to, you know, right at the, you

02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:41.300
know, the click of our finger, we can just go and Google something, or look something

02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:45.300
up online, and, you know, that's how you get through it, like, I love the fact that I didn't

02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:48.300
have to do any of that, and at the same time, it still felt like somewhat of a challenge,

02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:49.300
you know?

02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:53.300
Yeah, most of it I figured out on my own, although, in full disclosure, I did stream

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:57.300
the first night, because I was fortunate enough to get the game on Monday, so I streamed,

02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:00.300
and some of the streamers were yelling out, or some of the, excuse me, the chatters on

02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:04.300
the stream were yelling out things that I'd missed, I guess, as I was going through the

02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:09.300
tutorial, like, I totally missed that R3 could sprint, and that is such an important thing

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:13.300
for the sake, even though it's limited, you can't just sprint everywhere, and that's

02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:17.300
important, you do have, like, a stamina thing, but I guess you can increase that with items,

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:18.300
like, other stuff.

02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:19.300
Yeah, you get birds to do that.

02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:23.300
But, yeah, I mean, there were some little things that I missed, but yeah, trying to

02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:28.300
kind of figure out that game about the inventory management, and as I used this term earlier

02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:33.300
in the show, living off the land, because yes, No Man's Sky is very much about moving

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:38.300
forward, but like, you know, you run out of materials, and you have to find more, you

02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:42.300
know, you've got to be able to keep moving forward by using what's in front of you to

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:43.300
move forward, if that makes sense.

02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:45.300
That's the real adventure, No Man's Sky.

02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:51.300
Yep, and I like the fact that you're not, you're not whoring items, like, I know, like,

02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:55.300
games like Skyrim, you know, people go in their area, they just want to collect weapon

02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:59.300
after weapon, stock it up in their house, and never really do anything with it, like

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:03.300
this game, you really have to, like, watch what you're collecting, you know, you have

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:06.300
to, you have to balance the pros and the cons, should I hold on to this thing, or should

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:10.300
I dump it to get this, because I really need this right now, but I might need that later,

02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:14.300
you know, I love that whole challenge of it, you know, and the crafting, I do have to nitpick

02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:19.300
a little bit about the crafting, because, like, it's not a bad system, I mean, it is

02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:24.300
a crafting system, but coming from Minecraft, I'm, like, looking for my crafting table,

02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:28.300
I'm like, okay, where do I go to craft this stuff, like, I didn't realize that in your

02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:32.300
slot, you have to, like, you have to craft within one of your empty slots, so that was

02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:36.300
kind of weird for me, and I was like, you know, are they cutting corners, or did they

02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:37.300
just want it to be that way?

02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:42.300
Well, it's annoying, too, like, you can store, like, several tons of, you know, ore in one

02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:46.300
slot, but, oh, that chip, yeah, that's only gonna, you can't stack those.

02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:47.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:55.300
What was I gonna say about the, ah, I lost my thought about the game, and all this, nah,

02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:58.300
dammit, oh well, I'll think about it later.

02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:02.300
Yeah, but, yeah, I'll let somebody else get in on the call, but I'm really enjoying the

02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:07.300
game, I hope, hope they keep it as is, because, you know, like, in this day and age, it's

02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:12.300
like, developers get so, ah, they get so scared, as once they start getting some negative

02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:16.300
comments, and they try to go out of their way to change the game, I swear, I hope that

02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:21.300
they don't fuck with this game, you know, like, they need to just leave it as is, you

02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:25.300
know No Man's Sky 2, do an online No Man's Sky for those people that want that shit,

02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:29.300
but leave this game as is, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.

02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:34.300
I will say, the one thing I do that does, and I said this earlier in the show, but I,

02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:37.300
the one thing that does kind of bug me about the game that I do want to get a little better,

02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:41.300
at least it annoys me right now, is space fighting, like, when the, when the Raider

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:47.300
ships come, I, I just, like, the ship is not, does not control well for, like, a afterburner

02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:51.300
type of fighting thing, I, I just, that could be better for me, um, you know, but it's

02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:55.300
Yeah, but at the same time, at the same time, if you think about it, I'm not 100% sure,

02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:59.300
because, like, I'm taking my time through the game, but, I think you can go through

02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:02.300
the game just being peaceful, like, you don't even have to fight anything, so,

02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:06.300
No, they, they, they do, they do rage you if you're carrying expensive cargo, so you

02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:08.300
have to be mindful not to carry that, so.

02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:09.300
Yeah, I didn't know that.

02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:12.300
Yeah, so anyway, anyway, I'm going to let you go, buddy, but thank you for the call.

02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:13.300
No problem.

02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:14.300
Alright, bye-bye.

02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:21.300
Alright, um, I think that is going to do it, I don't see, yeah, so, I think it's almost

02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:25.300
about nine o'clock, so we do want to wrap up, so, if for whatever reason you didn't

02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:30.300
get through tonight, please consider sending us an email, that would again be participate

02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:36.300
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash o-l-r, many

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:41.300
other ways to participate with the program, but thank you guys very much for participating

02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:46.300
tonight, whether it be that you listen live or listen on the podcast, as we say at the

02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:50.300
end of every episode, tell a friend or five about the show, help us spread the word, because

02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:54.300
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we don't know that the voices are out

02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:59.300
there if they're not here, so, yeah, help us spread the word, a nice five star review

02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:04.300
on a place like iTunes, Google Play, wherever you found this podcast, it goes a very long

02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.300
way and we are extremely appreciative of all that.

02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:09.300
Hey, Mike, thanks so much for being here tonight and sitting in on the show, I hope you had

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:10.300
a good time.

02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:11.300
I did.

02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:12.300
Yeah?

02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:13.300
It was entertaining.

02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:15.300
Thank you for filling in, thank you for doing PokeStop earlier today as well.

02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:16.300
Oh, no problem, that was fun too.

02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:19.300
Yeah, if folks haven't heard that yet and they want to hear a little bit about Pokemon

02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:23.300
Go and the new Sun Moon trailer, check that out over at PokeStopPodcast.com.

02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:25.300
It was pretty cool and I was a lot more talkative on there, so.

02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:30.300
You were, but that's okay, you know, sometimes Loki's so loud, he just overpowers all the

02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:31.300
guests.

02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:32.300
Oh, yeah.

02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:33.300
I'm just kidding.

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.300
Nah.

02:29:34.300 --> 02:29:38.300
All right, but no, it's great that you could be here and I know you listen to the show

02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:41.300
a lot, because I'll get text messages from you about something I said and I'll be like,

02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:43.300
what, did I say that on the show?

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:44.300
You did.

02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:46.300
Yeah, so you keep me in check.

02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:50.300
Is it fun to see here play it out live as opposed to listening on the...

02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:53.300
It's a lot more entertaining because I listen to it at work, so.

02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:54.300
Yeah.

02:29:54.300 --> 02:30:00.300
And better than sitting by myself at work, listening to, you know, and like kind of talking

02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:01.300
to myself.

02:30:01.300 --> 02:30:05.300
What do you think people out there listening in Radio Land or whatever, what do you think

02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:10.300
people out there don't really realize about what this show really is live?

02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:12.300
The setup, I guess.

02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:13.300
Really?

02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:17.300
I don't know what initially I thought it was going to be before, but like...

02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:21.300
It's like set your expectations and then lower them and lower them some more.

02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:23.300
Hey, I think this setup we have here...

02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.300
This setup here is one of the, you know, like we have space, a lot of space.

02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:33.300
Yeah, no, like it's surprisingly comfy.

02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:35.300
Yeah, it's not a radio.

02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:38.300
It's not like you guys are like hugged up on each other, you know?

02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:41.300
No, that was the studio before this when we were at my apartment.

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:43.300
I don't hug.

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:44.300
I cut.

02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:47.300
So I'm over here for everybody's safety.

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:48.300
Oh, okay.

02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:50.300
But you share chips, Brazilian barbecue chips.

02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:51.300
Aren't those good?

02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:52.300
They are pretty fucking good.

02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:55.300
This studio puts the lounge in Orange Lounge.

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:56.300
Yes, it does.

02:30:56.300 --> 02:30:59.300
But yet there's not a single piece of orange furniture in here, so we'll work on that.

02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:03.300
There's a folder right here, it's orange.

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:05.300
There we go, that's my observation.

02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:07.300
There is nothing orange about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:08.300
It's a fucking lie.

02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:09.300
Except for Rob.

02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:11.300
Hey, fuck off, my beard.

02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:13.300
My beard is the orange in Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:14.300
Alright.

02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:18.300
Yeah, SG100Matt mentions the garage studio looked good though with the couch and the lights hanging up.

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.300
The garage is the closest thing to what we have now.

02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:23.300
That's what you need in here.

02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:25.300
The garage had the 100 degree heat.

02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:27.300
You need lights strung around the ceiling.

02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:29.300
Oh my god, that sounds terrible.

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.300
It was pretty terrible bad.

02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:34.300
I hate like, I hate streaming upstairs.

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:37.300
It was an insulated garage, so it wasn't as bad.

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:43.300
But Rob, you should totally do like holiday lights all around like the roof perimeter.

02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:44.300
Like Stranger Things?

02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:46.300
Well, not like that bad.

02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:50.300
When you let me put a video camera in here, I'll put the lights up.

02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:54.300
You know what? You can put a video camera in here, you just can't point it at me.

02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:56.300
Just put it like right there.

02:31:56.300 --> 02:32:00.300
And it should be like a surveillance cam view.

02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:05.300
It could be like Five Nights at Freddy's and you could switch cams and in like one moment I'll just run up to the camera.

02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:11.300
We gotta get the future. I gotta be on a quadcopter because that's not dangerous or anything.

02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:13.300
Let the listeners fly a drone around the studio.

02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:16.300
The whole time it's like, yeah.

02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:19.300
It's coming dangerous close to my face.

02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.300
Sounds great.

02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:25.300
Alright, anyway, I hope you had fun, Mike. We'll see you again soon, I'm sure.

02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:28.300
Thank you for blessing us with your presence. Do you have anything to promote?

02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:31.300
This time, sure, might as well. I'll just plug my Twitter.

02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:39.300
It's at mnav3. My Hearthstone one is the same, but just at HS for Hearthstone.

02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:42.300
Is that your Twitch channel too, mnav3?

02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:44.300
Yep. It's all my gaming stuff.

02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:46.300
Go get some Twitch followers.

02:32:46.300 --> 02:32:56.300
Yeah, why not? And then if any of you guys are on Battle.net, if you go to my Hearthstone Twitter, because I don't remember my battle tag info, it's on there.

02:32:56.300 --> 02:33:01.300
So, if you play Hearthstone, we can play some games and hopefully I won't lose.

02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:03.300
He's way better at Hearthstone than I am, that's for sure.

02:33:03.300 --> 02:33:04.300
Yeah, a little bit.

02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:08.300
Alright, thank you again for being here and have a great time. We'll see you again in the future.

02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:09.300
Thank you.

02:33:09.300 --> 02:33:22.300
So, going around to everybody else. Final thoughts. I'll start. My final thought is I think I'm going to play a little more No Man's Sky before I go to bed tonight and face the week tomorrow.

02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:29.300
And I can't believe time is running out until Dragon Con and there's all this other stuff going on over the next couple weekends.

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:33.300
So, it's going to be a busy couple weeks, so everybody that knows me, please bear with me.

02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:38.300
But I'm very excited for Dragon Con. Very, very excited. Loki, your final thought?

02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:41.300
So, yeah, hopefully I'll work on my game if my computer doesn't fuck up again.

02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:53.300
Oh, and another bonus to that is I had my bookmarks in Firefox, which a lot of resources for things I was using to research my game engine and everything and all the pages I had open are gone.

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:58.300
Because for some fucking reason they decided that, hey, we're going to keep all your files in the same spot.

02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:01.300
Oh, except for your bookmarks. Fuck those, we decided to delete them.

02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:08.300
Because they were there before, because I backed them up and now they're fucking gone. Because fuck you, we're Windows and we'll do fucking one.

02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:09.300
No more porn for you.

02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:10.300
Fuck your bookmarks.

02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:16.300
Oh, porn. God, that's all in my head. I'm talking about like, you know, no one needs shit.

02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:21.300
How am I going to remember Pornhub? That's going to be so hard for me to remember that website.

02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:26.300
I mean, porn is just dumb. Who needs bookmarks for porn?

02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:27.300
The good shit.

02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:33.300
Please. It's a fucking buffet that's ever-changing all the time. We don't need a good shit.

02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:35.300
A buffet full of crap.

02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:39.300
Alright. And last but not least, Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.

02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:41.300
Cheesecake.

02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:49.300
