Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, could you soon be playing PlayStation games on your PC and legally? Sure looks like it. Of course, there's always a weak slim PS4 if that doesn't work. We talk about this news and much more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight. Episode number 656 for this, August the 28th of 2016.

00:44.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining you from lovely Sacramento, California Studio N7 with my co-hosts here in studio and all of you in our chat room around the world.

00:56.000 --> 01:09.000
Live.vognetwork.com but here in studio by my side as she always is and would never leave me for an extended period of time. Not on purpose. Is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Bitch I brought you cookies.

01:09.000 --> 01:22.000
You did. Oh my gosh. She brought me cookies. They're the best cookies I've ever put in my mouth. And I've been thinking about, you know, maybe I should try to lose some weight before like GamerX and Final Fantasy Fan Fest.

01:22.000 --> 01:35.000
That's why I'm doing this now so we have a month. Get it out of your system Rob. And then also, well, Alan has also, I don't know if you know, but he's lost quite a bit of weight and was, you know, was kind of humble bragging a little bit the other day about how he's lost weight.

01:35.000 --> 01:47.000
I've decided I'm going to call him Alan Aska. Because of the hair. And no listeners are going to understand. In fact, Alan probably won't even understand. Because of the hair. It's Alaska hair.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
And if you are listening live, you can join our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and Rover Desk starting us off tonight wanting to know where are our cookies.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Come get them.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Actually, when you visit vognetwork.com, I think we put a cookie in your browser.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
But it's not one of those like skeezy kinds that you read about. It's just to remember like that you're logged into the site. So you can check in and get your points and all that good stuff.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Hint, hint.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Check in.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
That's right. Sign up for the, it's free. We don't spam you. We just, you know, like to be able to tell potential people to come on the network and partner with like look at all these engaged users we have because that does go a long way.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
So, all right. Say hello, of course, to Techmaster Loki.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Hi.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm okay.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Are you, now is that Slurpee your dinner? Because usually you bring dinner to the show with you because, you know, we're right about dinner time, but tonight you just brought a Slurpee.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, because I made food like I had lunch at like four or so.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh, I thought maybe you were on the Slurpee diet and I was like, that's my kind of diet.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Slurpee diet?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
That's not a bad idea.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I don't think I'd lose any weight from that, but very unhealthy.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It would sure be fun trying.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
It's like fast track to diabetes. Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I know, right? Oh my gosh.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
So anyhow, here we are assembled in studio and as I referenced a minute ago, Dark Soccer is actually going to be taking a hiatus in the show.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
She doesn't want to, but you know, some things are more important than OLR, including jobs that pay bills.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So Dark Soccer is going to be taking some time off for about a couple months.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm going to do my best to get, you know, some Sundays off when I can.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And I told her she needs 20 November off.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, of course.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Because that is like a DDR holiday.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
And if we stay on track, that's going to line up with episode 666 of our show, which is going to be hilarious.

03:39.000 --> 03:50.000
Well, the one thing is that I've already requested like pretty much the rest of my time off until the end of September for GamerX.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Right, right.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
So it's going to be really difficult for me to take time.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Apparently, Alan says I'm going to I was offered my own podcast on TBS and I'm going rogue.

04:00.000 --> 04:12.000
I think there's a reference to Samantha Bee when she, you know, she kind of went off to do her own thing and she she's kind of doing better than the people she left behind at Comedy Central with all with all respect to Trevor Noah and all that Samantha Bee's kind of on fire.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Well, there are podcasts in the planning, but I would never do anything that wouldn't be vog material.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Well, I do I do like four podcasts.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I want to do another one.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
One of the podcasts isn't even on vog.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I want to do another one because I think that you guys need more of me.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Well, we can speaking of more of me, I'm having more cookies.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
All right.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
You go in and you go ahead. You get those cookies.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Go for it.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
We are, of course, saying, you know, temporary hiatus, dark soccer.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
I do want to mention, since we brought up conventions, there may be some folks checking out this show for the first time because of Dragon Con, which we're going to be at.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, I'm going to be at next week in Atlanta.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Of course, I think this is the 30th year of Dragon Con.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a very long running convention.

04:58.000 --> 05:07.000
They get tons of I kind of I try to describe it to people as like Comic Con of the south, but without the Hollywood like it's like pretty much all fan driven.

05:07.000 --> 05:19.000
And my understanding more and more, especially as I talk to more cosplayers, is that it's really becoming known as like a cosplay like like bring your a game of cosplay to Dragon Con and lots of great stuff comes out of that.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
In fact, I did my first and only cosplay at Dragon Con last year, which sadly I'm not bringing back this year, but it was fun last year.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
So I have we have that and some folks we will be you can catch me as a presenter at the Parsick Awards on Sunday night.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
We're actually we have our pal at Pod Culture.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Pals at Pod Culture are nominated for their spinoff show, TARDIS interrupt us.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
They are actually nominated this year.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
That's very exciting.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
But we're presenting a different award, obviously conflict of interest.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
We're presenting a different award at the show.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So that's really cool that we're involved there.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Our pals at Critical Myth and British Invaders are all over the TV related tracks.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Brit track, of course, for British invaders and some of the television related tracks for Critical Myth.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
They have some panels.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
We're going to be compiling all that over at VOG Network dot com in this coming week.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So you guys know where to catch us at Dragon Con.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That's very exciting.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And then we will also be Dark Soccer.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Myself will be at Gamer X4, which I'm now hearing is supposed to be the last one.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I guess is I feel like they say that every year.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
They say that every year it's going to be the last one.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Then suddenly there's another one.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But regardless, I hope it's not.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
But regardless, we have fun every year we go.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So we're gonna be there again this year and we will.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
In fact, they we just we just wrote the check this past week.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
We will have a table once again where you can come say hello to us there at the festival.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
And possibly get condoms.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And I mean, yes, that's a whole nother side story.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Dark Soccer got a donation for Gamer X.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
You know what they gave her?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
A big box of condoms.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Condoms, Rose. Condoms, condoms, condoms.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
This is why you don't go to like one of those family planning clinics for free donations.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
So we'll be making balloon animals at our table over at VOG Network at GX4.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And then go fuck yourself.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Here you go.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And then I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest, which I know is a lot more niche.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
But I do really enjoy Final Fantasy 14.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So I I made sure to get tickets to that event.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
So I'm excited to go to that.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
I know that's and if you didn't get tickets to it, you're not going to because it's sold out a long time ago.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
But there is Mag Fest if you want to look forward to 2017.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
So I have a lot of cons coming up in the next few months.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
It's like I've had a con drought and now I'm going to I'm going to be fucking sick of conventions by the time Mag Fest is over.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Although that's not going to be true.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I love Mag Fest.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So I'm just very excited for the coming months.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So I look forward to seeing you all.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Anyhow, we need to get into some gaming talk.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
I want to talk about our gaming weeks as well as what's going on in the gaming news.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
But we like to usually start off with a kickoff topic, something to kind of get us started here with what's going on.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So, Loki, you've got a report here.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Could you tell us about this here about what's going on with PlayStation Plus?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Obviously, this is getting a lot of social media buzz this week.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
So PlayStation Plus, they've decided to bring it to the PC.

08:08.000 --> 08:18.000
So along with bringing the service there, they're also bringing this USB controller adapter so you don't have to be wired into the PC with it.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Which is nice, I guess.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
But does this mean we're not getting backwards compatibility for the PlayStation games?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Because it's like, but PlayStation now?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
You want to sign up for it still?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Because I don't want to sign up for it still.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
I don't fucking give a crap about it on the PlayStation, let alone on PC.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Ooh, I can play the classic games.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, I'd rather just have the games I bought already work on it.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
I wonder how that service is doing.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
I wonder if the numbers are not where Sony was hoping for them to be, which might be part of the reason why they're putting it on PC.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
But at the end of the day, even if PlayStation Now is doing very, very well, why not expand your audience?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Hell, it works for Netflix, right?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Why is Netflix so popular? Probably because it's on every single stinking device that's out there.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
I think it'd be cooler if it was on smart TVs or something like that.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I think it'd be neat if it was on Xbox One.

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
So, since I never used the PlayStation Now service, is that the ones for just the old PlayStation games?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Well, by old, we mean PlayStation 3.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
You know, it's a PC app, and if they developed it for the Windows Store, which I really don't think they'd ever get past them,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
it could be a universal app, which they could be playable on the PlayStation, or Xbox One.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I'd be interested if they had the Vita stuff.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh, okay. Well, yeah, because I'm thinking, you know, one thing that Sony did try to do is that they have the Vita TV.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
This is the PlayStation TV in the U.S.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
But it played Vita games, some of them, which was a weird thing to begin with.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
But then it also was, hey, you can hook in PlayStation Now right into your TV, right?

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Just because there's a few games that I think I would want to play.

10:07.000 --> 10:17.000
But, I mean, we actually have our PS3 still hooked up, because for some reason our PS4 doesn't like our sound system,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
so we've never been able to get it to work with our Blu-rays.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
And we've got a really good Harman Kardon system in the house, so.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah. I do like the fact that there's such a huge library on PlayStation Now,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
so I do feel like, wow, I could catch up with all these games.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
But in a way, I mean, one of the reasons why I haven't gone for it is that I'm worried it's almost overload.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
It would be like so many games, and, you know, I'm already bad when it comes to gamer ADD.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
It's like, you know, I play one thing for a week, and then it's like, ooh, shiny, something else is out.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I guess.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
It's part of the reason I'm almost happy that Final Fantasy XV got delayed,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
because maybe I actually will get to the center of the game.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
When I've seen the PlayStation Now, like, they have the library available,

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
like, you can see what's available on their service, and it's not really anything I want to play.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And I just don't see the...

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It isn't everything. That's a very important point.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And I think it's stupid, like, come on, you guys.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
I mean, yeah, I understand you're really trying to push the service because you can see money being made on it,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
but no one wants it. No one wants that service.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
They just want you to do backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Now, granted, I understand the PlayStation 2 might be a little bit more difficult to do,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
but come on, the PSP plays PlayStation 1 games.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
You can't tell me that the PlayStation 4, this powerhouse of, like, a PC,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
can't possibly emulate PlayStation 1 games.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Like, a really shitty cell phone can emulate PlayStation 1 games.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I do feel a little bit like, as a consumer or whatever,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
that it would be really nice if I had a PlayStation 3 disc,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
which I still have many PlayStation 3 games,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I could put it in my PlayStation 4 and I could play that game on PlayStation Now.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Like, you know, clearly that technology is available,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
so I just don't understand why I guess I can't do it.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Maybe they're worried about piracy or something,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
where people could fake discs that have the ID or something.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Maybe that's what they're concerned about.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That's why I feel like it's double dipping.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
But that's a lot of trouble just to play a PlayStation 3 game.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
That's a lot of trouble.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Oh, to make a fake game or whatever?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Yeah, but a hacker's gonna hack, Loki. It'll happen.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
No one's gonna do that for PlayStation Now.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
You don't think so?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't think it's worth it.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Well, it doesn't matter because it's not a thing anyway.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
For whatever reason, that's not what Sony's doing.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But, yeah, I don't know.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
It's just like, I'm sorry, but Microsoft's kicking their ass

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
as far as backwards compatibility support.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Granted, they don't have three systems to support,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
but they're supporting the Xbox 360, which is, I think, pretty decent.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
That's better than PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
And, I don't know, it seems pretty awesome.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah, again, it would be nice if, you know,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
even as a PlayStation Plus subscriber,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
if I could get one or two games on PlayStation Now or something.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Well, here's the rub on that, too.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It's like, oh, yeah, we made it.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
We got an emulator.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
We are able to get these PlayStation 2 games to work on the system,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
but you gotta buy them again.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah, you gotta buy them again.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
It's like, what the hell?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I mean, it's just greed.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Let's get to some comments from our chat room

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Ragenator in chat says,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Sky, it sounds like PlayStation Now on the PC might be good

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
for those like me who no longer have a Sony system for whatever reason.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, there's people out there that don't have a Sony system.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Kind of interesting because that makes me think,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
okay, well, maybe there's people out there that decided to go Microsoft only.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
They're an Xbox household, and they decided not to go with Sony,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
that Xbox One was what they wanted, and so that's what they have,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
and they're not getting both systems.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
What's interesting is that if Sony has PlayStation Now on the PC,

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
it's interesting how like Microsoft and the PC due to Windows 10,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
how those are so tied together.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
So it's almost interesting how Sony kind of fits into that dynamic now

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
is that, well, I guess in a way you don't need a PlayStation 3,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
but you still need a PlayStation 4 to play those games,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
but you wouldn't necessarily need a PlayStation 3 unless,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
well, the games you want to play aren't included in PlayStation Now,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
which is also a distinct possibility.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
And let's also talk about the other thing about PlayStation Now is the cost.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
It's $20 a month, or, oh, I'm sorry, $45 for three months

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
if you want to do it that way.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
That's fucking expensive, especially when you have like Netflix and stuff

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
that's like eight bucks, and this isn't like brand new games either.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, I don't know.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I don't know where the right price is because then I'm thinking,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
well, Loki, a new game costs 60 bucks.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
And I know these are not new games,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
but many of them were 60 bucks when they came out.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
So in that regard, I'm kind of like, actually, the price doesn't seem awful,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
but maybe if there was just a few more of the big, big, big titles in there,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
or heck, maybe if they started doing some of the PlayStation 4 stuff,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
because I would imagine it's capable of doing PlayStation 4 stuff as well

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
with the whole streaming thing,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
maybe it would make the pot a little sweeter, I don't know.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
So, let's see, more comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Let's see, Raginator says maybe the PlayStation 4 can't do PlayStation 1 games

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
due to the differences in chipsets.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah, but if it can do PlayStation 2 games at this point,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
they've figured it out.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
If it can do PlayStation 2, it can do PlayStation 4.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
It's not even chips anymore.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's not running off of native hardware.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It's running off of an emulator.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Come on.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
I mean, the PlayStation Portable was not native hardware either,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
but that was able to run PlayStation 1 games.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
What is the deal here?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't understand.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And then SGA100Matt points out in chat,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
they have those humble PlayStation bundles this week with PlayStation 3 games.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
That's a really good point.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I haven't really looked into this week's bundle,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
but would I necessarily want to get that

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
because my PlayStation 3 isn't really hooked up anymore.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
There's some PlayStation 4 games in there.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I might still do it for charity, but you know.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, and also it's Capcom,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and there's some PlayStation 4 games in there as well.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh, that's good. That's good.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
So there's a handful of those.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
But wouldn't it be nice if I bought something like that,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
then the stuff that is on PlayStation 3 is enabled in PlayStation Now,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and I can go play those things,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
because that's the way it works on Microsoft's side essentially.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I mean, it doesn't stream on Microsoft's side,

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
but the nice thing about my Xbox One is that every other week

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
it's I have this little present in my games inventory

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
of something I played on Xbox 360.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Because you invested all that money in,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
and they're keeping it with you,

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
but now you have these other companies,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Nintendo, PlayStation.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh, and PlayStation, it's kind of surprising

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
because they've been so good about this whole cross-buy thing

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
for like the longest time now,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
and now they're kind of going back on it.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
Well, yeah, these are different because they're on PlayStation 4 now,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and you have to re-buy these PlayStation 2 games.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
It's stupid. It really is.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
S2100Matt says, yeah, Microsoft got blasted

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
for their backwards compatibility when the system was announced.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Now they're doing it better than Sony right now,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
and I would agree.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
Microsoft is essentially kind of a model for backwards compatibility.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Now, it would have been nicer if this was there when the system launched

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
and if maybe it was more games at a time,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
especially if it had been like a good big large chunk of them

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
all at once in the beginning.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
But you can't alter the past, so I feel like...

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
At least they're working on it.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
At least they're working on it.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Versus Sony, who's just radio silence.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Or wants you to subscribe for this thing for 20 bucks a month.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
So, yeah, I think I really think Sony ought to think about

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
maybe at least if they're hurting for PlayStation Now or whatever,

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
let people play at least the stuff they bought digitally on PlayStation 3.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Let them use PlayStation Now for that stuff on their PlayStation 4.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
And heck, maybe that would get the thing installed on people's computers,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
well, on their computers now with the PC or their PlayStation 4,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
and maybe it would make them curious to perhaps jump in

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
and spend the 20 bucks a month to get all the games unlocked.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
So, just something to think about.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
I think if I were Sony, I would really want to give some thought

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
to this backwards compatibility

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
and how essentially Microsoft's doing it better right now.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So, let's see.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Also in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Kossen wants to point out the Humble Bundle has Okami HD and Strider,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
so it's worth looking into.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Strider was a PlayStation Plus game at one point, though, if I'm not mistaken.

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
So, I think a lot of people already have that, but it was still a good game.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It doesn't take away from the fact that if you missed it somehow,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
now is a good time to get it.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Let's see.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Also, Raginator says, well, I can tell you this, Sky.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
If Super Stardust HD is on the PC version of PlayStation Now, sold.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Take my money.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I feel like that ought to be.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
All the Sony first and second party stuff is on there, right?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I like the PlayStation 3 things, yeah.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah, I don't see why Super Stardust HD isn't in there.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean, double check, but I think, Raginator, you might have some luck there.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
It ought to be in there.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Is it going to be worth 20 bucks a month, though, to play that one game?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, of course, granted, you're going to have access to a ton of other games as well.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, and on top of that, it's like, okay.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Still, I don't like the fact that I have to still stream this stuff,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
because I have bandwidth.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I mean, if my wife is watching Netflix or something,

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
streaming a game to my PC and Netflix, thank God I don't have bandwidth caps.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
It's just kind of unreasonable, I think.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
Just enable this to be downloaded to my PC, or not my PC, but my PlayStation 4,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
and be done with it.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I don't understand what the big deal is.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Fifth Dream actually linked us to a resource, a good old Wikipedia,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
that actually lists all of the PlayStation Now games.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
They have it also on their own site, too.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Of course they do. I'm sure they do.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But isn't Wiki awfully convenient?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
As I think so.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Let's see, and Super...

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Actually, I don't see Super Stardust HD in here.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Interesting. I would have assumed that was a given.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Unless I'm not looking for the right name.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Star... There's a game called Stealth Bastard Deluxe.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I've never heard of that one.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
That's like the best name ever.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, I know, right?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Well, unless the game is being a stealth bastard,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
it is not actually on the list.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That actually kind of surprised me.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Huh.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Alright, JD also points out Wikipedia is often better formatted

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
than publisher websites, lol.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, it's very low bandwidth, which sometimes makes it easier.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's not so bloated as a website.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
and the types of things that we've been playing this week.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And then we'll come back and cover some other news.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
So, our gaming week, Stark Sakura.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
How was your gaming week?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Danganronpa 2 and Sims 4.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And a little Pokemon Go.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I've also started playing this game called Capitals.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
It's sort of like a cross between Go and Scrabble.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Not Pokemon Go, but the ancient game.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah, board game Go.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
Where you have to surround your enemy's base by forming words

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
and you encroach on their area by pushing your word barrier out closer to them.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
So you take over somebody's territory through words.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yes.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Sounds like your kind of game.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Well, it's pretty cool.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
I've been enjoying it and I got to use one of the alternative spellings of yogurt.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
The one with the H in it because it's in the Scrabble dictionary.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Very good.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
JD in chat says, I've heard about Capitals.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I'm mad it's not available for Android yet.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
So I guess it's not.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Get a real system.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Oh, stop.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
All right.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Let's see.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
J.D. points out the developer also made Tiny Tower a while ago.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Oh, that's a nimble bit game.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Oh, okay.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Go, that game was huge when it first came out, the Tiny Tower.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And then they had the Star Wars Tower.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Right.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
And then they've done some other games that are really good, too.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
It has a very unique retro style to the graphics.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Does this game have that, too?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
The retro style?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
It's very simple.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
It doesn't really need any of that.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I see.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
It's just tiles and letters and there's really not much to it.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Fair enough.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
But you should play it with me.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I'll think about it.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Okay.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Apparently Neil played it for a while.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Oh, really?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
But he hasn't responded to me challenging him.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yes.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
He's running away.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Sometimes happens.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
You sign up for a game and then it's like you see, oh, all these friends are playing.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, wait, they stopped playing after the first week.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
How dare they?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
How very dare they?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
That happens.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
All right.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
So, I played more No Man's Sky and it's pretty boring.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
What a glowing review.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I know.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
There's not really a storyline.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
It's just like, oh, hey, here's this place.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Okay, cool.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
You go to this warehouse, you'll learn new technology.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Okay.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
That's it?

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
I mean, it's like, it's basically the same as what I'm normally doing.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
And seriously, fuck you, this stupid space combat thing.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
That thing can go fuck itself with like a spiky run.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I hate space combat.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I just like, I just say, oh, I'm going to get attacked.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
I'm going back to the planet.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Yeah, but then they attack you once you leave the planet.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
That's why I pulse jump out of there as soon as I get out of there.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Like, fuck you.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
I'm out of here.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
You're going to attack me?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm going to jump.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Okay, bye.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Smart.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
So, yeah, their combat is just, it's god-awful.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It's seriously awful.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
But I ended up on like another planet now.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
I jumped another system and it's like this rainbow jungle planet now.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Cool.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
It's kind of cool.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
With lots of water.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
And then what else?

24:06.000 --> 24:15.000
Oh, I've been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go and then tap my Katamari.

24:15.000 --> 24:24.000
I've stopped playing because their game froze up, so I shut it down, restarted it, freezes

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
on the restart, cleared the cache, restarted again, still freezing.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
So, I was like, fuck, I got to just reinstall this thing.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
So, uninstalled it, reinstalled it, my progress is gone.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I'm like, fuck you, Namco, I'm gone.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Didn't you cheat in that game anyway?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
It doesn't matter.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
You had it coming.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
You had it coming.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I did not have it.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Karma sucks.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I did not have it fucking coming.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Yes, you did.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
No, I didn't.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
You got banned.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
You're the first person to get banned from Katamari.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I didn't get fucking banned from that stupid game.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Good riddance, though.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
It's a fucking waste of time.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
This is the second time in your life Katamari's given you trouble.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
It's, no, it's their stupid programming.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
It's because they assign an ID to your game through Google Play services or whatever,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
and it's on every install.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
They reassign you an ID.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Instead of it assigning you the same fucking ID that you had before,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
like every other fucking game would have.

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
Like, oh my God, if Ingress or Pokemon Go or something just stops fucking working,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
and oh shit, I got to reinstall the app, I load back in there,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
and oh, hey, look, there's my account because I'm signed into a goddamn online service

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
that saves my progress.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Bo, but fucking Namco Bandai, who can't fucking program shit, decides,

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
hey, we're just going to store all that locally to this specific ID.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Bo, but when you reinstall the app, because it's going to fuck up,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
because our shit is fucking broken anyways,

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
because they're fucking ads that they have break the game when you try to run them.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh, and then they have free candy offers that never fucking work anyways.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So let's add that in there on top of all this shit.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
So their buggy-ass fucking game that's constantly broken

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
and fucking reassigns a new fucking ID when I reinstall it.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So you know what, that's it, that's good,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
because I was looking for an excuse to get rid of it, and I'm done.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
I don't think anyone on the entire internet has gotten us upset

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
about Tap My Katamari issue, Loki, congratulations.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Wait, don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Just tell us how you really feel.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
It's stupid, it's a stupid game, so I'm done playing it, I'm free now.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
It was a complete time waster, there was no point to the game whatsoever,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
yet for some stupid reason, I kept playing it, and I'm done.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm done, I'm done, I'm not going back.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
You've had it officially.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
I had it.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Unless they want to fix that shit, then yeah, I'll go back after it's fixed,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
but you know, it's just, it was just stupid.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Alright, anything else in your gaming week?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
No, that was it.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Nothing more pleasant, nothing you had a good time with?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Alright, my gaming week.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, okay, so a few weeks ago on the show, somebody called in to talk about this.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I think it was our pal Brad from Pod Culture.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
So I'm going to actually recommend this one to you, Loki,

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
because it's kind of like a tap game, like one of those cookie-clicker games,

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
but it's not by Bandai Namco, so already it's okay.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
It's called Nonstop Night, like Night with a K,

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
and you play this little, like, it looks like a Diablo-esque kind of game,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
but it doesn't play like one at all, because it's a cookie-clicker type of game,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
but instead of tapping the screen repeatedly,

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
your little knight just endlessly runs through the dungeon slaughtering monsters,

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
and you can use buttons to do little skills, or what, you like buy different upgrades,

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
and I don't know, there's other stuff too, but it's got that same formula of,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
ooh, the numbers get bigger, it's addicting, and oh, I ascended,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
so I'm going to reset everything back to one.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It's like the exact same fucking formula,

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
but it's more of an automated hack-and-slash type of thing.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
No, I'm just not going to do it anymore.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
You're done?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm just done.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
It's too bad too, because it was a good time waster when I had a few minutes and stuff,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
and I was enjoying it.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Granted, yeah, I exploited stuff where I could, but who cares?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
What's it matter? It's basically a single-player game.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Okay, so they have online leaderboards, but who gives a shit?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
That's just how long you play the stupid game.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
All right, so I've been playing that a little bit,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
and your talk about Katamari made me think of that,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
because it's kind of a similar-esque type of game,

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
and I thought maybe I'm sure Brad's out there listening,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
and I see him in chat saying nonstop knight would probably get a kick out of the fact

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
that I actually did go download the game, and I've been playing it.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
So let's see, what else have I been playing on my gaming week?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I've still been playing a lot of World of Warcraft,

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
because I didn't really play the last expansion hardly.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
I somehow got a character up to level 98.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't remember Draenor at all.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
So thanks to this whole thing with the Legion expansion is launching next week, right?

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
So they've been doing these invasions in-game that feel a lot like the fates of Final Fantasy XIV to me,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
so it's kind of funny seeing how the MMOs are kind of feeding each other now.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
But through these invasion things, you can really level fast,

29:09.000 --> 29:16.000
and I've leveled a character from level 1 all the way to 95 I think I hit today,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
mostly through these stupid invasion things.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
What side?

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Alliance. It's with the Game Buoy guys.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
All right, well I want to play.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
So do I have to start on that server?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I think you already have a character. It's with the Game Buoy guys.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Oh, it's on our normal one. Okay, duh. Never mind.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah, so I think you're already there.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
I've already got like a 97 on one, so I'll have to play.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Maybe play with Captain Spike and Slidekick and then that's it.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
I just took a little break from it after I did all the Draenor stuff.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Well, and so, you know, obviously I took a long break from it,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
and I don't know what convinced me to come back.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I think just everybody saying, oh, you got to check out the Legion stuff.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I was like, whatever, I'll check.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
And I think I hit a point in Final Fantasy XIV where I was like, I still love a lot about XIV.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
There's so much I really enjoy about it.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
But the deep dungeon wasn't what I thought it would be, I think, which left me a little bit disappointed.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Like, it's not something I really want to grind over and over and over again.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
I thought, I don't know what I was expecting, but it's not, what they have isn't it?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Typical gamer, right?

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
I don't know what I, it's like every review of No Man's Sky.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I don't know what I was expecting, but this sure ain't it.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
Well, let's not be honest. I mean, No Man's Sky was, I still kind of enjoy it a little bit,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
but there's really not a lot there.

30:30.000 --> 30:37.000
It's like, it's just not, the guy seems like, seriously, Sean Murray seems like a fucking second coming to Peter Molyneux.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
It's like fucking Molyneux all over again.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
You watch the interviews again, you're like, oh my God, he's totally Molyneux-ing right there.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Well, I'll say this.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
I have been playing more No Man's Sky as well, and I do still enjoy the game,

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
but I think the element that I enjoy about No Man's Sky probably isn't the plot,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
but it's more that it's the same thing that I find appealing about Minecraft.

30:58.000 --> 31:07.000
It's that very, like, zen, chill, just, I'm gonna kick back on the couch and play this very low-maintenance game

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
that's all about, like, you know, in the case of No Man's Sky, it's about finding pretty things,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
and, oh, I'm on a new planet, and let's, you know, ooh, there's a cave over here, what's this?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Or, ooh, there's a building over here.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Like, I still just kind of get a thrill in the exploration side of things,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
even though when I really step back to think about, like, what's the fucking point of this game?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It's really minimal.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Well, even that, though, it's like, there's not really anything there,

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
because, like, in the caves, I know there's nothing gonna be there in those caves.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
The caves are pretty much useless, because there's nothing hidden inside them.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
All the minerals that you can find in there, you can find out in the surface, so what's the point?

31:42.000 --> 31:49.000
And even exploring the plants and stuff, it's just kind of, all the outposts are the same,

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
like, all the, like, there's only so many, like, space Winnebagos I can walk into,

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
with the chairs tossed over exactly the same way every time.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
It's like, it's just very rinse and repeat.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
And there's not, like, any, like, ooh, this is really different than that last planet.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Ooh, there's some interesting stuff going on.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
There's nothing interesting going on.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
It's just grind, and that's it.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And there's not even really much to grind.

32:16.000 --> 32:24.000
And from what I've seen or heard of the ending, it's just like, eh, fuck it, we just, we're just not gonna make one.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Ziba in chat says,

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
The story is amazing. I'm not sure if that comment's about Final Fantasy XIV or if it's about World of Warcraft.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
I'm assuming it's about Final Fantasy XIV, and I think that is an important point,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
is that, you know, if you still haven't played Final Fantasy XIV,

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
you know, even though I'm talking about, oh, I kind of, I'm kind of burned out on it a little bit,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
keep in mind, I've been playing for, like, two and a half years.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Like, you know, and you just kind of hit a point where you've been playing a game long,

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
well, actually, no, the game's coming out on its third birthday, so I guess three years straight.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
Sorry, I'm laughing because Loki's yawning, and his tongue is completely blue from that slurpee.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
It is so delicious.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I can't help but laugh, anyway.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Where was I? Sorry.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Horrible when this is a radio show and you guys can't see it, but trust me, it's funny.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
Okay, so Final Fantasy XIV, if you still have yet to play Final Fantasy XIV, especially Heavensward,

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
like, I realize it's gated because you have to play through all of Realm Reborn,

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
which in itself is a good experience, but I know some people get really turned off by the mandatory dungeons.

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
But, man, I'm telling you, the story in Heavensward is easily, like, one of the top three stories

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
in the entirety of the Final Fantasy series.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
Like, it's the best. For me, it's my favorite since Final Fantasy VI.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
Some people would take issue that I'm not giving seven or ten, enough credit, or even eight.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
But, for me, it's, like, seriously the best story in the series in a very long time.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Heavensward is mind-blowing amazing.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
Just for me, the patches and the follow-up on Heavensward haven't quite been there for me like Realm Reborn was.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm not sure what that X-factor is that's missing for me.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
Maybe the fact that they're only doing two dungeons instead of three, so you get really burned out on the roulettes real quick.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I think that might be part of it. I don't know.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
Anyway, so, let's see, other comments in chat.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream says,

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
I'm on a Lisa Frank planet now, talking about No Man's Sky, full of neon rainbow plants.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
I'm in Trapper Keeper land. That's awesome.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I don't know if I'd ever leave that place. That sounds amazing.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
So, anyway, William Murderface asks,

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Sky, did you play before a Realm Reborn hit about Final Fantasy XIV?

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
Yes, I did, but not for very long because it was terrible.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
I actually, I played the Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 alpha?

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
No, beta. I think it was just the beta at that point.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
And even early on in the beta, I was worried.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I was like, I don't know about this.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
But I ended up buying the game anyway and I played it and I was like,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
they've made some real shit decisions with this game.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Yeah, 1.0 was really, really bad.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
I understand 1.0 got better after Naoki Yoshida took over.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
It was planning a Realm Reborn.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
That 1.0 got really good towards the end, but I wasn't really around to see that.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
But I was there in the early days of 1.0 and I just,

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
God, like the maps were awful.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I don't know if you remember what the shroud used to look like.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
It looked like a piece of fucking graph paper.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
That's what the maps were, it was awful.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
But anyway, the game's great now.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
A Realm Reborn fixed everything.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
It's truly a legendary story in video games,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
just how turned around they made that game.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
It's pretty crazy.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I haven't played an awful, awful lot outside those,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
what are becoming mainstay games.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
But next week should be pretty exciting with Dragon Con and all.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
And they've got arcades are new this year at Dragon Con.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
They've got two different arcades, a classic gaming one

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
and a Tokyo Attack arcade.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
So they're going to have, really, my two favorite things are going to be there,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
classic gaming and Japanese gaming.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
So I'm pretty happy going into Dragon Con this year.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I'm excited to check it out.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Well, I mean, really, what else is there?

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Because U.S. gaming? Modern U.S. gaming?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
U.S. gaming makes me think of like...

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
It's like Ticket Redemption.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Okay, well, we're not doing those.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
What I'd find in a Dave & Buster's, which, I mean, don't get me wrong,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I like Dave & Buster's, they have some good stuff, but...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Hey, you like cell phone games?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
What if we made those cell phone games on a giant TV?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Exactly, exactly.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Like, I can do without that shit.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't need the cell phone games.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Hey, it's Tap My Katamari.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
But...

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
Yet another racing game, Daytona, whatever.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Just kidding, I'm not really shading.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Raw thrills in the cell phone games.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Yeah, it's pretty much it.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
So, yeah, but no, you know, good point, good point.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I mean, what else is there?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
But I'm just very excited about that.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
So more to come.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Anyway, housekeeping, don't have a lot for you.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I think I've said a million times we're not going to be here next week.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
However, stay tuned to our Twitter at VOG Network for the network,

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
at VOG Network.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
And then also stay tuned for, on our website,

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
because instead of this show being on next Sunday,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
we're trying to set up like a VOG Super Show at Dragon Con

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
that we're going to tape on Friday or Saturday.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
We're still trying to nail down all the details,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
but we're going to tape it one night and then broadcast it

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
where Bobby and this show would usually be on Sunday night.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So you may still have something new to listen to on Sunday,

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
which would be really cool,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
but this show will not be live on the network next week

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
because I'm out of town and it's Labor Day

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
and Dark Soccer and Loki probably want to make the most

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
of the three-day weekend as well.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
But we will be back.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
You don't want to play Sims 4 for three days straight?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
No, I don't get a weekend anymore.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Oh, yeah, your schedule. Sorry.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh, my God. I do have Labor Day also.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
You know what you should do? Quit.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Do you know what they pay me? No.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm just kidding. I'm just giving you crap.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Well, I hope you're able to enjoy what you can.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Anyway, but we will be back in two weeks.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
And here's the great part.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
So when we come back, it will be September 11th,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
which is Loki's birthday.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Yes, it is.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So Loki's birthday show.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
And we're also trying to ramp up the interview thing.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
I think I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I don't remember if I did or not,

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
but Dark Soccer not being here is going to leave some big shoes to fill.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
So we're going to be trying to get some more interviews

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
in the coming months.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
How are you calling your feet big?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Just, well, I don't know.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Is that a bad thing if I call your feet big, Dark Soccer?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I don't have big feet.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Like for guys, it's a compliment when you say you have big feet

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
because, you know, big feet means...

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
Big twat.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
I don't think you have your anatomy lessons quite correctly.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
No, that's not the kind of twat I was talking about. Thank you.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Wow.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
That's not the delivery I was expecting, but okay.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
Anyway, so how do you transition?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
How do you transition from big twat?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Easy, easy, easy.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
Well, I was going to say, since we're going to go on a tangent here anyway,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I just thought it'd be fun.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Have you seen, now I can't remember off the top of my head,

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
and I'm going to look up while I'm talking about it real quick.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Have you seen this thing that uses like an emulator,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
but it's like a WarioWare type of thing?

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
So it's a bunch of classic games and like little bits and pieces of them

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
that you're playing all together.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
No.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
It's pretty awesome. Like, I saw this on Destructoid,

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
and they had, it's basically, I don't know if it's like within MAME or something,

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
but they had like, okay, whoever is in first in this level of Mario Kart,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
you know, after like ten seconds gets going,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
and the next level is like, okay, kill this other person in like a fighting game.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
Okay, next one is like, you know, defeat the other person in this like puzzle game.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
It's like ten seconds of things are, catch the most fish in this like Atari 2600 game.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Okay, that sounds rad, actually.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Okay, where can I get this again?

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
I'm looking it up right now. It's called Multibull.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Okay, I like this.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, Multibull. It's a two player thing where you can compete against snippets of emulated games.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Now, it's not multitasking though, right?

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Because that's a patent pending thing from YYR.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
No, this is just old, this is emulator games.

40:09.000 --> 40:16.000
So like, for example, they've got, they have Wild Guns in there versus Excitebike, Super Mario Kart.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
There's some other stuff.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
Apparently, it's a collaboration between Bennett Foddy, who did QWOP,

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
and Alec Thompson, who did Be Glitched,

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
and they're going to be doing as part of a couple different festivals,

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
including XOXO Festival in Portland on September 1st, or I'm sorry, in September 9th,

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
and some festival in Austin on the 1st.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Alright, festival game. Sounds like fun.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Alright, before we get into other gaming news for this week,

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
let me tell you about, so we got on a tangent when we had the big feet reference,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
but obviously Dark Soccer is going to leave a space on the show that will not be easy to fill,

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
but we're going to be inviting some guests on over the coming weeks.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
You know, because we were doing interviews for a while,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
and then we just kind of fell out of it, so I've been really trying to get some people to come back on the show.

41:05.000 --> 41:11.000
So on September 11th, Gabe from the Sacramento IGDA is going to be here,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
because his game Crumple is just about ready to go,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
so he's going to tell us a little more about that game, and then we'll talk about that.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
Also coming up in September, Aethernaut is going to be here.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Aethernaut is a chiptune musician that is going to be at GamerX4.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
He was at the very first GamerX, and if you haven't heard Aethernaut's stuff, he's awesome.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
He kind of combines the chiptune stuff with violin, so it's really cool.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
So he'll be here in September.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And I saw, was it this week?

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
It was set in the arcade not this year, but last year.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Monsters and Monocles finally released.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
That just came out, yeah.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I follow one of the devs on Twitter, probably the same one you do.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
So definitely go check that out if you guys see it.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Yeah, have them on the show.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Have them on September, October. It'll be great.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Alright.

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
I've still been trying to hear from the people that are doing the Office game.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
I've messaged them and hadn't heard anything, but I'd love for them to be on the show, even when I'm not here.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Even if you're not here.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Even if I'm not here.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I'm going to invite you to this party at somebody else's house.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
By the way, not all these.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
Gabe will be here in person, but we'll be certainly doing a lot of interviews over Skype and so forth as we usually have.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
And I see in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, RageNator says,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
if and when you need someone on the show to fill in, I'll volunteer.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
We're not really looking actually for guest hosts right now.

42:30.000 --> 42:38.000
Just more people that are designing games or gaming culture contributions, those types of things, to come on and talk to us about it.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
Because it's always fun to hear about what's going on out there.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Besides just the AAA stuff.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Obviously we're not going to have the devs of Final Fantasy XV on this show, I'm sorry to say.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
But everybody kind of already knows about all that stuff.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
So we like to dig a little deeper and talk about some games maybe you haven't heard about.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
So we'll have that to look forward to in a few months.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
MXC in chat says, what about Cap President?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Still working on that.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
So I'm hoping we'll have something to announce when we come back.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
For Loki's birthday on September 11th.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
In two weeks.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Show on your birthday.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
We have a lot of shows on big days this year.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
We have a show on 20 November.

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
Sadly if we hadn't missed so many shows, 666 was originally going to be on my birthday.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Which is perfect, but you know.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Speaking of missing shows, we also will not be here.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
It's worth saying on October 2nd we will not be here.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
That is the week of GamerX.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
So Dark Soccer and I will still be in San Jose and won't be able to make it back in time for the show.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
But we will be here the weekend of Fan Fest because my flight gets back at noon.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
So I'll have time to roll in here and do a show that night.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
That'll be really exciting.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Alright, enough housekeeping talk.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Let's get into some more news.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Gosh darn it, Loki.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
So let's talk more about Playstation.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.000
And hey we talked about that wonderful Playstation now and how they're going to charge you $20 a month for that.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
Well guess what, there's Playstation Plus and that's going up as well.

43:59.000 --> 44:06.000
So they're going to be raising the price of Playstation Plus by $10 up to $60.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
And that's going to be starting in September on the 22nd.

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
So if your subscription expires after that, you'll have to pay $60 to get it.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
And yeah.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
And apparently they say that the reason for that is it brings it up with the current market conditions.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
It's just like, we want more money.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Inflation, we gotta balance the check.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
Well, but here's the thing, it's one of those, is it really a surprise?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Did you not see it coming?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Isn't that what Xbox Live charges?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
It is, yeah.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
So they know they can charge it because it's what people are paying for the competition.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
Honestly, this is one of those things where nobody likes to hear about paying more money, but it makes sense.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
It's also $10 a year that's like a lunch.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Yeah, it's really, it's not that bad.

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
I mean, not that we're encouraging them to bump it up another $10 or whatever, but you know, it's not the end of the world.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Especially considering you do get a pretty good value through Plus.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
Yeah, I stopped doing my Live just because I don't actually use the Xbox really anymore.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
I was doing that just to get the free games off there, but I don't know.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Maybe if I get an Xbox One someday.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
I just, right now, I'm holding off, I guess.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Crackdown's not out yet, and you know.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
It's fair.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Forza Horizon 3 does look pretty awesome.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
It does look awesome.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
But it's just like, you know.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.000
And at this point, I mean, for me, I already have an Xbox One, so this is a moot point, but you know, for you, what about this whole Scorpio thing?

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
And the fact that you know something bigger and better is coming, does it make you want to wait for that?

45:44.000 --> 45:51.000
And on top of that, no, it doesn't make me want to wait for that, but on top of that, it's like, well shit, I'm thinking about building a new PC anyways.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I'll just get it on PC, you know?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah, true.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
What's the point? So, we'll see.

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
I mean, I don't know about the whole Scorpio and PlayStation Neos or whatever.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
It's just, I have to see what the point is of those.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Right.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
I mean, I don't know.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Still worry about PlayStation.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
What are you going to get there that you don't get with the cheaper phone?

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Exactly.

46:13.000 --> 46:25.000
I'm still worried about the PlayStation, you know, VR thing, because I've got to, my gut feeling tells me that it ain't going to run as good as you think it's going to run.

46:25.000 --> 46:32.000
I mean, it's just like, why have that powerful system that's going to support VR, you know, better?

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Bo, but not better, but it's going to be better.

46:35.000 --> 46:42.000
I was looking at my Amazon orders, like what I have, because I didn't want to pre-order the same thing twice, which I did.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
You might remember when I bought Super Mario Maker, I bought two copies on Amazon because I'm an idiot, right?

46:47.000 --> 46:55.000
But, um, so I want to make sure I didn't do that for World of Warcraft because I went on Amazon to get World of Warcraft Legion because they, they, they match the Best Buy program, right?

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Where you get like the discount if you're a Prime member.

46:57.000 --> 47:03.000
So I bought it on Amazon, so I get the discount because I'm not even going to be here when the game comes out anyway, because I'm on my way to Atlantis.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I don't need to be online the very first day.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
It'll be server issues galore anyway.

47:07.000 --> 47:16.000
So anyway, I was in my history making sure that I hadn't already pre-ordered it at some point and I saw the PlayStation VR thing in there and I was like, oh yeah.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
I forgot. I plucked down a lot of money on this thing. I'm about to pluck down a lot of money on this thing.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
And then I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, well, you did just buy a car. Maybe you should just cancel this.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
Is the VR thing going to be really all you hoped? But I didn't do it.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
It's like, yeah, I mean, I didn't do it. I'm still holding on to it, but I thought about it.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm thinking about it as well because it's just like, that's quite expensive. It's like $400.

47:38.000 --> 47:46.000
And what exactly are you getting for that $400? I mean, some gimmicky games that they're going to have out for it?

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
I mean, it's just not a whole lot of like really big, you know, experiences.

47:50.000 --> 47:58.000
Rez is cool, but is it $500 cool? I mean, well, hey, you can play it without VR though.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
So, I mean, I don't know.

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
You know what? I'm going to keep it obviously because once I get rid of it, I probably won't be able to get it back.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
But I also feel like Sony kind of has a chance because we know they're going to be doing something in the next few weeks.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
You know, obviously a lot of these things are leaking out and we'll get into some other stuff in a minute.

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
And then they're expected to talk about whatever this Neo thing is or PS4K or whatever.

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
So I feel like Sony has a chance to get me hyped about VR again and really make me understand,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
yes, I'm going to be fine even if I don't have a Neo.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
And here's the type of awesome things that you just aren't going to be able to live without that aren't just Rez.

48:34.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah. The other thing though that they also announced recently that's been, actually it's already live now, is the two-factor authentication.

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
So, hey, if you have a PlayStation account, might want to turn that on.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
You know, it's a good idea, especially with all those FIFA hacks and shit out there.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah, I know some people that are getting hacked and it's ugly. It is ugly.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
I've got, I switched mine on as soon as I heard about it and yeah.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
Yeah. Two-factor authentication is awesome. I'm surprised it took them this long to get it.

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
Microsoft has one. I don't remember if it's through the Xbox One though. I know I have one on my Microsoft account.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
So I guess that does apply to my Xbox One.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
I have to double check my Steam account to see if it's still, I think it does. I thought I had it through the app.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
Usually, yeah, usually with a lot of these two-factor auths, like kind of once you sign in once, you don't get challenged on a lot.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
That's kind of what happens with Steam. Like as long as you're still on the same computer, same account,

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
it doesn't really ask you for it every single time. But once in a while it'll come up and say, load the app and grant your request.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
I just get a pretty frequently email saying, someone's trying to log into your account.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Do you really?

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
But they're trying to, but it sends the email, you know, they have to do the email confirmation thing.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
And so they can't get in, but you know, they're trying.

49:48.000 --> 49:56.000
I get that all the time on Facebook. Someone keeps trying to get into my Facebook and luckily Facebook has an option where you can say, this isn't me.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Like a lot of the sites are just like, ignore this email, you know, or whatever.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Facebook actually has a thing you can click where it's, this isn't me.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
And I'm hoping it kind of reports the IP or something as somebody who's trying to phish into accounts.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
So, because screw you, it's my Facebook, not yours. Stay out.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
It's like, why would you want to be in my Facebook? It's boring.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
SHG100Matt says, if you have something that is two-factor authentication, use it.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I get lots of people trying to steal my gamertag through social engineering.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
They send me the confirmation code.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Yeah. So two-factor auth is so important.

50:32.000 --> 50:41.000
Like if you're not using it on your email, oh my God, get signed up with it on your email because your email is like tied to so much other stuff.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
So important. You know what I mean?

50:43.000 --> 50:51.000
So, and definitely, you know what I don't, you know what I think doesn't have two-factor auth though that's kind of concerning is my pank.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
But I use like a completely different login and password for my bank than anything else. Like it's totally unique.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
Yeah, my bank still does. They have the two-factor as well, which doesn't make any sense too.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
It's like, you know, when I'm on my mobile app as well, I'm like, this is a little stupid.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
I'm on a mobile app on my phone and you're sending a message to my phone.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
Right, right. Well, somebody could be running it in an emulator or something, you know.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Well, I, it's just like, I mean, come on.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
All right. Let's move on with some other news.

51:23.000 --> 51:30.000
Talking about a big release that people are looking forward to on Sony as well as Microsoft.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Sorry, I have to respond to this comment in chat. Fifth Dream in chat says, oh, Rob Roberts bank account is insecure.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
Free money, guys. Yeah, what's he saying? You can't get blood out of a turnip.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
You might get in there and be surprised. Fine, there's nothing there.

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
If you want to get in there and put money in it, that would be great, but I don't think you're going to find much to dig out.

51:48.000 --> 51:56.000
Anyway, a game that I think a lot of people are looking forward to, no matter if it's Sony or Microsoft, Final Fantasy 15.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
You know, Final Fantasy 15 has been in development for, what, ten years and now two more months, right?

52:01.000 --> 52:09.000
Well, DLC is something that's going to be happening with Final Fantasy 15 and I'm a little bit concerned how that's going to play out.

52:09.000 --> 52:16.000
Because there's a season pass that they're selling that's going to have DLC and there's going to be six add-ons that are covered by the pass.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
But then apparently there's going to be more DLC that is not covered by the pass.

52:21.000 --> 52:33.000
Apparently in an interview with Famitsu, director Hajime Tabata actually was talking about DLC and mentioned that there are DLCs planned out that go beyond just these six.

52:33.000 --> 52:39.000
And there's possibly going to be VR content as well, something that's not even just the Prompto demo that was shown at E3.

52:39.000 --> 52:49.000
Cooking recipes and costumes. And now I'm starting to worry a little bit, like, how much fucking DLC is going to be in this game?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Too much fucking DLC.

52:51.000 --> 52:58.000
I'm starting to worry. I'm like, is the base experience of this game going to justify the high price of the game?

52:58.000 --> 53:06.000
I mean, it's a Final Fantasy game, so that expectation is sort of there. But the more and more I hear about this stuff, I worry.

53:06.000 --> 53:15.000
Now, granted, Final Fantasy X-2 also had DLC, and it was okay. The way they did it in that game, it was handled fine.

53:15.000 --> 53:25.000
So I'm like, okay, I guess if it's not too crazy outside of what they did in, sorry, not X-2, XIII-2. There's too many sequels to numbered games.

53:25.000 --> 53:32.000
If the DLC is handled similar to the way it was in XIII-2, then it probably won't be so bad.

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
But I just, I don't know, I worry about all this stuff. Like, okay, we have to sell a season pass and there's going to be more DLC beyond that.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
Costumes and recipes and all this other stuff. I'm like, how much nickel and diming are they trying to stink and do in this game?

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
I'm a little concerned. What about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com?

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
sg100matt says, do they let you preload the DLC before it goes live? I have no idea.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
5th Dream says, I don't trust season passes anymore. I don't blame you, honestly. Everybody handles it so differently.

54:04.000 --> 54:13.000
And 5th Dream points out Mortal Kombat season 2. And yeah, there was, you know, Mortal Kombat was another one of those games that had a season pass, but then there were characters beyond that, right?

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
So this is like, or outside of that whole thing, right? So I don't blame you.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
So act deft encourages, wait for a sale on the season pass.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
Or wait for the game of the year edition when it comes out in 2017.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I don't know if I can do that for Final Fantasy 15.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Or don't play it.

54:33.000 --> 54:42.000
That's certainly a fair response as well, but you know, Final Fantasy 15, it's a mainline Final Fantasy game. I can't think of one of those I haven't played.

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
I'm pretty hyped about it and I've enjoyed the demos that I've played enough. So, but I'm just, you know.

54:47.000 --> 54:55.000
I think all I played, like I skipped 12. I played some 13 when I borrowed it from you and nothing else of it because it just wasn't interesting.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
12 is really good though. The HD remix will be definitely worth checking out when that comes out.

55:00.000 --> 55:07.000
I have like the collector's edition that came with the book and the tin and the nice initial game. I might sell it.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
It's Balthier and Fran. It'll change your life. I'm telling you.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I'll just go back and play 5.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
They're awesome.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
5 is the best.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Really? 5?

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I like 5. Actually, my favorite is 3.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
I like the battle. Oh, 3 is one of my least favorites.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
No, the Japanese 3.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
No, I know. It's one of my least. Well, I would never say that.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Because it had the big job system in it.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
You know, I know.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Which I really thought was, it was a big innovator.

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
I liked the battling in 5, but I felt the story was really weak compared to...

55:37.000 --> 55:43.000
But it is, it does have the tough task of being sandwiched between 4 and 6, which are like the two best stories in the entire series.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
So, it's hard to live up to that. But, I don't know.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
I will say that, I mean, story-wise, I'd put 6 as being the top for a story.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Although, the story in 5 was really good.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
That and, you know, playing fun fan translations where his name was Butt.

55:58.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah. I remember, that was like the first big ROM translation that was out there. It was such a big deal when that happened.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
Although, I will go out on a limb and say that Seiken Densetsu 3 was still better than just about any of the Final Fantasy games.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
To be honest.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And, to this day, still nothing official with that.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Nope.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
To this day. Anyway.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
Alright, so that's the DLC in Final Fantasy XV.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
I just, it'll be interesting to see what happens when this game comes out in a couple months.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
I'm dying to see these reviews when they start coming out.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I just, I hope it's good. I hope it's good.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Well, we do have some more Final Fantasy news.

56:33.000 --> 56:44.000
In the wake of all of the Final Fantasy XV announcements and World of Final Fantasy, there is a new Dissidia Final Fantasy that's going to be coming out.

56:44.000 --> 56:52.000
It's going to be not like the other Dissidia games where it was a fighting game.

56:52.000 --> 56:59.000
It will be called Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia and it is a JRPG style game.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
It's done by Team Ninja, actually.

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
So, I looked at it. It looks pretty neat. I mean, for mobile, it's not bad.

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
It will be out in Japan later this year. Nothing about any type of international release, but you know it's going to happen.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
So, there's a trailer out for it. I would say look for it.

57:20.000 --> 57:29.000
It's interesting. It has that whole sort of look that the Final Fantasy III mobile had.

57:29.000 --> 57:40.000
So, I don't know. It remains to be seen, but then again, there's not much that you can do wrong with anything made by Team Ninja.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
Except maybe Metroid, other Z, other M.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
That doesn't exist in my universe, so I haven't involved it.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
I throw unnecessary shade at that game. Actually, I think it's better than most people give it credit for.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Unnecessary?

57:54.000 --> 58:02.000
No, I think that game is better than most people give it credit for, but it just wasn't Super Metroid. That's the problem.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
There is a Moogle in VV and Cloud and that makes me happy.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
And what's his face with the tail?

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
Oh my god, Y'shtola's in it.

58:12.000 --> 58:19.000
What, they probably just bring the best out of all the... It's probably the same characters that show up in theater.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
Well, I was actually kind of surprised to see Final Fantasy XIV characters in there.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Y'shtola I think is really big overseas too.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Yeah, she's a cutie.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

58:31.000 --> 58:40.000
So, one of the rumored announcements that was supposed to be coming out in just like a week or so here on September 7th was this PlayStation Slim.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
And apparently someone has one already.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
They bought it off of an auction site called Gumtree.

58:46.000 --> 58:56.000
And apparently they've posted lots of pictures online and Eurogamer's even had someone come out to the location and verify that it is authentic.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
So, it is. It's apparently... It looks much slimmer than the original PlayStation 4.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
It's all matte black with that kind of textured finish on it.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
They have a couple USB ports in the front there.

59:10.000 --> 59:17.000
It looks like instead of having the touch buttons on there, they actually have a physical reset and power button, which is kind of nice.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
And, yeah.

59:19.000 --> 59:27.000
So, I guess we'll learn some more about this in the next week here, but it's kind of bad for Sony that that...

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
How did that get to an auction site?

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
How did that leak out? I mean, that's pretty bad.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
So, I don't know.

59:35.000 --> 59:43.000
That is very bad that something they haven't even announced somehow already exists in a physical form and got...

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
So, my thought is they must be pulling the old Sega trick.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And they're out here today.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
And they're out today type of thing, which actually I think Microsoft also did.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
Well, they did like... It's out the day after tomorrow or something type of thing, right?

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Yeah, that was with the Xbox 360S.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So, I have a feeling Sony is about to drop that one where here it is and it's out today.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
So, that's how these things already exist off the assembly line and so forth, which in a way props to them for keeping it a secret this long in that regard.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But, yeah, that's really not good that one somehow already got in the wild in spite of all that. It's crazy.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I'd be curious to see what the other differences are aside from just it's smaller matte black now.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I mean, it doesn't... I don't know. I like the light bar in mine.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I'm hoping that it still has that because I don't really see that on here.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I don't know.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I think they said... If I remember correctly, I think when they had it like posted in NeoGaf that someone said that there was like a power button like light on there that kind of changes color like the light bar does.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yeah.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
But the light bar looks so much cooler than that. I mean, I don't know.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Yeah. No, the light bar in the controller. I'm very curious to see like what... Well, you know, the light on the back of the controller, you know, it changes color to go with the mood in different games.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
You know, developers kind of change that, but you don't ever really see that unless your hands are kind of, you know, like can you see the reflect?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
So, I can see why maybe they want to put it a little more front center where you can see it.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You know, now that you say that, I wanted... I thought I saw a picture of the controller and it looked different like that you could see those lights.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But maybe I'm thinking something else. I don't know. But yeah, I want to say that there was something else different.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yeah, they have a picture with the original PlayStation 4 and it's quite slimmer. I mean, it's got kind of rounded edges on it versus like the sharp edges that they have.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Yeah, definitely not as kind of sexy looking as the other PlayStation.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It's kind of neat though on the back though, they've got like the PlayStation button symbols on there. It's kind of raising it up a little bit and the PlayStation logo.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And then they've kind of... As far as ports on the back, it looks like they've just got the... an HDMI Ethernet and what I assume is the camera.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Although someone I think said it was the VR thing, but I think it's the camera. It looks like the camera port.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And then just, you know, the normal power cord spot and everything. But yeah, I mean, they posted a picture of the box. They posted a picture of everything that was in the box.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I mean, and someone saw it, so I don't know. It's authentic. It's just like, okay, you know, what are you gonna do?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yeah, it's the real deal. It's coming, but we'll just see how Sony puts a spin on it and what curious thing they'll say about the fact that it leaked so early, if nothing else.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Let's see now, Bobby Blackwell says, a dude posted the picture of the NX controller too, then admitted he faked it. But this whole thing, didn't they have like a YouTube motion unboxing?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Well, yeah, he had an unboxing. He had the actual thing being played and everything. They had, I think, a guy from Eurogamer or Digital Foundry come and look at it. And so, yeah, they confirmed it's legit.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So if it's a hoax, it's really the best one ever pulled. We'll put it that way. It's the best one ever, if it is indeed a hoax. Props. But it probably is not a hoax. It's looking very likely.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:43.000
All right. Now, let's see if this ends up being a hoax or not, although I could see that this is probably a real thing. Duke Nukem 3D rumored to be getting a remake, remaster type of thing, which I kind of feel like it's already been.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I mean, I know there hasn't been like a true HD remaster, but I do feel like Duke Nukem 3D has come back up with the Steam port that added the multiplayer inside Steam, right?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:04.000
They had one with 3D models. I don't remember what that was, if it was a mod or if that was an actual version of Duke Nukem 3D that they've had. They've had one with 3D models before.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Yeah.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
No, I don't remember which version that is.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Well, apparently, a teaser site for a Duke Nukem-related announcement came up, and this was as a part of dukenukem.com. And, of course, it's a countdown, so you know an announcement of an announcement.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:30.000
There's a banner that says, Happy 20th Anniversary, because, of course, the original Duke Nukem 3D was in 1996, so it is the 20th anniversary. So, likely going to be a re-release or remake.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Somebody on Reddit, so, you know, big grain of salt with this, but I'll go ahead and say, apparently knows that the game is called Duke Nukem 3D World Tour. It's part remaster, part remix.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
But, you know, again, take that with a grain of salt.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Well, that was out in the webpage. They found that actually within the code on the webpage.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So, hey, I like Duke Nukem.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And, honestly, as long as the first level's the same with the movie theater and everything, that's the level everybody remembers. Anything can be pretty much different after that. Most people probably wouldn't even recognize that it's different levels, like a remix or whatever.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
There was so many, like, fan maps. I think I still have a CD somewhere.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Oh, I had multiple CDs of those maps.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Like, the Duke Nukem game and, like, just bunches and bunches of... Wasn't there, like, Duke Nukem at the White House?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Oh, yeah, they had tons of, like, mods that, like, made it onto disc that they sold and it was just, like...

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
For sure.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, so the announcement looks like it was almost five days away, so that would make it, what?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Just in time for Penny Arcade Expo.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah, that seems appropriate.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So it makes a lot of sense, right? Because, you know, even though we've been talking a lot about Dragon Con on this show, you know, obviously there's a lot of people that are interested in Penny Arcade Expo, which is happening in Seattle at the same time.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So that would line up perfectly with it, especially if they do happen to have this game at the event there, so...

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And really, you know, when you have all those, like, blunders of different developers having strippers and stuff at their parties, this is really the only game that's appropriate for that.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It was part of the game.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
It was part of the game. It was part of the ambiance. Alright, anyway.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
The strippers and pick-ups.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Let's go to something completely different with Dark Soccer, and I mean different.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Well, sometimes you need to just sit back and look at the mundanity of life to just realize that all of your struggles were really not worth it in the end.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And so that's where this game comes in.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Are you saying, Dark Soccer, and in the end, it doesn't even matter.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
You know, I call that the R-Type song because it's like playing R-Type. In the end, it doesn't really matter.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So there is a game, the ultimate of boredom, called Un-Wigi.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It is a Flash browser game.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And it's really just...

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Not really a whole lot of much other than Luigi wandering around, smoking a cigarette, realizing that it's all gone horribly wrong.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
So basically, he's just depressed. He lights up a cigarette and walks around the Mushroom Kingdom.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Just giving these really sad observations and realizing that he's too old to change his ways.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And I'm going to read this quote here. This is great.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I looked down at Bowser's broken body and saw in it a map of a broken world.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And then you press another button and you get it all tastes of mushroom, of fungus, of molder, of damp ash.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
It's just Un-Wii. Un-Wigi.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Sounds so fucking hipster.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I know, it's great.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000
It's got a lot of text. It's a lot of reading because apparently a very bored Luigi has a lot of observations about the fucked up Mushroom Kingdom.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
This piece is called Un-Wigi.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I like the picture here. I asked her, why do you stay with him? She laughed. The kind of laugh so empty it's less funny than a sob.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Wow, alright. Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are real and coming to a store shelf or a digital shelf near you. Loki.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Alright, so this week we have Armello coming out on Xbox One, Assault Suit Lanos on PC, Attack on Titan on PC, Playstation 4, Playstation 3, Playstation Vita and Xbox One, Champions of Anteria on PC, Hatsune Miku Project Diva X on Playstation 4 and Vita, God Eater Resurrection on PC, God Eater 2 Rage Burst on PC, Playstation 4 and Vita,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:27.000
One Way Trip on Playstation 4, Resident Evil 4, I'm assuming the remaster on Playstation 4 and Xbox One, Strike Vector EX on Playstation 4, The Final Station on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One, The Turing Test on PC and Xbox One, Vernon on PS4 and Xbox One,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:54.000
World of Warcraft Legion on PC and Mac, Shiny on PC and Xbox One, Taheria Echoes of the Astral Empire on PC, Mac and Linux, Earthlock Festival of Magic on PC, Mac and Xbox One, Luminous Puzzle and Music on iOS and Android, and finally One Piece Burning Blood on PC.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That was a busy week.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's just a lot of small stuff.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah, but still, there's a lot of stuff coming up. But then again, Labor Day. I feel like the week of Labor Day is always kind of like a little big week. It's a mini big week. It's not going to be Black Friday big, but it's, you know, big.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yeah, actually the releases for the week after, it's not much.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Yeah, because that's when all the kids are back in school at that point. I mean, I know kids are starting school around now, end of August, but Labor Day is like the end.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:36.000
They have, for example, the week after next, Just Sing, which is that new Ubisoft singing game, and the Tomorrow Children. Remember that weird-ass Russian Playstation 4 game?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Yeah, that's coming out.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Alright, let's see. We've got The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Game of the Year Edition coming to Japan on September the 1st. That is on the Playstation 4.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:00.000
So not quite as busy of a week in Japan, because that's really the biggest thing on Playstation 4. Wii U, of course, is kind of, it's pretty dry right now in Japan as well as over here.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But looking at the Nintendo 3DS to see what's out of there, also empty until the 15th of September. But they do still get releases on the Vita, and there's one this week. It's Barani Kaku Sarishi Veriti comes out this week.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It looks like a French Revolution anime type of thing. You've got, you know, the chick with the poofy hair and the fan and the guy with the...

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Wait, wait, wait. What was the title again?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
It's probably based on an anime that I just, I'm not aware of.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
The Rose of Versailles?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Oh, it could be. Yeah, based on the art, there's a lot of roses in it.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Yeah, that is an anime actually based off of a real historical figure of a woman who would dress in men's clothes and duel people.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Well, I would think that this is probably some type of port of, or like an adventure game based on that. There's no description for this or anything available, so I have no idea what's all in it, if it's a visual novel or what it is.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Rose of Versailles is a pretty neat series.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah, listen, I like the art style. It's very cool. But a little bit slower in Japan this week, comparative to what Loki just had. But of course, Labor Day is an issue over there.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Dark Sakura.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:21.000
This is pretty slow in the UK, though. On the 26th, we have Attack on Titan, and we have King of Fighters XIV on Playstation 4.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Wait, it's already the 28th. Why am I doing the 26th?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Okay, on the 30th, we have Armello for Xbox One, and the Turing Test for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
On the 31st, we have RunGunJumpGun on Mac and PC.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
That's pretty much it. I already looked at September, and nope.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
That's it.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Alright, it's that time of the episode where we have to talk about NX rumors, because there's always NX rumors, and let's get into it, I guess.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So this is coming from Emily Rogers, who has kind of supplied some more of the NX rumors before on Twitter.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So, kind of just going over some of the stuff. So, for example, it's basically saying that there's some truth to the NX having detachable controllers and supporting force feedback and motion controls.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:31.000
The NX prototype had a 6.2 inch 720p multi-touch touchscreen, and unknown if the final product size will be larger or smaller than the prototype.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And then it says the prototype for the dock station has USB ports. I heard two USB ports, but I don't know if this number will change in the final product.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And that is all the information that you have this week, speculate away.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
We still don't know what the fuck this thing is yet, and I think it's stupid at this point.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:03.000
So the one reason I've heard before that Nintendo doesn't want to announce it early because they're afraid that someone's going to copy, but honestly, they're going to copy it anyways if they wanted to.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And, I mean, it's going to take a lot longer than six months to develop a console.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I think at this point, it's like, you gotta announce it so that at least people know what the hell it is to get excited about it.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Because right now, it's like, I don't know what the hell this is, and I'm not excited about it.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Well, maybe you'll be able to get excited very soon because, again, the rumor's building that this is going to be announced in September.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
This comes from the deputy news editor at Eurogamer who's answering some questions on Twitter.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But again, what's Eurogamer going to know about this officially?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I mean, I suppose they could have been invited to something that's under embargo, but that would be about it, all I can think of.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
But anyway, it was asked about when the NX would be revealed, and it was interesting.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:00.000
The phrasing used was, haven't heard it's changed from September, but I think info is now on tighter lockdown.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000
So I think that's what people are reading into is the fact that he said changed, like something has already been in stone or what have you.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Also, expected to be that there's going to be a Nintendo Direct for fans at the same time that there is an event for the press that occurs.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And that really, honestly, it all winds up with the whole right before Tokyo Game Show theory that I threw out there months ago,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and I'm sure that's what we're walking towards right now, so it's really just a matter of some type of official confirmation,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000
which may be Penny Arcade Expo, if they want to do an announcement of an announcement, that's a great time to do it.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So maybe we'll know something by Labor Day.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:44.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bike.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Anyhow, let's travel back to when things were a little simpler.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
We're going to go back in time to when, you know what, if you wanted the latest and greatest in the rumors, you got them out of a magazine.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
If you were lucky.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
If you were lucky, if you could get your parents to buy it for you.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
It's a classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
hey, pick up your copy of GamePro and read about this new game.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Yeah.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It's actually a game that was inspired by having watched another review of it.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It's this guy who does side-by-sides of different versions.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And I felt this one had to be shared with everybody because it's so freaking awesome.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Hellfire.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Is that not a great name for a game, Hellfire?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It's a good name.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Anyway, it came out in 1989.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It's by Toaplan, which do you know what else they did?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Zeroing.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Oh, okay.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Same company.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
They also did Snow Brothers, for the record.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Okay.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It was published by Taito.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
The game came out in the arcade, and then it was ported to the Mega Drive slash Genesis,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
and the PC Engine CD system as Hellfire S.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It actually has all kinds of interesting changes, by the way, for the PC Engine version,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
because they changed some of the story to where instead of having a character named Lancer,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
who was the main pilot, it's a female character named Kaoru.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And this is the soundtrack for it right here.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:27.000
It was like many of the PC Engine CD games where it was all remixed CD audio music and really good.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So the game is where there is great peace.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Everything is nice and peaceful because, yay, humanity.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Woohoo!

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And then this stuff called Black Nebula appears and then tries to take over the latest galaxy

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.000
and that humanity is colonized, and it's being led by this force called Super mech,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
who's a robot dictator.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And this is actually, Dan and I now have a new in-joke because of this game.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It's Space Egypt.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
In this game, there is a level that is fucking Space Egypt.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
So, anyway.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
So is that like Stargate?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Yeah, well, I didn't make that idea, but yeah, I guess it would kind of be.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Like you go by pyramids and shit in space.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And, you know, people with Pharaoh masks in space.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I guess if you can have Moet heads and, you know, Grodius and...

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So maybe we should leave Space Egypt to Toaplan and Easter Island to Konami.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000
At any rate, in the arcade and Mega Drive version, Lancer gets back to Earth and everything is great.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.000
But Kaoru in the PC Engine version blows herself up to save the Earth.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Anyway, the game itself is...

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Well, I'll put it this way, the arcade one is really freaking hard.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
But the cool thing about this one is that you start off being able to choose your weapons.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
You've got multi-directional weapons.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So you can get a front fire, a back fire, top or bottom.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And then you can get a diagonal fire.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
This is a little weaker because you don't have like three concentration beams.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It's just one coming at each direction.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But it does give you a chance to hit different targets, you know, that you might not otherwise.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You also get speed boosts, you get bombs, you get power-ups.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But now there are some changes for...

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And that's just in the arcade game.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So for the Mega Drive game, as you're going through this, you also get this little thing that will...

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Like an option almost that will go around and absorb energy from your enemies and blow them up.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And I think like a certain degree of homing to the missiles, the bombs.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It also introduced some parallax scrolling for the backgrounds and gave it a much faster feel to it.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It really did.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
The arcade version is pretty, but the Genesis one kind of blows it away in terms of graphical quality.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
The PC Engine one, though, was actually kind of a disappointment for its look.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I mean, it had the great music and the usual, you know, cheese ball, you know,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000
same style of, you know, late 80s, early 90s animation.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You know, those extra big eyes and extra big hair and, you know.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
But the soundtrack was really great.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You know, it was actually also easier than the other two versions.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Just didn't have the same extra option.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
You know, the little homing weapons and the little guy following you around like the Mega Drive version.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
But it's probably the easiest of the three.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And that is Hellfire.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I mean, it actually was...

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Mega Tech magazine actually gave this game number four in their top Mega Drive games of all time.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And the music was composed by Uemura Tatsuya, so...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Yeah, the soundtrack's pretty sweet.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yeah. So, the one thing I don't like is just how big the ship is on the screen.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I mean, it's fucking massive.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
So, the arcade version is really freaking hard.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
But the thing that was surprising is how easy the PC Engine version is,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
because usually when shooters come to the PC Engine, they get harder.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So... But it's a good game.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
All right.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Hellfire. You can find it, get it.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Hellfire.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
For PC Engine, TurboGrafx-16, whatever you prefer.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And a game, admittedly, I did not know much about.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
But it sounds very cool.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And there's a gameplay video as well I was looking at before. It looks pretty neat.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Well, there's... I've actually done other Toaplon games.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I think I've done Zero Wing before.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I think you did Zero Wing.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I've done Tatsujin, which was Truxton.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And I don't think I've done Snow Brothers yet,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
but I still want a copy of Batsu-kun, because it's just an e-game.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
All right. We're going to take a quick break here in studio,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
but when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
also your emails and the FUs of the week, and much more.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Live tonight, right in the middle of our 656th episode for this,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
August the 28th of 2016.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Our show already in progress before we have a little break here

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
for Labor Day and Dragon Con.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And many of you guys, I'm sure, are doing Penny Arcade Expo out there.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It's a big weekend for conventions.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
They're having one here locally, SacAnime.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
That's a pretty big deal, and I haven't been in years

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
since I'm always at Dragon Con these days,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
but didn't we do a panel at SacAnime once,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
like, years ago in the early days of OLR?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I feel like it was at SacAnime.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Yes, it was at SacAnime, and it was at, like, 8 in the morning.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It was 8 in the morning, and I think we had one person show up.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
But you know what? We did the damn show anyway.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
We did the damn show anyway, and we had a great time.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Maybe we were, like, a last-minute ad or something anyway,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
so the promotion was really, really bad.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So, Dark Tetsuya says, I know you guys did one at Fanime.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Yeah, we did a couple at Fanime. It's been a few years,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
but, yeah, we had done panels at Fanime.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I should mention, even though we, you know, here at OLR,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
we only have the Parsec Award appearance at Dragon Con,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
we will have a panel at GamerX4.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Dark Soccer, myself, and Captain Spike from GameBooey.org

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
are going to be doing a live show.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
We're doing a super show, which we're still trying to plan out.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
We'll probably be adding to who is on that as well,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
but for right now, it's the three of us.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Probably some other friends and fun guests, too.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
We did a lot of panels previously that were about, like,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
how to podcast and why to podcast,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
so we thought this year we would just podcast,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
and that would be fun. Do an actual show.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So, that'll be happening live at GamerX, so look forward to that.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some news,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
some rapid-fire news, some quick news stories here. Loki.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
All right. So, this is kind of cool.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I remember seeing, like, a little video about it

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
when they launched their Kickstarter,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
but Adult Swim Games is going to be helping ToeJam and Earl,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
the brand new ToeJam and Earl game, come back.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
The, what was it, Back in the Groove would be the subtitle on that.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And, yeah, looks pretty good so far, actually.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I don't know when it's releasing or what platforms yet.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
They said PC and consoles, but next year sometime.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
That's when they'll be releasing.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
But that's cool that they'll be actually published at some point.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I know that Adult Swim's been really kind of getting into gaming lately,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
so I will have to look forward to that, I guess.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And then we've got a couple free-to-play games being shut down by Ubisoft,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
and this includes Ghost Recon Phantoms and the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Those are both closing down later this year.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Looks like the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot will close on October 25th,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
followed by Ghost Recon Phantoms on December 1st.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Who is playing those games?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I don't know.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Apparently not enough people, or they wouldn't be shutting them down, right?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Right.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Well, sorry to the fans of those games,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
but apparently there were not a lot of people playing them,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
and so Ubisoft didn't feel like paying the bill anymore.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Going back just a little bit to the ToeJam and Earl thing,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com going,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Adult Swim Games has really gotten big.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yeah, it does seem like they've been doing more and more,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
and I think this ToeJam and Earl thing is probably going to have a presence

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
at Penny Arcade Expo, right?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Maybe.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Which I think is part of the reason why they announced it now.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Well, for those of you guys that have seen this on Netflix,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
it was really just only a matter of time before something like this happened,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
and of course I'm talking about Stranger Things on Netflix, which is great.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Of course, we raved about that a few episodes ago.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Well, apparently a group called Infamous Games,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
which they say that they like to do old-school adventure games,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
they have built a non-authorized, but it's a playable fan tribute to the series.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
The version that they've put out there, it's not complete,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
but they're just kind of looking at one of the show's scenes

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
in that classic 80s adventure game style.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Actually, this looks a little more, it doesn't really look 80s to me,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
because where computing was in the mid-80s,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
couldn't have produced these types of graphics.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
This is more like that Lucas Games, early 90s loom type of look to it,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
is what this reminds me of, but it's still a great throwback,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
and I hope they don't get cease and desisted by Netflix,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
so they probably will,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
but I would like to see them be able to put out this full vision there.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Anyway, in the scene you get to help Hopper,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
who's one of the main characters of the game, the Sheriff,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000
and the deputies look for a clue to why someone has disappeared in the woods,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
and then you find the clue and that ends the game.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It's a very short, playable scene, but why not?

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Why not?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
So yeah, check that out.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
In between generating all those graphics on the Stranger Things generator,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
because that's all I saw on Twitter this week,

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
was people generating their own words and phrases in the Stranger Things font.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Moving on to a game that I keep forgetting is coming out this fall,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
and I don't know why, because I'm really excited about this game,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
and that is Civilization VI.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
There's a collector's edition, because of course there is,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
announced for Civilization VI this week.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
It will come with an art book, some commemorative coins,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
some DLC, because that's where Civilization is now,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and all the bonus content that comes to the digital deluxe edition.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
90 bucks if you want all that, but coins, did I say coins?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Anyhow, pre-order DLC will be exclusive for 90 days.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That's something interesting with Civilization VI,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
but I'm assuming after those 90 days they want to open it up so that people can buy it,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
because of course they want people to buy it.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
But Civilization VI, it's going to be awesome.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Dark Sakura.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Well, here's some other stuff.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.000
There is a few new titles coming out to the Virtual Console.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Yay! Echo, echo, echo.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
So, among those is Super Mario 64 DS,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
that will be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and then also three Street Fighter titles.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Super Street Fighter Alpha 2, sorry, not Super,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo Hyper Fighting,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and Street Fighter 2 The New Challengers will be released on August 25th.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And then, kind of video game-y, but kind of not.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It's a good idea to pay attention to ergonomics when you are at your computer,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
and now there is a very cute way to do that,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
with an Eevee plushie that comes with a pillow that its little paws can attach to,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
and you can sit with it on your lap, which helps you maintain your posture,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
while still resting your wrists in a comfortable place in front of your keyboard,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
because you're supposed to have your hands resting higher than the keyboard a little bit,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
to relieve pressure on your wrists,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and so now you have a super adorable way to do it.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Yay, Eevee.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And Pokemon's all the rage right now, you know.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Well, yeah.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I also like that all their marketing there is still Pocket Monster.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
That is the old school name, absolutely.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Alright, we're going to get back into some of the long form news,

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
and of course, coming up in a little bit here,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.000
the mailbag and the FUs of the Week, and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
But first, we have some more news stories for you with Loki.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
So, I'm sure you've heard that a lot of people aren't too happy with No Man's Sky,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and how a lot of the things that were promised aren't coming through,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
or, you know, a lot of the things that should be functioning in the game

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
aren't necessarily functioning as well as they were supposed to.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So, there's been a lot of people looking to get their money back,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and getting some refunds.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And thankfully, there's been some research into this,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and apparently multiple services are offering refunds for your purchases of No Man's Sky,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
including Steam, Amazon, and PlayStation Network.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Steam even going so far as to allow you to do a refund,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:38.000
even if you played longer, if you've, you know, had it,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
or you just played under two hours within two weeks.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But I guess I want to say that I thought that they were bending that rule for this,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
and allowing you to do it anyways, but you might want to check into that.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And of course, you know, Amazon, they said they're looking at case by case spaces for those,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
and then it's only kind of the same thing.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
They'll refund any purchase within 14 days of the purchase.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Yeah, I mean, it looks...

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I mean, I guess I'm not surprised that people are asking for refunds for that stuff.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I mean, I still would like give it some time, just to see...

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It sounds like that they are working on patching the game,

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
and getting things up to, you know, where they should be.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I just kind of wish that that was there at launch.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I mean, honestly, since they gave themselves extra time,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and you basically see how many corners were cut for it,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
it's just kind of disappointing.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Well, and it seems like they fixed a lot of those PC issues within a few days, too.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
You know what I mean?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Like the PC version with all the graphic issues people were complaining about and stuff,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
that seemed to get fixed relatively fast.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
They've done several updates.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
It's like 1.07 now on PlayStation 4.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
So, I mean, they're working on fixing some of that stuff,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
and I think a lot of the PC issues have been fixed.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I've seen, like, there's already been quite a few mods coming out for it.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
So, you know, what the developer doesn't fix, the modding community will.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
So, I don't know, that's kind of interesting.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I'd be curious to see what mods that they have on there.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I know the one I did see seemed to add a lot more of the plant life,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
and made the plants look a little bit more lush, I guess.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So, yeah.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I wish they had modding support on the PlayStation 4 version.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I kind of wish they had modding support on the PlayStation 4 version of Fallout 4 as well,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
but, you know, we can't all have everything, I guess.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.000
All right, well, it's probably just a matter of time before it mods.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Oh, it's just that complicated PlayStation 4 and PlayStation's, you know, network requirements and stuff.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
True.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I don't know. I don't really know what the excuse is, but I'm disappointed that we still don't have that yet.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Yeah. All right, well, moving on to talk about Pokémon GO,

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
which, you know, still a lot of people are talking about, but there's a lot of buzz out there.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
In fact, I saw this, like, trending on Facebook or something this week.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
A lot of buzz out there that Pokémon GO is in decline,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000
and, of course, it's interesting how people really want to just, like, rally around, like,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.000
oh, look, this game is flopping already, but that's not really what's happening, you guys.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Pokémon GO peaked in popularity at some point in mid-July,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
but based on data collected by Sensor Tower, Survey Monkey, Aptopia,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
they have to use these third-party sites to measure this stuff because, you know,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
they don't really put anything official out there.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It looks like that the worldwide daily active users have just dropped from about 40 million to 30 million.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
That's still 30 million people playing this game.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Show me any other mobile game that's at that level right now.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
So, I think Pokémon GO is still doing very, very well, but, of course, you know,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
some people are complaining about, oh, the radar's got the issues, and, you know, you know,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I understand Ant just got to fix a bunch of that stuff, but the reality is it wasn't going to last forever.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I'm surprised they haven't switched up the, what was it, switched up the farms yet.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Remember, they were had-

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I thought, I heard they did again last week.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Did they?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
That the nest changed again, yeah.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I heard they changed again because, like, where people were finding, I think,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Poliwhirls, they were now finding, god, it changed to something else,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
and it was something kind of rare-ish.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I don't remember, but, yeah, like, some of the nests has changed, so you wanted to look that up.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
That was, like, in the middle of the week last week.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
So, but I think this is very natural.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I mean, it's like MMOs.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
An expansion comes out, big up, and then it'll slowly tick off,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
and then I'm sure when the second gen of Pokémon comes out, it'll go back up,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
or when the radar thing gets, you know, which I saw when I was in San Francisco,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.000
when I went to Pokémon Worlds with Shane, we got to see, because, you know,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
when you're in San Francisco, you get the new radar, and it looked really cool,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and I don't know why they haven't rolled that out worldwide yet,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
but I imagine that's going to be any day now, that's going to come out everywhere,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
and I think that'll get some people interested in the game again,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
who were getting a little frustrated with the way the radar thing played out.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You know, so I think this game is far from dead.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000
When, you know, when you've got another game, whether it be Candy Crush,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000
or Words with Friends, or Draw Something, or whatever,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
that gets back up to this level, you let me know.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So, alright.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
But, you know, and I'll say, you know, as much as I might be defending Pokémon Go here,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000
and the fact that people are, like, you know, excited, it seems on Facebook to see it decline in popularity,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I myself have really scaled back in how much I've been playing the game,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
but that's just, I mean, because I've just been, when I go out to play a game,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I usually end up playing Ingress, just because that's the game I've always kind of been into,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
so I think that's more why my Pokémon Go stuff has been declining.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And I'm still waiting to really see, like, what the point of the team and the gym control thing becomes,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
because there's no, there's no real way to measure up in the community and so forth,

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
like there is in Ingress.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I don't know, I just feel, I feel my progress more in Ingress than I do in a game like Pokémon Go.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So, whatever.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Alright, well let's move on.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Happiness. So much happiness, because the game, inspired by a preview,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
named after a 1990's Gin Blossom song,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
is back.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Ugh, Allison Road is back.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000
So, basically they had cancelled everything, they said we weren't going to do it,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000
and now the creator, Christian Kessler, says it's back.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
He has a new company that he made with his wife called Far From Home,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and considered that cancellation moment a setback, and now they are back and working on it.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
He said he started making a few necessary changes to the story and the flow,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
and it came back to life.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.000
So, they're working on it, no details yet, but they're still working on it.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So, yay!

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Great.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Yes. Yes!

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Yes, God.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Well, the fact that it's kind of been up and down and up, you know, it gives me some reservations,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
but I look forward to when they put an actual teaser out there or something,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I look forward to what they're going to deliver.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I just like the excuse to use Gin Blossoms in the background.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I can't, I'd like...

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
You were very excited about that.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Other people had to have caught that that was a thing, right?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Whatever.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I feel extra old.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I'm going to go drink my Geritol now.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Alright, go watch the Matlock reruns while we go to a story from...

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Actually, but you know what? I was going to say go watch some murder she wrote,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
but you can do that at any... Angela Lansbury is timeless, okay?

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Actually, Matlock wasn't a bad show.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
My grandmother watched Matlock a lot.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
It was kind of boring.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I would end up watching Matlock with my grandmother while I did stuff.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Alright.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
You know, it wasn't that bad.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Alright, let's move on. Logie.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Alright, so this is kind of interesting,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
but one of the co-creators of Rick and Morty

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.000
has teamed up with some former executive from Epic,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
and they're making VR games.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
So it's a new company called Squanchtendo,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
which sounds just kind of like a Nintendo thing, but...

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yeah, they're...

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Now that's a vegetable I'd eat.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Squashten? Squashtendo?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
No, that's Squash. Squanch.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Oh, Squanch. I thought you said Squash.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I was like, actually Squash is pretty good to begin with.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Alright, wow, when jokes go horrifically wrong on the next OLR.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Yeah, so they're going to be making VR games,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000
and they had a funny little comic to announce it as well.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
You know what VR game they should make?

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Is that courtroom scene from Georgia, the short that they did for...

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
What did they do with that? For Comic-Con or something like that?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Have you seen that YouTube of the Rick and Morty,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
that they do the voices for the court scene

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
of the guy who's just going crazy that's like, you know,

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000
he says all these really obscene things about like,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
why don't you shut up and blow me or something.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
He's just talking back to the judge, and the judge starts talking back to him.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It's hilarious, but it's in the Rick and Morty voices.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And because of this, no, fuck you.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
If you continue to fuck you, it was that one, right?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Kind of, but it was a lot more obscene than that.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
It was really, really funny.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Why don't you go fuck yourself and other things like that, right?

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I remember reading the thing like back in the day.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Yes, yes. Actually, I can do a little clip here.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I don't know, but again, this is like a nine and a half minute thing,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
so I don't know, but here's what I'm talking about.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Fuck yourself.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Okay, I'm going to tell you how this is going to work.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
You either listen or not. I don't care.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I'm through. Can I leave the courtroom?

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
No, you've got to stay here.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
No, I'm not talking to the bastard.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
We are going to have the trial Monday week.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
No, the fuck we are. I ain't going to trial with this lawyer present.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Listen, if you do not-

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Suck my dick, you stinking ass cracker.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
If you act like this, if you act like this,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I will send you out of the courtroom-

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Old bitch ass cracker.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And leave you out of the courtroom during the trial.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Horse ass cracker.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Do you understand that?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Sucking ass.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Do you understand that?

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I could just let that play all day. It's hilarious.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Yeah, so that's the VR game I want.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Well, one of the VR games that they're working on right now

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
is the Rick and Morty, it was the Morty Simulator,

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Virtual Rick-ality, so that is one of the ones

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
that they're working on right now.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Okay, maybe I will get that after all.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That'd be great.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I'd play Phoenix Wright if it was that.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Well, one game I know I'm going to be playing

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
because I am super excited about this series.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Even though the last few times it was on mobile,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
it was kind of garbage.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But I'm willing to give it another go,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
and that is Luminous.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
That's right, Luminous is coming back with a new version.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It's another mobile edition.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It's going to be, as I think Logie mentioned during release dates,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
it is out on Android and iOS on September 1st for $3.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
$2.99 was $3.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
It's going to have some classic tracks and some new tracks.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
You will be able to play in portrait mode on your phones,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000
which is the way that it looked on an HD TV,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
so that should be fine.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
You mean landscape?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Is that what I mean?

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
No, why does it say a portrait-style setup?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You're right, that would be landscape, not portrait.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Maybe some people like to play in portrait.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
That would be weird, though.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Portrait is like the way you play Meteos or something.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
But yeah, I can't imagine it won't be like,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
why would you suddenly want to play in portrait mode?

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
You're not going to be able to see as much.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Maybe they're just talking about, when they use that word,

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
they're talking about the artistic style or something like that.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
That's a little weird.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
But anyway, I guess we'll find out when the game is out,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
because we don't really have screenshots or anything.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Well, good, I need a new game to play.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Yeah, since you banished one from your phone.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I don't mind you, the last Luminous game that was out

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
was kind of earlier in the iPhone.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
It was around the time of the iPhone 4 or something.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
It was garbage.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
So hopefully this one's gotten the controls down better.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I should download that Space Invaders game that they had before.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
What was the other one that was on rails?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Oh, the Groove Coaster?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Groove Coaster, yeah.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
That's an arcade cabinet at round one,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
which, by the way, ready for the tangent train?

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Choo choo!

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Round one opened up in Concord this week.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Cool.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Not quite in Sacramento yet.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yeah, but you don't have to go all the way to San Jose.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Now, I wasn't able to go because I was super busy this weekend

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
with Rocky Horror last night and everything.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
But Shane went, and he wasn't able to be on tonight's show

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
because he has some of this stuff going on.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
But Shane spoke very favorably of the new round one.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
He said there's not as many music games,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
but there's still a lot,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
and there's less people playing them, I guess,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
because it's Concord, so I guess he got to get more games in.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
And he said they had the Luigi's Mansion arcade machine was there.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That's cool.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Which they don't have in San Jose.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
So just an interesting little side tangent.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Well, maybe.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
You know, they went in San Jose.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Now they're in Concord.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
The next logical place to keep moving this direction

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
would be here in Sacramento, right?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Why not put that out in, I don't know, people will love that,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
in like Roseville or Folsom or, I don't know, West Sac.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
What else is growing around here?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Elk Grove?

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Put it in the Palladio because there's like nothing there.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yeah, maybe. That'd be awesome.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Or, I don't know, Sunrise Mall.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
It's the whole mall.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Just tear the rest of the mall down.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
It's all the arcade.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
All right.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
All right.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Anyway, I don't know how we went from luminous to round one,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
but we did.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
There you go.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Let's get to the emails.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
if you want to participate with our show.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the emails

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
and find some emails to read for you tonight.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Again, that's Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
if you want to send us an email.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
There's two.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Two whole emails.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
All right, let's do it.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Hello, LR.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Hi.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Just a couple of thoughts on last week's episode.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I don't know if Shane is listening,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
but Time Crisis 5 is a phenomenal game

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
when the guns are calibrated properly.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
So if he sees it again in a location

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
where they care enough to calibrate it properly,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I hope he'll give it another try.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Maybe they had that in Concord.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I didn't ask.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I didn't ask about Time Crisis.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Alternatively, many recent gun games

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
have some sort of user calibration.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Look on the machine to see if it mentions it.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Also mentioned was the Mario and Sonic

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
at the Rio Olympics arcade game.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I actually did play this at my local Dave and Buster's

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
a couple of months back when I discovered

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
that some kid left like seven credits on it.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You get to play one mini game per credit

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
choosing from things like archery, hurdles,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
swimming, or your classic 100 meter dash.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Basically, it controls like the old world class

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
track meet on your power pad,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
except that there's an infrared sensor

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
watching your feet instead of physical buttons

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
or that there are two joystick levers,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
one on each side that are used for things like jumping

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
or the rhythmic gymnastics event,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
which is absolutely not part of the Rio Olympics.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
The other cool thing about this game

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
is that just like Mario Kart arcade

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
or even good old Daytona USA,

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
there are several cabinets and you will compete

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000
against whoever else is playing at that time.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Of course, you can intentionally not join someone else's game

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
and just play by yourself,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
but there's no difference except you'll be up against AI.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
The game was fun even if it was over pretty quickly.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
You play one event and that's it.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
The menu screens and post-game award ceremony

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
definitely take longer than the actual game,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
but it was fun while it lasted.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Worth a look if you're in a place that has it

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
and you don't mind being a bit sore the next day.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
And this one's for me, Jamie.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Good luck with the crappy shift. Hang in there.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Until next time, Aaron, YYR.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Always good to hear from YYR.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You know, I will go ahead and just say this.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I am actually changing from a worse shift

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
to the one I'm getting.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
It's just that the worse shift allows you to do the show at least.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Well, yeah, but I wouldn't be in any shape to do the show anyway.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
No, I understand. I understand.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So it's between my health and doing the show,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
to be perfectly honest.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Well, I had not played that Mario and Sonic Rio Olympic Games,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
so that was cool to hear a little bit about it.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So I'll have to check it out at some point.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
The one thing I'm hearing about this whole round one thing and the new one,

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Shane was telling me that the round one in Concord

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
is not with the rest of the network,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
so my card won't work there, which seems a little bit ridiculous.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
But I don't think I had a lot of money left on my San Jose card anyway,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
so I guess it's not that big a deal.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I have a ton of friends in San Jose.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I'm sure I'll be back there at some point anyway.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Let's just go to Mills Garage.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Well, apparently there's a DDR machine there now with memory card slots.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
They're opening up a mini arcade.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Don't they have a one-car garage?

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Yeah, and it's starting to fill with arcade games.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
They own the Para... Should I be talking about this on air?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I guess they wouldn't care.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
They own the Para Para machine that used to be Arcade Infinities back in the day,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
so that is still there.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And they moved stuff onto a flash drive,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
so it runs a lot smoother with that machine.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And then there is a Dance Maniacs,

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
and that's the last time I played Dance Maniacs.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Solo, and now there's a... Is it the Xtreme?

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
It's the Xtreme that they bought.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I think their Solo wasn't really working anyway,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.000
and at one point they kind of just unplugged the arcade part of it,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
and they were just using the dance pad with a PlayStation 2.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So, yeah, I don't know what the story is behind that,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
but we'll have to get them back on the show at some point to ask.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But, yeah, I know there's an Xtreme machine in there now.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
They just picked that up.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
And the Xtreme machine came from this area.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Apparently there was some place over at Sunrise and 50

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
and all those warehouses over there.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I think it was the bouncy... You know the bouncy trampoline place?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
I think it came from there. I think that's who sold it.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Yeah, crazy, right?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Yeah. Well, last email?

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Yes. And by the way, sorry, Dark Tetsuya says,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
I wonder if you upgraded the Dance Maniacs with that new version.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000
As far as I know, the version they have has some type of...

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
It's the...

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
But it was the J-Paradise.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
It is the J-Paradise.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Korean edition.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Yeah, it's whatever has the most songs,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
but I have heard there's an even newer one that has a ton of stuff.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I don't think they've tried that yet.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
As far as I know.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Email time.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Yes.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Hey, OLR. I just wanted to share a gaming experience I had last night.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I was over my boyfriend's house

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
and he decided to turn on his Steam link

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
to show me some of his games that he has.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
As he was going through his Steam library, I noticed he had Peggle.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Now, before yesterday, I only heard of Peggle from you guys.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
So I asked him to show me the game without knowing what to expect.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
At first, it kind of reminded me of the Miitomo Drop game

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
and the music was very classic sounding and catchy,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
but nothing could prepare me for the fever thing that happens at the end of every level.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
It is so over the top with all of these colors and rainbows

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
and it tops off with blasting Ode to Joy.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Peggle was the most unexpected gaming experience I ever had.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I encourage anyone who never played it before

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
to go and download it right now and play it.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
So I was wondering, did you guys ever have an unexpected gaming experience?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
If so, what game was it?

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Oh, good question.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
One of your longtime listeners, Ziba.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
For the record, you should see what happens if you fully clear the level.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000
You get like ultra hyper fever and then sometimes you'll get,

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000
if you manage to ace the score, then you'll get like ribbons and everything for it too.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I love this story too because it's not like Peggle's,

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I mean, Peggle is kind of an older game at this point, right?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
It is, but it's super fun.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
But it's awesome that somebody's discovering that for the first time, right?

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
It's like finding that old TV show that you've just found on everything.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Like, I don't know, like a lot of people now are finding Twin Peaks, let's say,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
which is like, that's a show I loved from the 90s,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
even if it got really weird in the second season.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
But like the fact that it's coming back and everything, you know.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
But like people are discovering that for the first time now.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
And I just love this story that like, oh, somebody's discovering that first time.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
So that's great.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Can you read the question part of that again?

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Because the question that she had.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
So I was wondering, did you guys ever have an unexpected gaming experience?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
If so, what game was it?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I know that actually another PopCap game Bejeweled was kind of fun for me

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
because of that stupid butterfly mode.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I am addicted to butterfly mode.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And I scream every time that damn jewel spider eats my butterflies.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
It's just like the craziest thing.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Well, as cheesy of an answer as this might be,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
the honest to God first thing that comes to my mind, DDR.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I mean, that game literally changed my life.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Derby Owners Club.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Seriously, did you expect to like that fucking game?

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
That's a good answer.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
If you guys don't know what Derby Owners Club is,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
gigantic, they probably still have it at some Dave and Busters.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
They've got to still have it.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
It's horse betting and horse racing.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Yeah, it's a horse racing game.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And you actually breed a horse who's on these little magnetic cards that you use.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I still have my binder.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I don't have binders of women. I have binders of horses.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I love it.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
What about you, Loki?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
But DDR is my choice, honestly.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Who knew that Stomping Arrows would be here all these years later?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000
As much shit as we give Konami now, and rightfully so, let's be real,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
none of the people who had anything to do with DDR's successes are even there anymore.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Maybe a few, but none of the big names.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
The show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for that arcade community at that time,

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
and it really stinks that we don't have that.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Well, I don't know, but round one's bringing some of that back,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
some of these other experiences.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Maybe it will come back.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I shouldn't say we're never going to have it again.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I remember giving you Third Mix all the way back in the day,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
and you had the Mickey Mouse pads.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
It was not the Mickey Mouse pads. It was the Jungle Book PlayStation game.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
That was the Jungle Book ones.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Which was a dumb fuck game.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
But the pad worked.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
But the pad was great.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
It had a dance pad, and you could use it with DDR,

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
and that was the first- I never realized.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
You know, I was a dirty casual at the time.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I only had a PlayStation.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I never realized you could put a little plug in the back of your PlayStation

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
and play Japanese games.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
So somebody brought over-

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I think I brought mine over.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Yeah, you brought yours over.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
And my burns.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I think the crazy guy I used to live with had the burned copy of the Third Mix

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
and brought it over, and we played that, like, all night.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
It was so much fun.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
And I lived upstairs, and I think I got so many complaints.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000
But I didn't care.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
We used to have all those Bimani parties back in the day.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Yeah, for real. It was fun.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
What about you, Logan?

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Yeah, what about you, Logan?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Probably just DDR.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I don't know.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Copycat.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
What?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Did you expect Grand Theft Auto?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Did you expect Grand Theft Auto?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
You would love as much as you did?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Of course.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I seriously need to go back and play 5.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I may do that, because now that-

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
One of the things I forgot to mention during my gaming week was,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
you know, recently my laptop was being stupid,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
and I had to reinstall Windows several times.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Well, prior to reinstalling Windows several times,

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000
my PlayStation, the second screen, I don't remember what they call that,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
where you can play the PlayStation on, like, your Vita or your PC,

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
wasn't working.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
But now it does.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
So I'm like, yes.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I don't have to watch this stupid Grey's Anatomy shit.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I can play No Man's Sky, which is better, but it's not much.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.000
But I need to go back and play, you know, Grand Theft Auto,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
because I've watched a lot of people playing the new update that they have

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
with all the stunt ramps and everything, and it looks seriously crazy.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Like, there's some fun racing going on there,

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
so I need to go back and play that.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
All right. Well, I do want to mention,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
just the chat room is lighting up with responses to the question

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
that was posed to us.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Very good email, Ziba.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Yeah, very good email and very good answers here.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
SHA100Matt, this isn't a game, but I think it's a good answer still.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I showed my girlfriend the Goonies last night.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
She had never seen it before, and she was an 80s kid also.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
She, of course, loved it.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
So talk about discovering something, right?

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Mm-hmm.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
RageNator reminding us, doesn't matter how old a game is,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
a good game is a good game, and a bad game is a bad game, no matter what.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Some other answers in chat, AkumaJP says, Zone of the Enders, for me.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I never thought it was going to be that good.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
BobbyBlackWolf saying, recently I tried Pokemon P-Cross.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I had never played a P-Cross game before.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I have now bought P-Cross E1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
and I'm looking for P-Cross DS every time I go to a place that sells used DS games.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
That's a great answer.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:20.000
VidPower says, the arcade game Prop Cycle surprised me with how fun it is.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Oh, man, that game is legendary.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
You've got to look that up.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
If you don't know what Prop Cycle is, Google it or look up a picture of the machine.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
It was the silliest game and you get this big fat bicycle and you're riding it.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
It was amazing.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
There's another game that came out in 95 that I'm probably going to make a classic game sometime,

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
but it was Psychic Force.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Did you ever play Psychic Force?

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
I don't think so.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.000
It was sort of like an in-space 3D fighting game, like multi-plane fighting game.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
It was kind of a weird one.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
It was one of those Taito games, but yeah.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Just a couple more quick answers and then we'll move on.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Act Def says, Portal blew me away.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
It still kind of does.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000
JD says, Rhythm Tengoku on Game Boy Advance surprised me with how adorable it was.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And SSG100Matt says, Undertale surprised the fuck out of me.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
So there you go.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Lots of great answers.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Great question.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
That's it for emails though, right?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for the future.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
For now though, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Um, I guess FU to not having my weekends anymore, because I do a lot of stuff on the weekends.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And FU to plantar fasciitis.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I have developed it in my left heel, so I have to go shoe shopping.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
That's it.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
All right.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Loki.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I guess this, um, FU2, it's just work stuff.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Just trying to get into a different department other than Wormat.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000
And, um, I'm rocking it, but they just aren't hiring.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
So they're like, yeah, we want you.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
We really do.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
But, you know, so it's really hard.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Um, my FU of the week goes to my voice because I threw it out again last night because I was hosting Rocky Horror.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Although the crowd was phenomenal and it was a different setup.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
It was outside.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000
It was really fun.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Great crowd.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I had a great time.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Um, and yeah, so just FU to the fact that I threw my voice out, even if it does make it a little bit sexy base here.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I wish I could kind of, I wish I could hang on to the voice without some of the pain.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Might work out better for radio.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Although I just, I have to face that my voice will never be like Captain Spikes from Gameboy.org.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
It's just never going to be.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
All right.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And then we'll get to our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
But first, Loki.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
All right.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:07.000
So it's been a few weeks since we talked about the ZeniMax lawsuit, but they've appended their complaint.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:16.000
And now they are straight up basically accusing John Carmack of, you know, stealing patent stuff.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
You know, basically stealing information.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Basically, they're also now naming Facebook as well with the amended charges.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And basically saying that the key source of conflict is misappropriated ZeniMax property.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Specifically, it spells out like they're saying the theft of alleged id software technology and stuff developed from John Carmack.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Basically saying, instead of complying with his contract during his last days of ZeniMax, he copied thousands of documents from a computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:00.000
He never returned those files or all copies of them after his employment with ZeniMax was terminated.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:15.000
In addition, after Carmack's employment with ZeniMax was terminated, he returned the ZeniMax premises to take a customized tool for developing VR technology belonging to ZeniMax that itself is a part of ZeniMax VR technology.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
So basically saying he stole the information.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Or, I don't know.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I guess we'll have to see it play out.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I see what they're trying to paint the picture that he came in and sold these documents.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But I kind of wonder if like a lot of it is just stuff that he was working on.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
But then again, you know, if he's employed at that company and it's their property.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
So it's hard to say.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.000
You can't really, you know, who's his thoughts or, you know, whose property.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I mean, it's kind of confusing.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000
But that's thankfully for a courtroom to decide, not me.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
I would probably just say, fuck you ZeniMax.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Not any of you on Twitter.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Fuck you ZeniMax, where's my fucking Fallout 4, you know.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Where's my mod support on PlayStation 4.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Oh, it's not fucking done yet? Well then you're fucking done.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
That's how my courtroom works.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.000
It'll be like that court scene we just played from Rick and Morty.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
How about fuck you?

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Fuck you, fuck you. Yes, fuck you.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Alright, let's talk about the Super Nintendo because it celebrated a birthday this past week.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:34.000
That's right, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System arrived in North America on August 23rd, 1991.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
So the Super Nintendo turned 25 this past week.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Which means, guess what everybody?

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
You're old.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Didn't Valve have like an anniversary or something this week?

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I thought they were like 20 or 25.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Yeah, probably like the 10th anniversary of them not announcing Half-Life 3.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I think it's 20, yeah.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
But in Valve time though, that's like an eternity.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Well anyhow, maybe you didn't know this, but Super Nintendo never did outsell the original NES.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Of course, some of the best games, at least if you talk to gamers of a certain age, like our age,

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
many would agree that the best games came out on Super Nintendo.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Games like Super Mario World, Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Metroid.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Can you imagine when that SNES mini comes out finally?

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Right, and Chrono Trigger.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
It was some of the great, great games of Super Nintendo.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Yeah, Mario Kart started on Super Nintendo, Star Fox, Donkey Kong Country.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I mean, Super Nintendo was just the system.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Will there ever be a better video game?

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.000
And just think, when they do end up coming out with an SNES mini, and for whatever reason they omit Chrono Trigger,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000
then that's just more fuel to go, I'm sorry, it feels like one of the best games ever.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
It would have clearly been on that system.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Well, the third party thing is going to throw a monkey wrench into that.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Whereas Super Metroid was a first party game, Chrono Trigger was not.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
They put Final Fantasy in there.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
They did, yeah.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
I mean, I would hope that that's in there.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Anything is possible.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Final Fantasy 2 and 3, or 4 and 6, will probably be in there first.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Much to the angerment of Chrono Trigger fans everywhere.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I hope the mini SNES isn't a real thing, that would be awesome.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I would love to get one of the old school controllers, just like they have one coming out for the NES, and make that a USB thing.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
That would be awesome.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
They do have USB SNES style controllers.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
SNES style or actual SNES?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
They may as well be.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Are they that good?

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
The body is exactly the same.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I mean, the insides really aren't as great, but it feels like one in your hand.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Officially supported virtual console on PC wouldn't be bad.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Nintendo, if you want to make some bank.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mini SNES will only have Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Hey, at least you'll get the great music.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000
If I'm challenged, say something nice about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
It had great music.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
There you go.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I'll give you that.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
How about right now?

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.000
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or perhaps something else that we didn't bring up.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
While we wait for a call to come in, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
No, I don't.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000
But I was checking out what the NES turned into over here, and it turned into an Eakins NES.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Which is like, it's a common Pokemon already.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
It's like, eh.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
It's not very good.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:51.000
So, but the buzz is that Cameron Park Lake, though, is pretty nice to go up there for Pokemon.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Really?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So I may have to head up there.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Is that where the Dratini's all went?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:01.000
No, that's where a lot of Magikarp and Psyducks and what else do they have?

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
They actually have Dratini's up there, too.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Nice.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
That might be worth it.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Might be worth it, because they don't spawn in Anatolia.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Psyducks.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000
People from the Bay Area were going out to Anatolia to farm Dratini's.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Like, it was just nuts.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Yeah.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Eventually it'll come back, I'm sure.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Alright, well, let's get to the phones.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
We have a call coming in.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Who's this?

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Hey, it's Raginator.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Hey, Raginator.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Well, just before you opened up the phone lines, you were bringing up the 25th anniversary of the Super Nintendo being released in the US.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Now, that being said, I'm not sure if Dark Sakura had one back then.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I almost have to say she had a Genesis back then.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Let's ask.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
There's one way to find out, Raginator.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Did you have a Super Nintendo Dark Sakura when it first came out?

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Or were you only at Genesis' house?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Yeah.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.000
In fact, we had to choose, and my mom asked me specifically, what gaming system do we need in the house?

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
And I said, I want a Super Nintendo because Link to the Past is on it.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And that's how it went, and we had a Super Scope as well.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I guess I was mistaken.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I must remember.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.000
No, it's an easy mistake to make, because she is such a Sega fangirl, it is a very easy mistake to make.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:25.000
But yeah, so she had the Super Nintendo, and how appropriate that she had the bazooka for the Super Nintendo as well.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Well, that obviously leads to my question, which I'll open up to you three, and anyone in the chat there wants to answer.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Do you remember off the top of your heads, when you got the Super Nintendo, why you got it,

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.000
in what case did you at least bear with the system?

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Sure, I'll go first. I think I've told this story on the show, but it's worth telling again, and I'll abbreviate it a little bit.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I got it for Christmas, I think the year after it was out, so I don't think I had it the very first year.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
No, maybe I did get it the first year. I think I did actually get it the first year, in 1991.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I'm trying to think how old it would have been. Yeah, I was in junior high, so yeah, that adds up.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:24.000
So yeah, I think I got it for Christmas that year, but my parents did that really cool trick where it was not actually under the tree at all,

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:31.000
and so I opened all the other gifts, and there was no Super Nintendo, so you're kind of trying to do that thing where it's like,

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I'm trying not to be an ungrateful little shit because I didn't get what I wanted, but I'm still kind of like,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.000
God damn it, that's the one thing I wanted, but you're just trying to hide it and suck it up best you can.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But then of course, after everything is done, then I think my sister came out and was like,

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Oh, there's one more thing, and it was this little tiny card, and the card opened up and it said,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Go look here, and then you go look in, I don't know, it was a closet or something, you go look in the closet,

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000
and it's like, go look here. You had to go look, so it was one of those stupid scavenger hunts where you went around the whole house,

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:09.000
and then finally it ends up, I think it was under my mom's bed, big box, and I knew what it was,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:16.000
it was Super Nintendo, and I was excited, happy tears from a dumb junior high kid, but here's the hilarious thing,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I got the Super Nintendo, and I got Super Mario World, it was packed in with it, obviously, everybody got that game,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.000
but then my parents had no idea what other game to get, so they bought a game called Drakken,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:34.000
which was, I guess, an early title on the Super Nintendo, and they didn't know what to get,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:40.000
they asked the guy at, and I want to say it was Montgomery Ward, I feel like was where they said they got it,

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:46.000
they asked the guy, what game should we get, because they didn't know what to get, and the guy said,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:53.000
well this one's selling well, or something like that, I don't know, turns out this game, it's like, nobody,

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
like I would tell my friends that I had this game, nobody knew what the fuck this game was, Drakken was a real,

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
and it's what, D-R-A-K-K-H-E-N, something like that?

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Yeah, that was actually a pretty decent game.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It was a PC title, or something, I think they ported it over to Super Nintendo, and so when I first,

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I didn't play it much, obviously, because I was obsessed with Mario World, and then I got, I think,

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I think I picked up F-Zero pretty quickly after that, so I didn't really play a lot of Drakken,

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.000
it really wasn't until about two years later I went back and I kind of sat down and forced myself to play Drakken,

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.000
and I was like, I actually really like this game, it was weird, it was a role playing game, but it was like,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000
you didn't control the battles at all, like you would kind of like walk around the screen and everything would auto attack,

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:44.000
but it was kind of cool because it was a first person mode game, which for early Super Nintendo you didn't see a lot of that.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:52.000
There was a sequel that came out after that called Dragon's View, that's really fucking good, like that game was really good,

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000
and it has that same kind of first person, but then it's mixed with like a side scroll or action thing,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:04.000
which they completely changed from the original Drakken. So anyway, there's the tangent, that was my first,

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.000
how I got my Super Nintendo and what the first game was that I had with it. Loki, your family has Super Nintendo? Yeah?

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Yeah, I bought it because I sold my, I think I sold my Nintendo to get a Super Nintendo,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:26.000
and so I don't remember all the early games they got with it, maybe I think Legend of Zelda was one of them,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:35.000
but I do remember one of the first games I had, because they didn't have Super Mario World, was Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Awesome. Which actually it's not a bad game, it's just like it's basically Roadrunner's Sonic the Hedgehog.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Isn't that like one of the few games they like can't emulate right? Yeah, I think it is.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I think I heard about like the boxes on stage six or something, they don't appear, it's like some really weird emulation,

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I was reading some article about it. I did end up beating him, but yeah, it's a pretty hard game.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Because you end up going like to Mars and there's Marvin the Martian stuff. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't bad.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I, well first of all my mom got it from my brothers, but forget them, it was mine.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:18.000
So we got A Link to the Past, of course we got the package of Super Mario World, and Home Alone.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Because my brothers were super into Home Alone at the time. That game was terrible.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000
It wasn't just terrible, it was terra-bad. It gave me virtual cancer.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Jamie. Virtual, not real. I felt ill playing it, I'll put it that way.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000
And then we also had the Super Scope, and I played a lot of Blastress. A lot of Blastress.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Of course you loved the bazooka. Of course I did. But I probably beat A Link to the Past like...

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Oh yeah, game was so good. So quickly, and then I played through it again.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.000
And my mom's like, now you need to let your brothers play, it's like they can play when I'm at school.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
They're in school too. So, that's their problem.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Here's some answers from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
JD says, my first Super Nintendo game was Donkey Kong Country.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:15.000
AkumaJP said, I got my Super Nintendo late because I had to work to get it. I got it with Street Fighter 2.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:20.000
SSJ100Matt says, my parents made me save up my money to get a Super Nintendo.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I had to roll pennies and do chores for my grandparents to get the money for it.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000
I was seven when this happened. It taught me the value of saving and importance of spending it wisely.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I like that. Let's see, and yeah, those are some comments.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Oh, Act F says, I can't remember what game I got with my Super Nintendo.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Aside Super Mario World, of course. Those are some answers from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Ooh, this is another good answer. Dungeon Buster says, one of my first games was Actraiser.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Yes, the game was so good. Stayed up all night to play it.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Thank goodness it was on a weekend, so no school the next day. Ooh, I love that game.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000
I remember renting that, and yes, I did stay up all night to play it.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I think we all did. The game was awesome.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I had a lot of Mega Man X fun too.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Ragenator, what about you? Did you ever officially get to buy a Super Nintendo? What was your story behind it?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Yeah, in fact, a slight tangent that relates to the story.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Back in the early 90s, my one brother and I used to have paper routes together, and that's how we made a little extra money for ourselves.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:35.000
And we used to do those on the weekend, and pretty much every single cent that we made went into our respective bank accounts.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:43.000
All that being said, I didn't get the Super Nintendo right away back in 91.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.000
However, I kept seeing the commercials for it.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I saw it mentioned on GameProTV, and even the neighbors across the street in the game line, and I saw it being played and all that.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
I thought, this is the most awesome system I've ever seen in my life.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:14.000
And considering that I had all this money in the bank saved up, I begged my parents to let me spend my own money to go buy a Super Nintendo.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And as a second sight, they were a little hypocritical spending money left and right that they didn't have, but they wouldn't let me spend my own money on something that I could afford.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:37.000
But eventually I did make them break down and let me buy a Super Nintendo on my own.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:48.000
My father took me over to this little store that's local to my area at the time called Best Buy, not Best Buy, Brand Aims.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:54.000
And I bought the Super Nintendo itself, which came with Super Mario World.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:08.000
And just for shits and giggles, my father bought two games that I recommended that I researched the crap out of, which was Super Castlevania IV and Actraiser.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Because I thought that... Castlevania was a good series. I played the original on the Nintendo.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I saw the gameplay on GameProTV. It looked good, especially the one on stage with the rotating tunnel.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:35.000
And plus, the soundtrack seemed amazing, and it was. It really showed off the sound chip on the system.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Same with Actraiser. Great soundtrack. And for a while, those three games lasted us a while. We played the crap out of them.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Eventually I ended up getting all the games like SimCity, SimEarth, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
You know, it's interesting because SimCity was really good on Super Nintendo because they added kind of the Nintendo-y elements to it.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.000
They added like the... Bowser replaced Godzilla, and you get like a Mario statue and all the silly stuff.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
But SimEarth was really bad compared to the PC version.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Yeah, honestly, the only game that I bought over the years that I regretted buying was the original Mortal Kombat.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Because back then I was really into fighting games, and I thought, oh, Mortal Kombat, I know that was a great arcade game.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I wanted it for home. Bought the game. Oh my God, I regretted that purchase virtually instantly.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I still loved it, but the whole sweat thing was really cheesy.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Yeah, but eventually, obviously, Nintendo learned their mistake from that game.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
They put the violence and the blood back into Mortal Kombat 2 and whatnot.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
And the later games were definitely better.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:03.000
But, you know, a great system. One of my favorite, you know, two favorite games for the system was from React Tracer Castlevania IV.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:11.000
It would be Killer Instinct with the Pakken soundtrack, which was the first soundtrack I ever got.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000
And that got me started on collecting soundtracks.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Super Ghost of Ghosts. Great game.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Wow, lots of good picks. Lots of good reminiscent down memory lane for Super Nintendo.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for the trip down memory lane tonight.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Sure, have a nice night.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Yep, take care of you too.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
A lot of positive feedback to Castlevania IV in our chat room.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.000
By the way, OrangeLoungeRadio, all in a word on Skype if you want to call in.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I see a lot of positive feedback for the Castlevania IV. DungeonBuster says,

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Yay, I love the track that plays during the swinging chandelier stage.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Oh yeah, that stage was so awesome too.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Let's see, VidPower says, Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat had sweat and neutered fatalities. So sad.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.000
It was so interesting what they could have and what they couldn't have.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Because if I remember right, like, Sonya still had the kiss thing that would incinerate.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Like, that was okay. You could set somebody on fire and that was okay.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
But what was it? Like, Johnny Cage would just uppercut them. That's it.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Because the head can't pop off like it did in the arcade game.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
And then what? They really changed sub-zeroes, right?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Sub-zero would do the deep freeze and then shatter them into a million pieces.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
But again, no blood, so it was okay.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.000
But then didn't they, in one of the later Mortal Kombat games,

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000
didn't they actually give him that fatality again as a throwback?

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
But it was, like, way gorier.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I think so.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I think they did in one of the later ones. Either it was the Mortal Kombat 9 or one of the other ones.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
They kind of redid it.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Alright, one last call here for calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000
You could also use the phone lines to do an old-school 1877 game, O-L-R, if you want to do it that way.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000
One other thing I was thinking of that wasn't in our show world tonight,

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
but it occurred to me was a big news thing.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I guess maybe because I've been playing World of Warcraft or Battle.net related games.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I don't know if you guys know, but Battle.net added into the launcher this week.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
And I knew it was coming, because I think we talked about that the feature was coming on the show.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
But now you can stream to Facebook natively within the Battle.net app.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:22.000
So Facebook is starting to make their play for a piece of that Twitch TV, YouTube gaming, and that whole thing.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:30.000
But I've got to admit, part of why I like Twitch and why I like YouTube gaming and stuff

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
is more the discoverability there.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
But if I stream on Facebook, it's only going to be limited to my friends.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.000
There's not going to be as much discoverability there to meet new people and stuff.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Which, I mean, I guess it could be cool that I could stream games just for friends.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Like, you know, come see how bad I am at Overwatch.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Or watch, you know, I'm going to play some of my friends on Facebook at Overwatch,

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
and here's what it looks like from my perspective, that whole thing.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000
But I don't know, I'm not really interested in Facebook as a streaming platform.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Plus, one reason why I think Twitch does so well with the streaming and everything is because

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:12.000
it's on mobile, it's on PlayStation, it's on Xbox, it's everywhere.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
You know, there's a Twitch app almost everywhere.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I guess, granted, though, Facebook, you know, they do have the mobile app,

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and you can watch things within that, so there is that.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000
But I just don't know if I see that being as big of a thing.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000
But it is built into the Battle.net thing, which is, you know,

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Blizzard's a pretty big company, and those are some heavy-hitting PC games.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I mean, that means now you can stream directly what?

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Overwatch, all right there.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Very, very, very easily. So, interesting.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Alright, well, oh, and DarkTetsuya in chat says,

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
oh, no wonder, a friend of mine was streaming Overwatch to her Facebook,

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
so I guess that's what that was about, yeah.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
And BobbyBlackWolf says, can I stream Rock and Roll Racing?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
I don't think that's in the Battle.net launcher, sadly.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:08.000
At one point, they released, was it that or was it their other game from that era?

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Maybe it was, but it's not actually within the Battle.net launcher.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
It's just like a separate executable file you just play.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
So, I think it does have to be built into the launcher.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I don't think you could actually stream old Warcraft.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Or is, I don't know, is old Warcraft in the Battle.net launcher?

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Warcraft 3 might be, but I don't think Warcraft 1 and 2 are.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Unless you still have CDs.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Well, yeah, but then, but the CDs are still gonna be independent of the launcher,

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
which has the broadcast software built in it.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Oh, I was thinking of like Twitch.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I just thought maybe they were too old, like, you know,

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
some of those older games don't play well, even though they're on newer systems.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Sure, sure.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000
All right, well, let's see, and Kaijuto says,

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
you can pretty much produce a show on just Twitch alone.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:54.000
I mean, if we were to set up this show on Twitch,

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
we probably would get exposed to new people,

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
and that's something we may still think about doing in the future,

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.000
but right now, you know, we're still orange on radio for the time being.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
But yeah, you know, whole nother platform there.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
All right, well, nobody else is calling in,

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.000
so I guess too many people watching those silly video music awards on MTV.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Oh my God, did you see what Beyoncé did?

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000
No, I've been doing this fucking show, Jamie.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Yeah, but you were looking at your phone.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000
How did you see it?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Because I'm on Facebook right now.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Oh, what did she do?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000
She brought out the, uh, Traven Martin's mother

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000
and the other two boys' mother on the red carpet with her,

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
and her daughter who has the tutu I always wanted as a kid.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Ah.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
So, bravo to her.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Yeah, but did she do anything in her, did she perform?

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Yeah, she did Lemonade.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Oh, okay. Okay.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
And then, um, all the queens, except for Adore,

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000
were all wearing other famous celebrity outfits.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Yeah, I saw that from Drag Race, right?

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Like, Fifi did the meat dress.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Um, Adore just posted, she was, like, in Manchester Pride District.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
She's overseas right now.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Yeah.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
So, I guess it didn't work out.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Anyway, interesting.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Uh, Sia Tabarian Chat says,

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000
When will we get the MTV Video Game Music Awards?

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with Act Deaf,

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.000
hopefully never, because that's just not something I want MTV producing.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
You know, the one that Jeff Keighley did,

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
which I don't even remember the name of it now,

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000
but it's in December.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
It's just the Video Game Awards?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Yeah, the Video Game Awards.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Okay.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Like, the first year, the fact that it acknowledged Roberta Williams

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
gave it big props in my book,

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
and then, you know, it's getting to be,

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000
remember the whole, like, throwing shade at Konami Live

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.000
during the thing?

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.000
That was pretty cool.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Where he just, like, read the house down,

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
why Hideo Kojima couldn't be there?

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
So, like, I'm like,

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
okay, this thing shows a lot of promise,

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
and I think it's going to age very well,

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
so I'm willing to let that, you know,

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
see what that looks like year three.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I think a lot of us were very worried,

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
because he was also involved with the Spike TV thing,

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.000
which is kind of what an MTV Video Game Music Awards,

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
whatever the fuck, would have looked like.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
But this new one he's doing is pretty good,

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000
so we'll see what happens year three.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
We will.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
All right.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Well, that is going to do it

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
We will be back to do this all again in two weeks.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Loki's birthday show on September 11th.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
How old are you this year?

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
36.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
36.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
You're old, so am I.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
I can't wait until you're 37.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
In a row.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
In a row.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
All right.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Well, anyway, we'll be back.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Dark Sakura, we're going to be shaking things up a little bit.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Dark Sakura will be here.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
She just won't be here live.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I'll be here dead.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:34.000
She'll be here.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I'll hunt.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Dark Sakura is going to still grace us

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.000
with the Classic Game of the Week

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
and ensure that Loki doesn't put Halo there in her absence.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
I won't put Halo there.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Well, I still won't be there if I don't approve it.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.000
But it doesn't matter.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
You can say it, but it doesn't mean it'll happen.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:48.000
It doesn't matter because Dark Sakura's

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
going to still do that segment for us,

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
so we'll have just a few little cosmetic changes on the show.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Fine.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.000
I'll start my own Classic Game of the Week

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
with hookers and blackjack.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Was that a game, hookers and blackjack?

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
No, it's from Futurama.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000
It should be.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
No.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Well, that should be a game.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
So, as we say here every week at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
if you enjoyed what you heard on the show,

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
please tell a friend or five about the show.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Help us spread the word.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000
A nice five-star review wherever you found this show,

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
like iTunes or Google Music or wherever,

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000
that goes an awful long way, so please consider that.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I'd really appreciate it,

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
as would we all here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I hope to see many of you at Dragon Con this next week

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
or at some of the other conventions coming up

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
in the next few months.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
But until then, let's go around and get everybody's

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
final thought for the night.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Dark Sakura, we'll see you in a few months.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Probably not that long.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
You might have some time off or something

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
where you can still play with us at some point,

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:47.000
but do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Same.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
All right, and my final thought tonight is

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.000
you need to take those pineapple cake things with you

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000
because I don't want any more.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000
You need to take the rest of those cookies

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000
that you brought here with you,

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000
get them out of my house

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
because I'm going on an emergency diet.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000
No, I'm leaving them.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I don't know.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I guess I'll play more No Man's Sky.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Might as well.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Might as well.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Got nothing else to do.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Got to get to that center of the universe

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000
so that I can have no ending.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000
I'm hearing people are not happy about that.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I'm trying to keep myself free of the spoilers and all that,

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
but I'm hearing people are like,

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
it's the new Mass Effect 3.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
We'll see, though.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.000
I thought I already spoiled it.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
I'm sorry.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
If you did, I wasn't listening,

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
and that's probably for the best.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
All right, times when it was a good idea

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000
to not listen to Loki.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
All right, that's it.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
We're out of here.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
We'll see you in two weeks.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Have a wonderful Labor Day and be safe.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Goodbye, everybody.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
