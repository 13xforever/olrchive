7000	15000	Visual Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
15000	27000	Tonight, No Man's Sky gets patched, some Pokemon Go players get banned, and PlayStation 4 slim details get leaked. We discuss the week of gaming on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
57000	65000	Join me here live in studio is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
65000	66000	Hi.
66000	67000	Hello and welcome.
67000	68000	Hi.
68000	74000	We had a little bit of a scare there because we thought this might be your last week before the break, but it's actually going to be next week.
74000	78000	I'm just not looking forward to that last week right before that. You know why?
78000	79000	Why?
79000	82000	Because I'm going to be working six days in a row.
82000	83000	Eww.
83000	84000	Ewwww.
84000	86000	What did you do to deserve that punishment?
86000	89000	I had surgery, therefore I missed my shift bid.
89000	93000	Oh, no, no. I meant, what did you do to deserve six days in a row? That's awful.
93000	96000	I had surgery and missed my shift bid.
96000	110000	I see. All right. Well, you know, again, you will be missed during the break, but we did figure out a way. We are going to have you continue to do the Classic Game of the Week through the magic of recording segments in advance.
110000	111000	Yes.
111000	112000	So there will be that.
112000	116000	We'll call it time travel. It'll be, it'll, it'll call TARDIS posting.
116000	119000	Yes. It'll be a classically recorded segment.
119000	120000	Yes.
120000	124000	Well, but we'll bust out like the old little recorder and the mic.
124000	131000	Yes. Oh, yeah. The old timey thing. We'll get, we'll get some razor blades and edit the tape, like actual physical edit, like I learned to do in college.
131000	132000	Yeah.
132000	140000	When I was studying radio and here I am having done a podcast for the last 15 years, never had to touch a razor blade except for my face.
140000	141000	You know what?
141000	146000	We've had to, I've had to do actual photo editing in the old school way.
146000	147000	Oh, yeah?
147000	149000	Where you cut out with an exacto knife.
149000	151000	Oh, like actual cropping.
151000	152000	Yeah.
152000	157000	You don't take, that little tool in Photoshop is an actual picture of a cropper.
157000	168000	It is. Or even on top of that where you use like transparent ink to reshade so that the shading looks natural.
168000	169000	Yeah.
169000	178000	All that stuff I learned how to do. And you know how often I've had to do it? Once. And that was on purpose since I graduated.
178000	181000	Understandable. All right. Well, let's also say hello to.
181000	187000	And Raginator, no, that's not going to happen. Halo will never be a classic game of the week because I will never approve it.
187000	198000	And Dark Soccer responding to a live chat comment at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where if you are listening live, you can come make a comment and get yelled at by Dark Soccer as well.
198000	204000	But sometimes she'll also say nice things to you. Okay. Also, say hello, of course, to Tech Master Loki.
204000	205000	Hello.
205000	206000	How are you?
206000	207000	I'm all right.
207000	208000	Yeah?
208000	209000	I have a headache for yelling at slow drivers on the way home.
209000	210000	I'm sorry.
210000	212000	Sorry, there's so much anger tonight. My gosh.
212000	217000	They were driving super slow. It's like you're merging onto a freeway and you're driving 15 miles an hour.
217000	227000	I understand. I drove to, as we'll talk about in a minute here, I drove to San Francisco yesterday and it took me three hours to get there because it's just like not only did Waze say hello,
227000	233000	but it definitely did Waze send me on the most backwards way to get there because I'm sure the roads were a mess.
233000	235000	That app usually tends to know what it's doing.
235000	241000	But just slow drivers that cut people off left and right causing backup for everybody.
241000	242000	It's horrible.
242000	245000	Were they doing construction on the bridge? Because they're always doing construction on the bridge.
245000	247000	Actually, I don't think they were. I think this is one of those.
247000	249000	Oh, my God. That's like the one time.
249000	252000	Yeah. No, I don't think I saw any construction on the bridge for a change.
252000	256000	So it's just it was backed up because traffic always backs up.
256000	257000	It stinks.
257000	258000	Yeah.
258000	262000	All right. Have you ever edited tape using a razor blade?
262000	263000	Actual audio tape.
263000	268000	I've cut a tape apart to pull it out of a tape player.
268000	271000	And then and then possibly drag it behind a car.
271000	276000	That doesn't necessarily that's not it's editing the tape to be something different than it was.
276000	280000	You know, like, is it the whole like pencil and the tape to unwind it?
280000	282000	That's the trick we see today.
282000	283000	We'll never know this.
283000	284000	No, no, it wasn't that.
284000	288000	It was like we had all these video cassette tapes that we weren't going to be using.
288000	294000	So what's better to do with them than to just throw them away, but to destroy them and then throw them away.
294000	297000	And, you know, those tape, they're very long.
297000	299000	It's fun to drag the whole thing out.
299000	301000	We wouldn't TP trees. We would tape trees.
301000	303000	Did you just moan into the microphone over there?
303000	306000	I did. I had a Cinnabon delight. It was in my mouth.
306000	308000	Exploded in your mouth.
308000	313000	It was beautiful with a creamy center. It was quite obscene.
313000	316000	Let's see, going to live.vognetwork.com.
316000	321000	SS2100 Matt says also Rob is number two on my friend's leaderboard on Waze.
321000	324000	I'm number one on my own leaderboard. Who's beating me?
324000	327000	Is that like being the top of the leaderboard at Google Maps or something?
327000	331000	Yeah, it's not it's not it's not a very serious game.
331000	334000	It's just something I pretty much always use it when I'm driving long distance.
334000	336000	And I use it on my commute to work a lot, too.
336000	341000	So anyway, let's see.
341000	346000	Also looking for more chat in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
346000	348000	Some folks talking about Halo.
348000	352000	Kaijuto says I agree. Halo should never be a classic because of its fans.
352000	355000	I do like Halo 2, 3 and Reach, though.
355000	358000	So all right. Well, it is what it is.
358000	363000	I think there's thousands of more games out there that deserve a little attention.
363000	366000	And maybe Halo on the last episode. Who knows?
366000	371000	In regards to our discussion about Sugimansato Rena.
371000	375000	2019 will be when it qualifies.
375000	379000	Oh, for a classic game of the week? Yes, because a classic game has to be 10 years old.
379000	380000	It came out in 2009.
380000	384000	So since you brought it up, I'll mention this real fast before we get into the kickoff topic.
384000	386000	So we were looking on Twitter.
386000	392000	Actually, no, one of my friends randomly retweeted this on Twitter and was like, WTF is this?
392000	396000	And it was a Steam game that was called Cat President.
396000	401000	And so when I saw this, you know I did a double take because, you know, again, this is a long time ago.
401000	403000	It was probably, what, 2008, 2009.
403000	408000	There was a Wii game out there called Sukiban Senchou Rena Wii.
408000	410000	Sukiban Shacho Rena.
410000	411000	I always mess up the pronunciation.
411000	415000	But the translation was roughly President Cat.
415000	421000	And it led to this whole discussion about why don't we get these more off-the-wall types of games.
421000	423000	Is a cat being president? This sounds hilarious.
423000	425000	We talked this whole thing up.
425000	431000	And then we ended up getting some of our listeners to tweet at the developers who actually noticed us.
431000	435000	And that caused some of the game blogs at the time out there.
435000	436000	Senpai noticed us.
436000	437000	Yeah, Senpai noticed us essentially.
437000	439000	And some of the game blogs were running with this story.
439000	445000	Fans are clamoring and petitioning for President Cat to come to the US and all this.
445000	448000	Which I think is funny because Jamie essentially named that game.
448000	453000	Because she was like, it's not exactly that, but roughly that.
453000	455000	But I would say it's a great name.
455000	457000	Sukiban is like a delinquent girl leader.
457000	461000	And then a shacho is more like a company president.
461000	465000	So it was like delinquent company president Rena.
465000	468000	Yeah. And you were like, I think you said boss cat first.
468000	469000	Like boss cat, yeah.
469000	470000	That's not good.
470000	472000	Like a gang leader boss cat.
472000	475000	So anyway, so the game blogs ran with this.
475000	477000	And of course the game never came west.
477000	481000	What was interesting about it is that then there were follow up articles out there that said,
481000	485000	Oh, now it's the worst selling Wii game of all time.
485000	488000	And it only sold 100 copies.
488000	492000	And to this day, I want to see the receipts.
492000	496000	Like nobody's really been able to produce receipts that that game only sold that many copies.
496000	503000	Which would shock me, especially considering Wii imported several of those copies because of this show.
503000	509000	So I have like maybe it only sold 100 at this store or at this demo or whatever it was.
509000	516000	But you know, and then on top of that, I mean the minimum print quantity, because you have to manufacture those.
516000	519000	The minimum quantity that they do is several thousands.
519000	522000	I can get 130 bucks on Amazon now.
522000	523000	Well, they copy the game.
523000	527000	Yeah, I'm sure it's I can play it, but it should be a cult hit at this point.
528000	531000	Oh, um, I actually there was a book.
531000	539000	I think it was based on the comic or something manga or something like that was was where it all tied together from.
539000	541000	But anyway, so OK, so that's that was the background.
541000	544000	So there was a huge campaign for President Cat.
544000	548000	And what's really funny, like years later, one of those websites like Destructoid or something,
548000	553000	ran a 10 games that also need to be localized for the Wii.
553000	559000	And this was right around the height of Operation Rainfall when it was like, you know, we need to get the last guardian.
559000	563000	We need to get Pandora's Tower and Xenoblade and all this stuff.
563000	567000	And then Destructoid actually ran a story that was like, here's 10 more games that need to be localized.
567000	569000	And President Cat was on it.
569000	571000	And that made me laugh like all the years later.
571000	573000	So obviously, when we saw Cat President.
573000	575000	Here's the article about us. I'll link it in the chatroom.
575000	576000	Oh, you found it? Yeah.
576000	582000	Not that one, but it was like grassroots effort to bring bizarre game to the US.
582000	584000	It's funny. You can Google it and all these.
584000	590000	It's funny that of all the things we've done in the 15 year history of the show,
590000	596000	that and the beautiful Katamari issues, I'll leave it at that, were the things that got us on the gaming blogs.
596000	598000	So it's just funny.
598000	602000	But anyway, so anyway, so we see this game called Cat President.
602000	606000	Of course, I do a double take. I'm like, oh, my God, someone made it. Someone did it.
606000	610000	And then my second thought was, are we getting a cut?
610000	613000	Although, to be fair, we had nothing to do with the original Wii game.
613000	615000	So I didn't really think that. But, you know, I laughed it in my head.
615000	618000	I was like, did somebody actually make an OLR dream game come true?
618000	622000	Well, it turns out I actually did a little research on this game in Steam, this Cat President.
622000	624000	It was something that was greenlit recently.
624000	626000	And it's a visual novel game.
626000	631000	So it's nothing like I think you actually said it looks more like Hatoful Boyfriend in the art style than anything else.
631000	635000	It does just with the background being actual photographs.
635000	639000	But, I mean, it makes me think a lot more of Hatoful Boyfriend.
639000	646000	And, you know, it is logical that a lot of people are talking about an election right now for some strange reason,
646000	650000	which was the case eight years ago when this President Cat thing first happened.
650000	654000	So, I mean, it is natural that somebody had the same idea because cats are awesome.
654000	659000	So anyway, I am going to reach out. We found who made the game and found them on Twitter.
659000	663000	I am going to reach out and try to get them on the show in a future week because I do want to ask.
663000	665000	I want to say, did you know about President Cat?
665000	667000	Did you know that's the thing? Because I want my money.
667000	668000	I'm just kidding. I would not say that.
668000	672000	But I'm very curious to hear where the inspiration for that came from and so forth.
672000	674000	So we'll figure that all out.
674000	680000	So anyway, since you brought that up, I had to mention that because I think I tweeted about it on the OLR account.
680000	682000	I put like, what's this?
682000	685000	I put the emote icon that goes, what's this?
685000	687000	With the little screenshot I saw on Twitter.
687000	688000	So that's where that all came from.
688000	692000	So there really is a cat president game on its way to Steam.
692000	694000	So we'll get more on that later.
695000	699000	So I want to talk a little bit about an adventure that I went on this weekend.
699000	702000	And maybe I should introduce somebody else who's sitting here in studio.
702000	706000	Who is always sitting here in studio, it seems like, during the show.
706000	708000	Shane is back with us this week.
708000	709000	I just haven't left.
709000	712000	Yeah, I know you've literally been here since Saturday.
712000	714000	I just don't like my new place I live.
714000	716000	So I don't really like going back there as much as possible.
716000	717000	You just hang out here now.
717000	718000	Yes.
718000	722000	I was actually saying earlier, he's kind of turned into Kramer from Seinfeld.
722000	723000	But like, you know.
723000	724000	My hair isn't stupid.
724000	726000	So that's really rude.
726000	730000	I brought you Cinnabons, so I'm going to go spit on yours now.
730000	732000	No, no, no, just let me eat them.
732000	733000	Okay, I'm going to let Jamie eat them.
733000	735000	Because they're amazing.
735000	739000	I love how he says, I'm not rude, and I'm going to go spit on your Cinnabons all in the same breath.
739000	742000	I didn't say rude, I said I didn't have dumb hair.
742000	743000	Alright, anyway, look.
743000	744000	Let's see.
744000	748000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh good, Shane's on the show.
748000	751000	I want his take on the Color Splash Power Rangers.
751000	752000	That's the thing.
752000	753000	Is that the Mario?
753000	755000	I think there's like a reference in the new Mario.
755000	756000	Oh, yeah.
756000	758000	I saw like that video, and I already forgot it.
758000	759000	Okay.
759000	760000	So that's how memorable it was.
760000	761000	Here's the weird...
761000	763000	And like Final Fantasy XIV is doing an event all about...
763000	764000	Oh, shucks.
764000	765000	Did I miss it?
765000	767000	I might have missed my first Final Fantasy XIV holiday.
767000	773000	It's doing an event all about like Power Rangers or Super Sentai, and Shane cannot be bothered.
773000	774000	I really don't care about it.
774000	779000	It's not like actual Super Sentai stuff, and the outfits you get aren't cool enough.
779000	781000	So that's fine.
781000	782000	I don't need it.
782000	786000	Well, anyway, you're here to talk about an adventure that we went on.
786000	790000	Oh, and if we're going to talk about Nintendo Sentai stuff, it's all about the Axiom Rangers
790000	792000	from Super Mario RPG.
792000	793000	Alright, look.
793000	796000	Let's talk about this adventure that we went on yesterday.
796000	798000	So, Shane, you decided...
798000	802000	Well, first, the story was we're going to go to round one today because my friend Tyler's
802000	804000	never been, and I was like, oh, round one adventure.
804000	805000	That sounds like fun.
805000	806000	So, yeah.
806000	807000	I said I'll drive.
807000	808000	I've got the new car.
808000	809000	Let's go to San Jose.
809000	811000	Let's go to round one, which did end up being part of the plan.
811000	817000	But then the day before, you heard, oh, people are getting to go to Pokémon Worlds after
817000	818000	all.
818000	819000	Yeah, so...
819000	820000	What happened?
820000	821000	I can tell this story.
821000	822000	You don't need to tell it for me.
822000	823000	Okay, fine.
823000	824000	Please.
824000	828000	So when I was at Power Morphicon, we met this like gay couple that's married, and we hung
828000	833000	out with them, and they were coming up to San Francisco after Power Morphicon in Pasadena.
834000	839000	I randomly get a text while I'm at work from one of the guys saying, hey, the Pokémon
839000	840000	Center is open to the public.
840000	844000	Look at what we just got for myself and my nephew.
844000	845000	It was like all these plush toys.
845000	846000	I was like, really?
846000	847000	He's like, yeah.
847000	850000	It's going to be open throughout the weekend, so you should go if you want.
850000	852000	I'm like, okay, bye.
852000	854000	So we went to the Pokémon Center.
854000	856000	I want to go.
856000	857000	Yeah, we did.
857000	858000	We went to...
858000	859000	Why didn't anyone tell me?
859000	861000	Well, A, it was literally last minute.
861000	862000	Yeah, it was super last minute.
862000	867000	I didn't think we were actually going to go.
867000	870000	So we went and picked up.
870000	872000	I got some plushies and a coffee mug.
872000	874000	Yeah, you got a Pikachu butt coffee mug.
874000	876000	I love that coffee mug.
876000	879000	I got a shirt and a hat and Pikachu.
879000	882000	But we were not able to go to the actual event.
882000	884000	No, and I actually really, really would have loved to do that part.
884000	885000	But you've been watching it all.
885000	886000	Oh, yeah.
886000	887000	I watched it all.
887000	891000	So tell us a little bit about the event, because I was able to listen to it while I was riding
891000	893000	in the car, but I wasn't really able to watch it.
893000	895000	Well, what do you want to know about it?
895000	896000	How was it?
896000	897000	What do you get out of it?
897000	898000	What do I get out of it?
898000	900000	It's just like watching a competition on TV.
900000	903000	It could be baseball or another sport or whatever.
903000	907000	It's just a sport to me, and I love watching the competition.
907000	913000	A card game is kind of boring sometimes, but the actual video game is really fun to watch.
913000	916000	So I watched a lot of the...
916000	920000	I saw some Swiss on Friday, which is where they just kind of randomly fight each other.
920000	921000	They get paired up.
921000	926000	And then I saw some of the top eight yesterday, and I saw the top four yesterday before it
926000	928000	cut out, and then watched the...
928000	930000	And that was all for Masters.
930000	931000	I only watched the Masters.
931000	935000	And then today I watched the Finals for Juniors, Seniors, and Masters.
935000	939000	And USA took everything for those, so that's nice.
939000	943000	But we got shut out in the card game, but who cares?
943000	946000	Which I still don't understand how the card game works.
947000	950000	And the card game's where all the money's at too, because first place as a Master gets
950000	952000	you $25,000.
952000	953000	You gotta buy all those cards.
953000	954000	That's where the money goes.
954000	955000	I guess.
955000	956000	To beef up those debts.
956000	958000	Not that expensive to get.
958000	961000	Don't spend no $25,000 on them.
961000	962000	Well, so we went...
962000	966000	I mean, that was a big chunk of the morning just to go there and shop for things that
966000	967000	pretty much you could buy online.
967000	968000	Nope.
968000	969000	Nope.
969000	970000	That's not true.
970000	974000	Some people, yes, like something you got, yeah, and what Tyler got.
974000	978000	But if you were smart like me, you only got the stuff that's branded Worlds, because that
978000	979000	will not go online.
979000	982000	Well, and also, if I don't get it now, I'm not going to think to go online later and
982000	983000	get it.
983000	984000	That's true.
984000	986000	Sometimes it just boils down to that.
986000	990000	But I don't even like Pikachu, but I love the San Francisco Pikachu, because he's holding
990000	993000	a little trolley car, and he's adorable.
993000	998000	And if I could get San Francisco Pikachu in the game, I'd probably play with Pikachu sometimes.
998000	1000000	So they announced that the next one's in Anaheim.
1000000	1003000	Yeah, today they announced it's in Anaheim, which is kind of surprising.
1003000	1008000	I thought they would have moved off of the continent and gone like Europe or something.
1008000	1009000	Or the other coast, at least.
1009000	1012000	Even though they were just in Boston, you'd think they'd at least go, but that's kind
1012000	1013000	of surprising.
1013000	1014000	They're not going that far away.
1014000	1016000	But that's awesome, because that's another road trip potential.
1016000	1021000	If they let people in, but I made a decision that I'm going to try to play competitively
1021000	1025000	this year, so I don't have to worry about not being allowed to go.
1025000	1028000	Even if I lose first day, I'll still get to watch everything.
1028000	1031000	So you are, this is a big declaration you're making.
1031000	1034000	You are going to try to compete in Pokemon at the competitive level.
1034000	1037000	Yes, starting with Generation 7.
1037000	1039000	How are you going to prepare for that?
1039000	1043000	Well, Generation 7's almost going to be a reset, because it's like everything changes.
1043000	1045000	That's why I'm not really caring about it right now.
1045000	1046000	I'm just sticking with my shiny hunting.
1046000	1047000	Okay, I got you.
1047000	1048000	So what are you going to do to prepare?
1048000	1051000	Like, how are you going to play Pokemon even more than I already do?
1051000	1057000	I really don't know how it's going to work, but I'll start following.
1058000	1063000	Like, I've already started to follow some of the best on Twitter, and I know there's
1063000	1068000	like YouTubes I can watch to kind of learn more about the competitive side, and so I'm
1068000	1070000	just going to kind of immerse myself in that.
1070000	1074000	Because, man, winning $25,000, it's what?
1074000	1077000	It's not 25 for the video game.
1077000	1079000	I forget how much it's like $15,000, I think.
1079000	1080000	Something like that.
1080000	1083000	But if you could win that, that's pretty awesome.
1083000	1086000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1086000	1091000	SSG100Matt says, Shane is going to have a Rocky IV training montage in the snowy mountains.
1091000	1092000	Are you going to get people to train you?
1092000	1096000	You were talking today about getting that 10-year-old kid that won the juniors to train
1096000	1097000	you.
1097000	1099000	Yeah, there's some 10-year-old that could have totally killed me at this.
1099000	1101000	I'm like, he should be my trainer.
1101000	1104000	Because he said he wanted to give back to the community, so hey, I'm a case.
1104000	1108000	I may be ordering a Team Rocket tank top right now.
1108000	1110000	What a perfect fit.
1110000	1111000	That's awesome.
1111000	1112000	I love it.
1112000	1113000	Let's see.
1113000	1116000	Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.
1116000	1119000	Actf says, I missed the Pokken tournament stuff at Worlds.
1119000	1121000	I think everybody did.
1121000	1123000	They did that in the beginning real fast.
1123000	1125000	Yeah, the finals were yesterday.
1125000	1128000	Everything else was today because they didn't care enough, I don't think.
1128000	1129000	It's just not big enough yet.
1129000	1133000	I have to say, though, for something as massive as Pokemon Worlds is supposed to be,
1133000	1136000	I was a little surprised at how small that venue was.
1136000	1139000	Because you remember, we got to go in the hotel where they were having it.
1139000	1142000	We just couldn't go in the actual hall where the competition was going on.
1142000	1146000	But it seemed like they were really only doing it in one hall there.
1146000	1150000	And then the Pokemon Center was another little space that was kind of off to the side.
1150000	1152000	Can't they just get in?
1152000	1158000	It was interesting because this place where it was at was literally across the street from Moscone Center,
1158000	1160000	where they did TwitchCon.
1160000	1161000	And the PlayStation event.
1161000	1163000	And the PlayStation event a couple years ago.
1163000	1164000	No, last year.
1164000	1165000	Oh, was it last year, too?
1165000	1167000	I thought they moved it one year to Vegas.
1167000	1168000	Vegas was the first one.
1168000	1170000	Vegas was the first one. Last year was Moscone.
1170000	1173000	Okay, okay. I got it all mixed up. But whatever. So they did Moscone.
1173000	1177000	So it just kind of surprised me that the Pokemon Worlds thing just didn't do Moscone,
1177000	1179000	and then they could have fit more people in there.
1179000	1182000	Yeah, but I really think it was a precaution.
1182000	1186000	I mean, they would have let people in, I bet, more spectators.
1186000	1190000	Because they eventually did start letting spectators in through various ways to get badges.
1190000	1193000	But I think they would have done it had Go not come out.
1193000	1195000	I think Go really is what killed it.
1195000	1197000	Exactly. Go brought out all the fucking retards.
1197000	1199000	And I'm sorry. No, seriously.
1199000	1200000	It's not a nice thing to say.
1200000	1203000	It's exactly the thing to say. You know why?
1203000	1207000	Because when people were playing Ingress, there weren't fucking signs that said,
1207000	1210000	I'm sorry, Pokemon Go players. Maybe don't throw your trash on the ground.
1210000	1214000	Don't try to access classified fucking secure locations.
1214000	1218000	Because you don't have to tell people that have common sense that.
1218000	1221000	They're like, hmm, maybe I shouldn't go there.
1221000	1223000	Whereas Pokemon Go players are like,
1223000	1227000	I'm gonna walk through the door because you're the Pikachu over there.
1227000	1230000	I'm sorry. No, it's just.
1230000	1233000	If you have to tell people that, you know.
1233000	1237000	Like, why do I have 50,000 stupid pop-ups on fucking Go?
1237000	1239000	Please don't trespass. Please don't play in your car.
1239000	1242000	Oh, yeah, fuck that. I'm gonna play in my car all the fucking time I want.
1242000	1245000	Because I've been doing Ingress and it's been just fine.
1245000	1248000	You know, hey, be respectful of this and that.
1248000	1250000	I mean, come on.
1250000	1252000	Nobody gives a shit.
1252000	1254000	And that's why. Because those people would be like,
1254000	1258000	oh, I'm gonna go in here. I'm gonna catch a Pokemon.
1258000	1262000	Darktitsuyu in chat says, wow, Loki, I just can't even right now.
1262000	1267000	Yeah, same. But to a point, I agree to a point.
1267000	1271000	Because we talked about this on Pokestop podcast this week, cheap plug.
1271000	1277000	Was that, you know, the sales of the 3DS have been impacted by Pokemon Go.
1277000	1280000	And it is causing a lot more people to become interested in Pokemon
1280000	1284000	that weren't before. Hell, I'm kind of even one of them.
1284000	1287000	Like, I think for a long time, Shane was like, Rob, play Pokemon.
1287000	1289000	No, Rob, play Pokemon. No.
1289000	1291000	Or I would, but I'd kind of quit by the first gym.
1291000	1295000	But then when Go came out, it was like, oh, I'm kind of feeling energized about Pokemon again.
1295000	1301000	And I've been playing the handheld games more than I have in an extremely long time.
1301000	1304000	So, and now I do this podcast about it, too.
1304000	1307000	So it's like, you know, and there's a lot of people, I think, in my shoes.
1307000	1311000	A lot of the guests we've had on the Pokestop podcast have said the same thing.
1311000	1316000	They've said that, you know, well, I was playing in like Gen 1, 2, and then I kind of fell out of it.
1316000	1317000	But Pokemon Go has brought me back.
1317000	1323000	So actually, you know, even though Loki uses very extreme descriptions in what he's saying,
1323000	1330000	but I think the point about Pokemon Go is causing this huge in-surge of interest in Pokemon that wasn't there before.
1330000	1332000	I think that is true.
1332000	1338000	I think, and I think that there's a lot of assumptions that, oh, they were going to spawn a legendary of Pokemon worlds.
1338000	1343000	And I think they kind of had to go out of their way to say, that ain't happening, stay home.
1343000	1344000	Another thing.
1344000	1348000	Would they listen like they would listen to all the pop-ups in the app? No, they're not.
1348000	1354000	Another thing that I think also kind of ruined it for spectators this year is the addition of Pokken Tournament.
1354000	1359000	Because from what I understand, it was really easy to qualify to get into worlds.
1359000	1367000	So people that wanted a guaranteed like, you know, badge at worlds so they could get the cool free stuff, that may have overflowed it as well.
1367000	1373000	But the joke was on them because their badges were only good for a day unless they qualified for the second day.
1373000	1374000	Interesting.
1374000	1376000	But they still got all the cool free stuff.
1376000	1378000	I just think they should just pick a bigger venue next time.
1378000	1381000	I mean, now they know Pokemon is a bigger deal.
1381000	1384000	Pokemon Go is probably going to bring more people in.
1384000	1387000	And it'll be interesting to see if that's represented at worlds next year.
1387000	1388000	I'd be very, I mean.
1388000	1389000	I don't think it will be.
1389000	1391000	There's not really competition in Pokemon Go.
1391000	1397000	But they could do a live event in Anaheim if Niantic is ready to start hosting those for Pokemon.
1397000	1399000	Because they're still doing them for Ingress.
1399000	1404000	What? Denver and Portland, Maine have big events next Saturday for Ingress.
1404000	1408000	So Niantic will start doing it for Pokemon Go eventually.
1408000	1410000	It's just a matter of what and when.
1410000	1412000	So we'll see.
1412000	1414000	Let's see.
1414000	1416000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1416000	1423000	Dungeon Buster says, kind of sad when places like the National Holocaust Museum have to ask people not to look for Pokemon there.
1423000	1425000	And again, I talked about this a little bit on Pokestop.
1425000	1427000	I'll just summarize it here.
1427000	1439000	A lot of that has to do with an error that Niantic made by they incentivized people to submit as many portals, which are the Pokestops and Ingress.
1439000	1442000	They incentivized people to submit as many of those as they could.
1442000	1444000	Because you got a badge for it.
1444000	1448000	And leveling up in Ingress is locked behind badges at a certain point.
1448000	1453000	You know, I want to play devil's advocate really quick, which I hate doing. I think it's a dumb thing to do.
1453000	1454000	But you're going to do it anyway.
1454000	1455000	Yeah, but I'm going to do it anyway.
1455000	1461000	While it is terrible for people to go to the National Holocaust Museum or whatever for Pokemon Go.
1461000	1466000	It also might be the only reason why they'd ever go and then actually get exposed to that stuff.
1466000	1468000	I don't necessarily disagree with that.
1468000	1473000	But I think, you know, you want to not stare at your phone the entire time. You got to look up.
1473000	1480000	Well, yeah, but I feel like if I were to go, like if I played Pokemon Go like that and I were to go to a place like that museum.
1480000	1485000	Yeah, I'd do my Pokemon Go, but I feel like I would be so interested in seeing the rest of the stuff.
1485000	1494000	It's a business like, well, I don't know if they charge you or whatever, but I think it's like a good way to actually make me more interested in going there.
1494000	1501000	You also understand the boundaries of common respect, which unfortunately the teenagers to it, not to brand all teenagers, but sorry, guys.
1501000	1509000	You know, it's a lot of that that's doing this is at these cemeteries and stuff that are disrespecting the area and so forth that you were mentioning earlier.
1509000	1515000	I think it's that audience that they can't be respectful, like you're mentioning that Arunia.
1515000	1520000	Because, well, because Ingress has existed for years and those portals have existed for a long time.
1520000	1523000	Why is it only just now coming out?
1523000	1525000	Because it wasn't as popular as Pokemon.
1525000	1527000	And that's true. That's true. And that's a fair read.
1527000	1536000	But, you know, but I think the players, the general player base also kind of knew a little bit more how to respect a place like that, if that makes sense.
1536000	1543000	So, um, anyway, uh, and as 200 Matt and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, it's all about being respectful.
1543000	1547000	If someone isn't being respectful, then they ruin ruin it for everyone.
1547000	1548000	Ain't that the truth?
1548000	1562000	Um, before we get into our gaming weeks, I just wanted to talk quickly about competitive gaming because I kind of found watching, even though I didn't get to watch a lot of it because I was driving, but listening to the commentary for Pokemon worlds, I found it very fascinating.
1562000	1565000	You know, I, I, I'm more casual Pokemon fan and I admit that openly.
1565000	1574000	Um, so I thought it was interesting, but it was like, wow, I really, I really can't dissect it on the level that they are. I know Shane can.
1574000	1577000	But yeah, like I'd start laughing or be like, well, that's so cool. And you wouldn't understand.
1577000	1580000	Yeah, I didn't. Well, a, I didn't see it and b, I didn't wouldn't necessarily understand.
1580000	1581000	You can just listen.
1581000	1595000	But I just thought, I think it's very interesting that now we live in this age of, of the direct broadcasting because of things like Twitch, heck, because of things like podcasting and live streaming, that we have more niche gaming events.
1595000	1602000	Although, you know, I realize I'm calling Pokemon a niche gaming event, but in some, in some elements it is, it's just one of the larger ones. We'll, we'll leave it at that.
1602000	1610000	Oh my God. And this year's worlds is going to spawn so much fan fiction because of the German player and the U S player that totally are in love.
1610000	1618000	And they had this like Pokeball pendant that splits in half and they each have piece of it. And it's just, it's going viral.
1618000	1626000	Okay. But it's okay. But it's stories like that. Like there's that. And the fact that, you know, when we, when even you were watching it, I was like, what are you watching the Olympics over there?
1627000	1633000	Because they're doing all these profiles of the people and like, this is where they come from. And this is how I was training my Pokemon.
1633000	1641000	Like all these things that I would expect to see during the Olympics and your witty retort, which was kind of true was, yeah, this is the Olympics of Pokemon gaming.
1641000	1646000	And I was like, Oh, so I guess this is just the way we treat all sports broadcasts at that level.
1646000	1651000	But I, I just, I thought that was very interesting that, you know, it was, it was kind of all put together like that.
1651000	1657000	And then, you know, you have former champions that are doing a lot of the commentating, which I, you know, I find that kind of stuff very interesting.
1657000	1663000	And that they will say, Oh, and so-and-so this guy's a household name, you know, in the Pokemon community.
1663000	1664000	And they were right.
1664000	1668000	And I'm thinking, I'm like, who the hell is this person? I've never heard this name before. Shane had to explain it to me.
1668000	1672000	But when you explain, well, what's the guy's name? What do you know?
1672000	1673000	Seijun Park.
1673000	1676000	Okay. And he's a big deal because he won worlds with a Pachirisu.
1676000	1684000	Yeah. He, okay. So he won worlds with a Pokemon that's kind of a, I don't want to say a trash Pokemon, but it's not one that you would expect to see in a finals.
1684000	1687000	And if I'm not mistaken, doesn't he also compete in the card game?
1687000	1690000	I think that was his first, this year was his first time. He got like 29th, I think.
1690000	1700000	See, so once I hear all that, I'm like, okay, well that, that makes sense why people that are really into Pokemon, like, Oh, it's, it's like that guy who plays baseball and plays football or basketball.
1700000	1702000	Wasn't there some sports guy that did that?
1702000	1703000	Michael Jordan.
1703000	1704000	Was it Michael Jordan?
1704000	1705000	He played baseball.
1705000	1711000	He played baseball. Okay. He wasn't the only one though. And not the one I was thinking off the top of my head. There was somebody who did like football.
1711000	1713000	The Charamzy is Bo Jackson.
1713000	1717000	Okay. Yeah, that sounds right. Bo Jackson. Thank you. So yeah, he's kind of like that.
1717000	1718000	Does Bo know Pokemon?
1718000	1722000	Maybe, you know, I'm sure he's retired at this point. So maybe, who knows?
1722000	1724000	Oh my God. I can't believe I did an eighties reference.
1726000	1734000	So anyway, um, I just, I just thought, I just thought it was very fascinating. What do you guys think of this, this competitive gaming stuff?
1734000	1735000	I love it.
1735000	1737000	Do you watch any of it? Do you watch any besides Pokemon?
1737000	1738000	No.
1738000	1739000	No?
1739000	1740000	No, none of the rest of that's interesting to me.
1740000	1745000	It adds a little bit of legitimacy to the years and years of being made fun of for being a girl gamer.
1745000	1747000	Yeah, I could see that.
1747000	1758000	Yeah. It's just, I get to go back and get, you see all these people who are making money doing all the stuff that you gave me shit for. Fuck you.
1758000	1768000	Yeah. And I, you know, and I have to admit like when they were doing the Ingress live thing from San Diego, they were doing a very similar type of broadcast and they would talk about the strategy and so forth.
1768000	1782000	And I was like super into it because I play Ingress really heavy. And I was like, this is so rad that this is getting like an ESPN level treatment and that they're talking about it, like on this serious level, which, you know, I'm really invested in the game.
1782000	1783000	So I kind of,
1783000	1784000	When was that?
1784000	1787000	It was during the San Diego anomaly. They actually did that live broadcast.
1787000	1799000	And they were doing, I think they used a group that does a bunch of YouTube videos. And so I think they kind of leverage that and they kind of did live broadcast, but I just, you know, watching it was, was awesome.
1799000	1804000	And like, you know, they were talking about the strategy. Oh, it looks like a resistance is the resistance is throwing a link through the city.
1804000	1810000	And it looks like what they're trying to do is prevent the enlightened from linking from here to here. And did it, you know, they'll just kind of analyze it on the big map.
1810000	1816000	Like it's like watching Madden draw the plays on the map with the pen, you know, it's like, like, like, like that kind of thing.
1816000	1826000	So I just, I kind of love that that exists for all these different games, no matter what it is that you're into, like Shane's into Pokemon, I'm into Ingress, Dark Soccer.
1826000	1832000	What were you watching when you saw this Dark Soccer? What, what, what, what competitive stuff do you like to watch?
1832000	1836000	Um, America's Next Top Model?
1836000	1838000	Drag Race?
1838000	1848000	I'll take it. Drag Race. You know what, you know what, you laugh, but believe me, and you know, this comes from somebody who does co-host a Drag Race podcast.
1848000	1850000	I was just watching the bad hair makeovers, that's all.
1850000	1856000	People treat Drag Race like it is a Olympic sport.
1856000	1858000	This is not RuPaul's best friend race.
1858000	1865000	Exactly. I mean, whatever it is that you're into, it's kind of, kind of neat to see that, to see things dive.
1865000	1867000	It is the Drag Olympics.
1868000	1877000	I love it. Let's see. JD is in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com saying, I'm excited for Drag Race to come back this week. Okay.
1877000	1882000	Yes. Okay. I already put in my order on my Apple TV.
1882000	1883000	Love it.
1883000	1887000	So I could watch it. And I need people to watch it with me.
1887000	1894000	All right. Let's, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1894000	1899000	We'll talk about television later, but video games. Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing this week?
1899000	1907000	I got back into Danganronpa 2. I got into, I'm still playing Sims 4 a little bit.
1907000	1914000	I just got my controller for my Apple TV. So I'm going to be playing some Sonic CD on it.
1914000	1921000	And, um, we busted out the ColecoVision and I think my needs, it's a power thing fixed. So that's shitty.
1923000	1930000	Oh, yeah. And Peggle and Pokemon Go and, um, Miitomo. Cause now it's the Metroid week. So I have like Samus gear.
1930000	1932000	Oh yeah. I got to sign in to actually get that stuff.
1932000	1933000	Hurry.
1933000	1938000	I finally fell off the Miitomo bandwagon. I was playing it longer than anybody. And then I finally stopped.
1938000	1939000	Miitomo is great.
1939000	1943000	No, it's still cute. All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1943000	1951000	Um, I played mainly just Ingress and a little bit of Pokemon Go. A lot of Ingress actually, which is kind of weird, but, um, yeah.
1951000	1957000	And I just checked the leaderboard. Apparently I'm ranked eight in our little cell here. So that's pretty good.
1957000	1962000	Um, I just, it's been easy because no one's been taking down stuff.
1962000	1969000	You know, normally I get a lot of like pushback from the other team, but nope, they've been like on vacation or something.
1969000	1973000	So it's been very like, Oh, Hey, I can throw this field over here.
1973000	1979000	There was a lot of drama, which I'm not going to get into on this part, but yeah, there was, there was a lot of drama.
1979000	1984000	But even still though, I mean like they've been having to send people from other areas and to clean up my stuff.
1984000	1990000	And we had Pepper hit through here and they had Marty the other day come through. Although he was like, like incredibly lazy.
1990000	1995000	Like just like, yeah, I'm going to destroy this thing. Oh, but I'm going to leave one resident around there.
1995000	1997000	I can't believe you're naming names on this show.
1997000	2000000	I don't care. It doesn't matter. No one knows who we're talking about.
2000000	2008000	Um, but it's like, it's incredibly lazy. It's like, dude, like I literally, I'm lazy when I bust stuff, I find the hub, I kill it and then I move on.
2008000	2017000	I'm literally like, I literally just drove back and just read through it even bigger. Like I'm like, fine, cool.
2017000	2020000	You have to block if you're going to, and that's the, that's the way to do it.
2020000	2026000	He threw one link, so it was cool, but unfortunately he threw it from the portal that's by my house and he didn't shield anything.
2026000	2031000	So I was like, okay, well I'm just going to break this really fast. And then, so yeah, so I played that.
2031000	2037000	Um, I played a little bit more No Man's Sky. Um, just haven't done a whole lot with that though.
2037000	2044000	Um, and then I played a little bit of Tap My Katamari. I did eventually update the app so I can't do the exploit anymore.
2044000	2054000	And I really wish I hadn't because the update, what they added was, hey, there's some candy offers you can do by doing some bullshit that, you know.
2054000	2059000	You know, have you ever seen those things when you try to go to websites? Like, oh hey, you want to download this file?
2059000	2066000	You're going to need to do one of these offers for it to work. And the offers, you end up doing it and it never fucking credits you for it.
2066000	2070000	Yep, that's, that's fucking Tap My Katamari. It's just a piece of shit.
2070000	2075000	It's funny though, is they also had some of these games that they advertised in their, um, thing.
2075000	2079000	They have like these little interactive ads, which I think are pretty cool and it gets you interested in the game.
2079000	2083000	So I was like, oh hey, you know what? These tower defense games look pretty cool. I'm going to try downloading one of them.
2083000	2092000	And I downloaded it and it's completely fucking different than that little demo. It is just like, holy shit, this stuff is just super complicated.
2092000	2098000	And it just feels like that they're trying to get me to pay. They're just like shoving those transactions just down my throat.
2098000	2100000	I'm like, nah, I'm uninstalling this immediately.
2100000	2111000	It was just like, what the fuck is going on here? This is not at all. It's just like so blatant with, oh please have, we want money. Give us your money. Money now.
2111000	2117000	Um, so I just kind of ignored that, but yeah, I'm hopefully going to play some more in a man's sky.
2117000	2122000	I really do need to go back to Fallout now that all that DLC is out and I haven't actually played any of it yet.
2122000	2125000	So I need to do that. That's it.
2125000	2133000	All right. By the way, just some late breaking news because some folks are sharing this in the chat room, um, over at live.voggenover.com and I'm seeing this on Twitter.
2133000	2137000	Apparently during the Olympics, because the Rio closing ceremony is going on right now.
2137000	2145000	Well, they always do at the end of the closing ceremonies, they always, you know, pass the torch, so to speak, to the next city that's hosting the Olympics, which is going to be Tokyo.
2145000	2156000	Tokyo is hosting the Olympics in 2020. Well, apparently, uh, somebody came out actually dressed as Mario, uh, and they actually did a whole little montage.
2156000	2158000	Yeah, it's on Twitter right now. They did a whole little Mario montage.
2158000	2160000	I saw it was the Japanese prime minister.
2160000	2161000	Was that the Japanese prime minister?
2161000	2162000	That's what it said on Twitter.
2162000	2163000	Oh wow. Okay.
2163000	2167000	Got it. Got to sell those Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games.
2167000	2168000	Right.
2168000	2170000	They have an arcade machine of that.
2170000	2172000	Like, yeah, they do.
2172000	2175000	It's four player, crazy, huge, ginormous garbage.
2175000	2182000	So yeah. So, um, you know, just, just a little, I bring that up here and interrupt the show to mention that because you know, that's kind of, kind of a big deal.
2182000	2187000	You know, the Olympics kind of a big deal for a lot of people since we've just been talking about competitive gaming and so forth.
2187000	2193000	And, and the fact that, you know, Mario just made an appearance at that event is, is kind of a big deal.
2193000	2198000	Uh, and, and it turns out it's the prime minister nonetheless. That's pretty, pretty darn big deal.
2198000	2204000	So anyway, the prime minister of Japan is Mario? Man, I learned something today.
2204000	2211000	All right. Anyway, uh, Shane, how was your gaming week? What did you play this week?
2211000	2214000	One day two of not having any shinies in Pokemon.
2214000	2215000	You poor thing.
2215000	2218000	Um, it hurts me physically right now.
2218000	2223000	Uh, other than that, I, uh, can start playing PS4 games again.
2223000	2226000	Yes, I got a PS4 controller finally.
2226000	2228000	Not going to throw this one away in a Taco Bell bag.
2228000	2230000	I hope not at least.
2230000	2235000	And then I played DDR and only played my songs.
2235000	2236000	That's all we played.
2236000	2240000	And I'm a jerk I've decided because some of those were just way too tiring for me.
2241000	2245000	It also makes me realize I'm going to start going to the gym because that was just pathetic.
2245000	2251000	Yeah, I, I really need to go to the gym too. So, but then it's like, ah, but I'm going to be maybe leaving for a week.
2251000	2253000	And so I won't get any exercise in while I'm at Dragon Con.
2253000	2258000	In fact, that's going to be worse for my health because I'll be doing so much drinking while I'm at Dragon Con.
2258000	2263000	But I'm, I'm all for trying to get up and do more exercise and DDR is always a great motivator for that.
2263000	2269000	Yeah, it was. It just kicked my butt. And so I've got to fix that for whenever I play it again.
2269000	2271000	Okay, I'm watching the clip.
2271000	2272000	Yeah.
2272000	2277000	And he's just, it's Mario going down a pipe in Tokyo in the big crosswalk at Shibuya.
2277000	2283000	And then coming up wearing a robe that he drops off of him and he's just wearing the Mario hat.
2283000	2284000	Yeah.
2284000	2285000	That's not.
2285000	2287000	Okay, but still, come on. That's acknowledging.
2287000	2288000	It's cute, but.
2288000	2292000	It's acknowledging that the next Olympics are going to be in the Mushroom Kingdom and they better watch out for Koopa.
2292000	2295000	You think it was bad with thieves in fucking Rio.
2295000	2297000	You got the fucking Koopas to deal with now.
2299000	2300000	At least it won't be.
2300000	2305000	And you better not be sending any princesses because that shit is just going to get fucking kidnapped.
2305000	2312000	At least it's not going to be in a place where the government allows its citizens to remain impoverished while spending all that money on a big Olympic stadium. I mean.
2312000	2317000	Well, and hopefully nobody lies about Wendy Okupa robbing them, but you know, anyway.
2317000	2318000	They just pee on her though.
2318000	2320000	What a piece of shit, okay?
2320000	2331000	I'm going to do an early F you to that piece of shit who pretty much got away with being a major asshole when people are giving Gabby shit for not holding her hand over her heart.
2331000	2334000	Sorry, he's a fucking embarrassment.
2334000	2335000	Okay, I'm done.
2335000	2336000	All right.
2336000	2337000	Lots of feelings.
2337000	2338000	All right.
2338000	2339000	Let's see.
2339000	2340000	My gaming week.
2340000	2342000	So I went to round one with Shane, obviously.
2342000	2348000	I'm really sad I didn't get to play DDR ace, but there were just so many people like, you know, there's just a huge line.
2348000	2350000	And so I got to watch a little bit of it.
2350000	2353000	It looked neat, but I want an addendum.
2353000	2354000	Oh, please.
2354000	2357000	I played time crisis five because I love time crisis.
2357000	2360000	Time crisis five is garbage or at least the one around one.
2360000	2363000	Oh, the guns are not calibrated whatsoever.
2363000	2366000	So you will like hold perfectly still and shoot.
2366000	2371000	And it's just going to go all over the place, at least on their machine, which really ruined the experience for me.
2371000	2374000	So I hate that game now.
2374000	2376000	What was I going to say?
2376000	2377000	So, okay.
2377000	2378000	So, yeah, round one.
2378000	2381000	I did play DDR supernova two because that's the machine we played on.
2381000	2382000	You can get on ace.
2382000	2383000	No, nobody.
2383000	2384000	Everybody was playing ace.
2384000	2385000	So nobody was playing supernova to us.
2385000	2388000	I was like, all right, well, I haven't played this game a lot.
2388000	2389000	A lot.
2389000	2390000	I played it before, but not a lot.
2390000	2392000	So I played it, played around on that.
2392000	2401000	But I actually played, you know, the music game I played more than anything was I played pop and music because it's been a long time since I really like sat down and played some pop music.
2401000	2404000	So I actually played like I played like several games back to back.
2404000	2413000	And if you don't know pop and music, imagine a music game where the controller is trouble with the Pop-O-Matic bubble.
2413000	2415000	It's nine of those.
2415000	2416000	And that's how you control.
2416000	2417000	Because that was the best part about playing that game.
2417000	2418000	You all know what I'm talking about, right?
2418000	2419000	The board game trouble.
2419000	2420000	The Pop-O-Matic bubble.
2420000	2424000	Well, imagine that that was a game that you just hit that bubble over and over in time.
2424000	2425000	You mean it wasn't?
2425000	2428000	Wait, why are we talking about how pop and music works?
2428000	2429000	Because did you not just hear?
2429000	2431000	That's what I played a bunch of at round one.
2431000	2432000	I was looking at text and playing Pokemon.
2432000	2433000	Good lord.
2433000	2436000	So I played like a bunch of games of pop and music.
2436000	2439000	No, but everybody that listens to this show probably knows.
2439000	2440000	Not everybody. Not everybody.
2440000	2441000	At this point?
2441000	2442000	Maybe.
2442000	2443000	At this point?
2443000	2445000	I'm just giving you the quick description in case you don't know.
2445000	2451000	But I will say after playing that, like my hands were glowing red.
2451000	2452000	Like didn't I show you?
2452000	2456000	I was like, look, my hands are in pain because I played so much pop music back to back.
2456000	2457000	But it was worth it.
2457000	2458000	It was fun.
2458000	2459000	I like pop music.
2459000	2465000	I played a little 2DX as well and some of the other stuff in the arcade that I enjoy.
2465000	2469000	And then as far as home games go, I've been playing more World of Warcraft.
2469000	2472000	I've been doing a lot of invasions to level up my character in World of Warcraft.
2472000	2474000	So that's been fun.
2474000	2480000	And then I played some more No Man's Sky this week, which I'm still enjoying that game.
2480000	2482000	Alan's making me think I missed something, though.
2482000	2487000	Like now he has me wondering, like, do I need to go back to a galaxy I was in a while ago
2487000	2490000	because I might have missed something or will it show up eventually?
2490000	2494000	Apparently I missed the recipe for the Atlas Pass somehow.
2494000	2498000	Like he got it in the galaxy right after he visited the first Atlas.
2498000	2500000	That didn't happen to me.
2500000	2503000	So did I miss it? Was I not looking out?
2503000	2506000	I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out the whole hyperdrive things.
2506000	2508000	You're still trying to figure out how to get off the goddamn planet?
2508000	2511000	Oh, I've already gone off the goddamn planet and then went to another planet.
2511000	2514000	And I was like, oh, hey, I'm going to find I found a broken ship.
2514000	2515000	I'm going to fix it up and take it.
2515000	2521000	And then so I fix it up and I'm like, oh, shit, I don't have a hyperdrive or the means to make a hyperdrive.
2521000	2527000	Where's my old ship? Oh, fuck, I don't remember the fuck that is because I looked and I don't know where it is.
2527000	2530000	So now I'm worried. I'm like, do I have to start the whole thing over?
2530000	2535000	But I feel like, OK, if I miss something, the game will put it back.
2535000	2540000	It's like the recipe that you can like not get on that first planet or whatever.
2540000	2543000	Like if you have the DLC thing, you get that recipe eventually.
2543000	2546000	But you just it might take you a while to get it. So I don't know.
2546000	2551000	Well, we'll see. I'm hoping I don't didn't miss that thing for good, but I've still been enjoying No Man's Sky.
2551000	2555000	I like exploring the different planets and stuff. I realize there's still a lot of controversy.
2555000	2560000	There's a lot of stuff, though, there like I found like when I was flying from place to place, I'm like, oh, there's another settlement.
2560000	2565000	That's exactly the same as the last settlement and no one there and the same chairs turned over.
2565000	2571000	It's like like some alien race came in there. I'm throwing this chair over exactly the same in every single one of these places.
2571000	2575000	Fucking like space, you know, trailers or whatever.
2575000	2578000	When you consider it, the whole thing is randomly generated.
2578000	2581000	Obviously, there are some templates that come up in the random.
2581000	2585000	Oh, I found some pretty fucked up buildings that are like up in the air.
2585000	2590000	And there's like one of those shrine things that the idols that you're supposed to find.
2590000	2596000	It shows me a map spot. I go there. There's a lake. There's nothing there. Not even in the lake.
2596000	2599000	It must be below the ground somewhere. I don't know how the hell to get down there.
2599000	2602000	Oh, the same thing happened to me. It's like there's like a shrine below the lake.
2602000	2607000	And I'm like, where the fuck is this? Because there was one in a lake, which is fine.
2607000	2609000	But like, nope, there's nothing here.
2609000	2610000	Oh, God.
2610000	2613000	And they keep going to those places like where you can like find stuff.
2613000	2617000	It's all located shrine. Cool. It keeps sending back to that one that there's nothing there.
2617000	2618000	Fuck, you know what I just realized?
2618000	2622000	Alan was trying to tell me what the thing looked like that I missed.
2622000	2625000	I think that was the thing at the bottom of the lake.
2625000	2627000	Alan, are you listening? Is Alan listening to the show?
2627000	2630000	Did the lady of the lake forget to throw you a sword?
2630000	2634000	Alan, if you're listening, I think the purple dot was at the bottom of the lake.
2634000	2638000	No, that's on Atlas Pass. That's something to learn language and stuff.
2638000	2640000	Oh, OK. Oh, I guess this is a web.
2640000	2645000	But yeah, I don't know. Whatever. We'll figure it out.
2645000	2648000	All right. So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
2648000	2654000	A lot of the standard stuff besides a fun trip to round one with Shane and our other friend.
2654000	2659000	So that brings us to housekeeping. Do follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.
2659000	2662000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash orange lounge radio.
2662000	2670000	And we will be bringing back interactivity on Facebook and Google in the coming weeks.
2670000	2673000	So stay tuned for that, because I know some of you have been wondering what happened to that.
2673000	2677000	And we have a plan. So there's that.
2677000	2687000	Also, I wanted to say we will not be here in two weeks because I will be back east for Dragon Con in Atlanta, Georgia.
2687000	2695000	I know one thing I will be at for sure is the Parsec Awards, which were usually on Sunday night, if I'm not mistaken.
2695000	2700000	I don't know if they're Saturday or Sunday night this year, but look out for the Parsec Awards.
2700000	2707000	Our pal Brad and his crew over at Pod Culture were nominated for a Parsec Award for TARDIS interruptus,
2707000	2711000	which is their Doctor Who themed kind of spin off of Pod Culture.
2711000	2714000	So I'm very excited. OK. And Brad's confirming it Saturday.
2714000	2719000	So I'm very excited to go there and support him and hopefully he'll win.
2719000	2727000	But even if he doesn't, we're going to cheer him on all the same and all the great indie podcasters that make that stuff.
2727000	2732000	So we'll be there at the Parsec Awards. But that's the only thing I know for sure I'm doing.
2732000	2737000	Otherwise, I should be around the podcast track, the gaming track.
2737000	2740000	There's going to be an arcade at Dragon Con for the very first time.
2740000	2744000	A lot of these same Japanese games, now classic games, this is going to be a new thing for Dragon Con.
2744000	2747000	So I'm very excited about it. So I'll be there as well.
2747000	2751000	So we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be out of town in Atlanta.
2751000	2759000	That also is going to mark Jamie taking a leave from the show for a few months while she has her work schedule snafu thing going on.
2759000	2764000	So but she'll be back. You're going to have to take the day off for Episode 666 or something.
2764000	2769000	I just I can't we can't do that show without Jamie without the most evil person here.
2769000	2772000	I just need the day. Excuse me.
2772000	2775000	Well, you're pretty you're you're kind of an asshole, too. So I don't know.
2775000	2778000	We all need to be here to get out the Ouija board. That's for sure.
2778000	2783000	I just know what I want, but I just need the specific date so I can ask it off in enough time.
2783000	2786000	Sadly, we don't know it yet, but we'll we'll try to plot it out and figure it out.
2786000	2789000	But I thought that it was going to be in December after.
2789000	2790000	I think so.
2790000	2791000	Then I should be fine.
2791000	2796000	Yeah, well, we'll figure it out. I'll try to I'll try to bring up a calendar and we'll figure that out.
2796000	2800000	But we're going to get into some news right now and talk about what's going on in the gaming world this week.
2800000	2801000	So, Loki, what's up?
2801000	2809000	We'll just do like a holiday themed episode that's dedicated to Krampus and then it kind of ties both together.
2809000	2811000	I like it. I like it.
2811000	2814000	So No Man's Sky got a patch for PlayStation 4.
2814000	2820000	It's, I guess, improved some stability, which means I haven't actually played it since the patch yet.
2820000	2827000	It's supposed to improve some of the frame rate and also add support for more hardware, which I don't understand.
2827000	2829000	I guess that's more of the PC stuff.
2829000	2832000	Stability basically is the main thing.
2832000	2845000	I'm not sure if that was one of the things that they fixed was maybe the whole, I don't know, the issue with, you know, if you have the DLC shipped, not getting that hyperdrive recipe right away.
2845000	2848000	So maybe that was one of the things that was in there.
2848000	2849000	I will actually have to check that out.
2849000	2850000	But, yep.
2850000	2854000	So PC version, the patch should be, you know, should be coming around the same time.
2854000	2859000	So hopefully that's good because the PC version here is really broken.
2859000	2866000	So I did the plotting real quick for episode 666 because you guys have to hear this.
2866000	2868000	So we're not going to be here the week of Dragon Con.
2868000	2870000	So I took that that week out of it.
2870000	2873000	We won't be here the week of GamerX4 because VOG Network will be there.
2873000	2875000	So I took that week out of it.
2876000	2884000	Now, I don't remember if I am back in time on Sunday, the week of Final Fantasy Fan Fest, but I think I am.
2884000	2889000	So I think we still have a show that weekend of Final Fantasy Fan Fest because I'm only coming back from Vegas, which is now our flight.
2889000	2894000	So that puts episode 666 on the 20th of November.
2896000	2897000	It's just too perfect.
2899000	2900000	I shit you not.
2900000	2906000	The way things plot out right now, episode 666 is on 20 November.
2907000	2909000	Dark Sakura, do you think that'll work out?
2909000	2911000	I know it's a little early.
2911000	2913000	I don't know. Actually, that might be too early.
2913000	2914000	No.
2914000	2915000	I'll have to see what I can do.
2915000	2917000	No. Okay, I'll have to see what you can do.
2917000	2922000	Because that would work out a little too perfectly.
2924000	2929000	You have to admit that's a pretty perfect day for episode 666 to fall.
2931000	2938000	For those that may not know, that is the name of an old school song that was in DDR and Beatmania was 20 November.
2938000	2942000	Like in the very first. So it's really funny if it works out that it's that day.
2942000	2946000	Didn't that have to do with 20 November? Wasn't that something to do with Beatmania?
2946000	2950000	I think it was the release date, yeah. How ironic.
2951000	2958000	Going back to No Man's Sky real quick, some people are actually asking for refunds from PlayStation for No Man's Sky.
2958000	2961000	Because it is a broken piece of shit for some people.
2962000	2968000	So because of that, they've run into some issues with their return policy.
2969000	2974000	Apparently, I guess, you can do a return on.
2974000	2978000	But I guess the thing was they're not allowing you to repurchase it later on.
2978000	2986000	So say, yeah, it's not worth my purchase right now, but after they iron out all the bugs, I do want to repurchase this later on down the road.
2986000	2990000	They're saying that no, you can't. Which is a little unusual.
2990000	2995000	Steam, of course, I don't think has that sort of stimulation.
2995000	3003000	It's basically you can cancel the game, or if you haven't played two hours worth of the game, I think you can do a refund on that.
3004000	3008000	And then they said season passes, 14 days of data transaction for those.
3008000	3013000	Why not just go to the store and buy the physical game then, if they're not going to let you buy the-
3013000	3015000	I guess, I mean, yeah, you could do that.
3015000	3017000	That does seem strange.
3017000	3027000	Yeah, basically, I was told I couldn't rebuy off the store digitally, and I couldn't buy a physical copy because whatever system they employ in the background wouldn't let me run it.
3027000	3031000	They delete the license from your account, and that seems to put a block on it.
3031000	3039000	I would happily rebuy the game at a later date if it's improved, if the features promised were put in, and if the crashing was fixed.
3039000	3046000	Because these things do get fixed over time, but I didn't really want to get my money back and then never be able to play it again.
3046000	3048000	So it seems counterproductive.
3048000	3054000	Yeah, they basically said, okay, well, you can either wait for it to be fixed, or you get a refund and you can't play the game again.
3054000	3063000	That's a real weird- I mean, I understand the PlayStation 4 has the whole licensing thing, but that's a real weird convoluted thing.
3063000	3070000	I can't believe that they wouldn't still want people to try and buy it eventually, kind of like what Steam does. That's very odd.
3070000	3079000	And yeah, maybe I'm just special or something, but I have a PlayStation 4 I bought at launch.
3079000	3082000	Did the game crash on me? Yeah, maybe two or three times.
3082000	3088000	Maybe three times, but I sent the- the game saves so much. I hardly lost any progress, so just whatever.
3088000	3098000	Now, that was one person saying that. So basically, this article came from Eurogamer, and they had contacted Sony saying, hey, this kind of sounds a little odd.
3098000	3107000	I mean, you're really not going to allow them to repurchase it. And apparently, they were told that players who do get a refund for No Man's Sky would be able to rebuy the game in the future.
3107000	3111000	Contrary to what the representative had stated previously.
3111000	3112000	Interesting.
3112000	3125000	So, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I guess if you haven't purchased it yet, maybe just hold on until it gets better. Like, I kind of- you know, I was all gung ho about Just Cause 3, and that was a fucking mess.
3125000	3134000	You know, and I purchased it digitally, and yeah, I'm kind of stuck with it because, I don't know, I just- that's one game I haven't gone back to play in a while.
3134000	3137000	Do you wish you'd done a refund on it?
3137000	3142000	I wish I hadn't bought it in the first place, because that was just- I bought too many games around that time and just haven't gotten around to playing it.
3142000	3150000	And I, you know, I did buy it, and I was like, ooh, yeah, I'm really going to play this, and then I played, like, twice, and, eh, don't forget.
3150000	3158000	Alright, well, let's move on to talk about some more rumors and news that's brewing around the Nintendo NX.
3158000	3166000	Although, you know, part of the reason we like to bring these things up on the show is that, A, it's what a lot of people are talking about out there in the gaming blogs and gaming culture.
3166000	3175000	But, B, especially when we're talking about things like patents and so forth, you know, not that every patent is used, but it's usually a case of where there's smoke, there's fire type of thing.
3175000	3184000	And so these are things that are highly likely to be in the Nintendo NX. But, of course, we don't know for sure until Nintendo actually says.
3184000	3188000	Which is when, at this point, because are we expecting next month?
3188000	3191000	It's supposed to be, I think, next month, maybe? That's the thought?
3191000	3193000	I feel like it has to be.
3193000	3199000	As much of a rumor as any of these other things that are coming out, my assumption is that they will either get the jump on.
3199000	3206000	Well, I'm still sticking with they're going to announce in advance of Tokyo Game Show so that third parties can show their games at Tokyo Game Show.
3206000	3210000	Even though Nintendo doesn't participate themselves, they can still be part of the conversation.
3210000	3214000	That's still my prediction for when they announce as the week before Tokyo Game Show.
3214000	3219000	I think it's kind of unusual not to announce anything by now, I mean, because people are curious about it.
3220000	3226000	They're just repeating the mistakes they had with the Wii U. It's the same thing all over again.
3226000	3230000	They're not going to have time to get the branding out to make sure people understand what it is.
3230000	3235000	That's really what did the Wii U and it's like everybody didn't understand it and they still don't to this day.
3235000	3237000	All they have to do is add a splash screen to Pokemon Go.
3237000	3240000	People just say that doesn't affect that.
3240000	3245000	I don't think that's going to matter at this point because there's so many people playing Pokemon Go.
3245000	3249000	I don't think that, oh damn, I don't have anything to play this on is really a problem.
3249000	3259000	And honestly, by the time that comes out, since they haven't really announced any new expansions or anything that updates to it,
3259000	3265000	aside from fixing shit that should have been fixed a while ago, I don't think the hype and buzz is there right now.
3265000	3272000	I think that a month from now, even if you look at parks now, there's not a lot of people out there like it used to be at launch.
3272000	3276000	So I don't think that's going to be a big deal like, oh yeah, we have Pokemon Go.
3276000	3281000	Yeah, you and every fucking other phone out there. I mean, I just don't think that's going to be a big deal.
3281000	3287000	Well, we'll see. I mean, I knew the bubble was going to burst on that eventually, but we just talked about how 30 million people are still playing it.
3287000	3290000	So I'm just, that's one way they could get brand awareness out there.
3290000	3292000	But I think, you know, don't read too much into that.
3292000	3296000	But I don't think, I just don't think it's as doom and gloom as you guys think it is.
3296000	3301000	No, I don't. I think that's what they're relying on is Pokemon Go to launch that system.
3301000	3303000	And they need more than that.
3303000	3307000	I don't think it's doom and gloom. I just think they're falling into the same trap they had last time.
3307000	3310000	And they need to not if they want to be super successful this generation.
3310000	3314000	I think they want to stay out of the conversation during the holidays when there's all this other stuff going on.
3314000	3321000	And then when gaming dies down in January, February next year, when things slow down after the holidays, that's when Nintendo can start the hype train.
3321000	3326000	Nintendo doesn't have anything for this holiday really. Nothing that's going to give them tons of money.
3326000	3329000	They've got Pokemon and that's really it.
3329000	3333000	So like what's on Wii U this holiday? The Paper Mario game, I think that's it.
3333000	3335000	So they have two games technically.
3335000	3339000	And so they needed to be talking about their other stuff that's upcoming.
3339000	3342000	They can't afford to just sit there and wait until after the holidays.
3342000	3348000	I still think the minute Nintendo announces this, it's going to drive what everybody's talking about in the media for a while.
3348000	3354000	But we'll see. But anyway, trying to figure out what some of that could be with the NX.
3354000	3357000	There's a new patent filing that's basically for a more mod...
3357000	3364000	So this controller they're just talking about doing with the tablet that has the things that you can hook up and the base and all that.
3364000	3367000	They're talking about a modular component to this.
3367000	3371000	Imagine the D-pad could actually slip in and out and change with another D-pad.
3371000	3378000	And honestly, as far as the whole collecting faces for the DS in Japan and all that,
3378000	3380000	this seems really right in line with that.
3380000	3386000	That Nintendo would be all about special, like, controller layouts or things.
3386000	3392000	I mean, but it could even be like, imagine that it seems like maybe you could have one type of D-pad for this game,
3392000	3397000	but maybe you could flip it out and it would be a stick for another game. That would be really cool.
3397000	3403000	They already do that with like, they have, was it Nintendo Elite, or not Nintendo, the Microsoft Elite controller can do that.
3403000	3408000	And they've got other third-party controllers that do something similar where you can swap that stuff out.
3408000	3411000	So it's not anything new. I'm surprised it's something that they're patenting.
3411000	3416000	I think it's the fact that it's on the tablet device is the new element to that. I think that's how they're able to do it.
3416000	3419000	But how would you keep track of all the little pieces for every game?
3419000	3422000	Exactly. It was more of a customization thing.
3422000	3427000	Versus like, I need this specific set of buttons for this game.
3427000	3434000	Yeah, exactly. Because it's going to become a nightmare. It's just like, oh, I need this attachment for this game, and I need this attachment for this game.
3434000	3438000	And like, oh shit, what attachment do I need for this? And that was one of the problems that we had.
3438000	3444000	It's like, well shit, I can play this game, but oh, I need a nunchuck. Now I gotta go buy this extra accessory or something.
3444000	3448000	Yeah, but that's not as bad as what it could potentially be with this controller.
3448000	3456000	Like, a nunchuck that's easy to get, but what if like, say the newest Smash Brothers game needs this specific D-pad to work properly.
3456000	3460000	You're going to run into shortages and stuff like that again.
3460000	3468000	Now, I would be happy with stuff being able to be hot-swapped. One, we're talking like analog sticks, which I have several of my controllers.
3468000	3473000	The analog stick has gone bad. It'd be nice just to replace that one component without having to open it up.
3473000	3475000	Or buy an entirely new controller.
3475000	3480000	Exactly, yeah. Or buy another controller. But I just, I don't see the point yet with this.
3480000	3485000	It's like, it's a neat gimmick, but I don't know what it's going to be used for.
3485000	3494000	And I'm, I'm just worried that it's going to be like the Wii U is now, where they still are trying to convince people what that gamepad's supposed to be used for.
3494000	3500000	And it's like, dude, it's too late now. It is too late. Like, it's Star Fox Zero.
3500000	3508000	Whoa, shit, we need those fucking motion controls. For why? Because you need some sort of justification for the gamepad? It's too fucking late for that.
3508000	3515000	Well, I'll be curious to see how Nintendo sells that to the audience, hopefully next month. Hopefully when they announce it.
3515000	3522000	But I think another audience they really have to sell the concept to is third-party developers, EA being one of them.
3522000	3529000	And what's interesting is that Eurogamer actually cornered Peter Moore from EA. Well, not cornered him, but you know, they were doing an interview.
3529000	3533000	And asked some pretty direct questions about, basically, the new Nintendo console.
3533000	3542000	In the interview, it was asked that Nintendo has a new console. EA was kind of quiet on Wii U. What is EA going to do with the NX?
3542000	3546000	And Peter Moore responded, I don't know. Obviously, a lot of details are still to be unveiled.
3546000	3551000	EA has developed for Nintendo for 30 years, and I was famously quoted as saying we're still good friends.
3551000	3557000	I've lived the console cycles up and downs. I launched the Dreamcast. Some publishers got behind that and some didn't.
3557000	3561000	But certainly, EA has never come out and said it won't develop for Nintendo.
3561000	3570000	And then the thing moved on. Eurogamer kind of cornered him on the whole, well, you mentioned that special relationship for Wii U, which never really materialized.
3570000	3575000	And then went on to ask about the whole, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does their own thing.
3575000	3581000	They don't necessarily want to compete with Xbox or PlayStation. Does it make Nintendo more difficult to support?
3582000	3588000	Peter Moore said, Nintendo has always based its success on its first-party games because it's a brilliant first-party developer.
3588000	3597000	If you ask that question to them, they'd say they have to launch with first-party software first. That's where the first dev kits go, which is a very interesting answer to that question.
3597000	3607000	Either he, I mean, it could really go either way. He could be either hiding something really big that EA is working on, which, you know, or they are not planning on it right now.
3607000	3613000	Which could, I mean, I guess it would largely depend on, did they get their Frostbite engine working on NX or not?
3613000	3620000	And if the NX is not as on a technical level as PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, perhaps they have not.
3620000	3625000	And so if Frostbite doesn't run on it, they're probably not going to be developing as many games for it.
3625000	3634000	But I would still think that, you know, their more casual arm, like, you know, the former PopCap that does the, you know, Pagle and the Plants vs. Zombies stuff.
3634000	3637000	You would think that there's room there to develop on NX.
3637000	3643000	But I don't think they're really developing for 3DS very much either. I think that's all gone mobile now. It's like, because they're making more money there.
3643000	3652000	And yeah, I mean, I could see them, you know, developing for the NX that they can capture more of that mobile, that 3DS audience.
3652000	3658000	But, I don't know. I mean, it's money. It's just, how much money are they talking about?
3658000	3665000	It's not the same as having a big title like Battlefield 1 or, you know, the next Battlefront or something like that.
3665000	3672000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Doomplague in chat says Nintendo patents a lot of things and doesn't always use them. True.
3672000	3674000	So you always have to take these things with a grain of salt.
3674000	3675000	Vitality sensor.
3675000	3678000	That's very true. Well, they even came out and announced that one.
3678000	3686000	Doomplague continues, the more interesting patent is the supplemental processing device, which looks like it's essentially a more powerful upgrade that you leave at home.
3686000	3689000	Like a dock that gives the system better graphics.
3689000	3698000	And that could certainly be a thing that maybe, you know, if we're talking about this whole tablet that plugs into a device in your home to put it on the TV,
3698000	3705000	it would make a lot of sense that maybe that device has something in it that makes the games capable of running at an even better resolution on your TV.
3705000	3715000	You know, again, don't really know until Nintendo comes out and says, here's what Mario looks like on our new console that is named blank.
3715000	3718000	Named that is not NX because that is not the actual name of the console.
3718000	3723000	So hopefully a month from now, we're having a very different conversation. We'll see.
3723000	3727000	Anyway, let's move on to our next story. Dark Sakura.
3727000	3731000	Something that has very little to do with Nintendo. Pokemon Go.
3731000	3734000	I see what you did there.
3734000	3735000	Yes.
3735000	3737000	It does have to do with Nintendo, but not a lot.
3737000	3740000	But not really, because Nintendo doesn't technically own Pokemon.
3740000	3741000	Yeah, I gotcha.
3741000	3749000	Anyway, Niantic, who is the developer behind Pokemon Go, is putting down the ban hammer for sure.
3749000	3757000	We've kind of talked about this before, but it's official that after getting so many reports of in-game cheating,
3757000	3760000	that moving forward, this is actually a direct quote,
3760000	3765000	moving forward we will continue to terminate accounts that show clear signs of cheating.
3765000	3774000	They do have an appeal process in place for people to, you know, well, appeal the decision of them,
3774000	3781000	but for right now they are looking for people who are using bots to cheat, who are spoofing,
3781000	3790000	who are basically using various other methods to try to circumvent the system and give themselves an advantage.
3790000	3803000	So many third party little bots out there have already started pulling their software away.
3803000	3806000	Like Necrobot, that one's gone.
3806000	3812000	Just because Niantic is really putting it down so that this doesn't ruin the game for everybody else.
3812000	3816000	And I've been fairly happy with what's been going on.
3816000	3821000	I don't really care about losing the proximity thing.
3821000	3823000	I actually like how they're doing it now.
3823000	3828000	Well, how they're going to roll it out where you see what PokeStops have what Pokemon.
3829000	3837000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, state.
3837000	3845000	S2100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, I think they banned that shitlord who was taking over gyms in New York City using eggs.
3845000	3847000	Good. Bye.
3847000	3850000	Well, that was a glitch in the game that they should have fixed in the first place.
3850000	3851000	But here's the thing.
3851000	3855000	Still exploiting the glitch in a way that affects other people. He deserved it.
3855000	3857000	Agreed.
3857000	3859000	But the system, of course, is not perfect.
3859000	3864000	In fact, there was actually a charity livestream of someone playing Pokemon Go that they're trying to get as much experience in one day.
3864000	3865000	Their goal was a million.
3865000	3870000	And they got soft banned because they were earning experience too fast.
3870000	3872000	Even though they weren't botting, they were livestreaming it.
3872000	3878000	And they even tweeted out to one of the guys at Niantic saying, hey, can you whitelist me?
3878000	3884000	Because I'm clearly not cheating, but your software thinks I am.
3884000	3885000	Interesting.
3885000	3888000	So, you know, we talked about this a little bit, again, plugging the other show.
3888000	3892000	But we talked a little bit about this on this week's PokeStop, which I know isn't posted yet, but it will be tonight.
3892000	3899000	But we talked a little bit about this, the whole fact that there's going to be errors in the system that are going to catch people that didn't really cheat.
3899000	3905000	And sometimes it's people that really, really don't want you to know that they cheated and it just kind of sucks.
3905000	3914000	But sometimes it's cases like this where it's like, hey, they've been taping the whole thing and it was just an unusual play circumstance where, you know, this person was playing for 24 hours straight.
3914000	3918000	But they did it for charity, but it probably set off alarms that they got too much experience.
3918000	3922000	Okay, so I wasn't paying attention to what was just going on, but I heard little bits of it.
3922000	3923000	Sorry, I was reading.
3923000	3928000	And there's actually an article on Kotaku exactly about this guy who's doing what you just said.
3928000	3929000	Yeah.
3929000	3930000	Did you talk about that?
3930000	3931000	Yeah, that's what he was talking about.
3931000	3933000	Okay, the, the, okay, never mind.
3933000	3934000	Yeah.
3934000	3936000	Thanks, thanks for your contributions.
3936000	3938000	I was reading about Danganronpa.
3938000	3941000	Sorry, it was more important than whatever you were talking about.
3941000	3943000	I wasn't talking about anything.
3943000	3945000	You were being rude to the others, but that's, that's all right.
3945000	3947000	I'd like to know more about Danganronpa.
3947000	3948000	What were you reading?
3948000	3949000	Yeah, Jamie will forgive you for-
3949000	3952000	Just, just impressions of the anime right now that's going on.
3952000	3955000	If I had known you were going to be here, I would have given you those episodes.
3955000	3956000	Oh, I just actually watched them.
3956000	3959000	I just made a new account on Funimation under a different name.
3959000	3960000	Okay.
3960000	3961000	So I got another 14 day trial.
3961000	3963000	They're so good.
3963000	3966000	All right, let's move on with something.
3966000	3967000	Shane, pay attention.
3967000	3968000	Loki.
3968000	3969000	All right.
3969000	3973000	So Facebook is launching a gaming platform, you know, and I'm kind of surprised that this
3973000	3978000	isn't already launched because I swear all those trivia things that people keep posting
3978000	3981000	on their walls about like, hey, do this math question.
3981000	3982000	Isn't that a game?
3982000	3984000	Am I already playing the game?
3984000	3985000	Is this already a thing?
3985000	3989000	Yes, the game is don't get blocked by your friends when you post-
3989000	3990000	Game is.
3990000	3993000	Figure out how do you turn off those fucking Instagram notifications.
3993000	3994000	Oh, guess what?
3994000	3995000	You can't because fuck you.
3995000	3996000	That's why.
3996000	3999000	Because you will fucking like Instagram whether you fucking like it or not.
3999000	4001000	I don't have this problem, Loki.
4001000	4003000	They fucking hate me is why.
4003000	4006000	I don't even have fucking Instagram.
4006000	4008000	I have no Instagram account.
4008000	4010000	Because I deleted it.
4010000	4014000	I thought creating one would allow me to shut off the notifications.
4014000	4016000	No, they just fucking get you Instagram.
4016000	4018000	That's all it does.
4018000	4022000	Anyways, so yes, they are going to be branching out.
4022000	4026000	One of the people that they're partnering with actually is Unity.
4026000	4032000	So they're going to be allowing seamless integration with Facebook home pages.
4032000	4036000	And I guess they're going to have an option I think pretty soon actually
4036000	4041000	where you'll be able to export using Unity to Facebook as a platform.
4041000	4042000	So that's cool.
4042000	4045000	I'll have to check that out.
4045000	4048000	It's interesting.
4048000	4050000	When you see the headline, you think, oh, God,
4050000	4052000	is Facebook going to release a console?
4052000	4054000	And it's really not that at all.
4054000	4057000	But it's interesting when you think about how they're saying that Pokemon Go,
4057000	4059000	you know, to keep picking on that game,
4059000	4062000	has been getting more eyes recently than Facebook has been getting.
4062000	4066000	So do you think that Facebook wants to build some of this gaming into their mobile platform?
4066000	4070000	They're sad and neglected, poor baby.
4070000	4072000	They don't control everything and they don't want that.
4072000	4074000	They probably just want money.
4074000	4078000	I mean, because they want people to have their games revolving around Facebook
4078000	4081000	so that when I'm playing like a Tap My Kata Mario or something
4081000	4086000	and if I purchase an in-game thing, they get a portion of that money and not Google.
4086000	4089000	I think it's also easy to tie this to Oculus
4089000	4091000	because Facebook has the Oculus thing.
4091000	4094000	But I kind of feel like, I don't know,
4094000	4097000	at least the original direction of what they wanted to use Oculus for
4097000	4101000	was not strictly gaming, and that's why Facebook being involved was interesting
4101000	4105000	because it makes you think that there could be more lifestyle type of uses for Oculus.
4105000	4112000	And heck, you already see on Facebook these 360 degree immersive experiences
4112000	4115000	and you can do it on your desktop by clicking and holding around.
4115000	4117000	You can imagine what that's probably going to look like in VR.
4117000	4120000	So I kind of always thought like, oh, okay, Facebook was actually bringing
4120000	4125000	a very specifically non-gaming element to Oculus to kind of enrichen that device
4125000	4128000	to make it more than just a gaming thing.
4128000	4134000	But now it's interesting to hear like, oh, but Facebook wants to kind of up its game
4134000	4140000	on its gaming because Facebook games used to be the whole conversation
4140000	4142000	when it was stuff like Farmville.
4142000	4143000	Now that's gone away.
4143000	4147000	Well, it's not gone away, but it's scaled way back in favor of mobile.
4147000	4151000	So I almost feel like Facebook wants to build in gaming again,
4151000	4154000	but they probably want to do it in a way that includes mobile
4154000	4156000	so that way you can play games on your Facebook,
4156000	4160000	but you're still kind of tuned into it on mobile, if that makes sense.
4160000	4162000	I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense at all,
4162000	4164000	but I feel like that's what they kind of want to do.
4164000	4170000	So let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4170000	4174000	Kaijuto in chat says the Facebook console is going to make you post your mood
4174000	4176000	every time you turn it on.
4176000	4179000	Tell us a little bit about the game you're playing.
4179000	4180000	Tell your friends about it.
4180000	4183000	Tag friends that you're playing the game with right now.
4183000	4186000	All right, moving on.
4186000	4188000	Let's talk about the PlayStation 4 slim.
4188000	4191000	We know something's coming with a slimmer PlayStation 4,
4191000	4193000	and we might know a whole lot more.
4193000	4197000	Apparently some images have leaked of this PlayStation 4.
4197000	4202000	There's an online classified listing that is selling this unreleased
4202000	4205000	slim line PlayStation 4.
4205000	4210000	Apparently it does not look like it is the souped up PlayStation 4K
4210000	4211000	or whatever you want to call it,
4211000	4216000	but it is a slimmer PlayStation 4 probably in line with what
4216000	4220000	Microsoft just did with Xbox One and the whole S system.
4221000	4225000	So, you know, again though, take this stuff with a grain of salt,
4225000	4228000	because we've all been fooled with photoshops before,
4228000	4231000	so it could be an elaborate thing, but I don't know.
4231000	4234000	You look at the console, you kind of go, okay, it makes sense.
4234000	4237000	There's nothing on this that makes you go, that's crazy.
4237000	4239000	I don't think it's a hoax at all.
4239000	4241000	I mean, it's got the box that looks real enough.
4241000	4246000	The system looks exactly like I would expect a slim line version to look like.
4246000	4248000	They even removed something from it.
4248000	4250000	So, that makes sense too.
4250000	4253000	And apparently people are asking this person on Twitter to actually,
4253000	4256000	like, take different pictures of it and so forth,
4256000	4257000	and they're actually complying.
4257000	4262000	So, it seems like they just posted a picture of the new PlayStation 4,
4262000	4264000	the slimmer one, on top of an older one.
4264000	4268000	So, you know, the fact that they can kind of respond to those custom picture
4268000	4272000	requests certainly lessens the chance that it's some type of Photoshop.
4272000	4276000	And again, there's nothing here that makes me go, oh, this is crazy different.
4276000	4278000	This is kind of what I would expect.
4278000	4280000	So, yeah, there it is.
4280000	4283000	It doesn't look like there's a lot of new features with it.
4283000	4285000	I imagine it probably just runs a little differently.
4285000	4287000	I do like this, though.
4287000	4293000	The power button and the eject button, they're on the side kind of,
4293000	4295000	and one of them is a lot bigger than the other one,
4295000	4298000	and so I won't always mistake one to the other.
4298000	4300000	Yeah, I can never remember which one's which.
4300000	4302000	I'm like, uh, this one?
4302000	4304000	No, this just popped out.
4304000	4305000	Okay, this one?
4305000	4310000	That could very well be the new slim PlayStation 4's greatest improvement.
4310000	4315000	Kaijito in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4315000	4318000	I thought the new PlayStation 4 was a bathroom scale.
4318000	4319000	I like it.
4319000	4321000	Yeah, that's a good, it kind of looks like a bathroom scale.
4321000	4324000	Doesn't it keep its angular, like?
4324000	4326000	Yeah, it keeps the look a little bit.
4326000	4327000	Which is cool.
4327000	4328000	It looks like a sandwich.
4328000	4331000	You're going to need a bathroom scale after, you know, the George Foreman one.
4332000	4335000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
4335000	4338000	Well, some Microsoft stuff.
4338000	4340000	It's kind of sticky.
4340000	4349000	Anyway, it has been gathered from a discussion with a few Microsoft people,
4349000	4358000	namely Phil Spencer, was that they're looking that this might be
4358000	4361000	the last console generation.
4361000	4369000	That everything's going to be going back to PCs or different units like VR,
4369000	4371000	which I think is kind of bullshit.
4371000	4376000	And then they basically were like, no, no, no, that's not it, that's not it.
4376000	4383000	But there's a lot of just really interesting things going on there.
4383000	4389000	They're really looking to make sure that the ongoing support for this Project Scorpio thing
4389000	4396000	is going to be able to incorporate anything that worked on the older systems should work with this.
4396000	4398000	Just not vice versa, of course.
4398000	4400000	You know, you can't go backwards.
4400000	4409000	And then they also did go in and say that they're not having console exclusives for it.
4409000	4416000	That they're all going to be compatible for Xbox One S or Project Scorpio.
4416000	4418000	So I don't know.
4418000	4422000	Honestly, I haven't cared about the Xbox system since the 360.
4422000	4430000	They're just really working on trying to close that gap between the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One for right now.
4430000	4436000	But Sony is already kind of crushing them, like doubling their sales.
4436000	4444000	Yeah, I mean, Microsoft definitely wants a little more of those sales.
4444000	4448000	But, you know, they're really trying with the exclusives.
4448000	4455000	They are working on that Xbox Play anywhere where they're working on having all the games work on PCs.
4455000	4459000	But that, of course, requires that you run Windows 10.
4459000	4463000	And Windows 10 is kind of janky still.
4463000	4465000	See, I'm not the only one that doesn't...
4465000	4467000	Windows 10 is fine for me.
4467000	4469000	I'm in the hate camp. I don't like it.
4469000	4471000	I don't really care for it.
4471000	4473000	I hate it less than Windows 8.
4473000	4475000	Oh, I love 8. 8 was so fun.
4475000	4479000	The only thing I dislike about 10 is just the forced updates that they do.
4479000	4481000	It's like, I don't want to update right now.
4481000	4483000	Well, I'm sorry, you're going to be updated.
4483000	4485000	I don't like it.
4485000	4491000	After having dug through the OS on it, I would rather stick with a more stable operating system, thank you.
4491000	4493000	I actually kind of like the whole...
4493000	4497000	Especially the way the Xbox One integrates with the whole Xbox app and everything.
4497000	4499000	I actually really dig that.
4499000	4501000	I'm not going to lie.
4501000	4503000	I enjoy Windows 10, personally.
4503000	4505000	Keep in mind, I was running 7 before.
4505000	4507000	But I guess some people prefer that.
4507000	4509000	I loathed 8.
4509000	4511000	All iterations of 8 I think were shit.
4511000	4513000	Everybody did except Shane.
4513000	4516000	Yeah, I thought 8 was fun. I actually thought it was a nice change of pace.
4516000	4523000	And I have found, just with all the things that I do, that honestly, even dealing with Mac OS is a lot more stable than Windows 10.
4523000	4525000	In my experience.
4526000	4529000	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4529000	4533000	And some things that will be coming at you probably around the same time as the new Windows update.
4533000	4535000	Loki, starting in the US.
4535000	4537000	Yeah, quite a bit actually this week.
4537000	4539000	We've got Tempest coming out on PC and Mac.
4539000	4542000	Alone With You on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
4542000	4547000	Deus Ex Mankind Divided on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4547000	4552000	Hue on PC, PlayStation 4, Vita and Xbox One.
4552000	4555000	Inside on PlayStation 4.
4555000	4562000	Madden NFL 17 on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
4562000	4566000	Metrico Plus on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4566000	4569000	King of Fighters XIV.
4569000	4572000	That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.
4572000	4578000	Worms WMD on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4578000	4580000	Metro Soccer on PC.
4580000	4584000	Obduction on PC, Mac and Oculus Rift.
4584000	4589000	Master of Orion, Conquer the Stars on PC, Mac and Linux.
4589000	4592000	Mugen Sol Z on PC.
4592000	4595000	N++ on PC.
4595000	4597000	Pan Pan on PC.
4597000	4601000	Steins Gate Zero on PC.
4601000	4604000	Armello on Xbox One.
4604000	4611000	Attack on Titan coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Vita and Xbox One.
4611000	4617000	Champions of Anteria, that's on PC.
4617000	4622000	Hatsune Miku Project Diva X on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
4622000	4631000	God Eater Resurrection on PC and God Eater 2 Rage Burst on PC, PlayStation 4 and Vita.
4631000	4636000	Alright, wow. This does seem like a pretty busy week this week.
4636000	4638000	I think just a lot of smaller stuff being released, but yeah.
4638000	4640000	Yeah, I don't think there's a huge title.
4640000	4646000	I didn't realize Attack on Titan was coming out so soon, but in Deus Ex that's pretty interesting too.
4646000	4649000	Well, let's travel to Japan. Let's get in a plane right now.
4649000	4652000	We're going to the Olympics four years early. How's that sound, everybody?
4652000	4659000	And we'll check out the releases over there this week coming out on the 25th of August on the PlayStation 4.
4659000	4662000	Hey, I'm excited for this. I almost want to import this.
4662000	4668000	Hatsune Miku Project Diva X HD is out this week on the PlayStation 4.
4668000	4671000	But that was coming out this week, though.
4671000	4673000	Oh, it's because it's coming out here as well, right?
4673000	4675000	Project Diva X, I just said.
4675000	4678000	Is there really a reason for it to be in HD?
4678000	4681000	Because it's on PlayStation 3, so it's HD-er.
4681000	4685000	Yeah, it's more high def-er. So there you go.
4685000	4692000	King of Fighters XIV, also out in Japan this week, as well as a fighting stick that will work for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.
4692000	4697000	No Man's Sky gets its Japanese release this week, so yes, you guys are getting into Japan as well.
4697000	4704000	I'm curious, will they be on the same network as us, or a separate one with their own named planets and stuff?
4704000	4705000	No, they'll be on the same network.
4705000	4708000	If you notice, there's some planets that have Russian names and stuff.
4708000	4709000	Oh, interesting.
4709000	4710000	I think they'll be on the same one.
4710000	4714000	I figured that could have been somebody who speaks a couple languages.
4714000	4717000	Or to be honest, it could have not been Russian. It could have just been someone going,
4717000	4718000	I'm pushing random letters!
4718000	4720000	You thought it was Russian.
4720000	4729000	Alright, and then from Capcom we have this week on PlayStation 4, Sengoku Basara Sanada Yukimura Den comes out this week.
4729000	4736000	I am not sure if this is based on an anime or what, but those are the types of characters we're looking at in this game.
4736000	4744000	Sengoku Basara, it's not Dynasty Warriors, it's like Dynasty Warriors, it's called...
4744000	4746000	God, I can't remember what the hell it's called over here.
4746000	4749000	It's Capcom's Dynasty Warriors type thing.
4749000	4751000	Yeah, I think it is called.
4751000	4753000	Yeah, I think it's Dynasty Warriors, Capcom's one is.
4753000	4756000	The romance of the Three Kingdoms was Taito, wasn't it?
4756000	4758000	It wasn't called Dynasty Warriors, it was...
4758000	4760000	I think it is called Sengoku Basara here, actually.
4760000	4765000	Maybe I'm thinking of another series. There's one that Capcom has as well.
4765000	4766000	Yeah.
4766000	4769000	No, but Sengoku Basara, that is Dynasty Warriors.
4769000	4775000	And Bob Coffee in chat kind of collaborates that, saying it is Capcom's take on the Musou genre.
4775000	4778000	And then Act F confirms that is what they call it here as well.
4778000	4781000	You can see how much attention I've been paying to all those types of games.
4781000	4787000	Although I did download one that was, I think it was like a PlayStation Plus game or something.
4787000	4789000	Messed around with that for a little bit.
4789000	4793000	Let's see, going to the PlayStation 3.
4793000	4796000	That same Sengoku Basara game is out on the PlayStation 3 as well.
4796000	4801000	And that is really it in Japan this week on the PlayStation 3.
4801000	4805000	Quickly looking at the Vita and the 3DS, though, for the handheld world.
4805000	4812000	On the Vita, Pyuramai Wars V, as well as Moju Tachi To Ohime-sama,
4812000	4815000	comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.
4815000	4817000	So you have that to look forward to.
4817000	4823000	And lastly on the 3DS this week, Metroid Prime Federation Force gets its Japanese release.
4823000	4832000	And Armed Blue Gunvolt Striker pack, which I think is like a two-in-one type of game set, is out.
4832000	4835000	Because that is a game, but it looks like it's got like two sides to it.
4835000	4838000	That is out in Japan as well this week.
4838000	4842000	I was thinking of Devil Kings is what I think they call it over here.
4842000	4844000	There was one on the Wii as well.
4844000	4846000	And I can't remember what that one was.
4846000	4848000	Samurai Heroes looks like.
4848000	4850000	Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, that was number three.
4850000	4853000	That's a samurai, yeah, I thought it was Samurai Heroes.
4853000	4855000	Okay, that's what it is.
4855000	4859000	And AkumaGP actually confirms, he's in Japan, so he knows a little bit about Japanese.
4859000	4862000	Basara means slash.
4862000	4865000	And that's what you do in those games, a lot of slash.
4865000	4870000	And mash, what's the name for, or what's the Japanese word for mash?
4870000	4874000	That's what you do is you button mash in those games over and over again.
4874000	4876000	Bayonetta.
4876000	4878000	Alright, Dark Sakura, how about Europe?
4878000	4882000	On the 23rd we have Tempest for Mac and PC.
4882000	4888000	Deus Ex Mankind Divided for PS4, PC, and X-Bone.
4888000	4894000	And then on the 25th we have Assault Squad 2 Men of War Origins.
4894000	4896000	Why's it gotta be men?
4896000	4901000	There's also, well, if no one gives a shit, there's a Madden game, whatever.
4901000	4904000	Madden NFL 17, whoopty shit.
4904000	4909000	N++ for PC, the other 99 for PC.
4909000	4912000	On the 26th we have Attack on Titan, yay!
4912000	4915000	And King of Fighters XIV.
4915000	4918000	So is N++ just really N plus one?
4918000	4920000	No, it's like C++.
4920000	4922000	That's a programming joke there.
4922000	4923000	I know, right?
4923000	4924000	I see what you did there.
4924000	4928000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
4928000	4930000	But first, Loki.
4930000	4939000	Alright, so Project Scorpio, there's been a lot of confusion with their messaging, I guess I would say, with that.
4939000	4942000	So, you know, out of E3, you know, they were saying,
4942000	4948000	oh hey, Project Scorpio is not gonna have any exclusive games, it's just gonna play the games that are already out there,
4948000	4950000	slightly better, and in 4K and stuff.
4950000	4957000	Well now they've kind of backpedaled out of that saying, well, it's not gonna have console exclusive games, Project Scorpio,
4957000	4964000	but we consider the VR experience almost like a separate console, so yeah, it'll have those.
4964000	4970000	So basically, yes, it will be getting, you know, VR games that are exclusive to it,
4970000	4974000	but they're not really considering that the same as Xbox One games.
4974000	4978000	Which, to be honest, that is fucking confusing, but whatever.
4979000	4986000	I guess if you only launch your VR platform for Project Scorpio, that makes it pretty, you know, that makes sense, I guess.
4986000	4990000	I'm worried about all this VR, it's just so spread out.
4990000	4996000	Yeah, I'm with you, I mean, cause like, you have these companies just saying one thing,
4996000	5002000	and they're like, oh well, it's a technicality, we just didn't consider that the same platform, ha ha ha.
5002000	5010000	You know, it's, I don't know. I don't want to be doing this close to the launch of that VR platform.
5010000	5019000	I do want to get it just at the very least so that I can play games on the second screen without having to pull my wife away from Grey's Anatomy on the TV.
5019000	5028000	I actually forgot I had my Playstation TV, so I'm actually thinking about hooking that up now to my USB,
5029000	5031000	You're still trying to convince Dan to buy one?
5031000	5036000	Or my USB HD screen I have, so we'll see if I can do that.
5036000	5037000	I don't have one, I kind of want one.
5037000	5038000	Rob, lend me one of your Vita's.
5038000	5040000	Yeah, I guess, if you really want one.
5040000	5042000	Cause I'm gonna start Ultra Despair Girls.
5042000	5043000	Alright, sure, why not?
5043000	5045000	I own a game for a system I don't have.
5045000	5050000	You kind of have to after this week's Future Arc for Danganronpa.
5050000	5055000	Yeah, I saw what happened. I need to finish, I need to play through Ultra Despair Girls.
5055000	5062000	Alright, let's talk a little bit about Overwatch, which is, I don't know, a game that would probably make me very sick in VR.
5062000	5066000	But it's something you play on PC or Playstation or Xbox One right now.
5066000	5069000	And the Public Test Realm got an update.
5069000	5073000	There's some balancing patches and so forth going on, they're prepping for Season 2.
5073000	5079000	But another awesome thing that they're doing in this Overwatch patch is they are trolling trolls.
5079000	5086000	So sometimes at the end of the match, people will type GG EZ at the end of the match.
5086000	5088000	Which means Good Game, Easy.
5088000	5095000	Which is a very like kind of, it's kind of a like crappy thing to say to your opponent because you're basically saying you suck.
5095000	5098000	Good game cause you were easy to steamroll type of thing, right?
5098000	5101000	So it's a very condescending thing to say at the end of the match.
5101000	5108000	Well now what Blizzard did is whenever you type GG EZ, it gets auto filtered when you press enter.
5108000	5114000	To say things like, come on mom, one more game before you tuck me in, oops miss tell.
5114000	5119000	Or, I'm trying to be a nicer person, it's hard but I'm trying guys.
5119000	5125000	Or, I'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life, but thank you all for playing with me.
5125000	5126000	That's fucking awesome.
5126000	5131000	So Blizzard is trolling trolls, I would be surprised if this actually makes the final release.
5131000	5134000	I think it should, I think that's fantastic.
5134000	5135000	I love it, it's great.
5135000	5137000	I wish they would add that to more games.
5137000	5141000	They do some things though, cause Blizzard even has these.
5141000	5146000	Your battle net count has been banned, please consult your registered email for details.
5146000	5152000	I think that one might be a bit much, they need to get rid of the ones that look like fake ban messages.
5152000	5158000	But I love the ones that, mommy says people my age shouldn't suck their thumbs.
5160000	5164000	I think some of these other ones will definitely, aw shucks you guys are the best.
5164000	5166000	That one's funny, it's gonna be great.
5167000	5172000	Interesting other change in Overwatch too, because you know they have limited time cosmetic gear.
5172000	5176000	They have a summer games event, don't say Olympics, but it's Olympics.
5176000	5180000	They have a summer games event going on right now where you can get limited time cosmetic things.
5180000	5185000	And some people are buying loot boxes because they want to get that cosmetic gear.
5185000	5195000	Well, the old verbiage for buying loot said, loot boxes have a chance to contain credits you can use to acquire any specific cosmetics you want.
5195000	5201000	And a lot of people commented with Blizzard, well with the summer games stuff being limited time,
5201000	5207000	we're not really gonna be able to get anything we want if we don't get the summer games stuff we want during this event.
5207000	5216000	So Blizzard actually changed it this week to say, loot boxes have a chance to contain credits that you can use to acquire many customization options.
5216000	5222000	As opposed to anything you want. So these cosmetics are going away after the summer games.
5222000	5226000	So you better buy them right now, because that's what they want, ching ching.
5226000	5231000	Going going gone, get them now. I could give a shit about loot boxes.
5231000	5237000	I mean they're okay and exciting to get when you level up, but I'm not dropping money on them. Sorry about it.
5237000	5242000	I don't think I ever bought the Mass Effect multiplayer stuff either. I'm trying to think if I ever did. I don't think I ever did.
5242000	5245000	Speaking of which, let's go on a little side tangent here real fast.
5245000	5246000	Oh fuck, what?
5246000	5248000	No, it's not bad. I just wanted to...
5248000	5256000	So the Wii U version of Minecraft apparently had the DLC stuff from like the Xbox version Minecraft and stuff.
5256000	5261000	And that includes all like the Skyrim level, the Mass Effect level, and all that stuff.
5261000	5264000	And I was unaware of that. I thought you had to pay for that DLC and stuff.
5264000	5270000	So my son's playing and he's like, yeah I picked one of these skins and there was like this weird hand thing.
5270000	5273000	And like I was trying to get up to the spaceship and stuff.
5273000	5278000	And I'm like, you're talking about, that was the Mass Effect level that you played.
5278000	5280000	And he's like, oh yeah.
5280000	5282000	I see, I see.
5282000	5286000	He had lots of questions about Mass Effect because he's like, what is that?
5286000	5290000	Well I hope you educated him properly or Uncle Rob's gonna have to come over to set him straight.
5290000	5293000	Well I didn't know, like I couldn't answer some of his questions.
5293000	5296000	Like, what's the creeper in that? I'm like, I don't know.
5296000	5299000	I don't know what the creeper is in the Mass Effect skin one.
5299000	5301000	Something that's still a creeper?
5301000	5303000	I don't know what a turian is.
5305000	5310000	Isn't that like a level in Metroid? No, that's Torian.
5310000	5315000	Isn't that like a, it's a 16-bit side scroller shooter game? No, that's Turrican, I'm sorry.
5315000	5319000	Isn't it that lady monster in Undertale? No, that's Toriel.
5319000	5325000	What's a turian? We'll ask Aunt Jamie to come over because she's in love with one.
5325000	5329000	Alright.
5331000	5335000	Maybe she can read some fanfic before bed. Alright, I'm teasing.
5335000	5339000	Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week.
5339000	5344000	Let's go back into a time when Minecraft didn't even exist, believe it or not.
5345000	5352000	A much simpler time where Dark Soccer's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, listen here.
5352000	5359000	Put down your freakin' Minecraft. That game is garbage. Play this instead.
5359000	5363000	Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week? Ten years or older.
5363000	5365000	Zaxxon. Zaxxon.
5365000	5372000	Came out in 1982. This is like almost 35 years. It's older than me. Yeah, right?
5372000	5375000	Developed and released by Sega.
5376000	5382000	I like how you, right when you said that, the little laser sound effects when the arcade came on.
5382000	5386000	I think they tried remaking this, but let's find out.
5386000	5395000	It was Zaxxon's Mother Base 2000 sequel. Anyway, it's an isometric shooter game, like I said, by Sega.
5395000	5403000	There are sources out there that say that the electrics company, Ikegami Tsushinki, I'm gonna mispronounce this.
5403000	5414000	Tsushinki worked on the development of it too. It is a game that lets you basically fly a craft through a fortress while shooting things down.
5414000	5420000	Just a fun little shooter, but it was really innovative for its time.
5420000	5430000	It was the first game to use axonometric projection, which basically was what led to the name the axon to Zaxxon.
5430000	5442000	Basically, it really is just isometric projection. It simulated a three-dimensional third-person viewpoint and had an altimeter so you could see how high or low that you were.
5443000	5452000	It had all kinds of different things going on for it, and on top of that, it was the first arcade game to be advertised on TV.
5452000	5456000	Paramount Pictures produced the commercial.
5456000	5470000	It also has a high score set by somebody in Hawaii, according to Twin Galaxies, and it had its own bootleg named Jackson in 1982.
5470000	5485000	As far as other versions of it that have come out, we have an MS-DOS version, Amiga 1000, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Atari 2600, 5200, which I have,
5485000	5496000	MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, ColecoVision, which I have that too, Intellivision, I think I have that one too, Sega SG-1000, and a TRS-80 colored computer.
5496000	5501000	That was actually the first home console I played Zaxxon on.
5501000	5508000	Today I learned that there is a boss at the end of the levels at Zaxxon, because apparently I never passed the first level, right?
5508000	5511000	I was like, hey, there's a boss there.
5512000	5521000	The Atari 2600 and Intellivision versions were different because they used a third person behind the ship perspective instead of the isometric version.
5521000	5529000	And the ColecoVision version was the first home version that used the isometric graphics.
5530000	5540000	Also, Coleco in 1983 did a tabletop version of Zaxxon with a double panel VFD screen, and Bondi released two Zaxxon handhelds,
5540000	5548000	and a VFD tabletop for the European and Japanese market, and an LCD card game that was sold worldwide.
5548000	5556000	It's also 2006, Zaxxon was a bonus on the Sega Genesis collection for PS2 and PSP.
5556000	5561000	The original Zaxxon is included on PS2, and Super Zaxxon is on the PSP.
5561000	5568000	Zaxxon is also an unlockable arcade game in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
5568000	5575000	And it was released on Wii Virtual Console in Japan, Europe, and North America.
5575000	5577000	There are clones, of course.
5577000	5583000	For the TI-99 4A, it came out as Arcturus.
5583000	5585000	On the Amstrad CPC, it was Zax.
5585000	5587000	BBC Micro is Fortress.
5587000	5591000	And the TRS-80 Color Computer is Zaxxon.
5591000	5602000	There's also Hostile All Terrain Encounter, also known as HATE, which was a clone made by Vortex Software for 8-bit and 16-bit computers and published by Gremlin Graphics.
5603000	5611000	Zaxxon was really, it was one of those games that actually was really good for Colecovision,
5611000	5620000	because it kind of put it on the map as having the, as close to arcade perfect version of Zaxxon as you could get at home.
5620000	5628000	And then, it was just really a game changer, literally a game changer, because it was the first of its kind.
5628000	5637000	And so, as far as other ones, its arcade sequel was Super Zaxxon, where it had a different color theme and a faster ship, making it more difficult.
5637000	5642000	And the robot at the end of the second fortress was replaced by a dragon. It didn't do so good.
5642000	5650000	Milton Bradley made a Zaxxon board game. 1987 led to Zaxxon 3D for the Sega Master System that used 3D glasses.
5650000	5652000	Have you guys ever played that one?
5652000	5653000	No, I have not.
5653000	5655000	It's headache-inducing.
5655000	5656000	Yeah.
5656000	5659000	And it was forward scrolling rather than being isometric.
5659000	5665000	And then, Zaxxon's Mother Base 2000 for the Sega 32X in 1995.
5665000	5668000	And it was the first Zaxxon game that had polygon graphics.
5668000	5677000	And, however, it was only Zaxxon in the U.S. The Japanese version was called Para Squad, and the European version was called Mother Base.
5677000	5682000	And people in the U.S. were like, it's not Zaxxon enough. Why do you call it Zaxxon?
5682000	5688000	Also, Zaxxon was shown at the Art of Video Games exhibition at the Smithsonian Institute.
5688000	5699000	There's also a direct sequel, Zaxxon Escape, that came out October 4, 2012 on Apple and Android devices, but it's not very Zaxxon-y.
5699000	5709000	Also, a home version of Zaxxon was featured in the music video for Blue Monday by New Order.
5709000	5711000	Oh, I didn't realize that.
5711000	5712000	Yep.
5712000	5713000	It's awesome.
5713000	5719000	And it's been in Friday the 13th, the final chapter, where one of the characters is playing Zaxxon.
5719000	5722000	Is that character Jason? Because that would be awesome.
5722000	5723000	No.
5723000	5727000	But he was like, oh, wait, I'm going to kill you, except I have to stop and play some Zaxxon right now.
5727000	5730000	Then I would murder the machine, because this game was hard as hell.
5730000	5734000	I have played the original arcade machine. Of course, I played the Commodore 64 version.
5734000	5738000	But I am like Alan Alchemy in chat at live.bognetwork.com.
5738000	5744000	I hated it because my depth perception did not like the game. I didn't hate it, but I was just terrible at it, and I had the same problem.
5744000	5752000	You have to keep firing. You have to keep firing, because it's the only way to find the holes in the wall and the right level to be at for all that stuff.
5752000	5762000	And there's an NPR podcast called Pop Culture Happy Hour that has what's called the Zaxxon rule, where people are forbidden to bring up topics that are unrelatable to the audience.
5762000	5765000	We break that all the fucking time.
5765000	5766000	Oops.
5766000	5772000	For other similar games, there's Future Spy by Sega in 1984. It uses the same hardware as Zaxxon.
5772000	5781000	But it's a military theme and viewpoint by Sammy for the Neo Geo that has the same perspective and similar gameplay to Zaxxon.
5781000	5783000	So, that's your game.
5783000	5785000	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
5785000	5786000	Pew, pew, pew, pew.
5786000	5789000	Yeah, that's all you can really hear in this little video, because you have to keep shooting.
5789000	5792000	That's the only way to find exactly where the holes in the wall are and all this stuff.
5792000	5799000	Anyway, as noisy as that game is, that is definitely a classic if I've ever heard one. I love Zaxxon.
5799000	5804000	I can't believe some podcast made a rule banning it. How dare they? How very dare they?
5804000	5808000	It was that you can't bring up anything that the audience won't get.
5808000	5809000	I see.
5809000	5811000	Like our digression into everything.
5811000	5815000	Oh, well, we can do that. You know why? Because it's our show and not yours.
5815000	5819000	But you know what? Just because they don't get it at first doesn't mean they won't get it later on.
5819000	5820000	That's right.
5820000	5821000	How else are they supposed to get anything?
5821000	5827000	We try our best to explain the end jokes. That's why I explained what pop music was for the 15th time this week.
5827000	5832000	So, you know, we'll do our best. Anyway, Zaxxon, check it out on a classic system.
5832000	5837000	Because, as Jamie mentioned, it was on literally everything in the 80s. So check it out.
5837000	5843000	All right. We're going to take a break, though. We got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news, some e-mails this week.
5844000	5851000	The FUs of the Week and our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5858000	5868000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode 655 for August the 21st of 2016 and our show already in progress.
5868000	5874000	Talking a little bit about a little adventure we took, or I took, to Pokémon Worlds on Saturday.
5874000	5878000	No, sadly, didn't get to go watch the event because it was still closed off to the public.
5878000	5887000	But did get to go shopping, at least a little bit, and then got subjected to listening to a lot of the commentary while Shane was playing it on our car ride.
5887000	5890000	Shane did leave, though. He was here in studio joining us for the first half of the show.
5890000	5895000	But he decided there was something better to do, so he left, as sometimes happens.
5895000	5900000	Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news with some rapid fire news right now. Loki.
5900000	5907000	All right. Let's do this. So talk about Call of Duty. Yes, Call of Duty.
5907000	5912000	They've been doing a lot of different iterations on zombies. This time it's going to be a little bit different.
5912000	5917000	It's kind of in the 80s, you know, because everybody likes throwing back to the 80s.
5917000	5922000	So now you take place in zombies in Spaceland, which is almost like a Disneyland type place.
5922000	5928000	And then, of course, they've got, you know, a celebrity cast of people playing the actual characters.
5928000	5938000	So we've got Seth Green, Ike Barenholtz, and J. Farrow, and Sasheer Zamata.
5938000	5944000	But on top of that, there's also two other people that are having major roles in it.
5944000	5951000	Paul Reubens is going to be playing, like, this washed up film director that has made a deal with the devil.
5951000	5958000	So he's kind of the villain in there. And you're going to have a DJ played by none other than David Hasselhoff.
5958000	5966000	Sounds pretty awesome. This just sounds, I guess they just want to indulge it so bad it's good type of thing.
5966000	5974000	They've done a lot of, like, really big celebrity things. Like, I remember one year they had, oh God, who do they have?
5974000	5979000	They've had a lot of big celebrities in this before.
5979000	5980000	Kevin Spacey.
5980000	5984000	No, not talking about, like, in the main game. I'm talking about the actual zombie stuff.
5984000	5989000	So they've had, like, a lot of big celebrities in there as well in the different zombie iterations.
5989000	5994000	But it looks fun. Definitely neat. I mean, a lot of people like the zombie stuff.
5994000	5999000	So we're checking out, especially Paul Reubens. So, I'm down.
6000000	6006000	Now this is kind of cool. So Microsoft, you remember one of the things that they were doing is this Xbox game preview.
6006000	6014000	And now that was more online of, like, an early access type program. Something similar to, you know, what they do on Steam and other places.
6014000	6017000	So now they're going to be bringing that Xbox game preview to Windows 10.
6017000	6024000	So those titles that are going to be on Windows 10 will, you know, could be possibly part of that program.
6024000	6030000	So one of the games that's going to be on there is Rockfish Games' Everspace.
6030000	6034000	It's going to be the first title as part of that Xbox games preview program.
6034000	6040000	It basically lets you buy, you know, of course the titles that are in progress and not finished yet.
6040000	6043000	Which is all of them, if you really think about it.
6045000	6050000	Very cool. Let's talk about Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10.
6050000	6053000	Because, you know, they don't exist on PlayStation 4.
6053000	6057000	Yeah, I bought those on Xbox 360 and I have never played them.
6057000	6061000	And they're not backwards compatible, so you won't be able to play them on Xbox 360.
6061000	6062000	That's alright, I have an Xbox 360.
6062000	6067000	And PlayStation 4 doesn't play PlayStation 3 games, so there, you know, isn't a way to play them on current consoles.
6067000	6070000	So, yeah, they're not really around.
6070000	6077000	So, apparently though, speaking to the creator, or excuse me, the co-developers, obviously, you know, Capcom is huge behind this.
6077000	6085000	But the co-developer of both those games, 9 and 10, Inti Creates, a website called Rockman Corner, which obviously is dedicated to Mega Man stuff,
6085000	6091000	actually asked about, hey, would Mega Man 9 or 10 actually come out on current platforms?
6091000	6098000	And Inti Creates said they are open to the idea, but Capcom ultimately does have the say and has to let that happen.
6098000	6103000	So, you know, they're saying make some noise, basically, let Capcom know it's something you're interested in.
6103000	6112000	And hopefully, Mega Man 9 and 10 can get a release for this generation, or at least the backwards compatibility thing you would think would be something they could get on.
6112000	6113000	I don't know.
6113000	6123000	Anyway, speaking of like the Steam Early Access stuff, or in this case, actual Steam Early Access, I think this is interesting because the company that's doing this is Game Freak.
6123000	6126000	You know, they make a little game called Pokemon that some people are really into.
6126000	6129000	Yeah, they have a Steam Early Access game that they've just released.
6129000	6131000	It's called Giga Wrecker.
6131000	6133000	It's going to launch in January of next year.
6133000	6136000	That's when the full version launches, but the Early Access is up now.
6136000	6140000	You can buy the current version that's about an hour and a half for $15.
6140000	6144000	Don't expect a Pokemon-style game, especially if you look at the trailer for this.
6144000	6146000	It looks more like a Metroidvania type.
6146000	6155000	I know that word is overused in gaming, but that's really what it looks like, where I guess you actually reconstruct debris and scraps into weapons and things that you use.
6156000	6161000	So it's almost like her weapon is like this Katamari ball that gets bigger and bigger, but she fires it out of her hand.
6161000	6163000	It's not like an actual Katamari she rolls around.
6163000	6165000	Although, no, I kind of want that game.
6165000	6166000	Oh well.
6166000	6169000	So this game does look interesting, but it's very different.
6169000	6172000	If I told you the people who made Pokemon made this game, you'd be like, what?
6172000	6176000	So it's just interesting that it's on the Steam Early Access.
6176000	6184000	What about an Attack on Titan type game where you're just ordinary citizens fighting off the prince and rolling his giant countryside Katamari?
6184000	6186000	It's kind of like a reversal type of thing.
6186000	6190000	Yeah, exactly. It's like, you know, no, you're not going to roll per planet into the star.
6190000	6194000	That's like the video game where the goal is to kidnap the princess.
6194000	6199000	Is there a video game out there that you actually play as the bad guy trying to kidnap the princess?
6199000	6200000	Oh, I like that.
6200000	6202000	Does that not exist?
6202000	6207000	Is there a game out there that, well, Bobby Blackwell says Braid. That's the twist.
6207000	6209000	Spoiler.
6209000	6211000	You know what I want?
6211000	6215000	Is there any game where the princess breaks herself out?
6215000	6216000	Well, I just-
6216000	6218000	And says, fuck you. I don't need a man to save me.
6218000	6228000	But I just kind of like spinning the trope around and having you be the bad guy, you know, in your total stereotypical game, you know, from the 80s type of thing.
6228000	6234000	You just need to be the princess who busts out by herself and kicks the shit out of the bad guy.
6235000	6241000	Fat Princess was the plot for the whole, but Bond's 006's Fat Princess got boring.
6241000	6245000	So, I'm just thinking like a straight up Mario game where you're Bowser.
6245000	6247000	Does that not exist?
6247000	6250000	I guess that seems like such a stupid simple concept.
6250000	6252000	Really? Nobody's thought of that?
6252000	6258000	I get that it was a plot twist in Braid. I'm talking just like a straight up platformer type of game.
6258000	6259000	That's weird.
6259000	6260000	Alright.
6261000	6266000	Raginator says, there's a Where's Waldo book where Waldo finds himself.
6266000	6271000	Bob Coffee in chat says, that princess game with the princess kicking ass needs to be made by Platinum Games.
6271000	6276000	Well, there was Super Princess Peach, but that was not really the same way.
6276000	6278000	That's not quite what I'm looking for.
6278000	6280000	Where she had a power of her emotions too.
6280000	6283000	Yeah, that's not really what I'm looking for.
6283000	6286000	Alright, moving on. Some other rapid fire stories. Dark Sakura.
6286000	6295000	Pokemon Snap is on Wii U Virtual Console coming out in the UK as announced by Nintendo of UK.
6295000	6300000	And it is seriously one of the best games in the entire Pokemon franchise.
6300000	6305000	It would only be worth it if they actually, you know, did motion controls with that game tablet.
6305000	6309000	Hey, you want an excuse for that tablet? There's a perfect one right there.
6309000	6313000	But how much you want to bet they're not going to do jack dilly squat with that thing?
6313000	6317000	They're just going to basically port it over and you have to use the analog stick still.
6320000	6330000	And in other news, another Metroid 2 remake actually has an update even though Nintendo gave them a C&D.
6330000	6344000	They have it out there that fixes issues with the gravity suit not being rendered, translation issues, and transportation pipe to the final area.
6344000	6350000	You can actually edit the English.ini file to help with the translation efforts.
6350000	6357000	Dan's save file deleted itself when he was at the end of the game.
6357000	6358000	Oh no.
6358000	6361000	So he just watched it finished up on YouTube.
6361000	6382000	He's like, I'm not going to do that again. He was showing me the like all because they put in some of the tricks like, you know, in Metroid Fusion how you had a trick to basically dash all the way through the shine spark through the whole level until you get to this one hidden room.
6382000	6389000	Well, a room you're not supposed to access yet, but you actually get a little hint about what's being done to you in the game.
6389000	6391000	So it's kind of interesting.
6391000	6396000	By the way, I see some folks in chat, you know, kind of going, oh, snap, I love Pokemon snap.
6396000	6398000	I wish it was coming out for Wii U and so forth.
6398000	6404000	I think I might be wrong, but I feel like I think it's on Wii Virtual Console, which you can access.
6404000	6409000	Remember, your Wii U is a Wii and you can get into the Wii and do the Wii shopping.
6409000	6418000	Because I'm almost positive I do have Pokemon Snap on my Wii U, but it's through the backwards compatibility thing where you have to actually go into Wii mode and get the game from there.
6418000	6424000	I'm going to disagree with Act Deft that Pokemon Go, but he says Pokemon Go is the new Pokemon Snap.
6424000	6435000	No, because the fun with Pokemon Snap is that you work to unlock events in the game and take those special pictures that were triggered by doing all the little tricks in the game right.
6435000	6441000	Like getting Lapras to show up or, you know, having different, you know, Pokemon peek out of different things.
6441000	6450000	I would say Pokemon Go feels more inspired by Snap than the mainline series, but yeah, they're absolutely different games.
6450000	6452000	I'm surprised they haven't made another Pokemon Snap game.
6452000	6454000	That would be just stupid easy.
6454000	6460000	It's just like, oh, look, I found a Pikachu. Let me change it to AR mode and he's on my cereal.
6460000	6467000	It seems like the obvious cell phone game to make, but then again, not that I need to tell the Pokemon company how to make mobile phone games because they're doing OK.
6467000	6471000	Or the ultimate VR game to make.
6471000	6473000	You know, why not?
6473000	6477000	Not VR. No.
6477000	6484000	If they wanted to go that route, but I would like to see maybe the rez approach where it's both.
6484000	6492000	Right. I mean, it doesn't have to be, but like, or at least, you know, you can use your phone just to kind of move it around and stuff like you're taking a picture.
6492000	6496000	If it was going to be like on the Wii U or something, I'd want it to be the U.
6496000	6502000	And this is where I would want like a motion control in the tablet that you can move it around.
6502000	6509000	And that was your window into it, but not like a VR headset. That's awful.
6509000	6516000	I'm with it being an option, but I also understand that we don't necessarily need to shoehorn everything into VR.
6516000	6519000	VR can come up with its own experiences.
6519000	6525000	All right. Let's see. Moving on. Let's talk about Mass Effect Andromeda, shall we?
6525000	6531000	Sadly, I don't have a lot of new information because there wasn't anything at Gamescom, but they said it wasn't going to be there.
6531000	6535000	So that's not news that it's not there. What's that?
6535000	6537000	We forgot to talk about something.
6537000	6539000	Oh, what's that? I'm sorry to hear something.
6539000	6542000	They're going to talk about a very important event.
6542000	6547000	I totally did skip something. Yes. We need to talk about this in the news.
6548000	6565000	I mean, the story of the century of how a company that was so on top and faltered so poorly is coming back to regain your trust by bringing back one of the most beloved franchises of all time.
6565000	6568000	This is way more important than some silly Mass Effect game.
6568000	6581000	Yes, this is seriously. But guess what? Metal Gear is back. That's right. Metal Gear is back. Don't worry that Kojima is not there. It's fine. Trust us. It'll be good.
6581000	6588000	Metal Gear Survive. Now, you're thinking, how the hell are they going to make another Metal Gear game? That's just weird.
6588000	6599000	I get it. It's because Konami is surviving all this mean people on the internet that are just saying these things that just have no basis.
6599000	6605000	But Konami and their series, they are surviving through all of that. Am I right, Loki?
6606000	6616000	They're right. So, what exactly is Metal Gear Survive? Well, it follows... Well, not Snake. Because Snake isn't in here, unfortunately. Or Big Boss. I'm sorry.
6616000	6617000	He's done. He's done.
6617000	6620000	No, no, no. That's not important. We can start another character. It'll be fine.
6620000	6621000	Fuck him.
6621000	6625000	It's fine. You know what? He's done. He's done. Whatever. He's yesterday's news.
6625000	6629000	Hater's too expensive. Kiefer Sutherland's too expensive. Forget them.
6629000	6631000	It's basically following the...
6632000	6635000	Loki, the players don't want Snake anymore.
6635000	6636000	They don't. They don't.
6636000	6640000	The players have told us they are sick of Solid Snake.
6641000	6649000	So, did you hear about them going to be doing Mass Effect HD re-releases later? That's better news.
6650000	6660000	So anyways, this game takes place at the end of Ground Zeroes, where apparently, you know, it's not... there's some just soldiers.
6660000	6666000	Not really saying who. Just soldiers. You know, left at Mother Base that were attacked at the end of Ground Zeroes.
6666000	6670000	And they get sucked through a wormhole to an alternate dimension. Wow, that sounds really different.
6670000	6678000	Oh, with zombies. And they're unicorn zombies. They're zombiecorns, if you will, because they have stupid crystals sticking out of their fucking heads. Zombiecorns.
6678000	6683000	But I love unicorns, and I love zombies. This is the perfect way to experience home.
6683000	6694000	So yes, it's basically a four-player co-op stealth action game with zombies in it that has none of the mainline Metal Gear Solid people.
6694000	6701000	But why is it a Metal Gear game, you may ask? Well, I'm glad you asked that question. Because there is a Metal Gear in there.
6701000	6706000	And that's literally the only fucking thing that ties this to Metal Gear in any fucking way.
6706000	6711000	Well, that, and if they put the Metal Gear name on it... Well, that is true. That is true.
6711000	6716000	And as you can imagine, people are so fucking excited.
6716000	6722000	To be fair, okay, to be fair, if they named the game Zombiecorns...
6722000	6728000	I would play Zombiecorns. Right? Like, why not just call it Zombiecorns?
6729000	6737000	And everybody would sit here and go, Konami got so fucking high, you guys. This is great. This is the future.
6737000	6744000	If Konami's just going to embrace themselves as the shit show they're becoming, let's just fucking roll around in it like a pig in poop.
6744000	6748000	This is great. Zombiecorns for the win.
6748000	6753000	If you're just looking to piss off the fans, which obviously that seems to be the angle that you're going with in this,
6753000	6760000	how about I just recommend a new title change for it? We'll just call it Metal Gear Silent Hills.
6760000	6765000	Survive. With Zombiecorns or something like that. I don't know. Just piss off everybody at the same time.
6765000	6771000	Because people obviously hate this. There's a 6.5 to 1 dislike ratio on the trailer that was posted.
6771000	6779000	Of course there, a representative from Konami is basically saying, hey, this is going to be not a full price game.
6780000	6781000	Just letting you know.
6781000	6784000	Why did Jamie say this in chat and not on a microphone?
6784000	6785000	Because look, he was talking.
6785000	6788000	The truck have started to move-icorns.
6789000	6795000	It was actually a response to IkumaJP. Just put a cardboard box on it. Equals MGS.
6795000	6796000	Beautiful.
6800000	6806000	I don't know what to say. I just know when I saw the trailer, I was like, God, that looks fucking terrible.
6806000	6813000	Okay, here's the trailer. If you know nothing about the game, it's shooting zombies through a chain link fence simulator.
6813000	6818000	Because there was no actual threat of zombies attacking them. They were on the other side of the fence going rrrr trying to get through it.
6818000	6821000	And they were shooting them through a fence. That was the whole fucking trailer.
6821000	6824000	That's it. It looked fucking terrible.
6825000	6832000	Maybe Konami should apply for a name change. They should just become HFM Games for hot fucking mess games.
6832000	6837000	Just embrace. Embrace the bad, Konami. Just embrace it.
6837000	6842000	They're just... I guess they're trying to make money. Good for them, I guess.
6843000	6849000	But, I mean, shit man. This is just like fucking... This is a rock revolution all over again.
6849000	6854000	It's like they don't know what makes their own fucking franchises good. And they're just gonna release it.
6854000	6855000	Let's start a petition.
6855000	6856000	People like zombies.
6856000	6858000	Called, Dear Konami, Could You Please Not?
6859000	6865000	Just go to change.org with the petition. The undersigned would like to tell Konami the following, Could You Please Not?
6867000	6869000	So, does this game have like...
6869000	6872000	I literally can't even. I need you to not.
6872000	6877000	So does it have like Raiden in it? No. Does it have Solid Snake? No.
6877000	6879000	It has his windy cousin, Fujin.
6879000	6884000	Revolver Ocelot? No. It has Soldier. Soldier 2.
6885000	6887000	Wasn't Soldier in Final Fantasy 8?
6887000	6891000	Well, surely... No, that was, um, 7 had Soldier.
6891000	6893000	Surely... 8 with seed.
6893000	6899000	We are just the cynical, rude gamers out there on the internet, and the internet as a whole has embraced this.
6899000	6902000	And Konami has come out to kiss their adoring fans, correct?
6904000	6909000	No. No? What do you mean? What do you mean the internet hasn't embraced Zombicorns?
6909000	6913000	No, they hate it. Absolutely hate it. No one likes it. It looks stupid.
6913000	6915000	Has Konami said anything about it?
6915000	6920000	They just said, hey, yeah, it's not going to be a full-price game.
6920000	6925000	But there is going to be this co-op play and stealth and a variety of weapons and devices.
6925000	6928000	And... yeah.
6930000	6931000	Alright, well, you know...
6931000	6933000	Making the petition right now.
6933000	6936000	Are you making a change.org petition?
6936000	6939000	Because you know that's the most effective place to do things, is change.org.
6940000	6943000	So, I like the quote here. Let's just quote him.
6943000	6948000	So, as you can see from the trailer, Survive is set after the events of Ground Zeroes.
6948000	6954000	The Mother Base that has been built up during Peace Walker's storyline gets sabotaged from within and destroyed.
6954000	6960000	And it all collapses into the sea. And Boston Miller manages to escape.
6960000	6961000	But at least...
6961000	6966000	And they go off and have a few adventures, which obviously we all know of in The Phantom Pains.
6966000	6971000	Unfortunately, not all Mother Base staff gets off alive, and some of them are stranded.
6971000	6974000	And it's about what happens to them, basically.
6974000	6980000	Well, I even don't want to really talk about this anymore in light of Zombicorns.
6980000	6985000	But I should finish my thoughts that I was starting on Mass Effect a little bit ago, which did not show up at Gamescom.
6985000	6989000	And of course, this is because EA is focusing on the holiday slate.
6989000	6993000	And I believe they've even said, more information on Andromeda on N7 Day.
6993000	6998000	I think that's the next day we're going to get some information, which is, of course, November 7th.
6998000	7001000	So, there'll be more on Mass Effect at that time.
7001000	7008000	But also, what I thought was interesting is that in that same interview, which the interview was with EA Studios boss, Patrick Soderlund,
7008000	7015000	actually said that maybe they're changing their mind on a Mass Effect trilogy remaster.
7015000	7020000	He has said that the market has demonstrated demand for remasters in the interim.
7020000	7025000	Although, that doesn't mean we're necessarily getting one, and I don't even think we would necessarily get that this year.
7025000	7028000	It's no longer off the table.
7028000	7034000	Although, how fast would they have to put that together in order to beat Andromeda out or get it out for the holiday?
7034000	7039000	I mean, I suppose they could announce maybe like a download only thing.
7039000	7046000	They could announce it on N7 Day, but I wouldn't expect it to be very fully featured or fully remastered if that's the case.
7046000	7048000	But we'll see. We'll see.
7049000	7055000	Regardless, no news on Andromeda at Gamescom, but that's going to come a little later in the year.
7055000	7057000	All right, Dark Soccer.
7057000	7058000	Wait.
7058000	7059000	What?
7059000	7061000	Do I have one? Oh, yeah, I do. But I have something else to add.
7061000	7062000	What's that?
7062000	7068000	That at Gamescom, they did say it was likely for a remaster of the Silent Hill.
7068000	7070000	I'm trying to write this stupid petition.
7070000	7071000	Yeah.
7071000	7072000	Of the Mass Effect games.
7072000	7073000	Yeah, I'd mention that.
7073000	7075000	Okay, I was trying to make the thing.
7075000	7077000	I know you're busy working on change.org. It's fine.
7077000	7078000	I know.
7078000	7082000	So the final update came out for Fez. Final update.
7082000	7087000	And it's pretty crazy, actually. It's for Mac and PC.
7087000	7092000	And some of the areas have been described as Virtual Boy Red and Black.
7092000	7097000	There is new aspects of the soundtrack.
7097000	7102000	And it is pretty, pretty big.
7102000	7113000	It has switched to FNA slash SDL2 from Monogame.
7113000	7118000	It has basically switched music decoders.
7118000	7123000	Music is in RAM instead of streamed.
7123000	7124000	All kinds of stuff.
7124000	7127000	Different game controller mapping.
7127000	7132000	Native support for any refresh rate.
7132000	7138000	Full aspect pixel perfect or super sampling from nearest multiple of 720p.
7138000	7140000	So full scale options.
7140000	7144000	And no more letterboxing or pillarboxing.
7144000	7145000	All kinds of different stuff.
7145000	7152000	There's speedrun mode by typing in dash dash gada dash gomez dash fast.
7152000	7153000	I like that.
7153000	7154000	All kinds of stuff added to it.
7154000	7156000	Clouds fading.
7156000	7159000	Just different kinds of things thrown in there.
7159000	7160000	And a lot of bug fixes.
7160000	7164000	Well, that's a cool little update for a game that's several years old at this point.
7164000	7168000	And I'm looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and Bobby Blackwolf is kind of clarifying.
7168000	7172000	Because he says, note that Phil Fish had nothing to do with this update.
7172000	7175000	And that did surprise me when I heard that this game got an update.
7175000	7178000	I was like, I kind of thought Phil Fish was kind of like done.
7178000	7183000	But he goes on to say, this was the programmer who now works for a AAA developer.
7183000	7187000	Some of this was porting the Linux version to the Mac and the PC.
7187000	7192000	And yeah, so that's what surprised me about this game getting an update.
7192000	7194000	Is I thought Phil Fish was kind of like done with games.
7194000	7198000	Because he got caught up in a lot of that ugliness that happened last year.
7198000	7201000	And so I kind of think he went on a siesta.
7201000	7205000	Or maybe, you know, if he is working on a game, he's probably not telling anybody about it.
7205000	7207000	Which, you know, I would completely understand.
7207000	7209000	So we'll see.
7209000	7215000	But as far as Fez goes, that's still cool that at least this game was able to get another update.
7215000	7219000	And it sounds like there's just a lot more in the bug fixes from what Jamie's mentioning there.
7219000	7222000	Some little graphical updates and things like that. So that's cool.
7222000	7226000	And Bobby Blackwolf says, it was a couple years ago, it was 2013.
7226000	7230000	Oh good lord, was it? I guess it was. Oh boy, oh boy.
7230000	7233000	Alright. Yeah, we're not getting any younger.
7233000	7235000	Loki, what do you got for us?
7235000	7240000	Alright, so there's yet another Skylanders game coming out this year.
7240000	7245000	The new gimmick of this game is going to be that you get to create your own Skylanders.
7245000	7248000	And while that sounds pretty cool, there's some caveats with that.
7248000	7256000	So first off, when you start the game, you pick one of ten different classes that you want to play as.
7256000	7262000	And when you do that, you basically have this item that's a crystal that it gets locked into.
7262000	7266000	And so those crystals can only have one element each.
7266000	7271000	So you have to buy more of them if you want to play as the other classes in the game.
7271000	7273000	And each of those crystals costs $10.
7273000	7282000	And then on top of that, if you want to get the full use out of it, you have to buy one of the senseis for the actual class.
7282000	7287000	Which costs $15 as well for each one of those.
7287000	7294000	And then that unlocks another level cap and also it adds a unique talent for each character.
7294000	7298000	So they want to have you purchase all these different things.
7298000	7307000	On top of that, I guess they're basically saying that if you accidentally duplicate a class,
7307000	7313000	say you wanted to choose a different one and you picked the wrong one, nope, you're stuck with that class again.
7313000	7315000	So you have to yet purchase another crystal.
7315000	7321000	So basically they're charging you up the ass for all this shit that really they shouldn't be.
7321000	7325000	But it's kind of Activision, you know, you think about it.
7325000	7329000	I kind of thought the ship had sailed with Skylanders.
7329000	7330000	Right.
7330000	7331000	I guess I know it's still a thing.
7331000	7334000	We only have Crash this year, so that's something for somebody that remembers Crash.
7334000	7339000	Honestly, it's Activision being Activision.
7340000	7343000	After a while, these franchises, they get greedy and they just decide,
7343000	7346000	here's how we're going to get the most money out of this.
7346000	7347000	And it's what tanks it.
7347000	7351000	Have with the Guitar Hero and it'll happen again with Skylanders.
7351000	7353000	Although ironically, the new Guitar Hero game was actually kind of good.
7353000	7355000	Oh, you're talking about the old Guitar Hero game.
7355000	7357000	No, I'm not talking about the new launch of Guitar Hero.
7357000	7359000	I'm talking about Guitar Hero, Band Hero, Guitar Hero.
7359000	7365000	Guitar Hero 80s, Guitar Hero best hits, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero this, Aerosmith.
7365000	7371000	That's what I'm talking about is that they get greedy and then they, I don't know,
7371000	7374000	they expect people to buy all this shit.
7374000	7378000	A quick follow-up before our next story here from our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
7378000	7381000	MXC in chat talking about Phil Fish because I said, you know,
7381000	7383000	I kind of think he's just on a siesta.
7383000	7387000	MXC says Fish is working on a game called Super Hypercube, which is,
7387000	7389000	you can check that out, superhypercube.com.
7389000	7390000	So I was not aware.
7390000	7392000	So thank you for letting me know.
7392000	7394000	It better be based on the movie.
7394000	7396000	Right, the actual cube trilogy.
7396000	7398000	It's not.
7398000	7399000	It is not.
7399000	7400000	It was a joke.
7400000	7401000	I know it was a joke.
7401000	7402000	It would be cool though.
7402000	7403000	It would be cool.
7403000	7404000	Somebody should make a movie based on this.
7404000	7405000	This hypercube was awesome.
7405000	7406000	All right.
7406000	7408000	Anyhow, let's talk about a little piece of history,
7408000	7412000	something that was floating around Twitter this week and got picked up by various gaming blogs.
7412000	7418000	But this guy, Frank Caffaldi, who is the head of restoration at Digital Eclipse,
7418000	7422000	who made like the Mega Man collection that was out on PlayStation recently.
7422000	7423000	You know what's funny?
7423000	7427000	We were both on a podcast together the same week, but not at the same time.
7427000	7430000	So I actually didn't talk to him myself, but he was on the show like right after I was.
7430000	7434000	It was kind of funny because I recognize this guy, his name and what he does and all that.
7434000	7440000	So obviously this guy has a great interest in collecting video game history and nostalgia and things like that.
7440000	7444000	Well, he actually put out some tweets that he got some circuit boards for the Famicom
7444000	7449000	and these actual cartridges that aren't even in a shell.
7449000	7450000	They're just like the chip boards.
7450000	7452000	They're prototypes essentially.
7452000	7457000	I'm kind of simplifying what these things really are because they could be things that were dumped to these.
7457000	7459000	They may not be the original.
7459000	7463000	There's no way to tell if the physical artifacts themselves are authentic.
7463000	7467000	But certainly the code is there to be looked at and poured around in.
7467000	7473000	And in the tweets, this is the interesting part and what I'm getting to here is Frank Caffaldi actually tweets a few things here saying,
7474000	7477000	I just acquired and preserved an incredible piece of video game history.
7477000	7484000	And moves on to say there are boards for the Famicom and I don't know if the boards are authentic, but the EPROMs are definitely old.
7484000	7487000	They were kind of fishy looking, but I picked them up anyway.
7487000	7491000	They are Hyper Olympic, Stargate, Soccer and Joust.
7491000	7493000	And there's some screenshots here from Joust.
7493000	7494000	I dumped the ROMs.
7494000	7497000	All but Soccer are definitely earlier than Retail Code.
7497000	7499000	Here's some clear differences in Joust.
7499000	7502000	Going on to say Joust has an interesting history.
7502000	7509000	It was programmed by Satoru Iwata in 1983 as part of a Nintendo and Atari deal that never happened.
7509000	7517000	Nintendo did not release it in 83 or 84 as planned, but HAL eventually did in 1987.
7517000	7519000	They self-published the game years later.
7519000	7527000	But this would mean that Joust is the first thing that Satoru Iwata, the eventual president of Nintendo, ever coded for a Nintendo system.
7527000	7533000	Which I also find kind of interesting because then one of the games he's most well known for is Balloon Fight.
7533000	7538000	Which has a lot of similarities to Joust, but then introduces that endless mode.
7538000	7540000	Which is a little bit different.
7540000	7542000	Kind of expands on that Joust concept there.
7542000	7545000	So I just think that's kind of cool that Iwata was working on Joust.
7545000	7550000	Then made a game that some may even consider better than Joust, Balloon Fighter.
7550000	7553000	At least kind of mixed up the formula a little bit while still being very similar.
7553000	7558000	But that's very cool that especially, I don't know where he finds these things.
7558000	7563000	If it was some type of liquidation or I don't know if it would be a flea market or something.
7563000	7566000	Or an auction type of site or wherever he found this.
7566000	7570000	But that's just very cool that that's a little piece of video gaming history that's preserved.
7570000	7575000	Because that would be the first game that he actually coded that would be out there.
7575000	7576000	So it's very cool.
7576000	7580000	Even if it didn't actually release at that time, it ended up releasing way later.
7581000	7590000	Especially considering with his passing last year, more people are very interested in his legacy and so forth.
7590000	7592000	So this being a very important part of that.
7592000	7594000	So very cool little story. Love that.
7594000	7597000	And Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out,
7597000	7602000	You never know, I know these protos sometimes wind up on eBay or Yahoo Japan auctions.
7602000	7609000	So yeah, the tweets didn't say, well at least the ones that got pulled that are all over the internet.
7609000	7613000	Don't say where it came from, but it's still pretty cool that it's out there nonetheless.
7614000	7615000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7615000	7617000	Every week you guys email us.
7617000	7621000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us emails.
7622000	7623000	The petition's up by the way.
7623000	7625000	Oh is it? Did you put it in chat?
7625000	7628000	I'm about to, I just have to post it on Facebook.
7628000	7631000	Okay, I gotta see this. Where's the post?
7632000	7635000	Alright, we will get to the emails here momentarily.
7635000	7637000	Because I'm just dying to see what she wrote in the petition.
7637000	7639000	Okay, it should be up now. I'm gonna tweet it.
7639000	7640000	Okay.
7640000	7642000	On my own twatter.
7643000	7645000	Wait, I'll just copy the link.
7645000	7649000	Alright, while you're getting that up, I will just remind the listeners you can always email us.
7649000	7654000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag head first
7654000	7659000	and find some mails that she thinks are worth reading here on the show.
7659000	7662000	And in the meantime, here's the change.org petition.
7663000	7668000	Fans of Silent Hill, Metal Gear, and other Konami franchises are tired of them ruining said franchises.
7668000	7671000	Where's our Silent Hills? Why did they chase off Kojima?
7671000	7673000	Why all the Pochi slot machines?
7673000	7676000	Dear Konami, can you please not, sincerely, everyone?
7677000	7679000	I think I said it right.
7679000	7682000	I can't believe you put the show's name on there. Alright.
7683000	7685000	I hope you don't mind. It's good publicity.
7685000	7687000	Ah, whatever. I don't care. Whatever.
7687000	7688000	Okay.
7688000	7690000	Alright, let's get to the e-house.
7690000	7692000	It had my last name on it and it wouldn't let me remove it, so.
7692000	7693000	Oh, yeah, that's kind of gross.
7693000	7694000	So.
7694000	7695000	Alright.
7695000	7699000	Still loving the show. Here's a few thoughts I had while listening. Sorry I can't include the time codes.
7699000	7704000	A typical 20 ounce bottle of Mountain Dew has 290 calories.
7704000	7707000	So 250 or so isn't unusual for Crystal Pepsi.
7707000	7711000	I have yet to see it in the Midwest. Is diet available? Probably not.
7711000	7713000	And I haven't seen a diet yet.
7713000	7718000	I doubt there's a Diet Crystal Pepsi and if there was it would probably be the worst thing in the world.
7718000	7720000	I think sugar is kind of what makes that drink.
7720000	7728000	I noticed the switcher slash best friends play YouTube channel uses the DOA beach volleyball music for their creepy anime bullshit series.
7728000	7730000	Because of course they do.
7730000	7733000	It's the current trailer video that auto plays on their channel homepage.
7733000	7742000	Along the same line, I get the feeling Mike, in referring to male bounce, might be thinking of the infamous Xbox arcade title Mount Your Friends.
7742000	7744000	Also Saints Row?
7744000	7750000	Oh, that wasn't Saints Row, wasn't it? Isn't there some male bounce in Saints Row a little bit? Just a little bit over the top.
7750000	7755000	Yeah, they have where you can increase the size of your package and it's your sexiness thing.
7755000	7759000	We want the wiggle jiggle.
7759000	7767000	Am I particularly mistaken or is Major Minor of Majestic March fame already considered to be one of Parappa's shitty friends?
7767000	7769000	At least as a spiritual successor.
7770000	7775000	A lot of people don't know that game. I never thought of that, so maybe.
7775000	7780000	Not as well received as the PS1 games, but still. It comes from Robert M.
7780000	7782000	Good call.
7782000	7785000	Okay, moving on to the next.
7785000	7786000	The next email.
7786000	7789000	Hello, LR. Martin the Belgian here.
7789000	7791000	Hello, Martin the Belgian.
7791000	7795000	I just called to say I love you and a pat on the ass and a job well done. Wink!
7795000	7796000	Thank you!
7796000	7803000	Because last week I said I love getting those emails that just say a pat on the ass and a job well done. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
7803000	7808000	Also you guys mentioned Dragon Con on last week's show since I live in Atlanta.
7808000	7814000	I'm contemplating attending for at least a day. Last year I just went downtown and checked out the parade.
7814000	7821000	I'm not really into events with big crowds, long lines and such, but I was wondering do you have any tips for a first time attendee?
7821000	7826000	I know you guys are true con veterans, so maybe you could give me some tips, dos and don'ts.
7826000	7836000	I will tell you one thing. There are sometimes quiet rooms for people who have anxiety slash autism slash things like that.
7836000	7845000	You can also find little restaurants where they'll go and let you have coffee, like inside of a convention center or a hotel attached to it.
7845000	7858000	Bathrooms are great for hiding in. I say this from experience. I would always find the most out of the way bathroom at E3 and then hide there when the people were too much for me.
7858000	7865000	And also just hanging out in certain booths can actually be really isolating if you need it to happen.
7865000	7871000	Sometimes I just take the elevator up to a higher floor. Even the elevator game can be a giant pain in the ass at Dragon Con.
7871000	7881000	But usually the higher you go, especially the floor that has all the LARPing events at Dragon Con, because it's up on the third floor, I think it's usually quieter up there.
7881000	7887000	Because only the LARPing people really seem to go up there if you need a quiet place to get away.
7887000	7894000	But the reality is Dragon Con is so many people. I'm not going to lie to you. There's going to be a lot of people around.
7895000	7903000	You'll see a lot of neat costumes. But just keep in mind there's a lot of people there dealing with the same issues you are.
7903000	7910000	And I think as long as you show everybody respect, you're going to get that back virtually all the time.
7910000	7913000	You know, obviously there's always going to be a jerk out there. But Dragon Con is a really cool crowd.
7913000	7918000	I can't think of all the issues I've run into at conventions. I don't think I've run into any at Dragon Con really.
7918000	7926000	So, yeah. And come say hi at the Parsec Awards on Saturday. That will be definitely a place where we're all assembled.
7926000	7931000	And I guess we're actually going to be presenting an award again this year for the fourth year in a row.
7931000	7934000	So that would be a good place to see us. And that's not a super crowded event either.
7934000	7943000	So it's not, you know, you have to be into podcasting. It's not going to be the most showy event in the world.
7943000	7952000	So I don't want to set the expectations too high. But I can say it is a nice little like it's not like trying to go to the Patrick Stewart panel or something that's just going to be wall to wall people.
7952000	7959000	I would say set a rough agenda of the things you want to do the most. But don't be disappointed if you don't get to them all.
7959000	7963000	Because you're going to have that whole, ooh, shiny type of thing where you're going to get distracted.
7963000	7967000	You're going to go look at something else. And you just have to remember that that's okay.
7967000	7974000	And that some panels, you know, especially the bigger the celebrity in the panel, the harder it's going to be to get in there and the more crowded it's going to be.
7974000	7980000	So just, you know, plan on getting there early if you want it, if you really want to get into a panel with a big celebrity in it.
7980000	7983000	But if that's not really what you're there for, which I don't really go to the celebrity panels.
7983000	7988000	Because all the big ones are on that Dragon Con TV anyway, which they're streaming this year.
7988000	7993000	I was going to say in those panels, though, with the celebrities and stuff, they allow you to stay in the room through multiple panels.
7993000	8000000	Because I remember that was one of the strategies I used back when I used to go to anime conventions to watch certain movies and get a good seat.
8000000	8006000	I would go to a movie prior to that that wasn't as popular and get a good seat and then just stay.
8006000	8011000	I believe Dragon Con does sweep rooms between panels, but it depends.
8011000	8017000	Like, for example, the podcast track, they don't really do that because they don't need to.
8017000	8021000	You know, at least none of the panels that I ever attended are that popular.
8021000	8025000	Plus, usually if it is going to be a more popular panel, they move it to another room.
8025000	8028000	So you have to move and then they'll line up for that.
8028000	8033000	But I think some of the more popular tracks, they do do room sweeps, especially in larger rooms.
8033000	8034000	There's more.
8034000	8035000	Oh, sure.
8035000	8039000	If I am attending only one day, which day would you recommend? Saturday or Sunday?
8039000	8042000	Which is typically the best or most fun day?
8042000	8046000	I will tell you most cons. Saturday is going to be the biggest, craziest day.
8046000	8050000	But the Labor Day angle makes Sunday still a big day.
8050000	8052000	Isn't it the last day?
8052000	8053000	No, Monday is the last day.
8053000	8054000	Monday is the last day.
8054000	8056000	Monday is a really quiet day too.
8056000	8058000	Monday is definitely the hangover day.
8058000	8062000	In my experience, most of the things I want to do end up on Saturday.
8062000	8064000	But Saturday will also be the most crowded day.
8064000	8068000	So it's kind of a, you kind of have to pick between the two.
8068000	8070000	Martin's in chat right now.
8070000	8071000	Oh, awesome. Hello.
8071000	8073000	We'll come say, I would say go Saturday.
8073000	8074000	And sign the petition.
8074000	8077000	Go Saturday and come say hi at the parsecs.
8077000	8081000	Or hopefully, I'm still waiting to hear, we may actually have another panel.
8081000	8084000	We don't know, nobody knows the programming yet.
8084000	8088000	So I'm hoping our friends from Critical Myth might have something.
8088000	8091000	I know Brian from British Invaders I think is there again this year.
8091000	8093000	He's likely on Brit track somewhere.
8093000	8094000	I'm just not sure where yet.
8094000	8096000	So there will be VOG presence somewhere.
8096000	8101000	I remember Anime Expo, I think it was 2000, it was at the Disneyland Hotel.
8101000	8104000	When we had a DDR third mix.
8104000	8109000	And everyone who either didn't have a room, or didn't want to go back to their room,
8109000	8112000	camped out in the arcade room in a ballroom.
8112000	8114000	We had people sleeping on the floor.
8114000	8116000	This is going to be a huge new dynamic for Dragon Con.
8116000	8120000	This is the first year that Dragon Con is going to have a full-fledged arcade.
8120000	8126000	They have a classic arcade and a Japanese arcade, the same people I believe that do Magfest.
8126000	8128000	Although I don't think it will be as much, but it will still be some.
8128000	8131000	That's going to be new for Dragon Con.
8131000	8136000	Usually it's just the old battle tech machines that got converted, that whole thing.
8136000	8138000	Which is a cool thing to see, but that was really it.
8138000	8139000	Heck yeah!
8139000	8140000	Yeah, I mean that was really it.
8140000	8142000	That's what Dan misses about Dave and Busters.
8142000	8145000	And I'm sure they are still there too, don't get me wrong.
8145000	8147000	No, the ones at Dave and Busters are gone.
8147000	8150000	No, no, no, I mean these guys that do the newer one.
8150000	8154000	So yeah, because all the gaming has moved this year.
8154000	8159000	Because in years past, Dark Soccer, if you don't want to go to bed,
8159000	8163000	you go down to the gaming room where there is no windows.
8163000	8165000	So you don't know what time of day it is, ever.
8165000	8167000	And you just play the wolf game until god knows when.
8167000	8169000	And that's what would happen.
8169000	8172000	And I'm sure that will still be a thing this year as well.
8172000	8175000	That was like me playing Vampire at Mobicon.
8175000	8177000	Assuming they didn't finally just ban the wolf game straight up.
8177000	8179000	Because they were starting to last year.
8179000	8181000	Or at least some of the places you could do it.
8181000	8183000	Alright, so what's the wolf game?
8183000	8184000	Is that like the white wolf?
8184000	8185000	The werewolf game.
8185000	8186000	The werewolf game, okay.
8186000	8187000	Like Mafia, that type of thing.
8187000	8188000	Like you're a wolf.
8188000	8191000	I accuse you of being the wolf and that whole thing.
8191000	8192000	And then you've got the seer.
8192000	8194000	You still play that on DDR Freak in the chat.
8194000	8195000	Yes, yes.
8195000	8196000	On the forums.
8196000	8198000	It's a big forum game to play too.
8198000	8200000	So it's fun, but you know.
8200000	8203000	How can we only have two signatures?
8203000	8204000	I'm sorry, four.
8204000	8205000	Sign it.
8205000	8207000	Because that's how many listeners we have, don't you know?
8207000	8208000	Sign it.
8208000	8212000	How could you not please do so?
8212000	8214000	Konami, please do not.
8214000	8218000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat does point out they don't let people sleep in the gaming rooms.
8218000	8221000	People try, but they always wake them up and make them leave.
8221000	8223000	Yeah, you do have to have a hotel.
8223000	8226000	You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here to sleep.
8226000	8227000	So.
8227000	8228000	Alright.
8228000	8230000	Let's move on.
8230000	8231000	You said one more.
8231000	8232000	There's more.
8232000	8233000	Oh, I'm sorry, there's more.
8233000	8234000	I wasn't even done with the email.
8234000	8235000	I'm sorry.
8235000	8236000	Way to assume, Rob.
8236000	8239000	Hey, I was answering questions.
8239000	8241000	Thanks and keep up the great show.
8241000	8242000	Cheers, Martin.
8242000	8243000	There's more.
8244000	8245000	P.S.
8245000	8246000	Okay.
8246000	8250000	Dr. Sakurai mentioned on a past show using a Microsoft thumb trackball, which they don't
8250000	8251000	make anymore.
8251000	8256000	Logitech actually makes a new wireless thumb trackball called the M570, which is really
8256000	8257000	good.
8257000	8258000	I have heard of that one.
8258000	8261000	I just can't use a wireless one at work.
8261000	8264000	I use it every day, myself every day.
8264000	8265000	It saves my hands and wrists.
8265000	8268000	I highly recommend it for any fans of thumb trackballs.
8268000	8270000	There's also one more email.
8270000	8271000	Rob.
8271000	8272000	Okay, yes, I know.
8272000	8273000	I know there was another email.
8273000	8274000	Rob.
8274000	8275000	All right.
8275000	8279000	The day after my previous message, I did, in fact, find Crystal Pepsi in my local convenience
8279000	8280000	store.
8280000	8284000	It's okay, but after a fair cola taste, it seems somewhat artificial.
8284000	8287000	Not really for me, I'm afraid, and it comes from Robert M.
8287000	8293000	Well, Final Fantasy Victory fanfare that you actually found this stuff, and not everybody
8293000	8294000	likes it.
8294000	8299000	It does not taste like pee pee.
8299000	8304000	It was one of those drinks that definitely tasted better when I was a kid, but I like
8304000	8307000	it, but it's just so sugary.
8307000	8308000	You know when it tasted good?
8308000	8310000	I can't drink it all the time.
8310000	8314000	After marching in Mardi Gras parades and they brought out a case of that shit, I was like,
8314000	8317000	I don't care what it tastes like.
8317000	8319000	Plus, it's better in a can.
8319000	8323000	It's better in those light blue cans that it used to come in than a bottle.
8323000	8324000	Yes, you're dead.
8324000	8326000	You're dead because we killed you.
8326000	8331000	Hi, participate at orangeloungeradoo.com is the place to send an email and your observations
8331000	8334000	on Crystal Pepsi and going to conventions.
8334000	8336000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8336000	8338000	It's time to get angsty because we do.
8338000	8358000	FU to my brain damaged dad.
8358000	8362000	I'm done.
8362000	8363000	That was short.
8363000	8364000	Loki.
8365000	8367000	FU to my headache right now.
8367000	8369000	I still have that.
8369000	8378000	And then FU to Asus for really terrible thermal design for their laptops because my laptop
8378000	8383000	right now, I'm not doing anything on it, is idling at 90 degrees Celsius, which is not
8383000	8385000	supposed to be happening.
8385000	8391000	Oh, and hey, that would be cool if I could go into my BIOS and say up the fan speed to
8391000	8392000	kind of help out with that.
8392000	8396000	But nope, that fucking option's not there because for I don't know what reason they
8396000	8398000	just blocked that shit.
8398000	8400000	Sorry, you can't control the fan.
8400000	8403000	We're the fan control, so whatever.
8403000	8404000	We are your fan.
8404000	8405000	So that sucks.
8405000	8410000	And I took it apart like, okay, it's got to be cat hair because it was cat hair last time.
8410000	8411000	Nope, that thing is clean.
8411000	8413000	It is clean as whistles.
8413000	8414000	So I don't know.
8415000	8422000	And finally, fuck you to a local mom and pop drive-in place called the Sunflower Drive-In.
8422000	8427000	It is a vegan, vegetarian burger place that...
8427000	8429000	Oh, God, I've seen that place.
8429000	8431000	Yeah, it's over in Old Fair Oaks, right?
8431000	8432000	Old Fair Oaks, yes.
8432000	8433000	It's over there.
8433000	8437000	My wife wanted me to go get her a nut burger, which I have no problem doing going down there.
8437000	8440000	Hey, honey, I brought you D's nuts.
8440000	8443000	And to be honest, it smells pretty good cooking.
8443000	8446000	I'm not going to eat it, but it smells pretty good cooking.
8446000	8448000	That's not the problem.
8448000	8452000	The problem is how fucking slow they are.
8452000	8457000	Okay, now my wife complains about going to Red Robin because I think they're fantastic
8457000	8462000	and how long it takes to get food from them, and it takes about like 20 minutes.
8462000	8464000	I waited.
8464000	8468000	I literally, from the time I ordered to the time I got the burger,
8468000	8474000	I waited over 45 fucking minutes for a fucking burger.
8474000	8477000	Loki slow-roasting those nuts takes time.
8477000	8479000	Like, do you harvest those off the tree?
8479000	8481000	Were they growing while I was waiting?
8481000	8483000	I mean, like, what?
8483000	8488000	There should be no reason if you're cooking a burger made out of meat, made out of nuts, whatever.
8488000	8492000	It should not take 45 fucking minutes to make a hamburger.
8492000	8494000	I can fucking figure out...
8494000	8495000	Maybe they're part of the slow food movement.
8495000	8497000	Maybe they lost your nuts.
8497000	8501000	It's just like everybody's just standing around while they're just like, I don't know.
8501000	8503000	And then the guy, like, it's bad enough.
8503000	8506000	It just attracts the vegan hippie crowd.
8506000	8508000	I don't like them.
8508000	8509000	I just don't.
8509000	8510000	I'm sorry.
8510000	8514000	It's just, you know, maybe I'm sort of, I don't know if that's racist or whatever,
8514000	8518000	but they're not a race, so I'm not really sure what that's considered.
8518000	8520000	Lifist, I guess.
8520000	8521000	Get off my lawn.
8521000	8522000	Whatever.
8522000	8523000	You're a hipsterist.
8523000	8524000	Hipsterist, yes.
8524000	8525000	Fine.
8525000	8526000	I'll take that.
8526000	8527000	I'll take that.
8527000	8530000	But like, it's just, even then, they were like getting pissed off.
8530000	8533000	They're like, so like, how long is my burger gonna take?
8533000	8535000	I ordered this like 30 minutes ago.
8535000	8539000	It might be another five, ten minutes.
8539000	8541000	I mean, the guy just...
8541000	8543000	I was just so fucking pissed off.
8543000	8548000	Because it was also, because they're a drive-in, they don't really have a lobby.
8548000	8550000	It's outdoors.
8550000	8552000	At lunchtime.
8552000	8554000	In the 95 fucking degree weather.
8554000	8557000	I'm not happy.
8557000	8558000	Alright.
8558000	8560000	My a few of the week is pretty simple.
8560000	8564000	I was reminded about it in chat because I went to 7-Eleven down the street the other day
8564000	8566000	to get the birthday cake Slurpee.
8566000	8568000	And I was really excited to see that they still had it.
8568000	8573000	And I filled up my Slurpee cup and I left and I came home and I started drinking the Slurpee.
8573000	8578000	Some fucking asshole switched out mango for the birthday cake.
8578000	8581000	And I couldn't tell because it was kind of dark, I guess, so the color wasn't quite right.
8581000	8585000	So I ended up with one of those sour mango flavored Slurpees.
8585000	8587000	Which, mango's okay.
8587000	8589000	But it's not birthday cake.
8589000	8595000	And it's like, you know, when you've prepared your taste buds for one thing and then you get another.
8595000	8597000	It's just not, you know...
8597000	8600000	Loki, imagine if you prepare your taste buds for the nut burger.
8600000	8603000	And then you ended up with, I don't know...
8603000	8606000	A hamburger? Oh, that sounds fantastic, actually.
8606000	8610000	And of course everybody in chat is like, that sounds even better.
8610000	8613000	Well, it's not what I wanted. I wanted the birthday cake Slurpee.
8613000	8617000	If I wanted a mango Slurpee, I would have fucking ordered it.
8617000	8619000	Alright. Serious business.
8619000	8622000	A couple more stories for you guys and then we'll get to the Skype line.
8622000	8625000	At Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
8625000	8627000	Alright.
8627000	8630000	And so let's talk a little bit about Final Fantasy XV.
8630000	8634000	Yes, unfortunately, even though we heard the rumors that it was going to be delayed.
8634000	8637000	It's been delayed. It's been delayed to November.
8637000	8641000	And yeah, it's just, they need more time to polish the game.
8641000	8644000	So that's good, I guess.
8644000	8647000	Was there something about trying to avoid a day one patch too?
8647000	8649000	Yeah, basically people don't like day one patches.
8649000	8653000	So, you know, they're gonna, you know, they're trying to avoid that.
8653000	8656000	So they're just polishing it and doing quality testing and stuff like that.
8656000	8659000	On a different note, though, I'm not sure if you're aware.
8659000	8666000	But Kingsglaive, the animated movie, they actually have the first 12 minutes of it online on YouTube.
8666000	8670000	If you haven't gotten a chance to watch that. So I didn't watch that and I thought that was pretty badass.
8670000	8674000	You know, the screenings happened at different theaters a couple days ago.
8674000	8676000	And some people I know went, but they didn't have any here.
8676000	8680000	Because, you know, we're only one of the 20 biggest, you know, metro markets in the nation.
8680000	8683000	But we don't get any of that stuff because we're not San Francisco or LA.
8683000	8686000	So, you know, whatever.
8686000	8689000	But yeah, we, I didn't get to see that in the theater.
8689000	8691000	But I want to see it at some point.
8691000	8695000	Yeah, they're saying that the digital releases of Kingsglaive is not going to be affected by this.
8695000	8701000	But they've decided to hold the physical release of it until November 29th, which is the game's release date.
8703000	8706000	So, oh well. That's fine. I'm willing to wait.
8706000	8709000	If it means it's going to be a better game. We've waited this long.
8709000	8711000	Mm-hmm. Agree.
8711000	8714000	All right, let's see. One more story for you guys.
8714000	8720000	And this is about a retro console. It's called the Retro-Bit Generations.
8720000	8723000	And it is something that's going to be coming out, I guess, over the holiday.
8723000	8729000	It's got over 100 8-bit and 16-bit games from companies like Data East, Capcom, and more.
8729000	8732000	Some of the titles were actually posted over on our forums.
8732000	8734000	Dark Tetsuya actually posted the list.
8734000	8737000	And I got to be honest, there was a lot of stuff on there I kind of didn't recognize.
8737000	8743000	It was a lot of obscure stuff, which I get is part of the cool factor for people that, you know,
8743000	8750000	it's not like you get a game like Kickle Cubicle on other plug-and-play NES-type devices.
8750000	8754000	So this is really for people that are really into the kind of niche stuff.
8754000	8757000	And there is a lot of games included with that, so that's pretty cool.
8757000	8765000	Also of interest here is that this is something that's being shipped through the ShopReadRetro.com store,
8765000	8772000	which is the whole retro magazine, which a couple months ago we got into some of the issues
8772000	8776000	that were going on with the whole Coleco thing, Chameleon and all that.
8776000	8779000	So it's just interesting that this is something that they're involved with now,
8779000	8785000	since that whole doing their own console didn't work out, let's just say.
8785000	8786000	They're shipping somebody else's.
8786000	8790000	But hey, there's going to be some collectors that are into that and some of those old titles.
8790000	8792000	So very cool.
8792000	8795000	And then there's also like some Japanese games that never came out here and stuff.
8795000	8797000	So I mean, it is over 100 games.
8797000	8798000	It's a pretty solid list.
8798000	8800000	So, you know, check that out.
8800000	8803000	I think it was only what, like 60 bucks, I think, for that.
8803000	8805000	So pretty cool.
8805000	8808000	Anyway, that is going to do it.
8808000	8809000	Let's get to the Skype line.
8809000	8811000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8811000	8816000	If you want to give us a call and talk about whatever we might have missed or what have you.
8816000	8819000	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?
8819000	8822000	Yeah, I got this thing in my email and I liked it.
8822000	8825000	I was following this for a while and I just like forgot about it.
8825000	8827000	But apparently it's still a thing.
8827000	8831000	So it's this console that they've been trying to start up for this company called NGeniX.
8831000	8839000	It's called the OtonX, which was supposed to be a console that would have procedurally generated games.
8839000	8846000	So basically you would give it like an idea for you to pick a genre or something and it would spit out a game,
8846000	8851000	which sounds really terrible, but that was a thing that they're running with.
8851000	8854000	But their Kickstarter campaign apparently is starting on Monday.
8854000	8861000	And they've already secured 95% of the system software development funding,
8861000	8868000	but now they're trying to raise $25,000 to add or improve current features with minor software enhancements.
8868000	8870000	I don't know, the whole thing seems very...
8870000	8872000	So like randomly generated games?
8872000	8875000	It's supposed to be like, yeah, it's supposed to be an autonomy.
8875000	8881000	They say it'll be the first autonomous game console ever, meaning it will self-produce games without a developer or human input.
8881000	8883000	So No Man's Sky the game console?
8883000	8885000	Sort of, yeah. No Man's Console.
8885000	8887000	No Man's Console. All right, we got a call coming in. Let's get to it.
8887000	8889000	Hi, you're on OrangeLawn's Radio. Who's this?
8889000	8891000	Hey, this is Def.
8891000	8892000	Yeah, Def. How you doing, buddy?
8892000	8894000	Pretty good, pretty good.
8894000	8895000	What's on your mind?
8895000	8900000	Well, I want to talk about Metal Gear Survive.
8900000	8901000	Yeah.
8901000	8906000	And it's something, well, I'm going to plug my podcast a little.
8906000	8907000	Please?
8907000	8912000	We recorded our fifth episode today.
8912000	8921000	And we were talking about that game specifically and what it meant for Konami and the gaming community in general.
8922000	8931000	And one point that I think Loki talked about is that who is left in Konami that we know about?
8931000	8939000	Like, who are the important people right now in Konami that we can recognize?
8939000	8947000	Because we don't have Kojima, we don't have Igarashi, we don't have even Naoki Maeda.
8947000	8949000	So, who's left?
8950000	8955000	People that worked with them. That's the honest-to-god answer.
8955000	8959000	Soldier. Soldier is left. Soldier number one and number two.
8959000	8963000	And yeah, that's the problem with Konami right now.
8963000	8969000	They only have the names, but they don't have any recognition beyond that.
8969000	8975000	And it's sad. It's kind of sad that Konami has pretty much gone to that.
8975000	8981000	That, oh, we have Metal Gear, we have Pro Evolution Soccer, we have the money.
8981000	8988000	Even though, well, they pretty much didn't promote it for quite years here.
8988000	8990000	Yeah, they let it go for a long time.
8990000	8999000	And granted, to be fair with all the crap that we give them, I feel like I'm more interested in the music stuff coming out of Konami than I have been for a very long time.
8999000	9002000	So, I'll give them that.
9003000	9010000	Yeah, and that's surprising, too, that they're promoting now what is the Bemani series, even in the United States.
9010000	9013000	If they just want to stick with that, that's totally fine.
9013000	9018000	Like, they can just stick with the music game series and maybe get some more stuff here in America.
9018000	9024000	I mean, this whole round one partnership's been pretty awesome, but home releases again of 2DX would be fucking fantastic.
9024000	9029000	Although, I'm not going to hold my breath, because obviously the controllers are holding that back, but whatever.
9029000	9033000	Home release of any Bemani game, it would be awesome.
9033000	9034000	Yeah, it would be.
9034000	9035000	Really.
9037000	9041000	Hey, this whole Pokemon Worlds thing, were you watching it at all?
9041000	9045000	I actually missed it, because I was watching the Olympics.
9045000	9049000	Oh, you're not going to go back and watch the archive or anything like that?
9049000	9055000	I probably watched the Pokken tournament stuff, because I'm really interested in that.
9055000	9063000	Maybe the video game Alpha Fire stuff, I'll watch the finals, too.
9063000	9068000	But yeah, I'm probably going to watch Pokken, because that's my game, so.
9068000	9069000	Yeah, I gotcha.
9069000	9073000	I didn't see any of the competition stuff, but it looks like some good stuff.
9073000	9079000	I got the SensacDeft on Twitter, there was a little jealousy of the Pokkicenter trip that we took.
9079000	9080000	Oh, yeah.
9082000	9083000	Why is that?
9083000	9090000	The Pokemon World stuff, every year is really, really hard to get.
9090000	9096000	I have some from 2014, but that's pretty much it.
9096000	9108000	Last year, well, in 2014, the stuff from there is really hard to get and really expensive, too.
9108000	9114000	The plushies, the Pikachu plushies, can go for really, really expensive top dollar.
9114000	9118000	God, the guys that buy and sell those things are fucking assholes, huh?
9118000	9125000	Kind of, but some do it because, well, there's the Pokemon Collectors Community in LiveJournal,
9125000	9131000	and they do trades and group buys and all that stuff, so there's that.
9131000	9135000	But yeah, there's other people that do it for profit, so yeah.
9135000	9138000	What did you think of that limited edition one they had this year?
9138000	9142000	This cute little Pikachu that has a little trolley with it to represent San Francisco.
9142000	9143000	What did you think of that one?
9143000	9144000	It's really cute.
9144000	9154000	It doesn't top the 2014 one because 2014 is kind of like a wrestling Pikachu.
9154000	9157000	It has the belt and it has a cape.
9157000	9158000	It's really awesome.
9158000	9165000	But this one, it's probably my second favorite because it looks pretty cute and it's a good design.
9165000	9172000	Yeah, and I'm not going to lie, ActDeaf, I did pick one up and they are super cute as hell.
9172000	9180000	And I also have to say, I saw your tweets that you were a little bit jealous of the whole fact that we were there at the Poki Center
9180000	9187000	and got these little plushie dolls, and I thought, you know, ActDeaf's been a big supporter of OLR for a very long time
9187000	9189000	and always calls in the show and has great things to say.
9189000	9195000	So my point is, ActDeaf, I went back to the Poki Center and I bought another plushie for you.
9195000	9198000	So I'll get your address off air and I'll send that to you.
9198000	9201000	Oh my god, awesome. Thank you so much.
9201000	9206000	You're welcome. So you don't have to deal with those third-party reseller bullshit because those guys suck.
9206000	9210000	So I got one for you and just as a thank you for everything you've done over the years.
9210000	9212000	So we'll connect off air.
9212000	9216000	Oh my god, that's pretty awesome. Like, really, thank you.
9216000	9225000	You're welcome very much. I don't mind. I will let you know, at the time you sent the tweet, I was eating America's finest version of Mexican food, Chipotle.
9227000	9229000	That probably helped.
9230000	9238000	And yeah, I got up. It wasn't that we were only like a block away. The whole thing was across the street from the Metreon, believe it or not.
9238000	9249000	Hopefully, since next year's in Anaheim, if I can get my travel visa and all that, it's like a three-hour drive from here.
9249000	9252000	So maybe I can go next year, but we'll see.
9252000	9257000	There you go. And you might get to see Shane compete.
9257000	9258000	Yeah.
9258000	9263000	The way things are going. All right. Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy. I'm glad you called in so I can let you know that.
9263000	9265000	Thank you so much.
9265000	9266000	You're welcome. Bye-bye.
9266000	9269000	I just linked the petition to Kojima.
9272000	9275000	Oh my god. How many signatures are we up to? Six?
9276000	9277000	Eight.
9277000	9281000	I haven't signed it yet, so maybe we'll get double digits by the end of the night.
9281000	9287000	All right. We've got more calls coming in, so let's get to it. Oren Sanz Radio on Skype. Hi, Oren Sanz Radio. Who's this?
9287000	9289000	Hey, this is Ragingator.
9289000	9291000	Hey, Ragingator. How's this going? I like the bald look you've got going.
9291000	9302000	Oh, thanks. You know, I more or less had to grant it. Buffalo doesn't get quite as high as it does out in California, but still, it's been not too pleasant here.
9302000	9316000	I hate Hawaii, so that being said, you know, I've been sitting around doing nothing and still breaking out on the mop side with a full hill here, so this was kind of necessary.
9316000	9318000	I hear you. What's on your mind?
9318000	9337000	Well, it's kind of a well-known factoid that Orange Lounge Radio owns its existence to arcades, and the three of you have professed your love of arcades God knows how many times.
9337000	9365000	Now, that being said, assuming that money was no object and that the three of you had the space in your homes to do so, if each of you could go out right now and buy five arcade machines yourselves and put them in your homes, which ones would that be?
9365000	9380000	Ooh, five. You're generous. Gosh. Okay. So, I don't know if you guys heard Ragingator's question, but again, if money and space were not a concern, what five arcade games would you go and get right now?
9380000	9387000	Essentially, I'm summarizing it there. Dark Soccer, you already have arcade games in your house.
9387000	9389000	I just linked it to Del Toro.
9390000	9401000	I don't know if this is the best question for you, Dark Soccer, because you already have games in your house. I mean, it's just JIRUS is the only arcade game, so to speak, and the rest are pinball games, but let's say-
9401000	9403000	No, we have a Blastroids.
9403000	9412000	Oh, do you? Oh, that's right, you do. That's right. Okay, well, hell, if money was not a concern or space, what would be the five games you would get?
9412000	9416000	I'd have a 2DX, so I can just put whatever I want in it.
9416000	9417000	Yep.
9417000	9421000	I'd have my own DDR, so that I could have dedicated exercise.
9421000	9422000	Yep.
9422000	9426000	I would have a sit-down space Harrier.
9426000	9427000	Ooh, okay.
9427000	9440000	I would have a Fantasy Zone, and since the Guardian Legend didn't come out in arcades, probably...
9441000	9449000	Ooh, that's hard. I think I'd have a Neo Geo AVS 6, uh, 8-cart, 8-cart, uh, 6-player system.
9449000	9452000	Wait, I thought the AVS was, uh, the whole console-
9452000	9453000	Sorry, MVS.
9453000	9454000	Yep.
9454000	9456000	I have an AVS already.
9457000	9459000	Good picks. Uh, for me-
9459000	9461000	Because then that means I could have, like, eight games in one machine.
9461000	9467000	Um, I'm gonna blur the line a little bit, but I always talk about wanting this machine, and goddamn it, I'm gonna have one someday.
9467000	9472000	A baby Pac-Man machine. I mean, that's kind of hybrid, and I realize the game is not that great, but I still want it.
9472000	9476000	Um, a hybrid, uh, video game pinball table. That would be my number one.
9476000	9483000	Uh, I want a Dance Maniacs machine, because one of my friends has one, and I'm a jealous hoe, so I really want one of those in my house.
9483000	9485000	And that would be my exercise as well.
9485000	9490000	I would also have to get the Beat Mania 2DX machine, because if space is no concern, then great.
9490000	9494000	Apparently I have this door that leads to Narnia, where I'm gonna store all this stuff.
9494000	9496000	Uh, so I definitely want one of those.
9496000	9499000	I want a Burger Time machine, because I'm regretful.
9499000	9503000	I had the opportunity to get one, and I didn't do it, and it-
9503000	9510000	If I- If that place had still been there even a month later, I probably could have afforded it and brought it home, and it would have been my first arcade machine.
9510000	9514000	And, you know, that game's kind of like this long-running inside joke.
9514000	9518000	So yeah, I'm just- I'm really upset that I don't have one, so that would be it.
9518000	9520000	And then for the fifth machine, um...
9521000	9525000	Actually, I'm gonna go- I'm gonna go a little crazy, and I'm just gonna go for something from my childhood.
9525000	9528000	I would want a cocktail cabinet.
9528000	9531000	Or, you know, it's not a cabinet, but it's a cocktail machine.
9531000	9534000	It's the one that you can sit down, and it's like the table is the game.
9534000	9543000	Uh, most expos that celebrate classic gaming, you'll see one of these pulled out there, but you don't really see them out in the wild so much anymore.
9543000	9552000	I would love a cocktail machine. Probably Ms. Pac-Man, or if I could find it, it would be a pain in the ass, I could find it, Time Pilot.
9552000	9558000	I found- For a moment, I thought I had found you a baby Pac-Man. Actually, I did, but they want way too much money for it. They want, like, two grand.
9558000	9562000	And then you gotta ship it out here, too, unless it's in Northern California somewhere.
9562000	9564000	Uh... I'll find out.
9564000	9565000	Yeah.
9565000	9568000	So those are my five. Uh, Loki, what about you?
9568000	9576000	Um... I'd have to get a DDR machine, for sure. Just, I don't know which one. A newer one?
9576000	9578000	Um...
9580000	9588000	Let's see... Uh, I guess? It's gotta have, like, a racing game of some sort, so, you know...
9588000	9591000	I don't know, what's the most expensive racing game I could think of?
9591000	9593000	Probably one of those new Mario Kart games.
9593000	9594000	Eh, fuck Mario Kart. That's stupid.
9594000	9597000	Initial D8 stage. We saw that at round one this weekend.
9597000	9600000	Okay, fine. We'll go with Initial D. I am not an Initial D fan, but whatever.
9600000	9607000	Um... I think it'd be fun to, uh, have a Derby Owners Club, so we'll get the full set up.
9607000	9609000	Yes! I will be at your house.
9609000	9611000	If space is not a concern, fuck yeah, let's do it.
9611000	9615000	It's not a concern. So let's do Derby Owners Club, and then, um...
9615000	9619000	Oh, what's that space game that's really large, too, that has a theater and laser dicks?
9619000	9620000	Galaxian 3?
9620000	9623000	Galaxian 3, yes. That's- Thank you. I was trying to think of the name.
9623000	9627000	I think, uh, Galaxian 3. How many is that so far? That's three? Okay.
9627000	9629000	No, that's four. You have four.
9629000	9634000	Um... I would do also a...
9634000	9637000	How about one of those giant X-Men machines?
9637000	9638000	Eh...
9638000	9641000	Okay, with the three TVs. I'm just thinking big, because clearly...
9641000	9642000	It was two.
9642000	9643000	Was it two? I thought it was three.
9643000	9644000	It was two.
9644000	9648000	Yeah, I'm not really big on that. Um, how about, like, a...
9648000	9650000	Oh, gosh. Um...
9652000	9654000	I don't even know. Um...
9654000	9656000	How about a Ridiculous Ticket Redemption game?
9656000	9658000	A Ridiculous Ticket Redemption game?
9658000	9659000	Spider Stomp.
9659000	9661000	Oh, God, no. Spider Stomp.
9661000	9665000	Uh, let's do, like, a, um...
9665000	9667000	I don't know what this...
9667000	9670000	The most ridiculous skeeball machine we can think of.
9670000	9674000	Oh, okay. Like an ultra skeeball machine. I like it. I love it.
9674000	9678000	Uh, JD in chat says keyboard mania. I can't believe that didn't make my list.
9678000	9683000	I guess because it was so short run in arcades. They only had the three mixes.
9683000	9687000	But, shoot. I guess, you know, for my dance maniacs machine, you know...
9687000	9692000	I want that, because that's going to be good exercise, but I would love a keyboard mania machine.
9692000	9694000	But, you know, the home version of keyboard mania was really playful.
9694000	9699000	If you want to get the full exercise thing, you've got to have a DDR, and then you've got to have a prop cycle.
9700000	9703000	Oh, I want one of those prop cycle Addams Family pinball games.
9703000	9706000	That was, like, a single custom that someone made.
9706000	9708000	It was a prop cycle pinball game.
9708000	9709000	How do you even do that?
9709000	9710000	Somebody custom made it.
9710000	9711000	It worked.
9711000	9712000	It's ridiculous.
9712000	9717000	Oh, I know, I know with Arcadia, you could have what Scandia has, that gigantic shooting range.
9717000	9719000	Oh, that's stupid, but yes, totally going to get that.
9719000	9725000	But you could, like, custom make it so that the shooting range, you're shooting different things instead of Wild West.
9725000	9727000	You're shooting, I don't know, celebrities or something.
9727000	9730000	Medieval stuff, because that makes no sense.
9730000	9731000	Alright, anyway.
9731000	9733000	Alright, Raginator, there you go.
9733000	9734000	We indulged your question.
9734000	9736000	I hope you like the answers.
9736000	9738000	Alright, I'm flipping it on you.
9738000	9739000	What's going on in your arcade?
9739000	9741000	What five machines would you buy?
9741000	9746000	Alright, well, some of them were, you know, kind of, like, no doubt answers.
9747000	9750000	The 1989 TMNT game.
9750000	9751000	Oh, good one.
9752000	9753000	Smash TV.
9754000	9755000	Oh, great.
9756000	9759000	Then Final Fight.
9759000	9760000	Okay, good.
9761000	9765000	I'm going to steal one of Dark Soccer's answers.
9765000	9767000	The Neo Geo MVS.
9767000	9771000	Although, granted, I never, ever saw an eight-slot one.
9771000	9774000	If only once all you ever saw was a two-slot and a four-slot.
9774000	9778000	So, that being said, I'll take the four-slot.
9778000	9785000	You are one super Iron Man, Ivan Stewart, off-road machine from being every pizza joint in the 90s.
9786000	9789000	That needs a Last Action Hero pinball, too.
9790000	9794000	And I'll probably go with Killer Instinct.
9794000	9796000	Oh, okay, good pick.
9796000	9797000	I like that.
9797000	9798000	I like that. That's great.
9798000	9803000	Oh, by the way, s2100matt has an idea for how you can retrofit the shooting range, Loki.
9803000	9805000	Vegans and hipsters.
9805000	9807000	No, that's stupid.
9807000	9810000	We wouldn't want to be surrounded by vegans and hipsters.
9810000	9811000	That'd just be creepy.
9811000	9812000	Let's do Silent Hill, though.
9812000	9813000	That'd be less creepy.
9813000	9818000	I was just thinking about the little game room that I managed at the University of South Alabama.
9818000	9824000	We had in there a World Cup soccer pinball, which I own, a Killer Instinct.
9824000	9827000	We had a Dark Stalkers 3.
9827000	9836000	We had Street Fighter Alpha 2, Cyber Sled, and King of Fighters 94.
9836000	9837000	Nice.
9837000	9839000	Or do they count multi-cabinets as one cabinet?
9839000	9844000	Because I would have to get a Daytona set up with 16 cabinets long.
9844000	9846000	So ridiculous that I'll never use.
9846000	9849000	Just so I walk in the room, flip on the switches.
9849000	9852000	Daytona na na na na na na na.
9852000	9854000	Just invite Jamie over.
9854000	9857000	I have to show you something in my room.
9857000	9858000	And then you open the door.
9858000	9861000	Do do do do do do do do.
9861000	9864000	You're like, excuse me, and then come back with a sledgehammer.
9864000	9865000	Oops.
9865000	9866000	Does insurance cover this?
9867000	9873000	No, I should probably point out something that J.D. mentioned in chat.
9873000	9877000	He does mention, bring up a valid point.
9877000	9880000	He, let me screw up real quick.
9880000	9883000	He says, what about Cruis'n World?
9883000	9887000	And that's definitely a contender.
9887000	9893000	That would be like honorable mention for me, like a sixth option.
9893000	9894000	I know.
9894000	9895000	It's only five machines.
9895000	9898000	Because now I'm thinking like, oh, I'd want a Spy Hunter machine.
9898000	9903000	And now I want, now that I brought up Iron Man, Stewart, Off-Road, I actually kind of want one of those.
9903000	9904000	It's like, yeah.
9904000	9906000	Oh, my arcade's getting busy.
9906000	9907000	All right.

9915000	9916000	Bye.
9916000	9917000	Bye.
9917000	9918000	All right.
9918000	9919000	That's fine.
9919000	9920000	It's fun to spend money that I don't have.
9920000	9921000	We'll try to fit in one more call if somebody else wants to get in.
9921000	9922000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9922000	9924000	And yeah, they'll see if anybody else wants to call in.
9924000	9925000	Do you have any other last minute stories, Logie?
9925000	9926000	No, that was it.
9926000	9927000	That was it.
9927000	9931000	Any gaming accomplishments you guys are going to try to do in the next week?
9931000	9932000	Anything you guys are going to try to do?
9932000	9933000	I'm going to try to get a pet owl.
9933000	9934000	Yeah.
9934000	9936000	When are we playing WoW together?
9936000	9938000	Do you want to tomorrow night after work?
9938000	9939000	Possibly.
9939000	9942000	I don't know if I'm supposed to say this on air, but I'll give you a preview.
9942000	9946000	We are taping the new reading is fundamental is finally coming back.
9946000	9947000	We're taping our first episode tomorrow.
9947000	9950000	So I have that.
9950000	9951000	But I mean, that's only going to be like an hour.
9951000	9953000	We could do Tuesday.
9953000	9954000	It's episode zero.
9954000	9958000	It's where it's where we dish on what we hope will happen.
9958000	9959000	Oh, my God.
9959000	9960000	I already know what I want to happen.
9960000	9961000	What's that?
9961000	9964000	Katya, all the things I want.
9964000	9971000	I want Alyssa to rip off Coco's wig at one point.
9971000	9973000	And I want Katya to win.
9973000	9976000	We're going to have to invite Dark Sakura on reading is fundamental, which you can follow
9976000	9978000	that on Twitter at RF podcast.
9978000	9982000	But I know not everybody who listens to the show is into Drag Race, which is unfortunate.
9982000	9985000	So I guess no other calls are coming in.
9985000	9987000	So I'm going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.
9987000	9990000	But if you think of something after the fact, you can always email us.
9990000	9993000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or you can always tweet us as well.
9993000	9995000	Tweet us as well at OLR.
9995000	9998000	But in the meantime, I think it's time to shut the show down for the night.

10056000	10061000	I'm going to be sad, but same time we're going to we're going to keep it trucking to make you proud.
10061000	10062000	OK.
10062000	10064000	You're like, I don't care. All right.
10064000	10067000	Just kidding.
10067000	10070000	All right. Your final thought tonight, Dark Sakura.
10070000	10074000	Fucking people, I swear.
10074000	10079000	My final thought for tonight is I really need to clean the living room and get my amiibo collection up to date,
10079000	10081000	because I still have amiibo in the package.
10081000	10085000	I got to get up and I haven't I but I've been I haven't bought any new amiibo in a while.
10085000	10086000	I was new amiibo.
10086000	10090000	I need to get the Marie and the Splatoon girls.
10090000	10092000	I need to get them.
10092000	10094000	The target by my house is plenty of the Splatoon packs.
10094000	10095000	Yeah.
10095000	10099000	And they're honestly they're not amiibo aren't exactly hard to find like they were now.
10099000	10101000	So I'll get them at some point.
10101000	10105000	I have I picked up another set for the ones I wanted.
10105000	10111000	And I got the Kirby ones for the game that I don't even have.
10111000	10113000	Well, why not?
10113000	10115000	They're things. They're shiny things.
10115000	10117000	I wanted Waddle Dee.
10117000	10119000	Because I want them all.
10119000	10123000	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10123000	10125000	I don't know. I'm tired.
10125000	10126000	Go.
10126000	10127000	All right.
10127000	10128000	We're tired.
10128000	10130000	So that's going to do it here at Orange Lounge Radio.
