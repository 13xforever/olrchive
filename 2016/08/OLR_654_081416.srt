00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week Rocket League wraps up its Championship Series and teases more new content bringing

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,880
power-ups to your favorite RC-powered soccer simulator.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,160
Loosen your boots and join us for this and plenty more news on tonight's episode of the

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,440
show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,040
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:44,320
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, August the 14th of 2016 with episode number 654 of

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
our show.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,840
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California to talk

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,000
with you guys over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,280
Again I'm Rob and you can find me on Twitter at Skie and she is DarkSakura.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,520
I have blue roots.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,460
Yeah, actually I love this hair thing you've got going on with the blended like blue to

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,460
red thing.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,600
I went to see Monet and my hair is blue going into red in some parts and purple in others.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,440
So it's actually both.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,840
It's really unfortunate that this is radio so nobody can see it.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,440
Maybe if someone bribes me with cheesecake, I'll take a picture.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,080
I will thank you for being a friend.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,080
You'll travel around the world and back again for cheesecake.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,800
Also joining us tonight, welcome back this week, Loki.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,040
Yes and my breadsticks go from marinara to creamy garlic sauce.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,400
Oh, I see that it's blended, blended sauces as opposed to blended hair.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,040
I see, fantastic.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
How was your couple weeks been?

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm sorry you weren't here last week, but yeah, I had to deal with the kids last week.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,840
I understand it happens because my wife couldn't pick them up and as a result, we had to deal

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
with Shane.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
So thank you for that.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
No, it's fine.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
No, he did.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
He did.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
It was at Power Morphicon.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
He did a fine job.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Yeah.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
He's at Power Morphicon right now actually.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,200
And this will be the second podcast today where I've brought him up.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,760
His ego has got to be swelling because we did Poke Stop earlier today.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
He wasn't able to be there.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,560
So obviously because he's doing the Power Morphicon stuff of covering for Ranger Pride,

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
his show.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,860
So, but I'm sure he'll be back another week to bless us with his presence again and talk

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,160
about how his shiny hunting is going.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Yep.

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,300
So it's basically been just a rollercoaster of karma, I guess.

46
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,960
So starting off with the bad karma, I guess for some reason, well not even really bad

47
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,920
karma, just bad shit that fucking happened.

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:46,000
So like I was at work and my pants ripped like to the point, like thankfully it was,

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,600
I was already at my car, you know, when that happened.

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,320
So it wasn't like anything embarrassing, but like, like almost to the point where like

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
one of the pant legs could literally have come off.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't even know how that happened.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,800
It's just like, I'm like, where the fuck did this happen?

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Same day, check engine light comes on, like, are you fucking kidding me?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
And then I go home, check your engine and check your caboose.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,560
And then I go home to work on my computer and everything's cool.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,600
Then all of a sudden, you know, I go to shut my son's window because it's, you know, it's

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,840
just before bed, you know, and everything.

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,220
I shut his window, come back, my computer's black screen.

60
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,160
And I was like, okay, that's weird.

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,800
So I restart it, won't restart, have to reload windows again, reload windows, seems fine

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,160
for a while, start to, you know, import myself for my backup again.

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,440
Fucking does it again.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Did it again.

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,280
Today, I redid everything.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Once again, third time, finally had the reinstall windows for the third time.

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,880
So far, it hasn't crashed yet, but that's the shit I have to fucking deal with.

68
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,320
So wait, so that's the bad karma.

69
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
What's the good karma?

70
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,060
Oh, the good karma is just, you know, work shit.

71
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,600
So basically I've had lots of meetings with people.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
The department I'm working in right now, they're very manual for everything that they do.

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,120
So like data entry stuff is just all very manual.

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,560
So by showing a little ass at work, you got a promotion?

75
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
No, no, no.

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,760
That's what it sounds like to me.

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,720
No, no, no, by basically, because we use a terminal program that basically emulates an

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,680
old mainframe system and it supports macros and those macros support Visual Basic Scripting.

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,400
And so out of sheer boredom or just curiosity, I've been teaching myself Visual Basic Scripting.

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,640
That is a great skill to have.

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,640
We had some people at my old job that's like, that did that stuff.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Yes.

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,640
And I've fucking rocked it basically because I've automated a ton of shit and just like

84
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
done stuff with her.

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
They're like, I didn't even know you could do that.

86
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,440
And just like all my boss, my boss's boss, the director of the environment, they're just

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,860
like all fucking static.

88
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,560
Would you say that maybe all those programming things for the game you never fucking finished?

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,200
I was trying to work on it twice when I've tried to work on it.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,140
My computer is just self-destructed.

91
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,780
So it's like, I've tried, but the fucking universe doesn't want it to happen.

92
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
You're cursed.

93
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Oh, hi.

94
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
I need to introduce as well.

95
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,940
We also have here in studio, another special guest to the show who has nothing to promote.

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,300
Not even a Twitter, not a show.

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,500
He's just here to hang out.

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,260
Say hello everybody to Mike.

99
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
What's up?

100
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Hey Mike.

101
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
How's it going?

102
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Is your mic on, Mike?

103
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
I don't know.

104
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
I don't know why we weren't hearing you.

105
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
Anyway.

106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Hi Mike.

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
How are you?

108
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm doing good.

109
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
How are you?

110
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,380
It is the show.

111
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
It is.

112
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,060
I thought you were promoting a sports podcast last time you were here, but it never happened.

113
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,980
No, I just said I was, I was, uh, no, what was it?

114
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
Uh, Hearthstone.

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
I was doing Hearthstone.

116
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Oh, Hearthstone.

117
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Are you still streaming?

118
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Hearthstone?

119
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,980
I haven't had the time to stream lately, but yeah, it's on my list.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
It's on my list.

121
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
It's on my to do list.

122
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
It's a lengthy to do list.

123
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
But yeah.

124
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,860
Uh, Mike also joined us on Pokestop podcast this week, filled in for an absent Shane.

125
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,180
So there's that.

126
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,180
Um, and you have such a unique name that people could find too easy on the internet.

127
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
If you want to follow you.

128
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
I'm sure.

129
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Exactly.

130
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,340
Well maybe this time around, I'll, I'll plug a Twitter handle or something.

131
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
There you go.

132
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
You know, believe I'm interesting enough.

133
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
There you go.

134
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
Awesome.

135
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,660
Uh, as 200 Matt in chat says, yay sports, do you play sports games?

136
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,500
I mean, this, this is a big time to be talking usually, usually the one show a year will

137
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,060
regress in a sports game.

138
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,340
Talk is, is Superbowl Sunday, but we have Olympics right now and that's kind of a big

139
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
deal.

140
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
Do you play sports games?

141
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I don't play sports games.

142
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,820
Um, only because they make me want to just go play the sport instead.

143
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,780
And then you're one of those guys.

144
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,380
You're one of those guys, right?

145
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,740
Why, why would I, why would I play double dribble when I can go outside and actually

146
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
bounce about?

147
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,500
I want to see the look of shame on the person's face.

148
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,540
But can you, can you dunk like the game?

149
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,540
Not anymore.

150
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,540
I used to.

151
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,540
Yeah.

152
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,540
That's cool.

153
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,340
So, so, uh, do you, do you play like the Olympic games?

154
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,420
I mean, I suppose this is a topical question for me to ask you ever played any of those

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,380
like Mario and Sonic at the, uh, the last one I played was, Oh good God, it was, uh,

156
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,740
the 2008 Olympic one.

157
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
The Wii one.

158
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
That was, those are huge.

159
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Yeah.

160
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Those are huge.

161
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Yeah.

162
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
It made your shoulders burn, man.

163
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Yeah.

164
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Cause you had to work it up a sweat and everything.

165
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
It was disgusting.

166
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,980
I was like, Oh, this is too much for a game for me.

167
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,220
Um, let's see.

168
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,940
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, where we do tape live every Sunday night

169
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,420
at the voice geeks, network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right

170
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,060
after the Bobby Blackwell show at Bobby actually starts us off here with a comment in our chat

171
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,740
at live.vognetwork.com with I played the official video game of the real Olympics grand theft

172
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
auto five.

173
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
Yes.

174
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,420
I am hearing there are some unfortunate issues going on there.

175
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,140
Um, that joke is probably an extreme USA basketball staying on a boat.

176
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,860
It's uh, it's, that joke is probably an extremely poor taste, but I did snicker, um, as it happens,

177
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,820
uh, dark to see and chat says, that's why I prefer NBA jam and NFL blitz.

178
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,540
I was never into sports.

179
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,420
What do you tell all the gamers that are like, I'm not into sports.

180
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,380
Do we need to just suck it up and try or what?

181
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Try playing sports?

182
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
Yeah.

183
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
No, it's not for everyone.

184
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
I coach.

185
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,380
I see it.

186
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,980
It's like, yeah, it's not for everyone.

187
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,620
Do you, I don't know if I should ask this cause I don't want you to get in trouble if

188
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
somebody hears this.

189
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Okay.

190
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,020
Do you ever have a kid that you're coaching where you're like, just seriously pull the

191
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,980
kid out of class all the time.

192
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:34,080
But then I, since I'm a good coach, I encourage them nonetheless and uh, understand that most

193
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,420
of it's confidence.

194
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:43,340
So it's like if I, you know, especially in basketball, it's not, uh, all about scoring.

195
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,560
It's like, there's so much other things that you can do to be helpful.

196
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,280
So it's like, I'm going to find something that you're going to get you that you're good

197
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
at.

198
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,120
That was a very PC answer that won't get you fired.

199
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,760
You handled that very well.

200
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,600
That's actually how I really, truly do it.

201
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
That's not just being PC.

202
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
That's actually how I do it.

203
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,720
That's a great answer.

204
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,560
You should go volunteer for the Donald Trump campaign and help his ass out cause he needs

205
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
to help him.

206
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Yeah.

207
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Um, where do I get cyanide?

208
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
A shovel.

209
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Cyanide?

210
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
All right.

211
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Not, not, not.

212
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Okay.

213
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Not okay.

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
A shovel will help because you're going to need a solid foundation for a giant wall like

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
that.

216
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
There you go.

217
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Now that's a funny joke.

218
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
All right.

219
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Okay.

220
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Anyway, uh, let's see.

221
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,920
Going back to our chat live.vognetwork.com Bobby Black Wolf says, I played baseball for

222
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,760
two years as a young kid, but my stereo blindness made it hard to watch the ball, but they had

223
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,840
to play me anyway because every kid got played.

224
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Yep.

225
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,280
So, so you, so you have to put the kids in.

226
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Yeah.

227
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,120
But then like I get to make up my roster.

228
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,120
So like my, my lineup, so it's like, I'm going to make sure that that kid that's the weakest

229
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,720
is at least with some kid that knows what he's doing or she, you know, um, Oh, do you

230
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,920
ever get kids that think they know everything about the sport because they played video

231
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
games?

232
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,300
No, actually I've never, I've never had that happen.

233
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
I've never had that happen.

234
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,760
I think of like, like I've been coaching for like eight years and I've only had one kid

235
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
ever mentioned like playing 2k or anything like that.

236
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,560
Oh, no one plays them.

237
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,440
Hey, well I was, 2k is fun.

238
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
It's just not a game that I go out and pick up.

239
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
Well, I was thinking there's so many like kids that are like, well, I saw that he saw

240
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,360
somebody do this on TV.

241
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
It's easy.

242
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,120
So video games seems like a natural progression to watch space jam.

243
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
I can jam.

244
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
Yeah, I could dunk from half court.

245
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Heck yeah.

246
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,380
Bugs Bunny could do it.

247
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
He's a rabbit.

248
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,580
I mean, for God's sakes.

249
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,900
Actually Loki brings up a very important question that I have to ask, you know, any

250
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,100
basketball coach I'm ever going to talk to in my life of which you're the only one I

251
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
know.

252
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,380
So here you go.

253
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,220
On a scale of one to 10, how culturally important is the movie Space Jam?

254
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,020
Space Jam is life.

255
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,720
So 11.

256
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Maybe even a 12.

257
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Okay.

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
It's important.

259
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,060
It's an important movie.

260
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,700
And at this point in time, none of the kids have seen Space Jam.

261
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
You know what?

262
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,280
Why don't you sit them down the first day and be like, you need to, oh no, I just avoid

263
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,800
trying to talk about that stuff with them because I'm like, uh, you're going to make

264
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,640
me feel way older than I need to feel.

265
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Two truths.

266
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,480
I own it on laser disc.

267
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Second truth.

268
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,760
Haven't seen it all the way through.

269
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
What?

270
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
This needs to be fixed.

271
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,200
I'll tell you something that needs to be fixed.

272
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
Is it too soon for spoilers on that?

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,400
They go to outer space and then play basketball.

274
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Yes.

275
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Guess who wins?

276
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,320
The Looney Tunes.

277
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Let's see.

278
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,520
Art Tetsuya in chat says, I think the Space Jam official website is still up.

279
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
It is.

280
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
And it's amazing.

281
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
It is.

282
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
It is original.

283
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,040
It re it reminds you of a time when the only city in America that mattered was geo cities.

284
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,080
Oh, it just takes you back to a simpler time.

285
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,880
Uh, and STO 100 Matt says, come on, Rab slam.

286
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Come on Rab.

287
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,480
Come on, Rob slam and welcome to the jam.

288
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,040
Every time they say they want going to remake that movie, I die a little bit.

289
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Me too.

290
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,800
Just, just don't like Hollywood, Hollywood needs to stop with the remakes.

291
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Stop.

292
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,280
Well, they didn't want to do all of the remake.

293
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,240
They wanted to do a quote unquote, seek cool.

294
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,760
Even spiritual, even sequels are getting a little worrisome.

295
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,120
Like I just, I just heard the other week they're going to make a sequel to the craft and I'm

296
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,360
like, no, no, don't touch that.

297
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,680
Well, they have the new witch movie coming out.

298
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,000
Now you see here's where I'm on the line.

299
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,960
I actually hear that's really, really good.

300
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
So I don't know.

301
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,360
So I guess I can't use the blanket statement of ban all sequels and ban all remakes.

302
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,960
Cause if I said ban all sequels, we wouldn't get new star Wars movies and you know, kind

303
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
of need those.

304
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,680
But then again, that last star Trek movie here was not very great either.

305
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,760
What do you, I hear in this, this re most recent one's the best one.

306
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Really?

307
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Yeah.

308
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,840
But it's not doing well at the box office.

309
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
Unfortunately it is the new star Trek.

310
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Yeah.

311
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Oh, I want to see it though.

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah.

313
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
I think that's a problem.

314
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
We're not going to see it.

315
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,680
I, and not to get, sorry, not to get too tangent because I know we're a video game show, but

316
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,840
I think this is important is I was reading a very interesting article online about why

317
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,000
isn't the movie star Trek performing better?

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,680
Is it because the last movie wasn't so great?

319
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
Is it because people are sick of the Abrams verse?

320
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,180
Is it because, and I kind of think it's those things as well, but honestly, do you know

321
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,300
what I think is the reason why star Trek is losing at the box office?

322
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,320
There's no star Trek TV series on right now.

323
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,640
Part of it, but there wasn't one with the last two movies either.

324
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,000
And they did a fine.

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,520
I think it's because a stranger things.

326
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,440
I think it's because Netflix is starting to change a lot of this conversation when you

327
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,500
can watch these very high quality things at home.

328
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,680
It's almost like, and this is why I think this is a good topic for significantly cheaper

329
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
too.

330
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Yeah.

331
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,840
It's almost like what killed arcades when you could bring the, you know, gaming experience

332
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
home.

333
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Now, I know a lot of people are going to be like, Rob, you're, you're talking like an

334
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,080
idiot because if movies were going to die because you could bring the experience home

335
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
that was happening back.

336
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,080
I mean, when that, when, when the beta max have killed the movie theater, I just, things

337
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,160
are getting more and higher quality and so forth where I think the things that are being

338
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,680
offered on television, especially specialty services like Netflix and so forth are like

339
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,600
on par with a lot of stuff that we go to the movies and see and for far less money.

340
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,880
And I think that's, that's what I'm talking about.

341
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm not talking about the technology behind it.

342
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm talking about what all is being offered.

343
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,740
Well, here's the problem is a lot of these companies that are making these movies are

344
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:50,240
just throwing just a ridiculous amounts of money towards these franchises, but they're

345
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
bad.

346
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,560
I mean, you could throw all your money, you wanted a bad movie.

347
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
It's still going to be bad.

348
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
Well, I don't know.

349
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,040
I still want to see the movie, but I didn't mean, I didn't mean to get too tangenty, but

350
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,280
I just, you know, I kind of thought that there was, there was a little bit of a relevancy

351
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
there when we talk about arcades.

352
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I saw suicide squad and that was awesome.

353
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Yeah.

354
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Yeah.

355
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
See, and Will Smith wasn't even annoying in it.

356
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
I thought for sure.

357
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,360
Like, you know, when they had the first trailer, was it some sort of super suicide squad?

358
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,680
Like, Oh, come on.

359
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
That's so cringy.

360
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
Actually, it was pretty good.

361
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
It was pretty good.

362
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,460
But yet I, you know, what's funny, you, you have like the opposite view on movies than

363
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,720
most people I talk to because a lot of people I'm hearing suicide squad, not, not a big

364
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,540
fan of it because they're expecting like a ton of joker, you know, footage and stuff.

365
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,240
Like he wasn't in the whole time, but that's all right.

366
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I thought it was fun.

367
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,060
They cut apparently a whole bunch of the scenes, especially the ones that painted his relationship

368
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,280
with Harley is a lot more abusive as what made it into the movie.

369
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,160
If you haven't seen it yet, there's a suicide squad review at voggenetwork.com and you know

370
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,480
at vog, we allow, you know, uh, response reviews and so forth.

371
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Right.

372
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,640
So, um, I'm not going to spoil what our author thought of the review, but you know, he kind

373
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
of felt one way.

374
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,920
And what's interesting is that you don't see this happen with a lot of reviews at vog network.

375
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,120
We have both concurring and dissenting opinions.

376
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,400
So kind of interesting how that's working out.

377
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,680
You know, uh, you know, I like it when not everybody necessarily agrees, we can have

378
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,320
a civil discussion, keyword civil on, uh, the, uh, you know, kind of differences there.

379
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,040
So, um, but then I want to mention in chat over at live.vog.network.com also, um, SHO

380
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
100 map pointing out the cost of going to a theater cost twice as much as a monthly

381
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
payment to Netflix.

382
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Yeah.

383
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,040
Uh, William murder face and chat says, see star Wars seven.

384
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,920
And I think, see, here's the thing, and this is important because I don't think like movies

385
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,600
are going to like die or go away because there's still something to be said about event films.

386
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,920
And a movie like star Wars is still an event film.

387
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,440
And perhaps the reason why star Trek three is not performing as well as the others is

388
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,720
that star Trek is losing that sense of an event film.

389
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,100
And I don't know if that's because there's no TV show because the last movie wasn't so

390
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,320
great and people are tired of the Abrams verse.

391
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,800
I don't know what that is because there's no captain Jean-Luc Picard in there is why,

392
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
but then here's okay.

393
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,020
Dark Sakura, what movie did you see in a theater this week?

394
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,280
Because I thought this was interesting.

395
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Oh yeah.

396
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,320
I saw how it's a movie castle.

397
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,600
And isn't that movie something like 10 years old?

398
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
2004.

399
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Yeah.

400
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,400
So, but yet people, there was a lot of people that went to go pay and see this movie, right?

401
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,360
Cause they made, they made an event out of it.

402
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,640
I hadn't seen it before either and it had been on my list and I just never saw it.

403
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,680
Um, and uh, this, uh, group here in Sacramento that does a lot of the cult movies like Rocky

404
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,880
horn stuff, they just did a screening of the lost boys and hocus pocus, which I haven't

405
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,000
seen hocus pocus either are two amazing films and they, they, I don't know if they sold

406
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,800
out the theater, but they got several hundred people there to see these movies that are

407
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
years and years old.

408
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,120
Well, I love going to the crest anyway.

409
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
It's gorgeous inside there.

410
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
Sometimes it's fun to just so see cult movies with a big crowd of people who yell at the

411
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
script.

412
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,960
I mean, that's part of the, why I did Rocky horror for years.

413
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,680
They actually said, um, uh, please be quiet during the film and don't, you know, call

414
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
out at the screen.

415
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,760
Well, sure, sure.

416
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,520
And if you're just like, well, this ain't Rocky.

417
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Yeah, it depends.

418
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
It depends on what you're seeing.

419
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Right.

420
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
But everyone was really respectful.

421
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Yeah.

422
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,920
So anyway, uh, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, let's see, um, stopping and chats is

423
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,200
so crazy that the critic score on Rotten Tomatoes is like 25% and audience is like 75%.

424
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,040
I think that's about suicide squad.

425
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:31,120
Um, let's see also, um, uh, Sia Tabiri says like before noon, my local AMC has basically

426
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
half price tickets.

427
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm cheap and go to the movies when they have deals.

428
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
Maybe movies are getting too expensive.

429
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I don't know.

430
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,720
Making these other ways to consume media more attractive.

431
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,520
I don't, we need more of the movie grill places.

432
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Yeah.

433
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
They need more of those.

434
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
And they also are starting to add a lot of gimmicks to it.

435
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,840
Like they have the D box stuff, which I've tried it before and it was fun.

436
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Yeah.

437
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,800
We saw Tron in the D one was fun and D box.

438
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,140
It was silly, but finally, but now they've got this thing, like I don't even know what

439
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,920
it is necessarily, but I saw they had it during our little preview thing and it's like, it's

440
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,160
like a three monitors display basically.

441
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
I've heard about it like in front of you and then kind of the side, like for sort of

442
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,820
like a surround ish thing.

443
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,240
And you know what they're trying to do with that?

444
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,520
Something that you can't replicate in the home.

445
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,280
So you have to come to the theater except people have fucking three monitors plays well

446
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
already.

447
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
So, Ooh.

448
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
All right.

449
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Anyway.

450
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
All right.

451
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I need to, I need to shift the conversation back to games.

452
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,920
Although I love this talk about movies and you know, I think, I think anybody who is

453
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,600
a fan of games, of course you consume, I'm sure a lot of you watch Netflix while you

454
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,460
game or, or do other stuff as well.

455
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,460
But I want to get back into video games and specifically the types of stuff that we've

456
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
been playing this week.

457
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,060
Cause I know there's one big game we got to talk about in this segment.

458
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,900
And I think it's the game everybody's talking about, but everybody plays different stuff.

459
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
So let's talk about your gaming week, dark soccer.

460
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
How was your gaming week?

461
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,580
I played Sims four.

462
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,660
I played Pokemon go.

463
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,980
Dan played, um, another Metroid remake too.

464
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Oh yeah.

465
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
How was that?

466
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
He likes it.

467
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
I love the music in it.

468
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,460
I used to turn off, um, whatever I was, uh, my music in Sims just to listen to Dan play

469
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,540
the music and then would watch him for a little bit cause he's playing it on his computer.

470
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,100
Um, it's really great.

471
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Yeah.

472
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,380
They did a really good job with that remake.

473
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,260
I mean, but I super liked the Brinstar music in there cause it's like the super Metroid

474
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
one.

475
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Yeah.

476
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
Only a lot more subdued.

477
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:25,220
So it has like the, the background, uh, uh, like the counter melody in it, but the, the

478
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,640
main tone of it is different.

479
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,980
So it's pretty cool.

480
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
I don't know.

481
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,980
I understand why Nintendo had to, you know, kind of step in and, and you know, for obvious

482
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
reasons, right?

483
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,100
They cease and desisted the whole Metroid thing, but I just wish there's a part of me

484
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,220
that kind of wishes Nintendo would kind of see the demand for this and think about maybe

485
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,900
if there's these people that want to make this, then try to try to work something out.

486
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,140
But they are seeing that there's a demand for Metroid.

487
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,180
That's why Metroid Federation Force, a truly Metroid game is coming out very soon.

488
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,500
I, here's the thing I actually think with that game, I think that was a way to keep

489
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
the trademark.

490
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,540
I think they, they made a Metroid game, like the Silent Hill Plinko and it actually, uh,

491
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,540
you mean Pachinko?

492
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,580
Plinko is a game that Drew Carey moderates on the Price is Right.

493
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Sure.

494
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,500
But Pachinko, it keeps those trademarks alive.

495
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Yes.

496
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,120
But just re-release the virtual console games or something on like a disc or something.

497
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,600
It would be still way better than this garbage, which is available either this week on the

498
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
3DS.

499
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,240
Well, until you've played it, I don't think you can call it garbage, though, have you?

500
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Really?

501
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,280
I need to play it to see that it's garbage.

502
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Here we go.

503
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Here we go.

504
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,480
I mean, I've only seen the trailers and that's convincing enough.

505
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,880
What if it's good?

506
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
Suicide Squad had some pretty crap trailers.

507
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
What are we talking about?

508
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,200
All their trailers were fucking awesome.

509
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
They were pretty fucking awesome, actually.

510
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm sorry.

511
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm not in agreement.

512
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
All right.

513
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
All right.

514
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I got you.

515
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,820
There is like nothing that screams, this is Metroid.

516
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,520
It's just like, hey, this is not the title.

517
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Yeah, exactly.

518
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
The title.

519
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,880
Anyway, back to Dark Soccer and her gaming week, this is AM2R.

520
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
That's it.

521
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Oh, that's it.

522
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Oh, yeah.

523
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,040
I actually have been playing a bunch of Peggle lately.

524
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Okay.

525
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,120
Just because it's quick and easy and I'm actually pretty good at it.

526
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,080
You know what I miss?

527
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,400
PopCap.

528
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I miss PopCap games.

529
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
I mean, I understand.

530
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,440
I think they're putting out stuff.

531
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,560
They do the Plants vs. Zombies shooter or something like that.

532
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I don't know.

533
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Yeah.

534
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,000
I miss PopCap before EA bought them, like when they were making those silly, addictive

535
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
games.

536
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,640
Oh, and I also bought Legion so I can meet my demon hunter.

537
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
World of Warcraft Legion.

538
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah.

539
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Yeah.

540
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Fun.

541
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Because of reasons.

542
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Because...

543
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
I'm tired.

544
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Rob, let's have coffee.

545
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,840
I could make some coffee if you need some coffee.

546
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,480
Wait, I already thought you can't drink coffee.

547
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
That was, that's over.

548
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
I can drink it again.

549
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Well, then...

550
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Well, let's get you coffee.

551
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Rob!

552
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Coffee!

553
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Anyway.

554
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
We need cheesecake delivery.

555
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
All right.

556
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Stop talking about food.

557
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Get back to games.

558
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
All right.

559
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Loki, how was your gaming week?

560
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,200
So my gaming week was pretty much consisting of mobile games because once again, my wife

561
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,920
is still watching Grey's Anatomy.

562
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,240
But I did get a few days to play No Man's Sky, so that's good.

563
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,680
And No Man's Sky is pretty fantastic.

564
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,240
The first planet I ended up on was pretty cold, I guess.

565
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,600
And so I ended up leaving that and ended up on a hot planet.

566
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,780
And then I left that planet to, I thought it was a moon, but I guess maybe it's another

567
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,840
planet that's actually more moderate and has some water and stuff in there.

568
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,000
And it's kind of funny because the planet that I was, this last planet I was on, has

569
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,100
all these really giant dinosaur-looking things that are friendly.

570
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,300
And this little fucking cow-looking thing is fucking aggressive.

571
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,840
Is it a shifty space cow?

572
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
Yes, it is a shifty space cow.

573
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,120
It comes up and it's like rawr!

574
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,860
And then tries to attack me, and I just shoot the laser thing into its head.

575
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
It's all...

576
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,680
It's just silly because it's no threat whatsoever.

577
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,400
It just comes up, bites me, and I shoot it in the face of the laser.

578
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,000
It just falls over.

579
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,360
And I laugh.

580
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Until the sentinels show up and they're like...

581
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
See, we have fucking sentinels.

582
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,880
Did you destroy one of my rocks?

583
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
You're fucking dead.

584
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
We're gonna send a giant robot.

585
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,400
I'm like, dude, I just fucking blew up a rock that's in a cave.

586
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,840
What the fuck do you care?

587
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,920
So, I don't know.

588
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I hate the sentinels.

589
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,720
Those are seriously the worst thing in that game.

590
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
That and the glitch where apparently your hyperdrive thing is all broken if you get

591
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,800
the pre-order thing, which...

592
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm on a different ship now, and I was trying to repair that hyperdrive.

593
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,100
Probably why I can't find the part to do it, so...

594
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
That makes sense.

595
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,380
Are you on PC or PlayStation 4?

596
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,380
PlayStation 4.

597
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
Oh, okay.

598
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,820
I was curious if you were subject to all those issues the PC version's been having.

599
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,140
Yes, I'm subject to that because my PC is shit and wouldn't be able to run that at all.

600
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,300
It would be just like, no, sorry.

601
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,140
Alan's running it on PC.

602
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,820
He actually was watching me play it, and he watched it enough where he's like, fine, I'm

603
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,380
gonna get this.

604
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,480
And he bought it on PC, and honestly, it looks better on PlayStation 4, but I think that's

605
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,760
because he had to turn the settings way down to get the frame rate to work.

606
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Yeah, they're still fixing stuff.

607
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,000
Because obviously, and I know we'll get to it later in some of the stories and so forth,

608
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,880
but obviously the PC version's been having a lot of issues, which is unfortunate, but

609
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,920
kind of makes you go...

610
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,580
With my laptop being as shitty as it was this week, I'm actually thinking about building

611
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,080
a PC now.

612
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,720
But of course, my way, not a normal PC.

613
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,880
It's gonna basically be this portable PC that I'll be using for VR, but it's also gonna

614
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,840
have a custom-built screen slash keyboard thing that's basically like my laptop that's

615
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,880
tethered to it that I'll be able to pull out and use on my lap as a laptop, and then shove

616
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,880
that big hunky thing with a 1080 GTX card in there, and I'll be set.

617
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,000
That's of course if I get this new job and the pay raise that comes with it and all that

618
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
stuff.

619
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,240
In the meantime, I'll just deal with this.

620
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Other stuff I've been playing, mobile games again.

621
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,920
Of course, I've actually been playing more Ingress this week than I have been playing

622
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,240
Pokemon Go.

623
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,040
I have been playing Pokemon Go, I'm getting bored with it, honestly.

624
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,880
It's just...

625
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,720
In my neighborhood and stuff, because I don't really get to go out that far to places.

626
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,800
And even when I do go to different places, it ends up like Roseville, nearby, or wherever.

627
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,520
It's just the same shit over and over.

628
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,960
It's the same fucking Pokemon that are everywhere, and it's just boring.

629
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Especially when I'm playing it and there's Rattata or something that's got a 500 CP or

630
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
something.

631
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,120
I'm like, I know this is gonna be a pain in the ass to catch.

632
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,640
I'm literally walking away from those now, because it's a waste of my time.

633
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,400
So I'm getting a little bored with it, but still playing it, whatever, and then Ingress,

634
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,160
of course I'm playing that just to keep up my streak, which is almost over at the end

635
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,620
of September.

636
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,840
So hopefully that'll be that.

637
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,280
And then still tap my Katamari, because when I haven't been able to have the TV, it's just

638
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,760
been kind of what I've been going to.

639
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,480
And they had another exploit in the game, which is patched out now.

640
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,800
But if you haven't patched yours, because I read about that, and they said, oh yeah,

641
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
we're patching that out.

642
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,180
I'm like, well I'm not fucking upgrading then.

643
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,960
So it's basically, you do the auto-step thing that they have, it's like some love thing,

644
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,280
I don't remember what it's called.

645
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,720
And then you change your language settings, and it stays on.

646
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,600
And you can stack it a bunch of times.

647
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,500
And so basically just let it sit there, and the game will play itself.

648
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,080
Of course I have other ways to do that as well.

649
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,080
But although their new update, they did add some stuff, so I may need to do that, but

650
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,360
right now I'm not.

651
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,760
I still don't know why I'm playing that game either, because there's really no point to

652
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
it.

653
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,480
It's like, I'm playing this, I'm like, why am I still playing this game?

654
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,160
There's no fucking point to this game.

655
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,840
I don't know.

656
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,960
You can say that about almost any game though, to be fair.

657
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Well no ask I even, sometimes I'm like, I don't really know what I'm doing here, I go

658
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,200
to these different planets and it's just kind of like, I don't know, this creature sort

659
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,040
of looks like that last creature I saw.

660
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,840
And the sentinels really ruin it, because it'd be fun to like, here's how I thought

661
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,360
it was supposed to be, I thought it was, oh if you're like a fucking dick to all the wildlife

662
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,040
out there, you're just blowing shit up, then the sentinels come and try to stop you.

663
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,620
Which makes sense.

664
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,420
But like the fact that like, oh you harvested a rock, well we're gonna have to fucking send

665
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,360
like nukes on you now, it's like, that makes no sense.

666
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,740
That they're on every fucking planet in the fucking universe, is a dumb thing that they

667
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,740
added.

668
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,860
Yeah, I understand the need to like gamify it, but I almost wish they'd put in like a

669
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,140
difficulty thing where you could just turn it off, like kind of like in Minecraft, you

670
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,740
have peaceful mode or whatever, you could do that, but then when you're supposedly in

671
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,300
an online universe, I guess everything has to be stabilized, although, how online is

672
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
it really?

673
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm sure we heard about the two people that, you know, tried to run into each other by

674
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,780
being in the same galaxy and nothing, I guess.

675
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:21,020
Well there were server issues, and I think one of them was not connected to the online

676
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,420
server, because if you notice in the screenshots, they were both in the same spot, but it was

677
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,340
different times of day, so it wasn't synced up, and so that's what they even said to their

678
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,700
server issues, and they have new features now that you can scan for players that are

679
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,140
nearby and go meet them, so they're trying to promote that, and you can do that, it's

680
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,380
just, their, you know, the server problems right now are just pretty bad.

681
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,760
Thankfully though, it doesn't rely too much on the online servers, so you can still play

682
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,380
the game without it really being a problem that you can't connect all the time.

683
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,420
So I'm definitely going to be playing a lot more of that.

684
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,340
Yeah, I'm still super into No Man's Sky myself, in fact, are you done with your game of the

685
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
week?

686
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Because I want to talk about No Man's Sky.

687
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,620
Alright, so, obviously, I've been playing No Man's Sky as well, started with a live

688
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,060
stream on Monday, I got the game a day early by some miracle, just by Amazon, didn't

689
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,380
pull any strings or anything, so I got the game a day early, so the first thing I was

690
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,700
like, I'm going to do a live stream, and did like a, you know, I don't know anything about

691
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,980
this game live stream, and I, you know, I've been a little bit critical of No Man's Sky

692
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,260
in the lead up to it being, you know, we've joked, I don't think it was like actual criticism,

693
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,280
but like, kind of like tongue in cheek, like, where's the game, yo?

694
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,900
What's the game in No Man's Sky, y'all keep showing these trailers, but where's the game?

695
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,820
You know, now that I understand, you know, what the game is, yes, I get that it's a journey

696
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:41,260
basically, and you, it's an inventory management sim, well, in a way, in a way, yes, the game

697
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,980
is to live off the land with limited resources, you know, because it is in a lot of games

698
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,220
that you play, like let's say a role playing game like Final Fantasy, it is kind of something

699
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,980
how you could carry around like, you know, 970 items in your magical backpack, you know,

700
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,180
you can craft a hyperdrive, but for some reason, I just can't build more pockets or like a

701
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,340
larger backpack to hold 500 units of ore, but anyway, look, okay, all that stuff aside,

702
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,020
like, I get the progression of being able to expand that and the whole live off the

703
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
land element.

704
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,540
So, you know, I understand that that's part of the challenge.

705
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:22,820
So actually, like, I find No Man's Sky to be that really, like, great blend of zen that

706
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,900
I get from Minecraft, like, digging a tunnel in Minecraft is very zen for me, like, it's

707
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,060
just very, like, relaxing and something I could just kind of do, you know, building

708
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,140
a coaster or whatever, it's just like something silly, time wasting, no point, whatever.

709
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,660
And I kind of, I kind of get that out of No Man's Sky as well.

710
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,700
I think part of what's always not worked for me in Minecraft is that I'm not much of a

711
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,820
builder.

712
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,940
So it's like, I'm building like straightaway tunnels, but I'm not able to build these fancy

713
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,620
houses that people do and these elaborate things, you don't really have to do that in

714
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,260
No Man's Sky, it's just about kind of like the templates.

715
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,780
So I kind of get that mix of, I have a purpose for why I'm hunting for all this stuff, but

716
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,020
I don't, like, have to, like, build or anything like that.

717
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,860
But wouldn't it be cool, though, if you could build, like, settlements or like, you know,

718
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
some sort of place?

719
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,860
Actually, yeah, that would be rad.

720
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,140
I would love to build a settlement that somebody else could explore.

721
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,380
That would be very, very cool.

722
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,460
But I, you know, I don't know, I, right now I'm enjoying the whole fact that, you know,

723
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,540
I jump forward as I'm moving towards the center of the galaxy or the side quests or whatever

724
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,540
you want to call them, excuse me, that pop up, like, I'm moving a little bit more towards

725
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,760
this other path that I was given.

726
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,780
For those that have played the game, you know, the center of the galaxy is the gold path.

727
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,140
I got a blue path that showed up pretty early, so I'm-

728
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
I haven't noticed any paths whatsoever, so-

729
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,580
Yeah, I've been going down this blue path, and I got to the end of the blue path and

730
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:54,300
I liked the building, you're speaking in vague terms, I liked the building that I got to

731
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,260
when I got to the end of that path, that was a very cool moment, but then it was like,

732
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,460
and your reward is another blue path and an item to hold down your inventory that you're

733
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,500
not sure what it's for, so that part was a little bit annoying, but I'm just, I'm liking,

734
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,740
every time I land on a new planet, it's like, oh, what's going to be different about this

735
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
one?

736
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,900
And I understand there's criticisms about, well, a lot of planets are the same, but I

737
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:22,660
don't know, I found a lot of variety in the planets that I've been to that I've been engaged.

738
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,340
I'm still kind of engaged in the end game of trying to get to the center of the universe

739
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,520
and explore what's there, so I'm just, I'm enjoying No Man's Sky, it's just like a relaxing

740
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,140
kind of game that is kind of no pressure, which is also why I understand why people

741
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,780
don't like the sentinels.

742
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,860
I don't mind the sentinels because I think they're easy to pick off and kill and they're

743
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,160
not that big of a deal, for me, I mean, I guess, for whatever reason, I don't get bothered

744
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
by the sentinels.

745
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,320
Whatever bothers me, I kill it, I kill its friend and I move on.

746
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,600
That's what happens to sentinels.

747
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,800
What annoys the shit out of me are the space fights, because then you get the space, again,

748
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,760
I don't mean to spoil, but it's not that far in the game, you will start getting spaceships

749
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,040
that want to come after you and attack you.

750
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,240
And flying around in space and trying to do these dogfights is, the controls are a beast.

751
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,080
So I kind of feel like the number one thing I'd like to see No Man's Sky improve on is

752
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,760
like some of the controls are pretty bad.

753
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,920
Like down to, I don't understand why L2 is what you use to zoom in on a creature, but

754
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,920
to scan the creature, you need to use, I think like R3 or something, because if you hit R2,

755
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,120
which would be the logical second thing to hit, you're going to shoot that creature in

756
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,080
the face and you've just turned a timid creature into an aggressive creature.

757
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,240
And I can't tell you how many times I went to scan a creature and instead of scanning

758
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,180
it, I accidentally shot it in the face.

759
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,540
You can't change what they're assigned to?

760
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,060
You could within the PlayStation 4 architecture, because PlayStation 4 has within the firmware

761
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:06,100
that you can remap any buttons you want, but it's not within the game, if that makes sense.

762
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,900
It wouldn't be just for the game, it would be like everything.

763
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,940
Well you can toggle those on and off with multiple key presses.

764
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,200
I want to get to some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Dungeon

765
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,100
Buster in chat says, I remember getting lost in some caverns and just used my multi-tool

766
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,500
to explode a new exit to the surface.

767
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,540
I'm flying towards the center of the galaxy right now, it's been interesting, I know what

768
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,060
Skye is talking about, I was on that path for a bit before switching, but the building

769
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,120
you find is really neat in his path.

770
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,300
The sentinels can be super peaceful if you don't keep blowing up the landscape like Schwarzenegger

771
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,700
Black Wolf.

772
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,700
I haven't found those little fuckers to be peaceful actually.

773
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,980
Here's the thing, I'll land on a peaceful planet where it says the sentinels are limited

774
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,500
or whatever the word is that lets you know they're not going to really be aggressive,

775
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,260
but then I'll have to go to a building and to get in the building I have to shoot the

776
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,140
door down, which is even going to make the peaceful sentinels pissed off at you, so it's

777
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,980
like okay I'm going to have to do this battle whether I like it or not.

778
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:16,020
But honestly the best way I've found to not be harassed by those sentinels, mine the plutonium

779
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,900
or whatever it is you need, mine the plutonium, then run like a bitch before the sentinel gets

780
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
there.

781
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,200
Just run, run, run, and then they'll scan the thing, but you're gone.

782
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,500
If that doesn't work, run inside a nearby building.

783
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,940
Hopefully you're near a building, because honestly everything you need to do can be

784
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,500
by buildings.

785
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,000
There's always plutoniums near buildings, there's always thamium 9 or whatever that's

786
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,940
called near buildings, or get the thamium 9 in space, it's far easier, hint, there's

787
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,760
always plutonium near buildings and if those things mess with you just run in a building.

788
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,940
That's how I've been doing it.

789
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,360
And use the plutonium to fuel your little booster thing that lets you get in the ship

790
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,920
and fly to the next question mark so you don't have to walk for five minutes.

791
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,240
Unless you want to.

792
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
That's the beauty of it.

793
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Do whatever the hell you want.

794
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
And what's up with the take off fuel?

795
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,920
Oh, you expelled, you know, a quarter of your take off fuel for just taking off one

796
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
time.

797
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
It's like...

798
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
What?

799
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,280
Well, it's easy to replace with plutonium.

800
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,120
It's really easy to replace.

801
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,620
But my assumption is that later on you get some type of enhancement that you could put

802
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,960
on your ship that will lessen the amount of fuel that you use for things like that.

803
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,520
That's an assumption though.

804
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,560
So anyway, DungeonBuster points out that you can mine plutonium underground in peace if

805
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
you really want to.

806
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,000
There's still sentinels down there.

807
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,840
They will come after you.

808
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Even underground.

809
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
He says they won't.

810
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
I wonder how far you're going underground.

811
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,280
I don't recommend going underground because you'll get lost.

812
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
You'll never come up.

813
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Unless you have the appropriate weapon to blow a hole, you know, to get out wherever

814
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
you want.

815
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,360
But if you don't have that weapon, I don't see the advantage of going in caves.

816
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,160
Except that sometimes you find a lot of green chip items.

817
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,180
I don't know what the hell else to call those things in there.

818
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
I don't know.

819
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,120
They're neutral items.

820
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,080
They're not alkali or whatever.

821
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,600
The one planet I was on actually had giant floating gold.

822
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,160
Like it was just, hey, here's some floating rocks of gold.

823
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
All right.

824
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Cool.

825
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
I like this planet.

826
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
It's like flying.

827
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
Like what's that big shiny thing?

828
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Gold.

829
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Okay.

830
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Cool.

831
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Bobby Black Wolf with another tip in chat.

832
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,280
And I didn't know this one over at live.fognetwork.com says, if you land on a landing pad, you don't

833
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,880
use up plutonium to take off.

834
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
I didn't realize that.

835
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Yeah.

836
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
I've tried that.

837
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,320
I looked over to where there's a landing pad, land, and it lands next to the landing pad

838
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
on the ground.

839
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
I'm like.

840
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,080
I think you kind of have to use a bi-chip pass to call it over to the pad.

841
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I don't know.

842
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,600
I don't know how to make that word right.

843
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,440
And Dartitsia says, Rob is right.

844
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
I love that phrase.

845
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,400
I went into a cave to my minerals and I was wandering around for like 10 minutes trying

846
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
to get back to the exit.

847
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Yeah.

848
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Be careful.

849
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Be careful people.

850
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
All right.

851
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Anyway.

852
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
So No Man's Sky.

853
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,620
I like it, but it's not an action packed game.

854
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,500
I think that's the most important thing today is not an action packed game.

855
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,940
And just because everybody's playing in the same universe, don't expect like fricking

856
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,180
30 people running on the planet that you're on.

857
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,460
That's not going to happen.

858
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:15,540
So if you're cool with like a Minecraft ish kind of experience, that's more what No Man's

859
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Sky.

860
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,180
No Man's Sky reminds me more of Minecraft than anything else.

861
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,380
But that's, that's me anyway.

862
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,380
But yet I'm more into No Man's Sky than Minecraft.

863
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
It's weird.

864
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Okay.

865
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,380
Different strokes for different folks.

866
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:35,060
Other games I've been playing this week, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo 3 a little

867
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,060
bit, a lot of Blizzard stuff, but just, that's kind of what I play on PC, Fallout SE 14 still.

868
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,260
Just checking in on that.

869
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,540
Otherwise not a lot of new stuff.

870
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,540
No Man's Sky really took up my week as far as the new games go.

871
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,300
So Mike, hey, how was your gaming week?

872
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,100
What'd you play this week?

873
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Quite a bit actually.

874
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,420
I think about it.

875
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,340
I recently got a 3DS.

876
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:01,000
So of course, I decided to play some Alpha Sapphire.

877
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,540
Check out the new stuff cause I haven't played, you know, I didn't play any of the, oh gosh,

878
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,300
between 4 and whatever the hell else we're on now.

879
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,020
I haven't played those ones.

880
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,660
Stopped after G3 so like seeing the remake, pretty cool.

881
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:21,580
Let's see, I'm playing Overwatch.

882
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,620
Overwatch is fun.

883
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,260
Play a lot of that, mostly.

884
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,860
What characters do you like in Overwatch?

885
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,220
What do you like to play as?

886
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,740
D.Va cause she's amazing.

887
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,740
D.Va's pretty cool.

888
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
D.Va.

889
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,740
Actually, no, I don't really play as D.Va.

890
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,980
I can't really, I haven't played with her since the patch though so I need to try her

891
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
again.

892
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,900
She's fucking fantastic since that patch.

893
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,060
Oh my god.

894
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,380
I hate other people that play D.Va on the other team.

895
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,480
I've figured out that, you know, the, what is it, the rocket boost, the upward rocket

896
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,000
boost and just launch it, then pop your ult and get it to where you can just wipe, yeah,

897
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it's amazing.

898
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,880
I might want to try that cause I love playing Pharah and, you know, she flies and does all

899
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
that stuff too.

900
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,360
Oh, it's so great because I'll do that and then emote and sometimes I miss but whatever.

901
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
It makes me feel good.

902
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,000
You got some haters in chat, Rama says D.Va is trash lol.

903
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,200
She probably, no.

904
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,960
When it comes to Doritos and Mountain Dew maybe, but, yeah, pretty much.

905
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,000
I love, she's a trashy eater.

906
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,680
I love the D.Va memes online.

907
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,400
Oh my god, have you seen the one of Ana giving her those little strawberry candies?

908
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
No.

909
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,040
It's like, frick yes, grandma candy.

910
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,960
It's so good.

911
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
That's great.

912
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
I love it.

913
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:42,560
Yeah, uh, let's see, I also play, um, I've been playing a lot of Zenyatta surprisingly

914
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,120
since the patch too.

915
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,400
He's a lot of fun.

916
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,160
And then my other one is Hanzo.

917
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,480
I'm surprisingly good with him for not being able to aim, like see where you're aiming.

918
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,720
I guess I'm just, I get lucky.

919
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
You're just that good.

920
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Oh, I guess.

921
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,200
No, I straight up am lucky.

922
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,760
It's like, uh, ooh, I didn't mean to fire that.

923
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,520
Oh, he just ran right in front of it.

924
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Cool.

925
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
That works.

926
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:16,400
Outside of Overwatch, still playing Hearthstone, they just released their new adventure.

927
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,200
And One Night in Karazhan is really fun and really frickin' cute.

928
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,440
That trailer was so ridiculous.

929
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I loved it.

930
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
It was so good.

931
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Oh my gosh.

932
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,320
Um, but yeah, it's very Disney-y.

933
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Disney-y.

934
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Yes, Disney-y.

935
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Okay.

936
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,320
The first wing is pretty cool.

937
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,040
It's, yeah, you've got like, it's very Beauty and the Beast and then you've got like the

938
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,760
mirror from Snow White and stuff and it's weird.

939
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,400
But I was like, I don't see how this is Karazhan, but okay.

940
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,480
I love Karazhan.

941
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
I love Karazhan.

942
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I love Karazhan too.

943
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,120
But I mean, it's just, um, Hearthstone is a silly Warcraft.

944
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,880
It's a silly Warcraft universe, but I like it and the cards aren't complete trash, so

945
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
yay.

946
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Cool.

947
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Um, I don't think I was playing anything else this week.

948
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,120
I don't think I had time to play much else.

949
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
All right.

950
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
So, great.

951
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Yeah.

952
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
All right.

953
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,200
Well, before we get into some gaming news, just some quick housekeeping.

954
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,480
We will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be out of town in Atlanta.

955
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,940
For Dragon Con 2016, I'm still awaiting to hear if we're doing anything like appearing

956
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,280
on panels or anything like that.

957
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,280
I'm pretty sure some of our other network shows are probably going to show up on some

958
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,120
of the TV track panels and so forth, so we'll be plugging those over at vognetwork.com.

959
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,840
But we are looking, hopefully, at doing some type of show.

960
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,020
It won't be live, unfortunately, because the bandwidth at the, um, you know, during a huge

961
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,560
convention with thousands of people, bandwidth is not reliable, right?

962
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,680
But we're hoping to maybe tape something in a live-esque type of element and put it on

963
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,000
the feed, possibly the same Sunday that we won't actually be here.

964
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,740
So stay tuned for that because maybe there'll be special programming from Dragon Con in

965
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,740
the place of Bobby and OLR that Sunday.

966
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,980
It's, anyway, what we're looking at right now, potentially.

967
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,340
More details to come in a couple weeks, which I can't believe that Dragon Con's only like

968
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,300
three weeks away, but here we are.

969
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,020
Another year has gone by.

970
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,020
That's really it.

971
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,440
And then just a reminder that, unfortunately, Dark Sakura is going to be on a bit of a hiatus

972
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,140
for a few months, starting actually with that same Labor Day weekend.

973
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,140
That also will be kind of a weekend of transition as OLR is going to go through a few changes

974
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,140
when we come back.

975
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
But I'll be back.

976
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Yeah, you'll be back.

977
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,140
It's not forever.

978
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
That's right.

979
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,260
She's not, you know, going away.

980
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,980
And she will still be a part of the show.

981
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,740
It's not exactly a vacation either.

982
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,320
Yeah, we're just still talking about how we're going to make that work.

983
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,900
So we may move some segments around, do some things a little differently.

984
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,460
So the formula you've been used to over the past few episodes may change a little bit

985
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
in a couple weeks.

986
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,940
But it will still be the same great OLR that you're used to, and you still get to chat

987
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,700
along with us and call in and all that fun stuff.

988
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
So there you go.

989
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,340
All right, let's get into the news and what's been going on in gaming around the world this

990
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
week.

991
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
Starting with Loki.

992
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,300
All right, let's see here.

993
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,140
So this is pretty cool.

994
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,300
Sony is, I mean, we kind of expected that there's got to be an announcement for the

995
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,380
PlayStation Neo at some point soon, because we are getting very close to the release date

996
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,380
to that.

997
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:35,180
So that is going to happen September 7th, according to some, I want to say, they announced

998
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,540
like some sort of meeting that would happen in New York City.

999
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:44,780
And one of the things that is going to be a focus would be the PlayStation Neo, since

1000
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,820
that is something that is coming out around October.

1001
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,260
However, there's something else that, there's a rumor that there may be a new PlayStation

1002
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:59,940
Vita or some sort of handheld system as well that might be announced around the same time.

1003
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,220
So that's interesting.

1004
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,220
And it's right around the corner.

1005
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,740
So I guess we'll have to see what exactly they're talking about.

1006
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,420
But yeah.

1007
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:16,020
I'm sure it's the Neo and all this stuff and, you know, but I'm curious what else.

1008
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,780
I am curious about a new handheld system.

1009
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,540
That'd be kind of interesting.

1010
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,180
I'm wondering what exactly it's going to be.

1011
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,460
There was, I remember where the evidence came from that it was, I wanted to see maybe those

1012
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,380
FCC filings or something to the effect of like, they're going to have like a new radio

1013
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,700
in the Vita or something.

1014
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,540
Maybe the support instead of like, remember how they had the 3G model and they kind of

1015
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,620
quickly got rid of that, but there might be like a 4G LTE model or something.

1016
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:47,060
So I'm wondering if they're going to try another portable system.

1017
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,060
Cross my fingers.

1018
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,060
Hopefully it's better than the last one.

1019
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,820
I mean, I don't know.

1020
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,380
The back touch thing was really stupid.

1021
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,180
I didn't like that.

1022
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,180
Yeah.

1023
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,100
I think there's a lot of people that would like to see Sony take another stab at a handheld,

1024
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,100
but I just don't.

1025
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,780
Well, but then again, we have to remember in Japan, it's still like there's games coming

1026
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
out every week.

1027
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
It's still a thing.

1028
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,980
Maybe there is a reason for Sony to do a new handheld, but I would think here's the other

1029
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,980
thing.

1030
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,580
I would think news like that, like a new handheld at least would hold off till the PlayStation

1031
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,740
experience in December, unless that sucker's coming out for this holiday, which I just,

1032
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
I don't know.

1033
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,620
It just seems so fast for an announcement like that.

1034
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,620
You know what I mean?

1035
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,140
They usually have something that takes a lot more time to build up.

1036
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,220
So I don't know, but I would think if they're going to tease a handheld, it would be at

1037
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,540
the PlayStation experience, which would be a little more dedicated to the fans and not

1038
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,780
this event in New York city.

1039
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,980
So I don't know.

1040
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,460
But they're like talking about like, you know, financials or something or like a plan for

1041
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:50,780
what they're going to be doing for, you know, the PlayStation business line.

1042
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,180
Maybe that's why they're bringing it up, you know, Hey, here's something that's coming.

1043
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,400
It's not necessarily something that's coming right around the corner, but it may be like

1044
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,180
next holiday or something like that.

1045
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,100
Still don't know what the, you know, maybe they're thinking they're going to compete

1046
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:10,860
with whatever this Nintendo system is, which we still don't know really much of anything.

1047
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,500
Well, you're right.

1048
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,060
We don't know much about that, but I hope, hopefully by the time this event rolls around,

1049
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,060
we'll know a little more.

1050
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,140
Although I imagine Nintendo is probably doing their own reveal in that same September timeframe.

1051
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,020
At least that's what the buzz is.

1052
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,720
So we'll see.

1053
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,220
Interesting comment from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1054
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,860
Dobby says, again, you don't want to get overshadowed so early on once an X is revealed.

1055
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,200
People will be talking nothing else, but that I don't know about nothing else, but certainly

1056
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,460
when NX is announced, it's going to dominate the conversation for a little bit.

1057
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
Okay.

1058
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,220
But I think if Sony were to announce a, announce a handheld, it's not like nobody's going to

1059
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,220
pay attention to that.

1060
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:56,540
So here was, here's what led them to thinking that there was going to be another handheld

1061
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,540
maybe.

1062
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,140
So basically there is an FCC wireless chip filing from Sony for a five year Hertz wireless

1063
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:11,860
chip and the hardware, it says, looks like the Vita or something.

1064
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:18,180
So there's a, I don't know what that could be a part of, but interesting.

1065
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,180
We'll see.

1066
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,180
All right.

1067
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,220
Well, let's move on and talk about something kind of related to the Olympics.

1068
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,860
No, video games are not showing up at the Olympics officially, but there is kind of

1069
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,460
this like adjacent thing going on.

1070
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,620
It's the Rio 2016 Olympics eGames showcase.

1071
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,620
So while the Olympics are going on, there's actually going to be an eGames showcase going

1072
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,620
on.

1073
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,740
And I think it's actually streaming on Tuesday, August 16th, and it's starting at 11 AM in

1074
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,740
Brazil.

1075
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,780
So that's going to be really early for folks here on the West coast if you want to see

1076
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,860
some of that, but I'm sure some of the highlights will be all over YouTube and such.

1077
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,680
But in this eGames showcase, they're actually only showing a couple of games.

1078
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,120
They're going to just be doing Super Smash Brothers for Wii U is one of the selections

1079
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
that they're doing.

1080
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,340
And then they're doing Smite, which, you know, that MOBA free to play that's on PC and all

1081
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,340
that.

1082
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,340
That's it.

1083
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,940
There's no, I don't know, League of Legends or Starcraft or, you know, some of those other

1084
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,840
big heroes, the Storm.

1085
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,020
Those other games are not involved.

1086
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,340
It's just those two games.

1087
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,460
But there will be players from around the world that are going to be going to Rio to

1088
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:30,820
take part, including Larry Loehr from the US, Canadian Evo champion ally.

1089
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:36,020
And there's a guy in Mexico, MK Leo, who's really good at Smash that will also be there

1090
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,020
as well.

1091
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,220
So they are going to be doing this.

1092
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,340
By the way, no prize money on the line.

1093
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,860
This is just for bragging rights, national pride, if you will.

1094
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:49,940
So as I, and I would say as the Olympics are, but I thought I heard a story that you actually

1095
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,840
do get a cash prize for medals at the Olympics.

1096
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,260
They just don't ever really talk about that.

1097
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,820
So I guess that will not quite be the same thing, but, you know, still kind of neat to

1098
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:04,820
see that gaming is, even if it's not a part of the Olympics officially, it's still kind

1099
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,520
of being spoke in a similar sense around the same time.

1100
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,700
So it's certainly progress from where we were at four years ago, that's for sure.

1101
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,020
So yeah, look forward to that on Tuesday.

1102
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,540
Meanwhile, Dark Sakura.

1103
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,260
Well there's a game that a lot of people have been looking forward to, which is Final Fantasy

1104
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,380
XV.

1105
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:30,540
And as we know, it did of course start off its life as a different game.

1106
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:35,540
It initially was Final Fantasy versus XIII and became Final Fantasy XV.

1107
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:44,180
Well now after all these changes and everything, it looks like there is a delay for the game.

1108
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:53,220
It's uh, well at least it's going to be on September 30th now is what's on the list,

1109
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:59,100
but there's no word as if it's going to be further delayed, although that's the theory.

1110
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,360
But yeah, it's not going to be as soon as we thought.

1111
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,620
It was, um, hold on let me see something.

1112
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,940
Yeah it looks like on here that there was supposed to be a two month delay after September

1113
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,580
30th, so my apologies I misread the thing.

1114
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:20,020
That September 30th is still the listed date, but the rumor is that there's going to be

1115
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,980
a two month delay after that.

1116
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,260
So sorry.

1117
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,820
But what's interesting about that is that that was supposed to be announced today, because

1118
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:33,140
I think the GameStop stuff was going to allow the switcheroo on Monday.

1119
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,200
Unless they're going to announce it tomorrow morning, which I guess is certainly still

1120
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,420
possible as well.

1121
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,180
But it does seem like there's a lot of, it's kind of one of those where there's smoke there's

1122
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,880
fire sort of things, and it's not like, you know, oh my roommate has a boyfriend that

1123
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,140
works at GameStop that, you know, copied this thing, you know, it's, there seems to be some

1124
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,420
hard evidence that yeah, Final Fantasy 15 is getting delayed.

1125
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,840
What do you guys think if it does get delayed?

1126
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Do you think it's-

1127
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,840
Oh well.

1128
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,220
Yeah, it's honestly like, okay, I'm like, ah damn it, you know, that's the exact my

1129
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,220
reaction.

1130
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,220
Ah damn it.

1131
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,860
If it makes the game better, like especially going back to No Man's Sky PC and all that,

1132
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:18,180
like I cannot sit here and go, man, what the hell are they doing with No Man's Sky?

1133
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:22,300
They shouldn't have released this buggy piece of shit on PC and all that.

1134
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,460
I can't say that.

1135
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,180
And then in the same breath say, how dare they delay No Man's- or how dare they delay

1136
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,660
Final Fantasy 15 for two months, you know?

1137
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,380
I honestly don't care enough about the game to care about it being delayed.

1138
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
What?

1139
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,100
I'm super ready for it.

1140
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,500
I'm excited to play 15.

1141
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,660
I'm not too excited about it.

1142
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:46,380
I wasn't too happy with 13 and 14 I got bored with after a while for being the MMO.

1143
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,020
I'm going to give it a shot, but like the demos haven't been that great.

1144
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,660
Yeah, I wasn't impressed with the demos either.

1145
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,660
I'm excited for it.

1146
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,660
Yeah, I'm with you.

1147
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,660
I'm excited for it.

1148
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,660
Like I preordered it.

1149
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:01,460
I'm just so used to like the turn-based battle system that I really like that and I'm just

1150
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,460
kind of sad that-

1151
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,580
That was a while ago.

1152
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,220
That was several Final Fantasy games ago, so it's like-

1153
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,220
That was 13, okay?

1154
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,940
That was the last fucking Final Fantasy game that was out.

1155
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,820
It was so long ago, the last one.

1156
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,580
It was, because they've had two sequels for it.

1157
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,580
13 wasn't-

1158
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,580
It's basically-

1159
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,580
Really turn-based.

1160
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,580
Sure was.

1161
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,580
The last turn-based-

1162
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,580
No, 10.2.

1163
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,580
It had the whole active time-

1164
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,580
Okay, fine.

1165
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,100
Active time battle system, whatever.

1166
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Same shit.

1167
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
No, no, no, no.

1168
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,100
It's just a different twist on it.

1169
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,100
No, no, no, no.

1170
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,320
Yeah, 10.2 was the same as 13.

1171
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,360
It was the auto-battling and you only did the whole special moves in that thing, remember?

1172
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,240
Right, but this is totally different from that.

1173
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,760
You're basically running around and actually engaging in stuff, which-

1174
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,960
This would worry me if I were Square Enix.

1175
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,540
This whole fact that maybe half of us are hyped and half of us aren't, because it definitely

1176
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,520
seems like they've poured a ton of money into this game and they need it to do well, so

1177
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,520
they need that hype to be there.

1178
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,760
I'm fine with going into it not being that hyped about it, but it's like, for me, I don't

1179
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,760
know.

1180
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,200
The great Final Fantasy games I think of are the ones that are, for me, the easiest to

1181
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,680
pick up the story.

1182
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:20,240
Seven I thought was pretty easy to pick up, even, you know, six, 13 kind of confused me.

1183
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,440
15, I have no fucking clue what the hell's going on.

1184
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,840
The movie trailer looks fucking awesome, though.

1185
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,840
I do want to see that.

1186
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,680
To be fair, 13 wasn't that great, if you ask me.

1187
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,160
I love 13, I'll defend it, but I get it's not for everybody.

1188
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,160
I don't want to have that talk today.

1189
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:41,440
I'm just saying, like, you know, I go back to, like, Lost Odyssey, which I think was

1190
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:48,080
more Final Fantasy game than Final Fantasy was, Final Fantasy 13 was, so I don't know.

1191
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,080
It looked cool?

1192
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,320
But yet, Lost Odyssey didn't sell.

1193
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,320
It's unfortunate.

1194
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
That's too bad.

1195
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,800
If they'd put it on PlayStation 3, it probably would have.

1196
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,200
It's because, you know, it's because people, there's people on both sides out there, there's

1197
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,080
people who complain, ah, another turn-based game.

1198
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,880
No one fights like that.

1199
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,320
You're not just going to, oh, I'm going to wait while you attack me.

1200
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,320
And then those people want this, and then they're going to, there's people that don't

1201
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
want that.

1202
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
I don't know.

1203
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,880
I didn't really care for, I thought it was a hassle.

1204
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:26,000
The new demo, a little bit better, but I still thought it was a little chaotic.

1205
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,400
Like I just, it's hard to keep track of what the hell's going on.

1206
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,080
I'd rather just have it.

1207
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,080
It's fine.

1208
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,080
You don't need an active time battle system.

1209
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,080
That's, that's cool.

1210
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,840
But just like the same presentation is fine because that's what made it a Final Fantasy

1211
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,640
game.

1212
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,920
William Murderface in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn is

1213
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,440
a pretty good story so far.

1214
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,600
Everyone seems to forget about that part, but it's an important one that is well done

1215
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
in my opinion.

1216
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,480
I actually like agree with that.

1217
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,160
And Heaven's Word, the expansion is even better.

1218
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,160
It's so like, I think the Heaven's Word story is like the best story in the Final Fantasy

1219
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,680
universe since like six.

1220
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,680
It's that good.

1221
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,520
And unfortunately most people will never see it because it's an MMO.

1222
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,640
It's an MMO, which puts people off.

1223
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,320
It's end game, which puts people off.

1224
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,960
It's it's, but just the reality is it's a magnificent story.

1225
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,040
If you can get there.

1226
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,440
The problem with Final Fantasy 14 is that there is no way to level without doing some

1227
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,600
of those instances.

1228
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,200
And it's horrible because I made it all the way through to when I got to 85 in World of

1229
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:36,800
Warcraft, I hadn't done a single instance, a single one, and I didn't craft either.

1230
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,560
And you shouldn't have to have to do those if you don't want to.

1231
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,720
But they were some really fucking cool fights.

1232
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,600
But I don't care.

1233
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Really cool fights.

1234
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
I don't care.

1235
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,680
That's what I was into.

1236
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,440
The whole point is that it should have something for everybody and you shouldn't be forced

1237
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,720
to play a game the way they think you should play it.

1238
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,720
Yeah.

1239
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,720
Yeah, you're right.

1240
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,000
Comparing it to WoW in that in that regard, you're right.

1241
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,600
I did the same exact thing in Warcraft.

1242
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:10,080
Like I made it up to, no, well, at the time it was, I think the cap was 90.

1243
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,600
Yeah, I made it all the way up to 90 without doing any instances and stuff.

1244
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,880
It's so funny because I have been playing World of Warcraft.

1245
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,200
I'm doing nothing but instances because I'm like, questing is too slow.

1246
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,920
The questing has actually been super fast and I'm playing through now Sakurina when

1247
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,240
I left at like 86 when I left.

1248
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:35,520
And the leveling is actually much faster now for the the Pandaria content.

1249
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,880
So it's been pretty fun.

1250
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:45,480
I'm actually looking forward to doing a Horde side for the other, for whatever.

1251
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
Draenor?

1252
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,600
Yeah, but I was trying to think of dude's name, the asshole, former war chief.

1253
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
Garrosh?

1254
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah, because I just like seeing him die.

1255
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,160
I really just like seeing him fail.

1256
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,640
It's awesome because I hated him.

1257
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
All right.

1258
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,000
Well, let's move on to some other stuff.

1259
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,480
Back to rumors about upcoming consoles, right, Logi?

1260
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,840
Of course, we do love our rumors and love our leaks about said rumors.

1261
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,040
So Nintendo, of course, you know, they have their wonderful NX coming out.

1262
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,200
We still don't know what the fuck it is.

1263
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,760
But there's all sorts of rumors regarding, you know, maybe it's this controller that,

1264
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,200
you know, attaches to some sort of tablet thing.

1265
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,360
And then now there's this new trademark filing that they have or copyright filing or patent

1266
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,160
filing, I should say, for a clip on controller.

1267
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,440
And the device almost looks like what they were describing with those NX rumors.

1268
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,960
So basically, it looks like some sort of controller that in this case, it looks like the left

1269
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,800
or right half of like a SNES controller.

1270
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:58,640
So they show four buttons and there's like a, I don't know if it's like a metal pad or

1271
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:04,760
something that connects to maybe magnetically and it allows it to, you know, send data electricity

1272
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,560
or whatever to the actual attachment.

1273
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:13,280
Neat, I guess, but I don't know.

1274
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,000
I don't know why, but it sounds like wireless charging to me or something is what that kind

1275
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,400
of reminds me of.

1276
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,840
I mean, sort of like I'm surprised like something like this can be patented because, I mean,

1277
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,600
it's just it's basically just like having some sort of thing.

1278
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,320
I don't know, some add-on controller or something, which I know a lot of devices have.

1279
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,800
They have it for mobile where you can pass through, you know, stuff through their charge

1280
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,800
board.

1281
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
I don't know.

1282
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,960
I guess we'll have to see what it is and see what exactly this gimmick the NX is.

1283
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,600
But it would be more fuel for those rumors, I guess.

1284
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,280
It would be nice for Nintendo to say something already.

1285
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,960
I understand that why they're not.

1286
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,880
But it's just like, God, I'm so sick of rumors.

1287
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,080
Every time I hear a new one, I'm like, this sounds like just so like.

1288
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:05,880
I'm worried about it, and the reason I'm worried about Nintendo is I think that some of their

1289
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,800
like big like, OK, we're really going to like disrupt everything by the motion controls

1290
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,800
and that that worked out well for them, then they're like, oh, we're going to disrupt everything

1291
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:19,920
by having the second screen tablet thing that didn't work out so well.

1292
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,200
And I'm worried that like this is going to be something that's just going to be kind

1293
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,880
of here's this really cool gimmick we thought of and no one gives a shit.

1294
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,960
Interesting comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying

1295
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,840
rumors killed No Man's Sky and Shadow Next Gen follows that up with unchecked expectations.

1296
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,840
Yeah.

1297
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:46,360
Is that, you know, a lot of people, because there was so such vagueness about No Man's

1298
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,520
Sky, a lot of people kind of filled in the blanks with their headcanon.

1299
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,440
And then when that wasn't met, it's a disappointment.

1300
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,920
And people, I think what you're getting at is that people are doing the same thing with

1301
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
the NX.

1302
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,600
Is that because, you know, we think it's going to be this.

1303
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,960
And then when Nintendo announces, well, it's it's it's not as grand as you thought it was.

1304
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:09,560
I just you know what this screams to me like, remember the Wii and all the fucking attachments

1305
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,560
that attached to the Wii and how much of a fucking nightmare that was.

1306
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,560
This is kind of what it was.

1307
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,560
So cool.

1308
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,560
I'm kidding.

1309
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:23,040
This is like, you know, kind of in that they didn't have like they had a lot of weird plastic

1310
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,040
shit that was unnecessary.

1311
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,000
So I'm not really talking about that.

1312
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,560
I'm talking about like, you know, they had the classic controller, they had the nunchuck

1313
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
thing.

1314
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,280
They had maybe those were the only two things that they had, but they had some other stuff

1315
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,360
that I thought connected to it as well.

1316
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,080
They I know definitely in planning had a lot more things, but it just kind of seems like

1317
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,080
that.

1318
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,320
Like, is this what's going to do like, oh, hey, we need some more buttons here.

1319
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:50,360
We're just going to release this game with another button half controller thing or something

1320
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,120
that we're going to attach here.

1321
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,880
You can customize where your controls are or something.

1322
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,880
I mean, I don't know what this is.

1323
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,880
Well, let's see.

1324
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,960
We're all speculating about this until I see what exactly this is.

1325
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,880
I just don't really care too much right now.

1326
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
That's it.

1327
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,200
I mean, I need to see what exactly this thing's putting out, because if it's just basically

1328
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,760
a Wii U without being tethered to a console, I mean, that's cool, but I'm not super excited

1329
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,760
for it.

1330
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,440
I may pick it up because that's a neat idea, but it's not like, shit, I need to have one

1331
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
of these right away.

1332
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,480
I just think it's going to be shadowed by cooler things that are going to come out,

1333
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,040
especially more VR stuff.

1334
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,800
I mean, we're talking like six months time.

1335
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,560
I mean, VR technology is getting better and better each day.

1336
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,560
I will say this.

1337
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:45,200
We've played our Wii U more than anything in our house as far as the newer systems.

1338
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,240
So I'm really looking forward to the NX.

1339
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,600
If it gives me more of all the stuff that I like for the Wii U, I'm happy.

1340
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,560
Yeah, I'm excited for NX.

1341
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,800
I just kind of, it's like, I don't know what to get excited for.

1342
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,800
So I'm making it up.

1343
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,760
And I don't give a shit about VR, so.

1344
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,760
I have to admit.

1345
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,120
I'm starting to wonder if I might cancel the PlayStation VR pre-order, but that is, I still

1346
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,240
like VR.

1347
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,440
This has more to do with, I'm really worried about this whole fact that they're putting

1348
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,200
out the Neo.

1349
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,320
And does that mean that VR doesn't work as well on the old system?

1350
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,320
That's more my problem.

1351
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
That's exactly it.

1352
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,600
And if they didn't talk about the Neo or anything, you know, if this was something that's coming

1353
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,400
out next year, then I might not be so worried about it.

1354
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,560
But it's like, you just met, you know, you mentioned that VR is going to be better on

1355
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,960
it somehow.

1356
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,960
How exactly?

1357
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,160
Because that kind of stuff worries me, and I'm kind of with you on that.

1358
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:43,040
Like if I get a PC built before then that runs, you know, the Rift or the Vive, and

1359
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,960
it's definitely going to go with the Vive, then fuck that, I'm canceling that shit.

1360
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,120
Because a lot of those things that they're showing off, don't get me wrong, Rez looks

1361
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:55,400
awesome, but like everything else is a really short experience.

1362
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,920
And I want like a full-fledged game with it.

1363
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,680
I don't want this like, cool, I did a mission.

1364
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
We're done.

1365
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,280
You know, or cool, I looked around a room.

1366
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,280
I don't care.

1367
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,280
I've done that.

1368
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,280
I've done that already.

1369
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,720
I want something that's a full experience.

1370
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,640
All right, well, I want to move on.

1371
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,120
Actually, did you talk about this other thing?

1372
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,120
Oh, I was going to say, yeah.

1373
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:21,160
And also, one of the things, good things though about the NX is Dragon Quest X has been confirmed

1374
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,520
to be coming to the NX.

1375
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,680
So that's cool.

1376
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,760
So they're going to get an MMO.

1377
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,600
And an anticipated one that we've needed for a long time, to be quite honest.

1378
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,600
Yep.

1379
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,440
And apparently it is also coming out for PlayStation 4.

1380
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,320
I'm not sure if that's going to be confirmed.

1381
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,580
It's not necessarily confirmed to be coming over here.

1382
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,120
And that could be the same with the NX.

1383
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,520
It may be in Japan though.

1384
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:53,800
Well, anyhow, I want to move on to another story about a comment from Bethesda about

1385
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,640
the Nintendo NX that a lot of people are going, hmm.

1386
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,240
And in this interview with an Australian news publication, Finder, excuse me, they were

1387
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,080
talking to Pete Hines, who's the vice president of Bethesda Softworks, and they're asking

1388
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,520
about the Nintendo NX.

1389
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,160
And Pete Hines said, yeah, they know what Nintendo is doing with NX.

1390
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,160
They've been briefed on the situation, but they're not really committing to the platform

1391
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,760
saying this, we talk to Nintendo all the time.

1392
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,560
We're pretty well briefed in on what they're doing.

1393
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,000
It's definitely something we will look at.

1394
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,320
And our philosophy is that we will put our games out on any format that supports the

1395
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,440
games as we envision and make them.

1396
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,660
If the NX fits that from a technical standpoint, and it fits the game that a developer in our

1397
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,020
stable is making, I don't see why we would not put it out on NX.

1398
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,580
But it's too early to say we'll definitely be putting games out or not.

1399
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,520
Like with mobile, we want to have the right fit for the right formats.

1400
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,280
You know, he could be dancing the line a little bit and just not wanting to show his cards

1401
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,600
if they do have something to announce.

1402
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,160
I mean, there's a million ways you could read this.

1403
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:54,420
But I definitely just pick up this sense of the NX might not be as technically superior

1404
01:06:54,420 --> 01:07:00,180
as what's going on with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which we kind of knew is a potential,

1405
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,180
right?

1406
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:06,860
And, you know, Bethesda tends to make pretty intense games that really push things graphically,

1407
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:07,860
right?

1408
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,580
Like your Skyrim at that time, your Doom at this time, you know, and you kind of wonder,

1409
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,220
like, would these games really run on Nintendo NX?

1410
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:19,340
You know, it's probably going to be challenged.

1411
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,340
And so I get it from that regard.

1412
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,780
But let's not forget Bethesda also has that card game for Elder Scrolls.

1413
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,580
The Fallout Shelter is a pretty big thing.

1414
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,500
These are things that probably would work on NX.

1415
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
Right.

1416
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,820
Though I'm not saying put those games on NX, but those future developments in that same

1417
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,820
way.

1418
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,820
Once again, that worries me.

1419
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:44,020
I mean, like, I understand that, that like on the 3DS, their first party titles do well

1420
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:47,760
and they've got a good library of games on the 3DS.

1421
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,980
That's fine.

1422
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,900
The Wii U, they have great first party titles.

1423
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,860
No one's arguing that their first party titles aren't great.

1424
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:54,940
It's the third party titles.

1425
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,900
And when you have that hardware that can't run these engines that run these modern games,

1426
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,700
like all the fucking shit that's coming from EA is in Frostbite.

1427
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,860
That shit does not run on the Wii U.

1428
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:09,620
And if it doesn't run on the NX, we're just looking at the same fucking scenario again.

1429
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,620
And that's fine.

1430
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,620
I know people are like, oh, well, fuck it.

1431
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,580
I don't need EA games.

1432
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:18,600
But you're getting, as stuff goes along, they're pushing better graphics and more stuff on

1433
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,440
screen and they're going to have more sophisticated engines.

1434
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,440
That shit is not going to run on these, the system, if it's that underpowered and they're

1435
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,920
going to have a problem because yeah, great.

1436
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,880
First party tells me help that system.

1437
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,240
But if that's all they got, we're going to be in a scenario right now where look at the

1438
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,320
release schedule for the Wii U.

1439
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:42,380
I mean, it's just every couple months or something coming out for it.

1440
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,380
And that's it.

1441
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,740
There's like nothing in between.

1442
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,560
It's just deserted.

1443
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,000
It's just, I don't know.

1444
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,320
I'm just worried about it.

1445
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:56,000
I really do think though NX was pushed back from this year so that that's not going to

1446
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,200
happen in Nintendo's first year.

1447
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,200
I really think that's what they're doing.

1448
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
I hope that's the case.

1449
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,200
I really do.

1450
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,040
Because when I hear that they're thinking about VR and thinking about this, it makes

1451
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,360
me wonder that they don't have a fucking idea of what this thing is going to be.

1452
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,200
They're just still up in the air about it.

1453
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,040
And I don't know.

1454
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,440
I'm just very worried about what they have to say about this.

1455
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,760
I'm not having high expectations for it.

1456
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,760
All right.

1457
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,240
Well, also in that same interview, I just want to mention with Bethesda, this is on

1458
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,260
a different note, has nothing to do with Nintendo NX or does it?

1459
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:31,120
Apparently the comment was that the evil within did make enough money to justify a sequel.

1460
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,440
That actually surprised me to hear that.

1461
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,480
I didn't think that game did so hot, but apparently it did.

1462
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:41,680
So the evil within may be getting a signal, a sequel and rage also performs well enough

1463
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,000
to justify a sequel.

1464
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,640
So now again, they're not confirming or denying anything, not saying what is happening for

1465
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,600
sure or when, but don't take it off the table essentially.

1466
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:59,040
But we'll have to wait for a future E3 or some other type of event to find the confirmation

1467
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,360
in those.

1468
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,760
So we'll see.

1469
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,160
All right.

1470
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,160
Let's move on.

1471
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,680
Next story, Dark Saga, before we get to release dates.

1472
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:13,400
Well in the wake of the Metroid 2 fan remake, there was another one that was called Pokemon

1473
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,840
Uranium and Nintendo's put down the C and D on that one.

1474
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,640
It was done by a nonprofit, it was put out on PC for free and 1.5 million people downloaded

1475
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,640
it.

1476
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,420
It had been in development for over nine years and had 150 custom Pokemon and a type called

1477
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,420
nuclear.

1478
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:36,460
So Nintendo's like, uh-uh, no, stop.

1479
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:43,820
So I'm sure you can still find it in places, but yeah, they finally put out a note on there

1480
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,260
and it said they took it down.

1481
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:54,220
You can still talk about it, still share content about the game, but we aren't going to make

1482
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,780
it available on the site anymore.

1483
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,820
I think no one's surprised.

1484
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,820
They put it up.

1485
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,820
They know it's going to get taken down.

1486
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,660
They know that someone's going to grab it and once it's on the internet, it's always

1487
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,660
on the internet.

1488
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:08,980
So I think it's naive to believe that any of these people that are developing these

1489
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:13,980
fan games about Nintendo properties are surprised that they're getting a C and D from Nintendo

1490
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,860
regarding that.

1491
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,100
I think that's just part of the plan.

1492
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,420
That get it up, get people to download it and just wait for the C and D, take it down,

1493
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,520
but it's too late.

1494
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,260
It's already there and that's it.

1495
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,780
Yeah.

1496
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,300
I mean, they, they have to know that these things are going to get C and D'd and you

1497
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,580
know, I'm curious how that game is though.

1498
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,460
I heard that one was not so good.

1499
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,620
What, the Pokemon Uranium?

1500
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,700
Their Uranium one is not so good.

1501
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,660
There's another, there's not even Pokemon Uranium.

1502
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,220
There's some like MMO Pokemon thing that I see on Twitch all the time that certainly

1503
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,580
can't be permissible either, but it's still floating around out there.

1504
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,340
I don't know if that's something that was released a long time ago that was pulled,

1505
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,340
but yeah, things have a way of getting on the internet and then never getting off.

1506
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:01,180
And you know, again, don't, don't share the link here as Bobby saying in our chat room

1507
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,860
because you know, we don't want the C's and D's but seriously, it's not that hard

1508
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:10,980
to go out there onto a torrent site of your choosing and find it.

1509
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,980
Or other forums.

1510
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,660
I'm sure they've got a fan game set at one time I found one that was for like Mario games

1511
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,660
and stuff like that.

1512
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:20,540
So I know that those exists and you can probably find a link on there for it.

1513
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,540
That was it.

1514
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,040
Thank you Act F. Pokemon Omicron is the one I was thinking of that MMO one that I see

1515
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,880
on Twitch sometimes.

1516
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,720
So by the way, did you know, um, no, I know we talked last week about the AM2R and all

1517
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,720
that.

1518
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,320
Did you know also the Nintendo power archive got pulled?

1519
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,720
Yeah, I saw that.

1520
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Yeah.

1521
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:44,040
That's like, again, it's like these magazines are how old it's like in a way I'm like,

1522
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:48,340
would you go to a library and take them out of the library and like, okay, I get that

1523
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:54,000
an online resource is not the same thing as a library, but you know, times are changing

1524
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,920
and for people to look at, you know, I really got a kick out of looking at some of the games

1525
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,080
the way gaming used to be.

1526
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,080
Yeah.

1527
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
I don't get it.

1528
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,800
If they're not selling back, are they selling reprints of those?

1529
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Can you even purchase those?

1530
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
I don't think so.

1531
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,800
I really don't.

1532
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,800
What is the point?

1533
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
Yeah, it's just, it's just unfortunate, you know.

1534
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,680
It's just lawyers going crazy to protect their IPs or probably.

1535
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,600
And at the same time, I can't say, well, it's completely unjustified.

1536
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,520
Nintendo has no right to do that.

1537
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,520
They own it.

1538
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,520
They of course have the right.

1539
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
Yeah, exactly.

1540
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,360
I have to realize that that is true as well, but there's that part of me that goes, but

1541
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,360
do they have to?

1542
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:32,000
But then again, once again, it is on the internet and therefore since it's on the internet,

1543
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
it's always on the internet.

1544
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,840
So it's probably somewhere out there.

1545
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,680
Well, but not at the source because there was that retro mags or whatever that was the

1546
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,600
source and it's no longer there.

1547
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,280
So, but after a discussion about this on our last week show, I did actually start looking

1548
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,200
for, and I did find like old scans because I just, you know, use my Google.

1549
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,720
I went and I found like, you know, Compute Skazette and all that stuff.

1550
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,680
And I was reading like old type in programs and stuff.

1551
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,680
And I was like, Oh my God.

1552
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,600
And I never realized like how intensely those magazines talked about programming.

1553
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,920
I don't remember that from a kid, but it was kind of like, again, it's fun to read this

1554
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,000
stuff that I remember one way as a kid and then read it now with my 38 year old brain

1555
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,440
as opposed to my five year old brain.

1556
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
And like, I'm just totally seeing it a different way.

1557
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,440
It's crazy.

1558
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:19,680
So, so on a completely different tangent since you mentioned your 38 old brain.

1559
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,320
So my wife, because she's watching Grey's Anatomy, mentioned to me that she's like,

1560
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,280
you do realize on the show that all these people are supposed to be like younger than

1561
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,280
we are right now.

1562
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,280
I'm like, what?

1563
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,480
She's like, yeah, even that guy right there with the gray hair.

1564
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,480
Yeah.

1565
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,440
He's supposed to be like in his like, like early thirties or something.

1566
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,440
And I'm just like, no fucking way.

1567
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,440
I just thought that was funny.

1568
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,440
No, yeah.

1569
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,440
I love seeing people.

1570
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,880
I love seeing very incredibly successful, talented people on television who are like

1571
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,240
15 years younger than me.

1572
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,240
Oh, I love that.

1573
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,240
Loki.

1574
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,240
I love it.

1575
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:57,320
They're like, they're like, I'm like, I thought he was like in his fifties or something like,

1576
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,320
I don't know.

1577
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,320
He's in his thirties.

1578
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,160
All these, all these people that have their shit together that I'm like, wow.

1579
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,160
And I was that age.

1580
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:10,560
I was a dumb ass bastards totally blew the realism.

1581
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,900
All right.

1582
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:15,400
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some things that are coming

1583
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,640
out that Nintendo can't pull starting in the U S Loki or something.

1584
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,640
Yeah.

1585
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,960
So this week we've got absolute drift Zen edition.

I'm going to preorder that today.

Just despite Loki.

1601
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:30,740
I okay.

1602
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,740
That's your game.

1603
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,860
If you want to, if you want to buy crap, that's fine.

1604
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,380
You're eating this weird chips.

1605
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,940
So I know that you're delicious for the chips.

1606
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:46,100
Do not come for the chips just because you don't like Brazilian or Brazilian steak or,

1607
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,100
or whatever.

1608
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,660
The Brazilian steak is really good.

1609
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,540
It's very flavorful and not horrible.

1610
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,540
Come for the chips.

1611
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,540
Loki.

1612
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,540
Oh, it's weird.

1613
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,540
Cut somebody.

1614
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,540
Yeah.

1615
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:59,640
Listen, weirdly.

1616
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,360
That is, that is you spitefully chewing down on the chip.

1617
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,360
All right.

1618
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,360
All right.

1619
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,360
Okay.

1620
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,360
Seriously though, don't chew in the mic.

1621
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
That's gross.

1622
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,360
All right.

1623
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,980
Going, going to the PlayStation three over in Japan, uh, tales of Biseria, uh, also being

1624
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,320
released there in a regular and a Famitsu deluxe pack.

1625
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:23,140
Cause we know they love the deluxe packs over there in Japan, uh, PlayStation four also

1626
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,560
getting that same release of tales of Syria.

1627
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,080
So look forward to that, uh, on the Wii U this week, some tumbleweed is rolling by

1628
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,400
because there's nothing coming out on the Wii U in Japan.

1629
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,640
But if we go to the Vita, we have collar cross malice and regular and limited edition.

1630
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,600
Uh, that is out this week on the 18th.

1631
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,640
And then lastly, looking at the Nintendo three DS this week, uh, we don't have anything in

1632
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,640
Japan.

1633
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,400
In fact, they get Metroid prime a week after we do so.

1634
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,400
Oh, sorry.

1635
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
They're calling.

1636
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,880
Was it Metroid prime Federation force over there?

1637
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,880
I don't.

1638
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,880
Okay.

1639
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
That game is not.

1640
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,880
I already closed the window.

1641
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,080
That game is not out of Japan for another week.

1642
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,960
So lucky them.

1643
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,120
Well, they have a chance to see how we react and make a decision from there.

1644
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:07,500
But you know, Metroid was always a bigger game here than it was in Japan.

1645
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,880
So I mean, it does make sense in that regard.

1646
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:14,560
Although yes, Loki, I understand this is not the Metroid experience that everybody's waiting

1647
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,560
for.

1648
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,560
All right.

1649
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,560
Uh, dark soccer.

1650
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,560
How about the UK?

1651
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,080
What will we find on the shelves in the UK this week?

1652
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Not a damn thing.

1653
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,080
Nothing.

1654
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,080
It's new.

1655
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,080
All right.

1656
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,080
Nope.

1657
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,360
A chance to revisit games that you need to catch up on.

1658
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,240
Time to drink tea and read a book.

1659
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,920
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio at vognetwork.com,

1660
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,320
use the pass phrase, note.

1661
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,320
All right.

1662
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,240
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

1663
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,880
And then the classic game of the week, Loki.

1664
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,920
All right.

1665
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:54,240
So Hello Games is currently testing some patch for the PC version because as you may know,

1666
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,780
the PC version, kind of a fucking mess right now of No Man's Sky.

1667
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:02,240
So it's supposed to improve support for AMD CPUs.

1668
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,820
It fixes some frame rate stuttering.

1669
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:12,320
And the setting, the max frames per second to 30 or 60 is not working.

1670
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,960
So you can, that'll be working as well.

1671
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,000
House stuttering and crashes when you're alt tabbing out of the game.

1672
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,440
Also they're saying that apparently they're going to fix some other issues if caused by

1673
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,440
G-Sync and stuff.

1674
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:34,160
So, all right, cool.

1675
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:38,320
So you can, what, you can like beta test this patch now or something, right?

1676
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,320
Yeah.

1677
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,320
The real one's not out yet.

1678
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,320
Right.

1679
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,240
So you can go to your Steam library and then if you go to the properties on the game, you

1680
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:50,840
can get into, select the betas tab and you can, if you type in the codes experimental

1681
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:56,740
with a three instead of an E in the beginning, then you can download it early.

1682
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,640
Apparently it's been working pretty well.

1683
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:03,400
You know, they've gotten the game to work at 60 frames per second at 1440p.

1684
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,400
So my bad.

1685
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,400
All right.

1686
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:11,560
Well, I'm going to ask Alan to install that later so I can see what that looks like on

1687
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:16,320
his PC because I, I wonder if it'll improve the graphic quality for him.

1688
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,320
So I mean, it doesn't look terrible.

1689
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,960
It's just, it doesn't look the same that it looks on PlayStation four.

1690
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,520
I wish that framer is higher, but I mean, you're simulating that many plants.

1691
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,920
I'm kind of okay with that.

1692
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,920
Gotcha.

1693
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,040
Well, before we get to the classic game of the week, a interesting update on what's going

1694
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:35,920
on with league of legends and a riot games is actually suing a league of legends cheating

1695
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,600
service called league sharp, which I guess charges between, and again, I'm not as up

1696
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:47,240
and up on league of legends because, um, I'm just not great on it, but, uh, uh, league

1697
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:53,920
sharp is charging between 15 and $50 a month for hacks and bots, uh, that I guess we'll

1698
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,720
edit the game or what have you.

1699
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:02,280
Um, so, uh, league sharp will allow you to see hidden information, automate gameplay

1700
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,680
to perform with enhanced or in human accuracy and accumulate levels, experience and items

1701
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,640
at a rate that is not possible for a normal human player.

1702
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,960
That is all according to the lawsuit.

1703
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,400
That's the lawsuits words.

1704
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:17,420
Um, they had originally tried to contact the site owners directly riot did, uh, but that

1705
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,420
didn't work.

1706
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,960
So they called the lawyers and got them involved.

1707
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,520
So riot wants to put a stop to that enterprise that's charging the money to basically cheat

1708
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,760
in the game.

1709
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,760
And we'll see what happens.

1710
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,280
The defendants have 21 days to respond.

1711
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,880
It'll be very interesting to see what develops with that.

1712
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:38,800
All right, let's travel to a time when things, things were a little more simpler than this.

1713
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,000
You couldn't, you could just cheat in games.

1714
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah, you could.

1715
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Well, you could.

1716
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
You had a game genie.

1717
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,360
You didn't have to pay somebody $15 a month to do it for you.

1718
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,880
You paid 60 bucks for a little device and found codes that would come in the little

1719
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,880
book.

1720
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,880
I fair enough.

1721
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,280
It's a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the week.

1722
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,280
Huh?

1723
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,920
There it is.

1724
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,000
There's the music.

1725
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,920
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

1726
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
you should play this game.

1727
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,120
It is over 10 years old, believe it or not.

1728
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,840
And therefore it's a classic.

1729
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,080
It's Barbies for Grown Straight Men.

1730
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,080
I'm sorry, Dead or Alive Xtreme beat volleyball.

1731
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:20,120
So this game is awful.

1732
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,000
And Dan played so much of it.

1733
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,600
So I basically picked this game to give him shit.

1734
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:36,860
Basically it's a volleyball game with the Dead or Alive ladies in bikinis and all kinds

1735
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:39,400
of outfits.

1736
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:46,820
And you have one guy in the entire theme and it's Zach, the human Teletubby.

1737
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:56,420
So anyway, no fighting, just volleyball and bikinis and sunshine and shopping.

1738
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:01,980
You basically just dress them up and take pictures and watch them walk around.

1739
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:07,140
And you have, they build relationships with each other and sometimes they do dances and

1740
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:15,580
then you play volleyball, but it really is just Barbie for, for grown men, really.

1741
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,200
It's just completely crazy.

1742
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:24,260
So anyway, as you go through the game, you can get gifts and date and sorry, influence

1743
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:31,780
other characters cause dating sim, you know, and then you earn Zach bucks, which you use

1744
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:40,420
on, you know, each character as you go through the game to buy new outfits with varying degrees

1745
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,100
of modesty attached to them.

1746
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:51,660
So the characters in the first game were Ayane, Kristy, Helena, Hitomi, Kasumi, Leifang, Lisa,

1747
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,020
and Tina.

1748
01:23:54,020 --> 01:24:00,540
And now we're like, what, on the fourth one of the series, fifth one of the series.

1749
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:06,140
And there was a big, big bit of drama about this, but the soundtrack for the game actually

1750
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,540
was pretty decent.

1751
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:18,540
It had some Bob Marley, it had some Christina, had real big fish and some other people that

1752
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:24,620
I'd never heard of, um, but people liked it.

1753
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,860
It was okay.

1754
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:30,520
And then, Oh, and there was, um, a kind of a bit of a controversy over an April fool's

1755
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:37,700
day joke is that EGM back in the day did, um, a nude code for the game that said you

1756
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,020
could play with them topless in nude mode.

1757
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:45,620
And then it was a hoax and they got a bunch of pissed off people because apparently I

1758
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:47,300
was promised some titty.

1759
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:52,020
I was promised some anime titty and you robbed me of my titty.

1760
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,020
And you know what that meant?

1761
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:58,860
That meant of course, um, you know, enterprising people because the X-Box was very exploitable

1762
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,860
then made it a reality.

1763
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:00,860
God, this game looks awful.

1764
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,300
I'm going to hack my titties.

1765
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,300
Yeah.

1766
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:09,340
This was, um, uh, some different hobbyist, uh, hobbyists actually reverse engineered

1767
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:16,160
the game and modified texture models to be able to make them completely naked in very

1768
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,100
high detail.

1769
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:24,540
And, um, Tecmo actually took them to court, um, for breaching the digital millennium copyright

1770
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:31,660
act, um, with that and as well for Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive 2 and, uh, tried to get

1771
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:38,340
some pretty, uh, uh, big money, like between one grand and 10 grand for every skin that

1772
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:41,760
was swapped over the website that they offered.

1773
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,700
So that's it.

1774
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,740
So it's basically Barbies for grown men.

1775
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:55,940
SSG100 Matt in chat says tear down that wall that is hiding those titties.

1776
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:56,940
You know what?

1777
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,980
A little, a little excess in games sometimes is just fine.

1778
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:05,740
In my opinion, you know, you, you, you have ridiculous over the top movies that I love

1779
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,180
like showgirls.

1780
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:12,340
I think if you're going to have the showgirls of games in something like Dead or Alive beach

1781
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:15,980
volleyball, which is basically what it is, uh, then you know what?

1782
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:16,980
That's great.

1783
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:25,180
So, uh, although I would like to see something that, you know, uh, sexualizes and, and, you

1784
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:29,060
know, makes, uh, characters of men in the same way, I think, yes, I think everybody

1785
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,660
deserves that too.

1786
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:37,180
I think that there should be like the banana hammock game with scantily clad dudes of various

1787
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:40,700
isn't there that showering guys game on steam.

1788
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,140
That game's like weird.

1789
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:47,620
It's not even shower with your dad shower with your dad.

1790
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:52,520
You want men to be subject to, uh, titty titty, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1791
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,520
Not even the same thing.

1792
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,520
Nine.

1793
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,620
So here's the, here's, here's what I, here's what the perfect game would be.

1794
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:02,260
And I'm going to go back to, you remember the days here's, I'm going to take it back

1795
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:06,080
ready for ready for old man Roberts reference here.

1796
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:12,280
Remember when you had like a laser disc or a DVD that on one side was one presentation

1797
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:16,880
of the movie, but if you flip it over, it was another presentation of the movie.

1798
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:23,440
So how about a game that on one side is anime titty and on the other side is anime dong.

1799
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,440
Like is it, is it that hard people?

1800
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,440
Is it that hard?

1801
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,400
Why can't we just have them all in the same game?

1802
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,960
Well, and I would, I would be perfectly fine with that too.

1803
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,360
But you know, for those that wish to have nothing but titty today or nothing but dong

1804
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,600
today, we can have floppy boob physics.

1805
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,680
There can be floppy dick physics or bouncy ball physics, whatever, right?

1806
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,720
We can have pantsless rage.

1807
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,400
We can have pantsless rage.

1808
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,400
All right.

1809
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,920
Uh, we're going to take a break and a question our lives and our priority in gaming.

1810
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,480
And then we're going to come back with even more news.

1811
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:04,680
And of course your phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one

1812
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,680
word.

1813
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,960
So we're gonna take a break, but we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio right

1814
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:16,200
after this.

1815
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:21,640
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 654 for this

1816
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:26,360
August the 14th of 2016 of course our show is already in progress.

1817
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:31,320
We've been talking a bit about no man's sky, the final fantasy 15 rumored delay, uh, more

1818
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,200
NX rumors and so on.

1819
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,880
And there's still plenty more to come.

1820
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:40,000
Um, I wanted to, um, mention that, uh, dark Sakura, you brought me something I've been

1821
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,640
looking for for the past couple of weeks that I have not been able to find myself, but you

1822
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,440
found it and you brought it here and that is the crystal Pepsi.

1823
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,440
Yes.

1824
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,520
I just happened to look over and went, shit.

1825
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,300
Is this a permanent thing that they're doing or is this just like, I think it's a limit

1826
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,580
to like, don't you all love the nineties?

1827
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,800
Here it is again.

1828
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:05,740
But if I miss Pokemon and blink when I do too, I wish that they'd had the diet one so

1829
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,740
I could have.

1830
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:07,740
Yeah.

1831
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,740
Because, okay, here's the thing.

1832
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:09,780
I love crystal Pepsi, right?

1833
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:12,420
I loved it when I was a kid and now that I'm drinking this again, I'm like, okay, yeah,

1834
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,740
this is really good.

1835
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:17,300
Now that I'm 20 years older, I'm realizing why this is so good.

1836
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,780
Uh, this is nothing but sugar.

1837
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,340
This is 250 calories a bottle.

1838
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,340
Oh my God.

1839
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,340
Let's see.

1840
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:26,380
Does soda only have like 160 or let's find out myself.

1841
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:31,420
I feel like, well, usually one can has one serving a 20 ounces, two servings.

1842
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:34,940
Oh, my red, my red bowl is only at 110.

1843
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:40,440
My Pellegrino, uh, pump Elmo is 140.

1844
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,820
Now see this crystal me drinking this bottle of crystal Pepsi wouldn't be so bad if I was

1845
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:47,140
still playing DDR, but, uh, at least, Hey, you know what?

1846
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:52,320
At least I walked around a lot yesterday because I'm an out of town friend of mine from Ingress

1847
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,040
was visiting over the weekend and we decided we wanted to do a big banner because you can

1848
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,160
do these things in Ingress called missions.

1849
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,840
And you know, when you string a bunch of missions together, you can do a banner.

1850
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,000
So we did a series of 60 missions downtown yesterday.

1851
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,400
Um, because it was, I wanted to get it done before I went to Atlanta.

1852
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,300
So I'd have it on my profile for when I meet other Ingersers there and so forth.

1853
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,020
And this was the weekend that it worked out for us to be able to do that.

1854
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:17,240
So, uh, we went out, yeah, did 60 missions.

1855
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:20,520
By the way, we had planned all this when the forecast for the weekend was supposed to be

1856
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:24,520
a more reasonable 90 and not the 102 that it ended up really becoming.

1857
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,080
And yes, those 12 degrees make quite a difference.

1858
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,960
And I did it in the heat and I'm crazy.

1859
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,960
You did it in the heat.

1860
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,880
Yes, but I've earned every drop of this crystal Pepsi from yesterday's exercise.

1861
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:37,880
You go.

1862
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,000
That's for sure.

1863
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Will do.

1864
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I will go.

1865
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,120
I will go and unveil the rapid fire news that we're going to get into next.

1866
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,120
Loki.

1867
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,200
All right.

1868
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:52,200
So there's some new Nintendo games that have entered in their selects program.

1869
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,280
So that means that they're going to be cheaper now because you know, Nintendo doesn't really

1870
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,400
do price drops pretty regularly.

1871
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:03,240
So on the three DS, you can look forward to a few games, a animal crossing new leaf, a

1872
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,560
Lego city undercover.

1873
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:11,640
The chase begins Luigi's mansion, dark moon, and then 10 dogs, cats, um, or plus cats,

1874
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:15,320
golden retriever and new friends and Tomodachi life.

1875
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:20,440
And then of course on the Wii U we're getting the legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, Lego city

1876
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,800
undercover and Nintendo land may have to pick up Wind Waker cause that's not bad.

1877
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,340
And then Lego city undercover looked pretty cool as grand theft auto with Legos, which

1878
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:36,680
I think is what originally was supposed to be within a backed off from that too bad.

1879
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:43,580
Also there's going to be some, um, new bundles that are going to be a game plus an amiibo.

1880
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:47,260
And so those are going to be coming out starting September 9th and those are going to be priced

1881
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:48,700
at $40.

1882
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,700
So something that you can look forward to captain toad treasure tracker with toad Mario

1883
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:59,820
party 10 with Bowser, Mario party with peach Yoshi's wooly world, uh, with light blue yarn

1884
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:04,740
Yoshi or pink yarn Yoshi.

1885
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:05,740
That's cool.

1886
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:08,580
I guess if you don't own those games yet, if you're, if you're going to finally take

1887
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:12,740
the plunge on a Wii U this Christmas, Hey, at least you could stock up on games for reasonable

1888
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:13,740
price.

1889
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,740
Black Friday, just wait for the black Friday.

1890
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,740
Ooh, good.

1891
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,740
Good call.

1892
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,300
Um, but yeah, I mean, we wake her definitely.

1893
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,540
I mean, cause I like Wind Waker.

1894
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,340
I have it on the game cube somewhere.

1895
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:26,900
It's actually, it's in my sister's storage cause she has my game cube, but I wanted to

1896
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:27,900
play it again.

1897
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:32,620
I'm like, but $40, man, that's a lot, you know, for that, I'm just going to wait until

1898
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,620
it drops in price.

1899
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,620
Well now it's dropped in price.

1900
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,620
So maybe I will.

1901
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:40,340
Um, and then this is kind of funny, a little tongue in cheek, I guess.

1902
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:47,380
So South Park, the fracture, but home, they released a brand new, uh, that title's always

1903
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,380
going to make me giggle.

1904
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:53,820
I hear Mike over there, they released a new teaser for the game.

1905
01:32:53,820 --> 01:33:03,300
Um, that was pimping a, a device called the nostrils rift, which is basically this device

1906
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:07,660
that plugs onto your face and allows you to smell smells.

1907
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:12,260
So this apparently is going to be a thing that you're going to get to experience if

1908
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:18,060
you're at games com and you will be able to smell farts with it as you play the game.

1909
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,460
What else would you do?

1910
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,460
Exactly.

1911
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:26,780
So, uh, go check that out if you're having to be in, you know, going to games com.

1912
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:27,780
I don't know.

1913
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:28,780
That's fantastic.

1914
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:29,780
It looks awesome.

1915
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:30,780
All right.

1916
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,780
Too bad it's not like a pre-order item or something like that.

1917
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,780
No, that'd be kind of funny, but.

1918
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:37,780
All right.

1919
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,780
Well, something Jason was talking about in the intro tonight was a rocket league in this

1920
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:42,780
game.

1921
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:43,780
You know, Hey, rocket league is still a lot of fun.

1922
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,780
I don't know if you guys have checked it out lately, but they keep doing a lot of updates

1923
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,780
to it.

1924
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,780
And there's more free DLC coming to rocket league.

1925
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,780
And now rumble mode is happening in September and that's on all platforms.

1926
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:58,780
Now what's happening with this is that it's going to be bringing items like the boot,

1927
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:03,780
which will allow you to kick an enemy car in its proverbial face.

1928
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,780
I'm assuming so you can kick cars.

1929
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,780
There's a grappling hook, which will pull the players towards the ball.

1930
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:14,780
So I guess like, you know, any, any game adding grappling hooks is always a good thing.

1931
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:15,780
Exactly.

1932
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,780
Uh, so yeah, that's, that's pretty cool.

1933
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:21,780
Uh, that they're adding these silly things to it to do a little more, uh, uh, I guess

1934
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:22,780
fighting in it.

1935
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:27,780
Uh, you can also, there's other, uh, powerups as well, such as, uh, a plunger, which will

1936
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,780
grab the ball via, via a plunger and a cord.

1937
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,780
Um, a spike will allow you to attach the ball to your car when you bump into it.

1938
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:39,780
And a swapper will allow you to instantly change fields on the, uh, change a position

1939
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,780
on the field with your opponent.

1940
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:44,780
So this just sounds like clusterfuck 5000.

1941
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,780
And, uh, I think it'll be fun.

1942
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:51,780
Uh, Hey, would you like to get a Ubisoft game for free?

1943
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,780
Yes, that's right.

1944
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:56,780
Now that you're paying attention, Rayman Origins is going to be free on PC starting

1945
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:57,780
on August 17th.

1946
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,780
How do you get it?

1947
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:02,780
You go to the Ubi 30 website and click get the game.

1948
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:08,780
And they're doing that each month too, but you do have to have a Uplay account to get

1949
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,780
the game in your library.

1950
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:12,780
But I mean, if you played Ubisoft game, they forced you to do that.

1951
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:13,780
Yeah.

1952
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:14,780
So you probably have one.

1953
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,780
So you just need to remember your lock.

1954
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:21,780
If you've ever played Assassin's Creed or just dancer and South Park, then you have

1955
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:22,780
a Uplay account.

1956
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,780
So, uh, log into it and you can do that by the way.

1957
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:30,780
You could still grab splitter cell if you want, uh, before that goes up on the 17th.

1958
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,780
Uh, once you download it, it is yours forever.

1959
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:37,780
Four more free Ubisoft games coming, uh, through the end of 2016.

1960
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:42,780
That's some, you know what, Hey, it is hard to be upset with free and Rayman's a solid

1961
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:43,780
platformer too.

1962
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,780
So, I mean, for that reason alone, they did do Yaris.

1963
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,780
Remember Yaris existed and it was free and it was bad.

1964
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,780
Okay.

1965
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:52,780
But to be fair, Ubisoft had nothing to do with Yaris.

1966
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:55,780
I think the bar for quad, I realized Ubisoft may have put out a couple of stinkers over

1967
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,780
the years, but there's, there's some really good stuff too.

1968
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,780
And Rayman's Rayman's on the good side.

1969
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,780
Rayman is, but you can't bulk it free.

1970
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:02,780
True.

1971
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:03,780
All right.

1972
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:08,780
Then again, they do also have that weird bird combat game that's coming out.

1973
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:10,780
That's VR or something like that.

1974
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:11,780
Why not?

1975
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:17,780
That you like, I don't know what you do in this game, but you're a bird.

1976
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:18,780
All right.

1977
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,780
And you do battle.

1978
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:21,780
You're a Pidgey.

1979
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:23,780
Uh, last up, Dar Sakura.

1980
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:28,780
Um, Florence and the Machine has three songs out that are for Final Fantasy 15 and they're

1981
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:29,780
all on iTunes right now.

1982
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:35,780
I may have just bought all of them, but the songs are Too Much is Never Enough, I Will

1983
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,780
Be, and Stand By Me.

1984
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:40,780
Um, and yep.

1985
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:44,780
The last one, actually, it is a cover of the original Stand By Me.

1986
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:48,780
If there's not going to be poking dead bodies in Final Fantasy 15, I'm going to be slightly

1987
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:49,780
disappointed.

1988
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,780
Hey, want to see a dead body?

1989
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:56,780
I will say this, uh, the minute that I found out that those tracks were on Spotify, which,

1990
01:36:56,780 --> 01:37:00,780
you know, it went up Friday and all the big music services got it Friday, uh, I went and

1991
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:01,780
listened to the whole thing.

1992
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:02,780
I was not disappointed.

1993
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,780
I love that cover of Stand By Me and I love how it incorporates the Final Fantasy theme

1994
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,780
into it.

1995
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,780
I mean, you kind of already knew that from the trailer, but the two original songs are

1996
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:11,780
really good as well.

1997
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:15,780
Like, you know, Florence is a phenomenal artist and, um,

1998
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,780
And she's not on, what, Heroine?

1999
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:18,780
What was she on?

2000
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:20,780
She was on something.

2001
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:25,780
Well, I guess a lot of artists were, but anyway, all that aside, she's a fantastic musician

2002
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:29,780
and I loved the, even though it's a three song soundtrack, I loved it.

2003
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:31,780
So, um, yeah, check it out.

2004
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:32,780
Listen to it.

2005
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:33,780
I think there's a YouTube out there.

2006
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:37,780
They officially put out with scenes for the game from one of the other songs, not Stand

2007
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,780
By Me, but the first song on the soundtrack.

2008
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:40,780
So, uh, yeah.

2009
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:45,780
ImmortalKing in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love Florence and the machines.

2010
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:47,780
And now that it's on Final Fantasy 15 is awesome.

2011
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:52,780
Uh, and then Bobby Blackwolf says, I actually love Too Much is Never Enough more than Stand

2012
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:53,780
By Me.

2013
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:55,780
That's the song, um, that is first on the soundtrack.

2014
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:56,780
Yeah.

2015
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:59,780
Honestly, the Too Much is Never Enough is a fabulous song.

2016
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:05,780
And I really hope it's used artfully in the game because if that is with a climatic moment

2017
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,780
in the game, that could be a beautiful thing.

2018
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,780
It was just alcoholism.

2019
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,780
Oh, only.

2020
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:12,780
All right.

2021
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:16,780
Anyhow, you can get over alcoholism a lot easier than you can heroin.

2022
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,780
Fair enough.

2023
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:18,780
So moving on.

2024
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,780
All right.

2025
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:24,780
In other news, um, Sega has renewed the license for Virtua Fighter.

2026
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:25,780
Oh, sorry.

2027
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:27,780
The trademark for Virtua Fighter.

2028
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:30,780
So maybe we shall have more of those coming out.

2029
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:34,780
I'm never, I'm not a big fan of the Virtua Fighter series myself, but a lot of people

2030
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:35,780
are.

2031
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:36,780
I'm a Tekken girl.

2032
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:40,780
Well, writer, we've got Virtuality coming out.

2033
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:41,780
Maybe Virtua Fighter.

2034
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:42,780
No.

2035
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:43,780
Yes.

2036
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,780
Kick Punch.

2037
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,780
That's it.

2038
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:47,780
All right.

2039
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:50,780
Uh, we're going to get back into some, uh, long form news here.

2040
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:53,780
I do want to mention though, something that had come up in chat, as I saw people talking

2041
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:58,780
there over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, I saw that, uh, uh, earlier after the break, SH2100

2042
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,780
Matt was letting people know that tickets for MAGFest are on sale, the music and games

2043
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:05,780
fest, which I went to for the first time this year.

2044
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:06,780
And I had a great time.

2045
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:13,780
Uh, so the hotels went up for MAGFest earlier this week and it was, it was controversial

2046
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:14,780
to say the least.

2047
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:15,780
Let's put it like that.

2048
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:18,780
Were there some servers humbled by your presence or whatever?

2049
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:19,780
Kinda.

2050
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,780
I mean, I don't think it was that the servers fried, but it's just that hotel rooms were

2051
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:24,780
gone instantly.

2052
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:26,780
And that hasn't really happened with MAGFest before.

2053
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:29,780
Like last year, I feel like it took like a day.

2054
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:33,780
And the year before that, like it just wasn't like MAGFest is getting really, really, really,

2055
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:34,780
really popular.

2056
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:38,780
And it's being constricted by that space that they hold it at.

2057
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:42,780
Although that is a beautiful hotel, it's just National Harbor is only so big in itself.

2058
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:45,780
So, you know, there's just, there's just some growing pains in that regard.

2059
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:48,780
And then there's the whole, they put it up at a really weird time.

2060
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:53,780
They put it up at one o'clock Pacific, which for most people that go to MAGFest was four

2061
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,780
o'clock Eastern, which, you know, a lot of people are still at work.

2062
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:59,780
So it was a weird time for them to put out and they did it unannounced unless you're

2063
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:00,780
on Twitter.

2064
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,780
So they're getting a little bit of heat for it.

2065
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:06,780
You know, I, I do feel like that team is very responsive and chatty.

2066
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:08,780
And so I feel like they're listening to the feedback at least.

2067
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,780
So, I mean, you know, what's done is done.

2068
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:16,780
And then the tickets for actual MAGFest went on sale just, I think yesterday.

2069
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:19,780
And the servers did melt down for that, but I think they've stabilized now.

2070
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:23,780
Although they say that MAGFest will not sell out as fast as the hotels did.

2071
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:24,780
But I don't know.

2072
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:30,780
I don't know if I believe that anymore, but I did want to say some of the same people

2073
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,780
I went to MAGFest with last year decided to go again.

2074
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:36,780
And I have decided to go with them again.

2075
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:41,780
We did, we did not get the official hotel cause we were 15 minutes late, but we did

2076
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:43,780
get the hotel next door.

2077
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:44,780
So we did get a hotel.

2078
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:45,780
So it's not that bad.

2079
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:46,780
Yeah, it's whatever.

2080
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,780
Yeah, whatever.

2081
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,780
So I just, my only thing, and this is always my paranoid thing.

2082
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:53,780
We're going to Washington DC in January is please no Snowmageddon.

2083
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,780
That's my only wish.

2084
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,780
Please no Snowmageddon.

2085
01:40:56,780 --> 01:41:00,780
Uh, so, uh, but I will be flying out there and going to MAGFest.

2086
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,780
I, I, our friend just booked the tickets.

2087
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,780
They're doing the group rate thing cause there's like at least eight of us going.

2088
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:09,780
Uh, so I will be going to MAGFest 2017 and I'm really excited to, um, be there.

2089
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,780
Uh, this year I am going to try to lobby to get on some panels.

2090
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,780
I would love to do that now that I know a little more about what the convention is all

2091
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:16,780
about.

2092
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:18,780
I would really, really love to get involved in that capacity.

2093
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,780
Um, and I'm looking forward to representing VOG.

2094
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:24,780
Um, I don't know if I know Bobby is unable to go cause the earlier timeframe of the year

2095
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,780
makes it not able to work for him.

2096
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:29,780
I'm not sure what other VOG hosts we have that might be going.

2097
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:35,780
Uh, but I look forward to, uh, representing, uh, VOG and being hopefully a part of some

2098
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,780
of the hosts that can go.

2099
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,780
So, and MAGFest is going to be a lot of fun.

2100
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,780
Excited.

2101
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:40,780
All right.

2102
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:45,780
Rama in chat, uh, over at live.vognetwork.com says Sky working on it.

2103
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,780
Yeah.

2104
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,780
All right.

2105
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,780
Ooh, wow.

2106
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:51,780
And MXC says the cheapest tier of tickets sold out a few minutes ago.

2107
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:52,780
Wow.

2108
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,780
So there's going to be slightly more expensive now.

2109
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:57,780
Well, hopefully my pal already got those tickets.

2110
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,780
I better, uh, beep him or what we can do.

2111
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,780
All right.

2112
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,780
Uh, we're gonna get back into some other long news at this point.

2113
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,780
So Loki.

2114
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,780
So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Go.

2115
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:11,780
Uh, Niantic is finally cracking down on players that are cheating in Pokemon Go by using bots

2116
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:12,780
or other programs.

2117
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:18,780
They've made some changes or additions to their FAQ and they are now sending out the

2118
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:25,780
ban hammer and also sending out cease and desists to some of the, um, websites creating

2119
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:28,780
these bots, including one such bot called Necrobot.

2120
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:33,780
Uh, they sent out a cease and desist letter and basically they've shut down, you know,

2121
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:39,780
shop and you know, they comment, do the legal action being started against, um, other bot

2122
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,780
creators and devs.

2123
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:44,780
Uh, we did not receive the letter yet, but the project development will be stocked.

2124
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:48,780
And then of course, you know, there's other, uh, what was some of the other bought ones

2125
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:54,780
that other bot creators have also received, um, cease and desist letters though for that.

2126
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:59,780
Um, one of the other things they included on there as well, using an emulator, um, modified

2127
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:03,780
software to access Pokemon Go or clients or backends.

2128
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:07,780
So they're saying that maybe they might ban you for using some of those Pokemon tracking

2129
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:11,780
things because there's still some of them out there and you create, you know, accounts

2130
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,780
to do that.

2131
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:13,780
But let's be honest.

2132
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:17,780
I mean, you can create as many fucking accounts as you want and they're not really going to

2133
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:19,780
stop you.

2134
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:20,780
So it gets banned.

2135
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:21,780
Big deal.

2136
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:22,780
Yeah.

2137
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:25,780
Unfortunately, it's very easy to make a new account and keep playing.

2138
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:30,280
Um, but at least I'm glad Niantic is doing something about it, but I'll, I'll just give

2139
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:33,320
a cheap plug for Pokestop podcast this week because we talked a little more about this

2140
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:39,660
at length and some of, I kind of feel like we, there's some false positives, unfortunately,

2141
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:43,980
that it makes it hard to be excited about this when that's going on.

2142
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:46,580
It's definitely a step in the right direction at least.

2143
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,580
It is.

2144
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:48,580
It is.

2145
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:49,580
It's better than nothing.

2146
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:50,580
That's true.

2147
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,580
That's a common theme with Niantic.

2148
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:52,580
It's better than nothing.

2149
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:57,420
Not only is Niantic sending out cease and desist letters, but they're also getting sued.

2150
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:01,680
They're getting sued by a guy from West Orange, New Jersey.

2151
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:07,300
He's pursuing a class action lawsuit against Niantic Labs because his house or I guess

2152
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:13,980
apparently his house is labeled in game as either, um, or something nearby, maybe as

2153
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,100
a Pokestop or a gym.

2154
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:20,700
Um, yeah, I'm not really sure.

2155
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:24,980
Say if it's specifically his house or something, but basically those darn kids are on my lawn

2156
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:29,780
playing Pokemon Go and, and I'm not happy about it.

2157
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:33,820
And so basically he says, you know, at least five individuals knocked on the plaintiff's

2158
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:39,700
door and asked the, asked the plaintiff's, um, access to the backyard to catch Pokemon.

2159
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:40,700
Someone explain this to me.

2160
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:44,580
I never fucking understand this because I've never had to walk anywhere to get a Poke.

2161
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:48,500
I mean you can catch a Pokemon that's like several, I don't get it.

2162
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:52,540
Like it's, are people dumb enough to like not realize that you don't have to be on top

2163
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:53,860
of the Pokemon to catch them?

2164
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:58,420
We talked about this a little bit on Pokestop last week and, uh, the theory I threw out

2165
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:03,840
there was that it wasn't the Pokemon themselves, but it was the whole searching feature that

2166
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:08,140
was causing people to triangulate the Pokemon in this person's backyard.

2167
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:11,400
And that's cause you know, back East and these other places, they have much bigger backyards

2168
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,540
than we do here.

2169
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:17,820
So it was, and we, we, I'm speculating again, tinfoil hatting, I have nothing to go on,

2170
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:22,500
but this could be part of the reason why Niantic said we needed to get rid of the searching

2171
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,840
the way it was and replace it with something else.

2172
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:27,160
So I worry about this loss.

2173
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:29,760
I mean, I, I know a lot of us are kind of laughing it off.

2174
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,800
This one worries me.

2175
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:37,000
Like I kind of feel like this is going to be a really interesting precedent for AR gaming.

2176
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:43,700
I just, I have the, maybe I'm just like, you know, that Ingress player that's like, ah,

2177
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,700
I've been doing this longer than you guys.

2178
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:51,260
But it seems like just, it's really like new bitch to think that you got to walk right

2179
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,260
up to that stuff.

2180
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,860
Like, I mean, seriously, just driving around, you can catch it, learn how to hop a fence

2181
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:56,860
like the rest of us.

2182
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:57,860
Just like forget it.

2183
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:01,740
I mean, you'll have to, if it's on your screen, you can tap it in, you know, attack it.

2184
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:06,780
It could be like several blocks down the road, but, but it could be again, the backyards

2185
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,940
in some of these neighborhoods are huge.

2186
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:12,940
So somebody is triangulating it in this person's gigantic backyard and they need to get in

2187
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:15,380
the backyard to actually even though that's not a pokey stop.

2188
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:20,300
That's just in general people being dumb, but you know, I don't know, whatever.

2189
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,300
We'll see.

2190
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,900
I, I, again, this, this one worries me a little bit.

2191
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:30,180
I feel like at the end of the day, it's the choice of the kids to ring the doorbell, not

2192
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:31,180
Niantic.

2193
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:32,180
So talk to their parents.

2194
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,180
Yeah.

2195
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:36,940
So I kind of feel like that might be the escape here, but I, I just, I worry a little bit.

2196
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:40,900
Did you hear about the bad egg for Pokemon Go?

2197
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:45,700
There was an article up that said that, um, people were able to, through some kind of

2198
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:49,260
glitch, put an egg as, um, with the gym.

2199
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,580
Oh, I heard somebody was doing that at one of the local communities here.

2200
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:53,580
Yeah, yeah.

2201
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:54,580
And I'm trying to find the picture of it.

2202
01:46:54,580 --> 01:47:01,740
Basically the egg has no CP, so it can't be killed and it will just reap all those ongoing

2203
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:05,500
benefits of being a gym leader and you can't knock it out.

2204
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:13,380
People, you can file a report with Niantic to have it removed, but, um, it's just happening,

2205
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:17,260
I think for the most part on the East coast, um, gyms, but still a nuisance.

2206
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:18,260
Yeah.

2207
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:21,820
So something else to consider, you know, William Murderface, I just, before we move on to the

2208
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:27,100
next story, William Murderface poses a, a, a good question in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2209
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,980
William Murderface says, how is ringing a doorbell a crime?

2210
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:30,980
The fuck?

2211
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:35,260
Um, I suppose they're going to have to prove that it was a nuisance.

2212
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:39,380
You know, if it was at weird hours the night, I mean that that's going to be the, the, the,

2213
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:42,620
it would have to legally be a nuisance for that to happen.

2214
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:47,340
That's why, you know, you don't go ring your neighbor's doorbell at 2 AM just to say, Hey,

2215
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:48,340
sup, I'm bored.

2216
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,820
What you up to, you know, don't do that.

2217
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,820
No.

2218
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:52,820
Well, I w okay.

2219
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:58,820
It's different if you work overnights, Mike, you can do things like that, but, uh, you know,

2220
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,820
yeah.

2221
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,820
Anyway, well, we'll see.

2222
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,820
I don't, I don't know.

2223
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,300
I think that's a good question.

2224
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:07,220
And one that will probably be asked in court that Niantic will say, what's illegal about

2225
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,220
ringing a doorbell.

2226
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:09,220
Anyway.

2227
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:13,100
Uh, let's move on to a story about something that's definitely illegal.

2228
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:16,500
And that is hacking a forum to get people's passwords.

2229
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,320
Yes, it's happened again.

2230
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:23,360
Feel like we have one of these stories every month, but the forums for Dota 2 were hacked

2231
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,160
on July 10th.

2232
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:29,540
And apparently they got 2 million records in the hack, usernames, email addresses, passwords

2233
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:30,720
and IPs.

2234
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:35,000
So if you didn't use a unique password on the Dota 2 website, you should probably do

2235
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,500
that next time.

2236
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:41,560
And as always change your password, which at this point, you might as well just change

2237
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:48,000
your effing password on all your sites every couple months, just to be safe or use, I realized

2238
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,800
everybody, some people use the app that does the one password generator, whatever works

2239
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:59,240
for you, just realize you can't, you know, name all your passwords, you know, Mr. Kitty

2240
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,960
123 or whatever silly passwords people come up with, it has to be a lot more complex than

2241
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,080
that or things are going to get hacked.

2242
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,680
All right.

2243
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,680
Moving on, DarkSakura.

2244
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:14,320
Well, again, business can be shady.

2245
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,800
Business is super shady.

2246
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:19,540
Microsoft bought its Twitch competitor.

2247
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:25,680
They acquired Beam Interactive, they are not saying for how much, basically it's pretty

2248
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:33,880
much, you know, like Twitch is, it's to watch realtime gaming and commentary.

2249
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:39,200
And so they're calling it a convergence, it's a takeover.

2250
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,680
It's just shady business.

2251
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:48,920
So the one thing about Beam is that it is completely realtime.

2252
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:52,800
It doesn't have that 10 to 20 second delay that Twitch has.

2253
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:59,700
And it also has different tools that allow the different viewers to influence the stream.

2254
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:04,140
So like they'll let a viewer select the weapon that they have to in a shooter or other things

2255
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,600
like that.

2256
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:12,520
So yeah, shady, but it's business.

2257
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:19,480
Well, I could see why Microsoft wants to get in on that business as well is that, you know,

2258
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:23,880
Twitch obviously has a huge audience and nobody's really competing with them.

2259
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:29,320
I mean, YouTube kind of trying, but like even YouTube isn't taking off the way the Twitch

2260
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,320
is.

2261
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,680
So Twitch really has a lock on that.

2262
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:34,080
So they're very interesting.

2263
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:38,620
So it's just, it seems to me that they're just going to turn it around and use it for

2264
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:45,600
their own promotion, which I like the idea of a streaming service being independent.

2265
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,680
And then the name of this is Beam, right?

2266
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,680
Beam.

2267
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,800
Somebody was asking in chat.

2268
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:55,360
Well also, I think Beam also is very much about, you know how like when you play Tomb

2269
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,720
Raider on Twitch, you may not know this, but when you play Tomb Raider on Twitch, people

2270
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:03,440
can like help or hurt you by the chat commands.

2271
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:09,480
Beam does that type of stuff where it's like, vote on what item the player should get next

2272
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,480
type of thing.

2273
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,560
So there's a little more interaction than there is on Twitch, which is actually kind

2274
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,480
of cool at the same time.

2275
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:18,260
This just opens yourself up to rampant trolling.

2276
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:24,060
But if there's something a little more structured, like actually, maybe the Jackbox Party Pack

2277
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:26,340
is a really good explanation of that.

2278
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:29,900
Because like in the Jackbox Party Pack, you might be streaming a game online that you

2279
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:35,100
and your friends are playing in one room, but anybody can join to help vote on answers

2280
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,340
and maybe change the flow of the game and things like that.

2281
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:41,080
I think that might be more the type of technology that Microsoft's getting into.

2282
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:46,780
So if Microsoft is really looking at making games more interactive, that could be a pretty

2283
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:50,940
cool thing and something that puts it a notch past Twitch.

2284
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:51,940
We'll see.

2285
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:54,020
I'm curious to see what they do with this.

2286
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:55,660
Very, very curious.

2287
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:59,580
So all right.

2288
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:00,580
Let's move on.

2289
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,180
Loki, before we get to the mailbag.

2290
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,180
All right.

2291
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:04,780
So this is kind of funny.

2292
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:07,140
Apparently THQ is coming back.

2293
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:08,140
Yeah.

2294
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:14,260
THQ is coming back as THQ Nordic because you may remember Nordic games when they had that

2295
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,980
huge buyout where they were selling all their properties off.

2296
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:21,620
Nordic was one of the ones that purchased a lot of the older backlog stuff that they

2297
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:22,620
had.

2298
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:27,220
So like the Darksiders, MX versus ATV, Red Faction, just around human properties.

2299
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:34,260
Now on top of that, they're just going to be renaming themselves to THQ Nordic, which

2300
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:36,460
is neat.

2301
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:42,340
And they're going to be publishing under the THQ name, possibly.

2302
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:43,980
I guess that's cool.

2303
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,740
Good luck to them with that name.

2304
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,740
I guess they really want that.

2305
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:49,900
I just want to see more games coming out from that stuff because, I mean, hell, Destroy

2306
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,900
All Humans.

2307
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,780
That was pretty awesome.

2308
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:55,060
Stoppy's with you in our chat at live.vognetware.com.

2309
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:57,500
Stoppy says, I really hope they bring back Red Faction.

2310
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,020
Red Faction is pretty cool, yeah.

2311
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:01,780
So maybe it's going to be a throwback to some of these old series.

2312
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:02,780
Who knows?

2313
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:05,140
Well, you know, Volition really does want to make a Red Faction game because that's

2314
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:09,020
what Saints Row 4 basically was in space.

2315
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:10,020
I don't know.

2316
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,020
It's silly.

2317
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:13,860
Well, I think this is awesome.

2318
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:16,980
And that is that Parappa the Rappa is coming back.

2319
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:17,980
Yay!

2320
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:18,980
Wait, hold on.

2321
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:19,980
I gotta believe.

2322
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:20,980
Hold on.

2323
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:21,980
What?

2324
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:22,980
Not in a game.

2325
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:23,980
Sorry.

2326
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:24,980
It's not a game.

2327
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:25,980
It's not a game.

2328
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:26,980
Why would you do that to me?

2329
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:28,980
Because the truth, it was my clickbait.

2330
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:32,540
Parappa the Rappa is coming back, but it's just not a game.

2331
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:37,620
It's going to be some anime shorts that are actually coming out.

2332
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,620
These are...

2333
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:39,620
I don't...

2334
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,620
But why?

2335
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,220
That's already an anime.

2336
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:45,700
But these are new anime shorts.

2337
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:53,100
It is a series of shorts that I guess PJ Berry is actually getting the title role in this.

2338
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:57,940
It's not Parappa, but it's PJ Berry, which is the little bear friend that always looks

2339
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:58,940
a little hungover.

2340
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:01,060
If you remember the games.

2341
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:06,660
So that is going to be starting in October and it will be actually, actually, no, why

2342
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:07,660
does...

2343
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:12,180
It says starting in October, but it says, oh, the pilot episode will be August 18th,

2344
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:14,060
then the rest of them in October.

2345
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,300
They're doing an early preview type of thing.

2346
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:19,140
So you could check that out if you want.

2347
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,980
I want the Lemmy and Remy show.

2348
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:24,500
And maybe if this does very successful, maybe there'll be a Parappa 3.

2349
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,500
I gotta believe.

2350
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,660
Parappa would be the perfect digital game.

2351
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:29,100
We need a Lemmy sequel.

2352
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,940
Yeah, I would totally be down with the Umjama Lemmy.

2353
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:35,220
I would be down with a game starring both of them again.

2354
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,220
Give them co-billing.

2355
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:37,220
Don't give a fuck.

2356
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,220
Just bring back this series.

2357
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:39,220
Add Knuckles.

2358
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:40,220
Fuck off.

2359
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:47,540
Did you guys see the comic?

2360
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,220
What if Sonic was in Pokemon?

2361
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:54,180
He was going around telling all the Pokemon to rise against their human masters and trap

2362
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,740
them all in Pokeballs.

2363
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,740
That's what I see going on.

2364
01:54:56,740 --> 01:55:01,540
If Knuckles was in the game, he'd just be like, the fuck am I doing here?

2365
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:07,260
And teach Parappa about hardcore.

2366
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:10,780
I would actually love to see a third friend that comes in.

2367
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:11,780
So what?

2368
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,780
Parappa raps.

2369
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:15,060
Umjama Lemmy plays the guitar.

2370
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:17,780
How about like Marimba Mel or something?

2371
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,780
Didgeridoo Dave.

2372
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:22,060
Yeah, Didgeridoo Dave that plays the didgeridoo.

2373
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:24,980
And then implement Lucio from Overwatch.

2374
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,460
There we go.

2375
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:27,460
Drop the beat.

2376
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:29,700
Let's get the beat down.

2377
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:33,520
But like, no, seriously, if they had Didgeridoo Dave, then you could actually go back and

2378
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:39,580
play the older games with the didgeridoo enhanced soundtrack.

2379
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:44,020
So you could go back and do like, you know, the toilet wrap with the, you know, ominous

2380
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,020
didgeridoo noise.

2381
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:51,860
And his didgeridoo is like the sewage pipes.

2382
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:56,180
I feel like that's on the cusp of being an OLR dream game is didgeridoo Dave.

2383
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:59,940
That's it.

2384
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:03,100
The third game in the Parappa the Rapa series didgeridoo Dave.

2385
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,100
All right.

2386
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,740
I like that.

2387
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:09,940
It's a dream game adjacent because it's not an original idea, but it's one that needs

2388
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:10,940
to happen for sure.

2389
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,940
It's a dream sequel.

2390
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:13,180
It's a dream cool.

2391
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:14,180
A dream cool.

2392
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:15,180
It's a dream cool.

2393
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:16,180
All right.

2394
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:18,660
Didn't we open this show talking about sequels and remakes and how we don't want them anymore?

2395
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:19,660
Here we are.

2396
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:20,660
All right.

2397
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:22,180
Anyway, we're allowed to change our minds.

2398
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,180
That's right.

2399
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:24,180
You know what?

2400
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:27,220
This is your show and not yours.

2401
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:31,260
Opinions in the gaming industry changing, contradicting themselves.

2402
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:34,660
Get out, get out right now.

2403
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:35,660
Let's get to the mailbag.

2404
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:36,660
Really?

2405
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:37,660
Really?

2406
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:42,300
I was going to say, you know, just kind of going back to that topic we were just on there

2407
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:43,300
a second ago.

2408
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:44,300
Yes.

2409
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,300
Really?

2410
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,300
They should just add T-Pain as you know, the third character.

2411
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:47,300
Why not?

2412
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,300
Oh, Auto-2 now.

2413
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,300
T-Pain is Auto-2 now.

2414
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:51,300
T-Pain is Auto-2 now.

2415
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,300
I think Rob just lost this.

2416
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,300
Why is this so funny?

2417
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:00,300
Because it's incredible.

2418
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:02,300
Hey, I smell a list list coming.

2419
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:05,300
Oh, who should Parappa's new shitty friend be?

2420
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:06,300
Exactly.

2421
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:09,300
Why not all of them?

2422
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,300
All right.

2423
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:15,300
Hey, if you have a shitty friend you'd like to see in the Parappa universe, email us.

2424
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,300
My shitty friend is in my mind.

2425
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:25,300
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can email us and tell us about

2426
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:30,300
all your imaginary shitty friends or whatever's on your mind this week about gaming and the

2427
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:31,300
gaming industry and so forth.

2428
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:34,300
So, what's in the mailbag this week, DarkSakura?

2429
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:35,300
One email.

2430
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:36,300
One email?

2431
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,300
One.

2432
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,300
All right.

2433
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:39,300
Well, at least it's an email.

2434
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:40,300
Hello.

2435
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:41,300
Hi.

2436
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:44,300
I just wanted to extend well wishes to everyone at the OLR and VOG family.

2437
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:45,300
I love you guys.

2438
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,300
That's it.

2439
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,300
Smile hearts, Ryan.

2440
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,300
Thank you, Ryan.

2441
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,300
That's the email?

2442
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:56,300
That literally is an email that just was like, no, please, I'm laughing.

2443
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:58,300
The music was great for it too.

2444
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:04,300
No, I'm laughing as I'm still laughing at Auto 2 now, but I love that we just got an

2445
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,300
email that's like, I just called to say I love you.

2446
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:13,300
I just called to say I care.

2447
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,300
I love it.

2448
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:15,300
Thank you.

2449
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,300
You want to know what's funny?

2450
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:17,300
I love you too.

2451
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,300
I love you too.

2452
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:22,300
I actually was listening to that song last night because I was on a Stevie Wonder kick.

2453
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:23,300
All right.

2454
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:25,300
There's no inappropriate time for a Stevie Wonder kick.

2455
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:28,300
Do you know what though was really wrong to follow that song with?

2456
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:29,300
Superstition.

2457
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,300
Anyway.

2458
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:35,300
The only time that that might be inappropriate is if in the middle of Inception because they

2459
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:39,300
don't really need a kick that early, especially the Stevie Wonder.

2460
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:42,300
Anyway, thank you for the email.

2461
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:43,300
I'll see what you did.

2462
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:49,300
You know what, even though there was no question or observation, I appreciate a pat on the

2463
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:51,300
ass and a job well done once in a great while.

2464
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:56,300
But you don't want a pat on the ass so hard your ass falls off, tries to grant you a wish

2465
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:57,300
and flies away.

2466
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:59,300
Nobody understands this reference.

2467
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,300
It sounds amazing.

2468
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:03,300
Darsucker's referencing a webcomic that none of you read.

2469
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:08,300
The rest of the webcomic is actually pretty dirty, but I'll link it to you guys in the

2470
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:09,300
chat.

2471
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:15,300
By the way, can I just mention in chat over at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster saying,

2472
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:19,300
I'm going to name a planet Parappa shitty friend and hope it doesn't get reported.

2473
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,300
Great.

2474
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,300
Let's see.

2475
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,300
And we have Sia Tabiri in chat says, Clogger Clay.

2476
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:27,300
Raginator suggests Triangle Tim.

2477
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:32,300
Fifth Dream suggests base player that no one knows his name.

2478
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:34,300
They just put flea in it.

2479
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:35,300
It's so fucking good.

2480
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,300
He could be like a rapper's name.

2481
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:38,300
Base playa.

2482
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:44,300
Sia Tabiri suggests Molly Marimba or Orange Wright suggests Xylophone Xandar.

2483
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:47,300
Sia Tabiri says saxophone Xin-chan.

2484
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:48,300
Xin-chan.

2485
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,300
You know what?

2486
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:52,300
See, this is what they need to do in the next Mega Man game.

2487
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:53,300
Tuna base.

2488
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:56,300
Trying to do like a musical spin on it where the rumor was that they're all going to be

2489
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:59,300
named after like music, you know, Sonata and that type of stuff.

2490
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:01,300
No, they need to be all fucking rapper names.

2491
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:05,300
Like, you know, that kind of base playa or I don't know.

2492
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,300
Actually tuna fish.

2493
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:09,300
That's or excuse me, tuna base.

2494
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,300
That's a great name.

2495
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,300
Maybe a drag name.

2496
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:15,300
Well, it could actually be a little fish that plays the bass guitar.

2497
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:18,300
That's I think that's a great idea.

2498
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:19,300
Act Deaf.

2499
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:20,300
You should make Parappa games.

2500
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:22,300
How about tuna piano?

2501
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:23,300
Tuna piano.

2502
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,300
All right.

2503
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:30,300
Let's get to the FUs of the week because when the show totally derails, we just derail it further.

2504
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:49,300
Harpsichord Henry said harp core Henry.

2505
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,300
Oh, I read harpsichord.

2506
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:51,300
All right.

2507
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,300
Anyway, go ahead.

2508
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:58,300
If you if you to wanting so much cheesecake that I can't fucking stand it.

2509
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:06,300
And so Becky and I are going to get cheesecake because Becky with the good hair.

2510
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:08,300
Actually, Jamie has the good.

2511
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:11,300
Jamie has the good hair today.

2512
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:14,300
I it's it's a Beyonce reference.

2513
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:15,300
Oh, OK. Don't worry about it.

2514
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:16,300
Sorry. Don't worry.

2515
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:19,300
She's not my queen bee.

2516
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:21,300
But cheesecake is all the best stuff in the universe.

2517
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:24,300
And I also have blue roots.

2518
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:30,300
I said when I get old, I'm going to bleach on my hair and make it blue so I can be a blue haired old lady.

2519
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:39,300
And now I have like deep blue roots with my red and purple hair, and it's pretty fucking good.

2520
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:45,300
Raginator says Lira Lisa and I just keep thinking Lisa Lisa and cult jam.

2521
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:46,300
Yeah.

2522
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:47,300
All right.

2523
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,300
Moving on.

2524
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:51,300
Loki, how about your FU of the week before my FU of the week?

2525
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,300
I have to say accordion owls.

2526
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:55,300
And of course, played by Weird Al Yankovic.

2527
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,300
Yes.

2528
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:57,300
Brilliant.

2529
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:59,300
I think that really is already in my little pony.

2530
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:01,300
He may as well do that to sell it.

2531
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:02,300
OK.

2532
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:06,300
FU to my fucking computer for being just retarded and randomly crashing.

2533
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:10,300
It hasn't crashed yet, but that doesn't mean there's still potential.

2534
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:12,300
I'll try to work on my game tonight.

2535
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:17,300
I'm sure they'll get the crash and then just send FU to my car.

2536
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:25,300
But thankfully, though, that was fixed and it was kind of weird because it's one of those like transmission things where the check engine light came on and it goes off.

2537
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:30,300
And then it would be like several months where the car's driving just fine and one stutter here or there.

2538
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:32,300
And then finally it stayed on so they could fix it.

2539
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,300
So that's good.

2540
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,300
Oh, my God.

2541
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:37,300
I just heard a gay gasp.

2542
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,300
Someone created.

2543
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:40,300
I know.

2544
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:41,300
And it wasn't me or Mike.

2545
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:44,300
Someone created.

2546
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,300
The Picaturo.

2547
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:46,300
The Picaturo.

2548
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,300
What?

2549
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,300
Yeah.

2550
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:49,300
And it's in California, too.

2551
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:50,300
OK.

2552
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,300
Stop derailing the FUs.

2553
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:52,300
All right.

2554
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:54,300
I wanted Picaturo.

2555
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:59,300
My FU of the week goes to my snack food addiction because I've eaten tons of snack foods today.

2556
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:01,300
And then I had a Crystal Pepsi.

2557
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,300
Did you have a Picaturo?

2558
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:04,300
I don't think so.

2559
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:06,300
I have not.

2560
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,300
Life squad goals.

2561
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:10,300
It's at this place called The Loop.

2562
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:11,300
Where's that?

2563
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:12,300
Is it in fucking L.A.?

2564
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,300
Everything's in L.A.

2565
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:14,300
I'll find out.

2566
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:15,300
It's in L.A.

2567
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:18,300
I already know like mega California burrito.

2568
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,300
Oh, my God.

2569
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:20,300
Look how big it is.

2570
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,300
I'm going to put in the chat room.

2571
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:24,300
And it's served in ice cream.

2572
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:25,300
It is a joke.

2573
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:28,300
Since it's radio, it's a giant.

2574
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:35,300
It's a giant churro that you actually wrapped around your face and has little Pikachu ears on it.

2575
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,300
Can you put that in chat?

2576
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,300
Yeah, I'm gonna.

2577
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:39,300
Sorry for the folks listening on the podcast.

2578
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:40,300
Oh, my God.

2579
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:41,300
Google Picaturo.

2580
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,300
The Picaturo has to be inside of my stomach right now.

2581
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,300
That's amazing.

2582
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:47,300
I think it would kill you if it was inside your stomach.

2583
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,300
I don't care.

2584
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:49,300
It does look alive.

2585
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,300
Picaturo used Nuzzle.

2586
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:53,300
It's super effective.

2587
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:55,300
Picaturo used IBS.

2588
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:59,300
It's super effective.

2589
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:01,300
Picaturo uses Thunder Shark.

2590
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:02,300
It was extremely effective.

2591
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,300
What's that?

2592
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,300
Is that the new Alola Pikachu?

2593
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:05,300
Yeah, it's Alola form.

2594
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,300
It's the Dole Whip form.

2595
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:08,300
All right.

2596
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:10,300
Oh, my God.

2597
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:13,300
The thing's also coated in something like golden delicious.

2598
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:14,300
Stop talking about fucking food.

2599
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,300
It's a video game show.

2600
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:18,300
It was half related.

2601
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:20,300
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line.

2602
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:21,300
Loki.

2603
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:27,300
So Spotify has now, they've unveiled a dedicated gaming section.

2604
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:32,300
They have game soundtracks and playlists for games.

2605
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:34,300
So some of the games that they have on there.

2606
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:36,300
Rocket League.

2607
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,300
There's some Ultimate Rock Gaming.

2608
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:42,300
Gaming Anthems.

2609
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:44,300
So, yeah, you can go check it out.

2610
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:45,300
They're so bad.

2611
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:52,300
Just if you want to check some of those out in that, just browse and scroll down to the genre section, big gaming.

2612
02:04:52,300 --> 02:05:01,300
I actually, I was unable to find it in the Spotify app, but I went to that dedicated website and there actually was some playlists that were actually really good.

2613
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:05,300
Like, I like Spotify a lot myself.

2614
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:07,300
Like, I realized you can kind of pick that or Apple Music.

2615
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:14,300
But one thing Spotify has done very, very well that no other service for me has done is that the playlist that it curates.

2616
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:18,300
Like, We Think You'll Like This have been spot on.

2617
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,300
Like, they're so good.

2618
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:20,300
I have never used Spotify.

2619
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:22,300
Really? I don't think Apple Music does that.

2620
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:24,300
It just has a list.

2621
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:29,300
Well, I got suckered into the whole pay 99 cents for three months and then oops, I didn't cancel my credit card.

2622
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:31,300
But, I mean, I really do like it.

2623
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:36,300
So it's like, okay, yeah, they suckered me into paying the monthly fee and I kind of don't buy music anymore.

2624
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:37,300
I just use Spotify.

2625
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:42,300
So, which is probably not what record labels want to hear, but that's the direction things are going.

2626
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:45,300
You get to listen to new music whenever you want.

2627
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,300
I do.

2628
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,300
That's just basically what you want.

2629
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,300
You don't want to necessarily buy.

2630
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:51,300
I have a curated playlist for new music.

2631
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:53,300
And you can still search on there, right?

2632
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:55,300
And it knows I want to hear every new Britney song.

2633
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:56,300
It knows.

2634
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:57,300
All right.

2635
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:04,300
Anyhow, let's go on to one last story tonight.

2636
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:07,300
Oh, this could maybe be a use for the Pikachu Dark Sakura.

2637
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:09,300
Digestion?

2638
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:10,300
Digestion.

2639
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:18,300
Do you remember a few weeks ago here on the show, we were talking about Pokemon inspired dildos.

2640
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,300
That's right.

2641
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:22,300
Adult toys inspired by Pokemon.

2642
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:30,300
Well, apparently a adult film company out there called Brazzers was the name of this company.

2643
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:31,300
Never heard of them.

2644
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:37,300
Well, I can't imagine why.

2645
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:40,300
They're like memes worthy.

2646
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:42,300
You put Brazzers on anything and it's dirty.

2647
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:50,300
Anyway, they have Porn Star Go, which is a Pokemon Go inspired triple X film.

2648
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:53,300
And there actually is a trailer.

2649
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:55,300
And wouldn't you all like to see that trailer right now?

2650
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:56,300
Absolutely.

2651
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:58,300
Let's do it.

2652
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:00,300
Because it's going to be great radio.

2653
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:03,300
The porn stars try to catch them all.

2654
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:06,300
Imagine porn stars in the real world.

2655
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,300
They are in the real world.

2656
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:10,300
I'm confused.

2657
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:14,300
Get ready for the ultimate showdown.

2658
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:16,300
Oh my God.

2659
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,300
Was that anal beads she pulled out of his pocket?

2660
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:28,300
And shows that she caught the beads.

2661
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:30,300
What the fuck did you do to my yard?

2662
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:34,300
That's the guy who's doing Niantic for all these people being in his yard.

2663
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:37,300
This is like cosplay porn.

2664
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,300
Is this a parody?

2665
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,300
Is this serious?

2666
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:45,300
Okay.

2667
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:46,300
Is this legit or is this?

2668
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,300
Oh my God.

2669
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,300
It says August 8th.

2670
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:50,300
I guess it's already out.

2671
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:51,300
This is legit.

2672
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,300
This isn't like a parody somebody did.

2673
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,300
No, it's just a really terrible film.

2674
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,300
Not like Google.

2675
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:57,300
Just go to Brazzers.

2676
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:59,300
All right.

2677
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,300
Wow.

2678
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:03,300
Now I've seen everything.

2679
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,300
The ladies are really cute though.

2680
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:08,300
They look really adorable in those outfits.

2681
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:09,300
Sure.

2682
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:14,300
You know there will be significantly less clothing in the actual thing.

2683
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:16,300
So they're not going to look as cute, Rob.

2684
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:18,300
I'm fine having just seen the trailer.

2685
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:19,300
That's fine.

2686
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,300
There you go.

2687
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:21,300
It's straight on their front page.

2688
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:22,300
So yes, I would definitely say that.

2689
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:23,300
Oh my God.

2690
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:24,300
Getting in on the...

2691
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:25,300
That looks so stupid.

2692
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:26,300
Getting in on the...

2693
02:08:26,300 --> 02:08:27,300
Did they do a Candy Crush porn?

2694
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,300
I don't think so.

2695
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:37,300
No, but they have Sex Fighter, a triple X parody, Vega gets vagina.

2696
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:41,300
Yes, that's a thing.

2697
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:44,300
So yes, apparently that is a thing.

2698
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:45,300
That's fantastic.

2699
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,300
All right.

2700
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,300
Let's...

2701
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:49,300
A parody title popped into my head.

2702
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:50,300
I don't know if it's appropriate.

2703
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:51,300
Oh no.

2704
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,300
What's this?

2705
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:53,300
Dare I ask?

2706
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:54,300
No.

2707
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,300
We won't go there.

2708
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:56,300
Thanks.

2709
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,300
That was a great radio.

2710
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:00,300
Fifth Dream and Chat suggest Panty Crush Saga.

2711
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,300
Well, here's what I was going to do.

2712
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,300
I was going to go to their parody page because that's going to be where they have all the

2713
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:05,300
different stuff.

2714
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:12,300
So on top of that, they also have Sex Fighter with Chun-Li versus Cammy, of course.

2715
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:13,300
Some other parodies.

2716
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:15,300
Several Ghostbusters triple X parody videos.

2717
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:16,300
Of course.

2718
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:19,300
Star Trek's...

2719
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:21,300
What would be the plot of a Ghostbuster?

2720
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:23,300
Is it your vagina is haunted?

2721
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,300
X-Men.

2722
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:31,300
They also have Spider-Man, Star Whores, Storm of Kings, which I'm not really sure what the

2723
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,300
fuck that's supposed...

2724
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:33,300
I guess Game of Thrones.

2725
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:36,300
Just so you know, the X-Men thing exists in the gay porn universe as well.

2726
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:37,300
Or so I've heard.

2727
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:38,300
Oh.

2728
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:39,300
Oh.

2729
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,300
On Twitter.

2730
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:41,300
You know, people are so nasty on Twitter.

2731
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:42,300
Right.

2732
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,300
All right.

2733
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:44,300
The Skype line is open.

2734
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:47,300
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2735
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:49,300
If you want to give us a call.

2736
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:52,300
Orange Lounge Radio, again, all one word on Skype if you would like to participate with

2737
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:54,300
the program tonight.

2738
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:58,300
Meanwhile, while we wait for any calls that may be coming in, I want to check with Loki

2739
02:09:58,300 --> 02:09:59,300
for any last minute stories.

2740
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,300
Unless he's too busy looking at pornography.

2741
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:05,300
No, they just have, like, they really, after that first page of parodies, they just kind

2742
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,300
of go downhill from there because there's not really anything...

2743
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:09,300
When was it ever uphill?

2744
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:13,300
Well, I thought that there'd be, like, more movie parodies and stuff like that, but it's

2745
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:14,300
really not.

2746
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:15,300
Like, I mean, come on.

2747
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:16,300
Womb Raider means shit.

2748
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,300
That's like fucking grade school shit.

2749
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:18,300
That's art.

2750
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:19,300
That's just, like, stupid.

2751
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:20,300
Whatever.

2752
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:21,300
That title is...

2753
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,300
Alright, the phone's ringing.

2754
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:27,300
Let's get to it so we can get through some folks that want to be on the show tonight.

2755
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:28,300
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2756
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:29,300
Who's this?

2757
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:30,300
Hi, Rob.

2758
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:31,300
It's Rama.

2759
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:32,300
Hi, Rama.

2760
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:33,300
How are you?

2761
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:34,300
I'm good.

2762
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:43,300
I just want to know, are you becoming the official, how do we say, per slash adult material

2763
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:45,300
collector of the show?

2764
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:46,300
Sure.

2765
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:48,300
It appears to be Loki right now.

2766
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:50,300
How am I supposed to fucking answer that?

2767
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:51,300
I don't know.

2768
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:54,300
Like, what gives you that impression that I'm the official curator of all the adult

2769
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:56,300
collections on OLR?

2770
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:00,300
It sounds like you got a little more excited about the parodies that were being discussed

2771
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:02,300
with Loki about a couple of minutes ago.

2772
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:05,300
You're the one that does the show about cosplay.

2773
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,300
You should see how cute some of these costumes are, Rama.

2774
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:11,300
The costumes were YouTube appropriate, to be fair.

2775
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:14,300
To be honest, the costumes were pretty great in Final Fuck X.

2776
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:18,300
No, seriously, it was disappointing, though, because the female, like, porn stars were

2777
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:22,300
all done up like, you know, they're Final Fantasy characters.

2778
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:25,300
The male porn stars were like, ah, fuck it, we're just not doing anything at all.

2779
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:29,300
Yeah, no, they should have also dressed up and, you know, anyway.

2780
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,300
Commitment, dammit.

2781
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:35,300
Stoppy in chat says, as your attorney, I'm going to advise you to not answer that, Sky.

2782
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:37,300
So, I plead the fifth, Rama.

2783
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:41,300
Well, that's all fine, because I tell you what, if Mako-chan was awake, she'd be joining

2784
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:45,300
forces with you, because on our show, she's our residential hentai connoisseur.

2785
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:48,300
Can I come on anime jam session sometime to talk about pornography?

2786
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:52,300
I don't see why not, I think Mako-chan would be all for that.

2787
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:54,300
Alright, make it happen.

2788
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:59,300
I don't watch anime, but I do watch porn.

2789
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:05,300
Yeah, I don't watch that either, anime.

2790
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,300
You're lying.

2791
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:10,300
Alright, actually, one of these, I do need to catch, now that I have the Pokemon show,

2792
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:14,300
I keep meaning to watch some of the episodes of the Pokemon anime and check that out, so.

2793
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:17,300
My son's been watching it, and I've been watching it with him, and yeah, it's pretty

2794
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:18,300
good.

2795
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:20,300
It gets pretty dark in places.

2796
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,300
Does it?

2797
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,300
I'm like, I'm all shit, man, like that one where they went to fight the psychic one,

2798
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:28,300
she's like, yes, I'm going to trap you here and keep you as my toys and kill you and steal

2799
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:29,300
your souls.

2800
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,300
Wasn't that the plot of Return to Oz?

2801
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:32,300
Terrifying.

2802
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:33,300
I'm like, dude.

2803
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:34,300
That was keep their heads.

2804
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:36,300
I'm like, this is a little dark.

2805
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:40,300
Like, my youngest sounds like, I'm scared, I'm scared.

2806
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:42,300
I'm like, it's just a show.

2807
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:46,300
Oh, and Rama's probably sitting there going, literally, I can think of 50 different animes

2808
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:49,300
that you should be watching before that.

2809
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,300
More like 25.

2810
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:52,300
More like 25, alright.

2811
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:54,300
I'm actually watching anime right now.

2812
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,300
Are you?

2813
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:56,300
What are you watching?

2814
02:12:56,300 --> 02:12:58,300
I'm watching Danganronpa 3, the future arc and despair arc.

2815
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:00,300
Because of your obsession with the games.

2816
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:01,300
Pretty much.

2817
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:02,300
Yeah, fair enough.

2818
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:04,300
And so, and Shane and I actually just like, we're both watching them, so we talk about

2819
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:05,300
it the next day at work.

2820
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:09,300
Sometimes the obsession with games carries over an anime, it just happens, it happens.

2821
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,300
Well, it's the only way they're finishing the story.

2822
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:14,300
Uh, what, Rama, what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?

2823
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:18,300
I was going to talk to you about Magfest and all that goodness.

2824
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:19,300
Yeah.

2825
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:21,300
AKA VOGCON Winter Edition.

2826
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,300
Yeah, right?

2827
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,300
Yeah, definitely.

2828
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:25,300
Are you going?

2829
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:27,300
I am going.

2830
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:32,300
And I'm also, I got peoples that's trying to secure me at least two rooms for all of

2831
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:33,300
us to help out.

2832
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:34,300
Believe you me.

2833
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:39,300
Because let me tell you, I forgot that the rooms were going up that afternoon.

2834
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:43,300
I'm checking Facebook, and I get them, and somebody's talking about it, I was like, oh,

2835
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:44,300
okay.

2836
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,300
I totally forgot because I was working, and then I go to check my phone, and so I was

2837
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,300
like, I got a room.

2838
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:53,300
I started tapping as hard as I could on my phone to reserve a room.

2839
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:56,300
And then I was this close, I was like, I made one mistake.

2840
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:00,300
I realized I only had one room, I need to grab a second room.

2841
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:04,300
And the site wouldn't let you get two rooms, by the way, because we tried to do the same

2842
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,300
thing.

2843
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:06,300
And that's how we got locked out of the main hotel.

2844
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:11,300
No, that's, yeah, because it seems that you have to go into the full desktop view of the

2845
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:12,300
page.

2846
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:13,300
I go to that.

2847
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,300
Already gone.

2848
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:15,300
I'm like, you know what?

2849
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:16,300
This.

2850
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,300
You know what?

2851
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:18,300
They're going to have to do next year.

2852
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:19,300
They need to start requiring a deposit.

2853
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:23,300
I know nobody likes that, but it'll deter people from just holding rooms for the sake

2854
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:24,300
of holding rooms.

2855
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:30,300
But, I'll get into that in one sec, but thankfully I have friends who are traveling or going.

2856
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:34,300
I will know, probably in a month or so, I'll have two rooms coming to me, so I'm good to

2857
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:35,300
go about that.

2858
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:41,300
As for the whole deposit thing, you're right about that, because Captain Khan is in the

2859
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:46,300
same hotel, does the same thing, and every year the same people, bitch.

2860
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:49,300
They're like, I have never heard of a Khan doing this.

2861
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:50,300
How long have you been doing this?

2862
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:51,300
This is new to me.

2863
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:54,300
You could tell the people who don't read the website.

2864
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:56,300
Dragon Khan has insane deposits.

2865
02:14:56,300 --> 02:15:02,300
I had to pay a full night's stay in advance, and if I canceled after the first of the year,

2866
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:04,300
I'd lose half of the deposit.

2867
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:07,300
And if I cancel now, I'll lose it all.

2868
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:11,300
Rob, this is why I have a dedicated credit card just for hotel rooms.

2869
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:12,300
I don't have to worry about that.

2870
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:15,300
It's probably not a terrible idea.

2871
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:20,300
This year we are taking over the Travis Donovan suite, and we're repurposing it as the VOG

2872
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:22,300
suite this year, so we're going to have fun.

2873
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:25,300
It's going to be expensive, but you know what?

2874
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:29,300
I'm in an age where I fucking earned it.

2875
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:32,300
I can't be humble about it, Rama.

2876
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:37,300
I've reached that point in my life where I'm like, I ain't cramming four people in a Motel 6 anymore.

2877
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:42,300
I fucking earned a suite when I'm on vacation, and I'm a motherfucking adult.

2878
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,300
Rob, brother.

2879
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:45,300
What?

2880
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,300
Brother, let me tell you something.

2881
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:54,300
There are con-goers that are our age that still pack six to ten people in a room.

2882
02:15:54,300 --> 02:16:00,300
And if they can do it, God bless you, but I ain't doing that shit.

2883
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:03,300
Poor bastard that is stuck in the bathroom.

2884
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:10,300
No, look, I have slept on the bathroom floor of a Motel 6, and I wasn't even fucking drunk.

2885
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:12,300
It was probably E3 or something.

2886
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:14,300
I've been there, done that.

2887
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:17,300
My 38-year-old ass is not doing it anymore.

2888
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:20,300
I'll wake up, and I'll be like, my back, my back.

2889
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:26,300
There's a reason I used to play live-action vampire at Mobicon so that I would be guaranteed

2890
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:33,300
a bed when everybody else got up, and I could go lay down for my four hours of sleep before

2891
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:35,300
doing my go-for duty.

2892
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:41,300
Yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, being in the room at MAGFest with just my girlfriend

2893
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:42,300
was nice.

2894
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:45,300
We were also in the closest room to the con on the second floor.

2895
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:49,300
Yeah, when you can do it.

2896
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:53,300
Again, I'm sitting here going, look, I realize that not everybody is in a situation where

2897
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:54,300
they can do that.

2898
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:59,300
And when I was in my 20s, believe me, I did all the roughing it up in rooms and all that

2899
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:01,300
stuff, and I'm just like, you know what?

2900
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:05,300
I stopped going to Disneyland and doing all these other extravagant vacations I do.

2901
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:10,300
Pretty much all I do is cons now, so I save my money, and I buy myself something pretty

2902
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:11,300
at cons.

2903
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:12,300
Mm-hmm.

2904
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:13,300
And you are three cons.

2905
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:15,300
We've been being a certified con whore.

2906
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:17,300
I think I will hit that.

2907
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:19,300
We have Dragon Con in three weeks.

2908
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:21,300
We have Gamer X4 a month after that.

2909
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:24,300
We have Final Fantasy Fan Fest like two weeks after that.

2910
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:25,300
And now we have MAGFest.

2911
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:30,300
That's four cons in the next, what, through January 2017.

2912
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:31,300
Four?

2913
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:33,300
Damn it, Rob, you're such a whore.

2914
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:34,300
Yes.

2915
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:37,300
Wow, and this is Rama.

2916
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:39,300
Talk about pot and kettle.

2917
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:40,300
Jesus, Rama.

2918
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:41,300
I know, right?

2919
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:44,300
All right.

2920
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:50,300
Kossin in chat says, hmm, so Rob actually knows if you can catch a VD from sleeping

2921
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:52,300
on a Motel 6 floor.

2922
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:54,300
Just so you know.

2923
02:17:54,300 --> 02:17:55,300
Yes.

2924
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:56,300
Yes, no.

2925
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:57,300
Brother.

2926
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:59,300
Luckily, I did not.

2927
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:01,300
However, I want to point this out.

2928
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:09,300
The Motel 6, where I slept, and I will never do this again in my entire life, was on Hollywood

2929
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:13,300
Boulevard in Hollywood.

2930
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:17,300
I, and everybody has these dreams of Hollywood.

2931
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:18,300
Did it smell like prostitute on the floor?

2932
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:19,300
Glitz and glamour.

2933
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:21,300
Oh, no, there's prostitutes, that's for sure.

2934
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:22,300
Oh, yeah, no, no.

2935
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:23,300
Weren't you there?

2936
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:28,300
Yeah, I was there because, like, it was, we went with our friend Brad, and he had gone

2937
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:31,300
out for a smoke or something like that, and he ran into a couple prostitutes in the hallway

2938
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:35,300
that were, like, trying to hit him up for stuff, and he's like, no, it's cool.

2939
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:36,300
Um, but.

2940
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:41,300
When OLR does E3, we hang out with hookers.

2941
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:45,300
WhoreLR.

2942
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:48,300
Hashtag WhoreLR.

2943
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:51,300
Some day we'll have the parody movie.

2944
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:53,300
That's what we can aspire for.

2945
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:56,300
Maybe for our quiciniera, somebody will make a porn.

2946
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:57,300
Alright.

2947
02:18:57,300 --> 02:18:59,300
Obviously, you know, I know peoples, okay?

2948
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:02,300
We can get this shit done.

2949
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:06,300
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go so we can try to get more calls, but anything else you

2950
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:08,300
want to share with us tonight?

2951
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:13,300
I have a half a case of Sprite Remix and a half a case of Crystal Pepsi in my fridge.

2952
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:16,300
I didn't hear Surge, so I'm not interested.

2953
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:17,300
I want Surge.

2954
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:18,300
Save me some.

2955
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:20,300
And Josta needs to come back.

2956
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:26,300
And Rama, I was going to say, you probably already know this, but call that hotel every

2957
02:19:26,300 --> 02:19:30,300
day until MAGFest, because people are going to cancel those rooms.

2958
02:19:30,300 --> 02:19:34,300
And if I do that, they're going to tell me to refer back to the booking system, so like

2959
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:35,300
I said, I'm on this.

2960
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:37,300
I've been doing this shit for almost 20 years.

2961
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:38,300
I got you, fam.

2962
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:39,300
I got you.

2963
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:40,300
Alright.

2964
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:41,300
Thanks for looking out, bro.

2965
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:45,300
By the way, apparently the cheapest level of MAGFest tickets are already gone.

2966
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:50,300
I just heard that as a few minutes ago, because our group guy was still waiting to hear back

2967
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:52,300
on the final count, so we missed it.

2968
02:19:52,300 --> 02:19:56,300
So, and now we're kind of sitting here going, well, god damn it, you know, so we're going

2969
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:59,300
to have to make a move on that really soon, so it looks like MAGFest may sell out this

2970
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:00,300
year.

2971
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:02,300
MAGFest never sells out.

2972
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:04,300
They're going to keep selling and so on and so forth.

2973
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:07,300
No, they sold out during the con last year.

2974
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:09,300
Well, shit, look.

2975
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:13,300
That place can handle at least 15,000 people, so you know, hey.

2976
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:14,300
Yeah, I know.

2977
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:15,300
I know.

2978
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:17,300
It's, but move sooner rather than later.

2979
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:19,300
Alright, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you.

2980
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:20,300
Hey, no problem.

2981
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,300
Stay fabulous, brother.

2982
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:22,300
I will.

2983
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:23,300
Stay black.

2984
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:24,300
I'll try.

2985
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:25,300
Alright, bye.

2986
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:26,300
Bye.

2987
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:27,300
Alright.

2988
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:28,300
Did you say stay black?

2989
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:29,300
It's an inside joke.

2990
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,300
Okay.

2991
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:31,300
Something that Dan says.

2992
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:35,300
Look, for those that think I'm being like insensitive or rude, it's like, one day, for

2993
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:42,300
those that don't know the joke, one day Rama called in and Rama said something like that,

2994
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:50,300
like, stay whatever, brother, and Dan was like, stay black, and it just turned into

2995
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:53,300
this hilarious thing, and we all had a laugh at it, and Rama thinks it's funny.

2996
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:55,300
We all think it's funny, so.

2997
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:58,300
If you don't think it's funny, I'm sorry.

2998
02:20:58,300 --> 02:20:59,300
Next call.

2999
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:00,300
Hi, you're on Order of Songs Radio.

3000
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:01,300
Who's this?

3001
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:02,300
Yeah, what's up?

3002
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:03,300
This is Kaijuto.

3003
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:04,300
Hey, Kaijuto, what's up?

3004
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:06,300
First, I just wanted to let you know, I heard you earlier.

3005
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:10,300
I've been busy, so I haven't been able to, like, really listen to the show, and I think

3006
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:17,300
I heard you mention that you might be taking away your pre-order for the PlayStation VR,

3007
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:19,300
because you're not sure about the new, right?

3008
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:21,300
You said something like that, right?

3009
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,300
Yep, I did.

3010
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:30,300
Yeah, I think somewhere, Sony confirmed that the VR and the new PlayStation are gonna be

3011
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:34,300
like, kind of like separate from each other, like, you'll probably be able to use the VR

3012
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:39,300
sometime later in the future, but they really do intend for it to run on the PlayStation

3013
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:42,300
that we have right now, so you don't really have to worry too much.

3014
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:49,300
Well, that's refreshing to hear, so I do, I get a little nervous sometimes with what

3015
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:54,300
they say versus what actually happens when things hit the streets, but I also realize

3016
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:58,300
if I want to get a PlayStation VR, I'm gonna need to be one of those people that takes

3017
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:59,300
the plunge.

3018
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:02,300
I think, Kaijuto, at the end of the day, I'm gonna stick with my pre-order, and I'm probably

3019
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:06,300
gonna get it, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I haven't thought about canceling it.

3020
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:11,300
But, hey, there's the rumor, I think that they're gonna add VR support to No Man's Sky,

3021
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:12,300
which would be pretty awesome.

3022
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:16,300
That would be fucking rad, actually, and No Man's Sky is the type of game that I think

3023
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:19,300
could do it with, I mean, I don't know about the space flight, that's the only thing I

3024
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:23,300
worry about is that the space flight could be a little barfy, but I think maybe if they

3025
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:27,300
tune some things and, like, you don't run into a space station and start spinning 360s

3026
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:31,300
and stuff, I think if they can tune some of that down, it might actually be really awesome.

3027
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:33,300
I would love to play No Man's Sky in VR.

3028
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,300
Yeah, it's funny that you say that, because that's what I was calling about, I was calling

3029
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:40,300
about No Man's Sky, and I was streaming the game for a friend of mine, and I told her

3030
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:44,300
that very thing, I was like, you know what, I think they should put this in VR, but I

3031
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:48,300
don't know how well it would work, but I'm just calling to say that I have it on the

3032
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:51,300
PlayStation 4, and I absolutely love the game.

3033
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:53,300
It's, like, one of my favorite games right now.

3034
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:55,300
It's probably my game of the year.

3035
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:56,300
I'm, like, really enjoying it.

3036
02:22:56,300 --> 02:22:59,300
I know that it's been getting a lot of heat online, because people were expecting it to

3037
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:05,300
be one thing that it wasn't, but I went in there with no expectations, and basically

3038
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:11,300
what it is is, like, a part space simulator, part survival game, with some exploration

3039
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:12,300
in it.

3040
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:16,300
You know, it's not, like, this big, heavy, action-packed, you know, adventure game, and

3041
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:18,300
that's not what I was looking for, so I'm really enjoying it.

3042
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:21,300
Yeah, actually, and since you missed earlier in the show, just to kind of summarize without

3043
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:25,300
restating what I said, I also have been playing No Man's Sky, and I find that I really, we

3044
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:28,300
agree on this one, Kaijuto, I really enjoy it as well.

3045
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:32,300
I, and it's, for me, it's a little harder to put my finger on, like, I'm not sure why

3046
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:38,300
I keep drawn to this, but I think it's just, I love the exploration fact, and yeah, okay,

3047
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:44,300
so the planets have a lot of similar-ish looking creatures, but there's just enough differentiation

3048
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:49,300
and just enough subtle, the story pushing forward every time I find a new building that

3049
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:52,300
I still am inspired to move forward.

3050
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:57,300
Like, it's just enough, and I realize it's not for everybody, but I'm so into it right

3051
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,300
now.

3052
02:23:58,300 --> 02:24:02,300
Yeah, what about the fact that, like, the game really doesn't hold your hand, like,

3053
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:06,300
you know, there's some walkthrough to it, but at the same time, it kind of forces you

3054
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:10,300
to figure out what is going on, and I really like that aspect of it as well, because, like,

3055
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:15,300
when I, when I first played it, and I was, like, crash land on that planet, and I'm looking

3056
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:19,300
for stuff, and I really didn't know what the heck I was doing, and I just, like, took my

3057
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:25,300
time with it, you know, I started scanning areas, I started finding things, and I slowly

3058
02:24:25,300 --> 02:24:30,300
started to understand the game, just on my own, like, not going on Twitch, or not going

3059
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:34,300
to YouTube, and I like that, like, I miss doing that in games, because, I mean, we,

3060
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:37,300
you know, with the internet, you know, we get so used to, you know, right at the, you

3061
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:41,300
know, the click of our finger, we can just go and Google something, or look something

3062
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:45,300
up online, and, you know, that's how you get through it, like, I love the fact that I didn't

3063
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:48,300
have to do any of that, and at the same time, it still felt like somewhat of a challenge,

3064
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:49,300
you know?

3065
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:53,300
Yeah, most of it I figured out on my own, although, in full disclosure, I did stream

3066
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:57,300
the first night, because I was fortunate enough to get the game on Monday, so I streamed,

3067
02:24:57,300 --> 02:25:00,300
and some of the streamers were yelling out, or some of the, excuse me, the chatters on

3068
02:25:00,300 --> 02:25:04,300
the stream were yelling out things that I'd missed, I guess, as I was going through the

3069
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:09,300
tutorial, like, I totally missed that R3 could sprint, and that is such an important thing

3070
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:13,300
for the sake, even though it's limited, you can't just sprint everywhere, and that's

3071
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:17,300
important, you do have, like, a stamina thing, but I guess you can increase that with items,

3072
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:18,300
like, other stuff.

3073
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:19,300
Yeah, you get birds to do that.

3074
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:23,300
But, yeah, I mean, there were some little things that I missed, but yeah, trying to

3075
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:28,300
kind of figure out that game about the inventory management, and as I used this term earlier

3076
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:33,300
in the show, living off the land, because yes, No Man's Sky is very much about moving

3077
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:38,300
forward, but like, you know, you run out of materials, and you have to find more, you

3078
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:42,300
know, you've got to be able to keep moving forward by using what's in front of you to

3079
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,300
move forward, if that makes sense.

3080
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:45,300
That's the real adventure, No Man's Sky.

3081
02:25:46,300 --> 02:25:51,300
Yep, and I like the fact that you're not, you're not whoring items, like, I know, like,

3082
02:25:51,300 --> 02:25:55,300
games like Skyrim, you know, people go in their area, they just want to collect weapon

3083
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:59,300
after weapon, stock it up in their house, and never really do anything with it, like

3084
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:03,300
this game, you really have to, like, watch what you're collecting, you know, you have

3085
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:06,300
to, you have to balance the pros and the cons, should I hold on to this thing, or should

3086
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:10,300
I dump it to get this, because I really need this right now, but I might need that later,

3087
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:14,300
you know, I love that whole challenge of it, you know, and the crafting, I do have to nitpick

3088
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:19,300
a little bit about the crafting, because, like, it's not a bad system, I mean, it is

3089
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:24,300
a crafting system, but coming from Minecraft, I'm, like, looking for my crafting table,

3090
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:28,300
I'm like, okay, where do I go to craft this stuff, like, I didn't realize that in your

3091
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:32,300
slot, you have to, like, you have to craft within one of your empty slots, so that was

3092
02:26:32,300 --> 02:26:36,300
kind of weird for me, and I was like, you know, are they cutting corners, or did they

3093
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:37,300
just want it to be that way?

3094
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:42,300
Well, it's annoying, too, like, you can store, like, several tons of, you know, ore in one

3095
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:46,300
slot, but, oh, that chip, yeah, that's only gonna, you can't stack those.

3096
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:47,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3097
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:55,300
What was I gonna say about the, ah, I lost my thought about the game, and all this, nah,

3098
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:58,300
dammit, oh well, I'll think about it later.

3099
02:26:58,300 --> 02:27:02,300
Yeah, but, yeah, I'll let somebody else get in on the call, but I'm really enjoying the

3100
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:07,300
game, I hope, hope they keep it as is, because, you know, like, in this day and age, it's

3101
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:12,300
like, developers get so, ah, they get so scared, as once they start getting some negative

3102
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:16,300
comments, and they try to go out of their way to change the game, I swear, I hope that

3103
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:21,300
they don't fuck with this game, you know, like, they need to just leave it as is, you

3104
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:25,300
know No Man's Sky 2, do an online No Man's Sky for those people that want that shit,

3105
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:29,300
but leave this game as is, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.

3106
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:34,300
I will say, the one thing I do that does, and I said this earlier in the show, but I,

3107
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:37,300
the one thing that does kind of bug me about the game that I do want to get a little better,

3108
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:41,300
at least it annoys me right now, is space fighting, like, when the, when the Raider

3109
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:47,300
ships come, I, I just, like, the ship is not, does not control well for, like, a afterburner

3110
02:27:47,300 --> 02:27:51,300
type of fighting thing, I, I just, that could be better for me, um, you know, but it's

3111
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:55,300
Yeah, but at the same time, at the same time, if you think about it, I'm not 100% sure,

3112
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:59,300
because, like, I'm taking my time through the game, but, I think you can go through

3113
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:02,300
the game just being peaceful, like, you don't even have to fight anything, so,

3114
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:06,300
No, they, they, they do, they do rage you if you're carrying expensive cargo, so you

3115
02:28:06,300 --> 02:28:08,300
have to be mindful not to carry that, so.

3116
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:09,300
Yeah, I didn't know that.

3117
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:12,300
Yeah, so anyway, anyway, I'm going to let you go, buddy, but thank you for the call.

3118
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:13,300
No problem.

3119
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:14,300
Alright, bye-bye.

3120
02:28:14,300 --> 02:28:21,300
Alright, um, I think that is going to do it, I don't see, yeah, so, I think it's almost

3121
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:25,300
about nine o'clock, so we do want to wrap up, so, if for whatever reason you didn't

3122
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:30,300
get through tonight, please consider sending us an email, that would again be participate

3123
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:36,300
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash o-l-r, many

3124
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:41,300
other ways to participate with the program, but thank you guys very much for participating

3125
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:46,300
tonight, whether it be that you listen live or listen on the podcast, as we say at the

3126
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:50,300
end of every episode, tell a friend or five about the show, help us spread the word, because

3127
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:54,300
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we don't know that the voices are out

3128
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:59,300
there if they're not here, so, yeah, help us spread the word, a nice five star review

3129
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:04,300
on a place like iTunes, Google Play, wherever you found this podcast, it goes a very long

3130
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:06,300
way and we are extremely appreciative of all that.

3131
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:09,300
Hey, Mike, thanks so much for being here tonight and sitting in on the show, I hope you had

3132
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:10,300
a good time.

3133
02:29:10,300 --> 02:29:11,300
I did.

3134
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:12,300
Yeah?

3135
02:29:12,300 --> 02:29:13,300
It was entertaining.

3136
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:15,300
Thank you for filling in, thank you for doing PokeStop earlier today as well.

3137
02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:16,300
Oh, no problem, that was fun too.

3138
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:19,300
Yeah, if folks haven't heard that yet and they want to hear a little bit about Pokemon

3139
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:23,300
Go and the new Sun Moon trailer, check that out over at PokeStopPodcast.com.

3140
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,300
It was pretty cool and I was a lot more talkative on there, so.

3141
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:30,300
You were, but that's okay, you know, sometimes Loki's so loud, he just overpowers all the

3142
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:31,300
guests.

3143
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:32,300
Oh, yeah.

3144
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:33,300
I'm just kidding.

3145
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:34,300
Nah.

3146
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:38,300
All right, but no, it's great that you could be here and I know you listen to the show

3147
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:41,300
a lot, because I'll get text messages from you about something I said and I'll be like,

3148
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:43,300
what, did I say that on the show?

3149
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:44,300
You did.

3150
02:29:44,300 --> 02:29:46,300
Yeah, so you keep me in check.

3151
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:50,300
Is it fun to see here play it out live as opposed to listening on the...

3152
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:53,300
It's a lot more entertaining because I listen to it at work, so.

3153
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:54,300
Yeah.

3154
02:29:54,300 --> 02:30:00,300
And better than sitting by myself at work, listening to, you know, and like kind of talking

3155
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:01,300
to myself.

3156
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:05,300
What do you think people out there listening in Radio Land or whatever, what do you think

3157
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:10,300
people out there don't really realize about what this show really is live?

3158
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:12,300
The setup, I guess.

3159
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:13,300
Really?

3160
02:30:13,300 --> 02:30:17,300
I don't know what initially I thought it was going to be before, but like...

3161
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:21,300
It's like set your expectations and then lower them and lower them some more.

3162
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:23,300
Hey, I think this setup we have here...

3163
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:28,300
This setup here is one of the, you know, like we have space, a lot of space.

3164
02:30:28,300 --> 02:30:33,300
Yeah, no, like it's surprisingly comfy.

3165
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:35,300
Yeah, it's not a radio.

3166
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:38,300
It's not like you guys are like hugged up on each other, you know?

3167
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:41,300
No, that was the studio before this when we were at my apartment.

3168
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:43,300
I don't hug.

3169
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:44,300
I cut.

3170
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:47,300
So I'm over here for everybody's safety.

3171
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:48,300
Oh, okay.

3172
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:50,300
But you share chips, Brazilian barbecue chips.

3173
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,300
Aren't those good?

3174
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:52,300
They are pretty fucking good.

3175
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:55,300
This studio puts the lounge in Orange Lounge.

3176
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:56,300
Yes, it does.

3177
02:30:56,300 --> 02:30:59,300
But yet there's not a single piece of orange furniture in here, so we'll work on that.

3178
02:31:01,300 --> 02:31:03,300
There's a folder right here, it's orange.

3179
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:05,300
There we go, that's my observation.

3180
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,300
There is nothing orange about Orange Lounge Radio.

3181
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:08,300
It's a fucking lie.

3182
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:09,300
Except for Rob.

3183
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:11,300
Hey, fuck off, my beard.

3184
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:13,300
My beard is the orange in Orange Lounge Radio.

3185
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:14,300
Alright.

3186
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:18,300
Yeah, SG100Matt mentions the garage studio looked good though with the couch and the lights hanging up.

3187
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:21,300
The garage is the closest thing to what we have now.

3188
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:23,300
That's what you need in here.

3189
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:25,300
The garage had the 100 degree heat.

3190
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:27,300
You need lights strung around the ceiling.

3191
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,300
Oh my god, that sounds terrible.

3192
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:31,300
It was pretty terrible bad.

3193
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:34,300
I hate like, I hate streaming upstairs.

3194
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:37,300
It was an insulated garage, so it wasn't as bad.

3195
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:43,300
But Rob, you should totally do like holiday lights all around like the roof perimeter.

3196
02:31:43,300 --> 02:31:44,300
Like Stranger Things?

3197
02:31:44,300 --> 02:31:46,300
Well, not like that bad.

3198
02:31:46,300 --> 02:31:50,300
When you let me put a video camera in here, I'll put the lights up.

3199
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:54,300
You know what? You can put a video camera in here, you just can't point it at me.

3200
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:56,300
Just put it like right there.

3201
02:31:56,300 --> 02:32:00,300
And it should be like a surveillance cam view.

3202
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:05,300
It could be like Five Nights at Freddy's and you could switch cams and in like one moment I'll just run up to the camera.

3203
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:11,300
We gotta get the future. I gotta be on a quadcopter because that's not dangerous or anything.

3204
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:13,300
Let the listeners fly a drone around the studio.

3205
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:16,300
The whole time it's like, yeah.

3206
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:19,300
It's coming dangerous close to my face.

3207
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:21,300
Sounds great.

3208
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:25,300
Alright, anyway, I hope you had fun, Mike. We'll see you again soon, I'm sure.

3209
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:28,300
Thank you for blessing us with your presence. Do you have anything to promote?

3210
02:32:28,300 --> 02:32:31,300
This time, sure, might as well. I'll just plug my Twitter.

3211
02:32:31,300 --> 02:32:39,300
It's at mnav3. My Hearthstone one is the same, but just at HS for Hearthstone.

3212
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:42,300
Is that your Twitch channel too, mnav3?

3213
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:44,300
Yep. It's all my gaming stuff.

3214
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:46,300
Go get some Twitch followers.

3215
02:32:46,300 --> 02:32:56,300
Yeah, why not? And then if any of you guys are on Battle.net, if you go to my Hearthstone Twitter, because I don't remember my battle tag info, it's on there.

3216
02:32:56,300 --> 02:33:01,300
So, if you play Hearthstone, we can play some games and hopefully I won't lose.

3217
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:03,300
He's way better at Hearthstone than I am, that's for sure.

3218
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:04,300
Yeah, a little bit.

3219
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:08,300
Alright, thank you again for being here and have a great time. We'll see you again in the future.

3220
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,300
Thank you.

3221
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:22,300
So, going around to everybody else. Final thoughts. I'll start. My final thought is I think I'm going to play a little more No Man's Sky before I go to bed tonight and face the week tomorrow.

3222
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:29,300
And I can't believe time is running out until Dragon Con and there's all this other stuff going on over the next couple weekends.

3223
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:33,300
So, it's going to be a busy couple weeks, so everybody that knows me, please bear with me.

3224
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:38,300
But I'm very excited for Dragon Con. Very, very excited. Loki, your final thought?

3225
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:41,300
So, yeah, hopefully I'll work on my game if my computer doesn't fuck up again.

3226
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:53,300
Oh, and another bonus to that is I had my bookmarks in Firefox, which a lot of resources for things I was using to research my game engine and everything and all the pages I had open are gone.

3227
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:58,300
Because for some fucking reason they decided that, hey, we're going to keep all your files in the same spot.

3228
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:01,300
Oh, except for your bookmarks. Fuck those, we decided to delete them.

3229
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:08,300
Because they were there before, because I backed them up and now they're fucking gone. Because fuck you, we're Windows and we'll do fucking one.

3230
02:34:08,300 --> 02:34:09,300
No more porn for you.

3231
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:10,300
Fuck your bookmarks.

3232
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:16,300
Oh, porn. God, that's all in my head. I'm talking about like, you know, no one needs shit.

3233
02:34:16,300 --> 02:34:21,300
How am I going to remember Pornhub? That's going to be so hard for me to remember that website.

3234
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:26,300
I mean, porn is just dumb. Who needs bookmarks for porn?

3235
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:27,300
The good shit.

3236
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:33,300
Please. It's a fucking buffet that's ever-changing all the time. We don't need a good shit.

3237
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:35,300
A buffet full of crap.

3238
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:39,300
Alright. And last but not least, Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.

3239
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:41,300
Cheesecake.

3240
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:49,300
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We will see you in seven days to do it all over again. Good night and have fun.
