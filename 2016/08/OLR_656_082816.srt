Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, could you soon be playing PlayStation games on your PC and legally? Sure looks like it. Of course, there's always a weak slim PS4 if that doesn't work. We talk about this news and much more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight. Episode number 656 for this, August the 28th of 2016.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining you from lovely Sacramento, California Studio N7 with my co-hosts here in studio and all of you in our chat room around the world.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Live.vognetwork.com but here in studio by my side as she always is and would never leave me for an extended period of time. Not on purpose. Is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Bitch I brought you cookies.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You did. Oh my gosh. She brought me cookies. They're the best cookies I've ever put in my mouth. And I've been thinking about, you know, maybe I should try to lose some weight before like GamerX and Final Fantasy Fan Fest.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's why I'm doing this now so we have a month. Get it out of your system Rob. And then also, well, Alan has also, I don't know if you know, but he's lost quite a bit of weight and was, you know, was kind of humble bragging a little bit the other day about how he's lost weight.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've decided I'm going to call him Alan Aska. Because of the hair. And no listeners are going to understand. In fact, Alan probably won't even understand. Because of the hair. It's Alaska hair.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And if you are listening live, you can join our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and Rover Desk starting us off tonight wanting to know where are our cookies.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come get them.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Actually, when you visit vognetwork.com, I think we put a cookie in your browser.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But it's not one of those like skeezy kinds that you read about. It's just to remember like that you're logged into the site. So you can check in and get your points and all that good stuff.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hint, hint.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Check in.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right. Sign up for the, it's free. We don't spam you. We just, you know, like to be able to tell potential people to come on the network and partner with like look at all these engaged users we have because that does go a long way.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, all right. Say hello, of course, to Techmaster Loki.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hi.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm okay.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you, now is that Slurpee your dinner? Because usually you bring dinner to the show with you because, you know, we're right about dinner time, but tonight you just brought a Slurpee.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, because I made food like I had lunch at like four or so.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, I thought maybe you were on the Slurpee diet and I was like, that's my kind of diet.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Slurpee diet?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's not a bad idea.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't think I'd lose any weight from that, but very unhealthy.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It would sure be fun trying.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's like fast track to diabetes. Yeah.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I know, right? Oh my gosh.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So anyhow, here we are assembled in studio and as I referenced a minute ago, Dark Soccer is actually going to be taking a hiatus in the show.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She doesn't want to, but you know, some things are more important than OLR, including jobs that pay bills.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So Dark Soccer is going to be taking some time off for about a couple months.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to do my best to get, you know, some Sundays off when I can.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I told her she needs 20 November off.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, of course.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because that is like a DDR holiday.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And if we stay on track, that's going to line up with episode 666 of our show, which is going to be hilarious.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, the one thing is that I've already requested like pretty much the rest of my time off until the end of September for GamerX.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Right, right.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So it's going to be really difficult for me to take time.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Apparently, Alan says I'm going to I was offered my own podcast on TBS and I'm going rogue.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think there's a reference to Samantha Bee when she, you know, she kind of went off to do her own thing and she she's kind of doing better than the people she left behind at Comedy Central with all with all respect to Trevor Noah and all that Samantha Bee's kind of on fire.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, there are podcasts in the planning, but I would never do anything that wouldn't be vog material.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, I do I do like four podcasts.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I want to do another one.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
One of the podcasts isn't even on vog.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to do another one because I think that you guys need more of me.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, we can speaking of more of me, I'm having more cookies.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
All right.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You go in and you go ahead. You get those cookies.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go for it.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We are, of course, saying, you know, temporary hiatus, dark soccer.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I do want to mention, since we brought up conventions, there may be some folks checking out this show for the first time because of Dragon Con, which we're going to be at.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, I'm going to be at next week in Atlanta.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Of course, I think this is the 30th year of Dragon Con.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a very long running convention.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They get tons of I kind of I try to describe it to people as like Comic Con of the south, but without the Hollywood like it's like pretty much all fan driven.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And my understanding more and more, especially as I talk to more cosplayers, is that it's really becoming known as like a cosplay like like bring your a game of cosplay to Dragon Con and lots of great stuff comes out of that.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In fact, I did my first and only cosplay at Dragon Con last year, which sadly I'm not bringing back this year, but it was fun last year.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So I have we have that and some folks we will be you can catch me as a presenter at the Parsick Awards on Sunday night.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We're actually we have our pal at Pod Culture.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Pals at Pod Culture are nominated for their spinoff show, TARDIS interrupt us.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They are actually nominated this year.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's very exciting.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But we're presenting a different award, obviously conflict of interest.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We're presenting a different award at the show.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So that's really cool that we're involved there.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Our pals at Critical Myth and British Invaders are all over the TV related tracks.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Brit track, of course, for British invaders and some of the television related tracks for Critical Myth.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They have some panels.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We're going to be compiling all that over at VOG Network dot com in this coming week.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So you guys know where to catch us at Dragon Con.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's very exciting.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And then we will also be Dark Soccer.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Myself will be at Gamer X4, which I'm now hearing is supposed to be the last one.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I guess is I feel like they say that every year.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They say that every year it's going to be the last one.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then suddenly there's another one.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But regardless, I hope it's not.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But regardless, we have fun every year we go.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we're gonna be there again this year and we will.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In fact, they we just we just wrote the check this past week.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We will have a table once again where you can come say hello to us there at the festival.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And possibly get condoms.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I mean, yes, that's a whole nother side story.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Dark Soccer got a donation for Gamer X.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know what they gave her?

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
A big box of condoms.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Condoms, Rose. Condoms, condoms, condoms.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is why you don't go to like one of those family planning clinics for free donations.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So we'll be making balloon animals at our table over at VOG Network at GX4.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And then go fuck yourself.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Here you go.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest, which I know is a lot more niche.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But I do really enjoy Final Fantasy 14.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So I I made sure to get tickets to that event.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So I'm excited to go to that.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I know that's and if you didn't get tickets to it, you're not going to because it's sold out a long time ago.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But there is Mag Fest if you want to look forward to 2017.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So I have a lot of cons coming up in the next few months.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's like I've had a con drought and now I'm going to I'm going to be fucking sick of conventions by the time Mag Fest is over.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Although that's not going to be true.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I love Mag Fest.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I'm just very excited for the coming months.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So I look forward to seeing you all.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Anyhow, we need to get into some gaming talk.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to talk about our gaming weeks as well as what's going on in the gaming news.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But we like to usually start off with a kickoff topic, something to kind of get us started here with what's going on.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So, Loki, you've got a report here.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Could you tell us about this here about what's going on with PlayStation Plus?

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Obviously, this is getting a lot of social media buzz this week.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So PlayStation Plus, they've decided to bring it to the PC.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So along with bringing the service there, they're also bringing this USB controller adapter so you don't have to be wired into the PC with it.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Which is nice, I guess.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But does this mean we're not getting backwards compatibility for the PlayStation games?

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because it's like, but PlayStation now?

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah?

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You want to sign up for it still?

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Because I don't want to sign up for it still.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't fucking give a crap about it on the PlayStation, let alone on PC.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ooh, I can play the classic games.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, I'd rather just have the games I bought already work on it.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I wonder how that service is doing.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I wonder if the numbers are not where Sony was hoping for them to be, which might be part of the reason why they're putting it on PC.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But at the end of the day, even if PlayStation Now is doing very, very well, why not expand your audience?

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hell, it works for Netflix, right?

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why is Netflix so popular? Probably because it's on every single stinking device that's out there.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think it'd be cooler if it was on smart TVs or something like that.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think it'd be neat if it was on Xbox One.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So, since I never used the PlayStation Now service, is that the ones for just the old PlayStation games?

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, by old, we mean PlayStation 3.

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know, it's a PC app, and if they developed it for the Windows Store, which I really don't think they'd ever get past them,

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it could be a universal app, which they could be playable on the PlayStation, or Xbox One.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'd be interested if they had the Vita stuff.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, okay. Well, yeah, because I'm thinking, you know, one thing that Sony did try to do is that they have the Vita TV.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This is the PlayStation TV in the U.S.

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But it played Vita games, some of them, which was a weird thing to begin with.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But then it also was, hey, you can hook in PlayStation Now right into your TV, right?

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just because there's a few games that I think I would want to play.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But, I mean, we actually have our PS3 still hooked up, because for some reason our PS4 doesn't like our sound system,

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
so we've never been able to get it to work with our Blu-rays.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And we've got a really good Harman Kardon system in the house, so.

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah. I do like the fact that there's such a huge library on PlayStation Now,

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
so I do feel like, wow, I could catch up with all these games.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But in a way, I mean, one of the reasons why I haven't gone for it is that I'm worried it's almost overload.

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It would be like so many games, and, you know, I'm already bad when it comes to gamer ADD.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's like, you know, I play one thing for a week, and then it's like, ooh, shiny, something else is out.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I guess.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's part of the reason I'm almost happy that Final Fantasy XV got delayed,

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
because maybe I actually will get to the center of the game.

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When I've seen the PlayStation Now, like, they have the library available,

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
like, you can see what's available on their service, and it's not really anything I want to play.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And I just don't see the...

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It isn't everything. That's a very important point.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I think it's stupid, like, come on, you guys.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean, yeah, I understand you're really trying to push the service because you can see money being made on it,

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but no one wants it. No one wants that service.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They just want you to do backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now, granted, I understand the PlayStation 2 might be a little bit more difficult to do,

167
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
but come on, the PSP plays PlayStation 1 games.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't tell me that the PlayStation 4, this powerhouse of, like, a PC,

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
can't possibly emulate PlayStation 1 games.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like, a really shitty cell phone can emulate PlayStation 1 games.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I do feel a little bit like, as a consumer or whatever,

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that it would be really nice if I had a PlayStation 3 disc,

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
which I still have many PlayStation 3 games,

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I could put it in my PlayStation 4 and I could play that game on PlayStation Now.

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like, you know, clearly that technology is available,

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
so I just don't understand why I guess I can't do it.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe they're worried about piracy or something,

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
where people could fake discs that have the ID or something.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe that's what they're concerned about.

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's why I feel like it's double dipping.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But that's a lot of trouble just to play a PlayStation 3 game.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's a lot of trouble.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh, to make a fake game or whatever?

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, but a hacker's gonna hack, Loki. It'll happen.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No one's gonna do that for PlayStation Now.

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You don't think so?

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think it's worth it.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, it doesn't matter because it's not a thing anyway.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
For whatever reason, that's not what Sony's doing.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But, yeah, I don't know.

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's just like, I'm sorry, but Microsoft's kicking their ass

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
as far as backwards compatibility support.

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Granted, they don't have three systems to support,

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
but they're supporting the Xbox 360, which is, I think, pretty decent.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's better than PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And, I don't know, it seems pretty awesome.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, again, it would be nice if, you know,

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
even as a PlayStation Plus subscriber,

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
if I could get one or two games on PlayStation Now or something.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, here's the rub on that, too.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's like, oh, yeah, we made it.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We got an emulator.

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We are able to get these PlayStation 2 games to work on the system,

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
but you gotta buy them again.

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, you gotta buy them again.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's like, what the hell?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I mean, it's just greed.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's get to some comments from our chat room

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Ragenator in chat says,

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sky, it sounds like PlayStation Now on the PC might be good

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
for those like me who no longer have a Sony system for whatever reason.

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, there's people out there that don't have a Sony system.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Kind of interesting because that makes me think,

215
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
okay, well, maybe there's people out there that decided to go Microsoft only.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They're an Xbox household, and they decided not to go with Sony,

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that Xbox One was what they wanted, and so that's what they have,

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and they're not getting both systems.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What's interesting is that if Sony has PlayStation Now on the PC,

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
it's interesting how like Microsoft and the PC due to Windows 10,

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
how those are so tied together.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So it's almost interesting how Sony kind of fits into that dynamic now

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is that, well, I guess in a way you don't need a PlayStation 3,

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
but you still need a PlayStation 4 to play those games,

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
but you wouldn't necessarily need a PlayStation 3 unless,

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
well, the games you want to play aren't included in PlayStation Now,

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
which is also a distinct possibility.

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And let's also talk about the other thing about PlayStation Now is the cost.

229
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's $20 a month, or, oh, I'm sorry, $45 for three months

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
if you want to do it that way.

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's fucking expensive, especially when you have like Netflix and stuff

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that's like eight bucks, and this isn't like brand new games either.

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, I don't know.

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't know where the right price is because then I'm thinking,

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
well, Loki, a new game costs 60 bucks.

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And I know these are not new games,

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but many of them were 60 bucks when they came out.

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So in that regard, I'm kind of like, actually, the price doesn't seem awful,

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but maybe if there was just a few more of the big, big, big titles in there,

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
or heck, maybe if they started doing some of the PlayStation 4 stuff,

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because I would imagine it's capable of doing PlayStation 4 stuff as well

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
with the whole streaming thing,

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
maybe it would make the pot a little sweeter, I don't know.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So, let's see, more comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's see, Raginator says maybe the PlayStation 4 can't do PlayStation 1 games

246
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
due to the differences in chipsets.

247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, but if it can do PlayStation 2 games at this point,

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
they've figured it out.

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If it can do PlayStation 2, it can do PlayStation 4.

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's not even chips anymore.

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not running off of native hardware.

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's running off of an emulator.

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Come on.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean, the PlayStation Portable was not native hardware either,

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but that was able to run PlayStation 1 games.

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What is the deal here?

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't understand.

258
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And then SGA100Matt points out in chat,

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
they have those humble PlayStation bundles this week with PlayStation 3 games.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's a really good point.

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I haven't really looked into this week's bundle,

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
but would I necessarily want to get that

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because my PlayStation 3 isn't really hooked up anymore.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's some PlayStation 4 games in there.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I might still do it for charity, but you know.

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well, and also it's Capcom,

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and there's some PlayStation 4 games in there as well.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, that's good. That's good.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So there's a handful of those.

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But wouldn't it be nice if I bought something like that,

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
then the stuff that is on PlayStation 3 is enabled in PlayStation Now,

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and I can go play those things,

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
because that's the way it works on Microsoft's side essentially.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I mean, it doesn't stream on Microsoft's side,

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but the nice thing about my Xbox One is that every other week

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
it's I have this little present in my games inventory

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
of something I played on Xbox 360.

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because you invested all that money in,

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and they're keeping it with you,

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but now you have these other companies,

281
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Nintendo, PlayStation.

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, and PlayStation, it's kind of surprising

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
because they've been so good about this whole cross-buy thing

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
for like the longest time now,

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and now they're kind of going back on it.

286
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Well, yeah, these are different because they're on PlayStation 4 now,

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and you have to re-buy these PlayStation 2 games.

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's stupid. It really is.

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
S2100Matt says, yeah, Microsoft got blasted

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
for their backwards compatibility when the system was announced.

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Now they're doing it better than Sony right now,

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and I would agree.

293
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Microsoft is essentially kind of a model for backwards compatibility.

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Now, it would have been nicer if this was there when the system launched

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and if maybe it was more games at a time,

296
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
especially if it had been like a good big large chunk of them

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
all at once in the beginning.

298
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But you can't alter the past, so I feel like...

299
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
At least they're working on it.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
At least they're working on it.

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Versus Sony, who's just radio silence.

302
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Or wants you to subscribe for this thing for 20 bucks a month.

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So, yeah, I think I really think Sony ought to think about

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
maybe at least if they're hurting for PlayStation Now or whatever,

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
let people play at least the stuff they bought digitally on PlayStation 3.

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let them use PlayStation Now for that stuff on their PlayStation 4.

308
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And heck, maybe that would get the thing installed on people's computers,

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
well, on their computers now with the PC or their PlayStation 4,

310
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and maybe it would make them curious to perhaps jump in

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and spend the 20 bucks a month to get all the games unlocked.

312
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So, just something to think about.

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think if I were Sony, I would really want to give some thought

314
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
to this backwards compatibility

315
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and how essentially Microsoft's doing it better right now.

316
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So, let's see.

317
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Also in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

318
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Kossen wants to point out the Humble Bundle has Okami HD and Strider,

319
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
so it's worth looking into.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Strider was a PlayStation Plus game at one point, though, if I'm not mistaken.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So, I think a lot of people already have that, but it was still a good game.

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It doesn't take away from the fact that if you missed it somehow,

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
now is a good time to get it.

324
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's see.

325
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Also, Raginator says, well, I can tell you this, Sky.

326
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
If Super Stardust HD is on the PC version of PlayStation Now, sold.

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Take my money.

328
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I feel like that ought to be.

329
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
All the Sony first and second party stuff is on there, right?

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I like the PlayStation 3 things, yeah.

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, I don't see why Super Stardust HD isn't in there.

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean, double check, but I think, Raginator, you might have some luck there.

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It ought to be in there.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Is it going to be worth 20 bucks a month, though, to play that one game?

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, of course, granted, you're going to have access to a ton of other games as well.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, and on top of that, it's like, okay.

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Still, I don't like the fact that I have to still stream this stuff,

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
because I have bandwidth.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I mean, if my wife is watching Netflix or something,

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
streaming a game to my PC and Netflix, thank God I don't have bandwidth caps.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's just kind of unreasonable, I think.

342
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Just enable this to be downloaded to my PC, or not my PC, but my PlayStation 4,

343
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and be done with it.

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't understand what the big deal is.

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Fifth Dream actually linked us to a resource, a good old Wikipedia,

346
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that actually lists all of the PlayStation Now games.

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They have it also on their own site, too.

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Of course they do. I'm sure they do.

349
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But isn't Wiki awfully convenient?

350
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
As I think so.

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's see, and Super...

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Actually, I don't see Super Stardust HD in here.

353
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Interesting. I would have assumed that was a given.

354
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Unless I'm not looking for the right name.

355
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Star... There's a game called Stealth Bastard Deluxe.

356
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I've never heard of that one.

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's like the best name ever.

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, I know, right?

359
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, unless the game is being a stealth bastard,

360
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
it is not actually on the list.

361
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That actually kind of surprised me.

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Huh.

363
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Alright, JD also points out Wikipedia is often better formatted

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
than publisher websites, lol.

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, it's very low bandwidth, which sometimes makes it easier.

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's not so bloated as a website.

367
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks

368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and the types of things that we've been playing this week.

369
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And then we'll come back and cover some other news.

370
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, our gaming week, Stark Sakura.

371
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
How was your gaming week?

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Danganronpa 2 and Sims 4.

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And a little Pokemon Go.

374
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I've also started playing this game called Capitals.

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's sort of like a cross between Go and Scrabble.

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Not Pokemon Go, but the ancient game.

377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, board game Go.

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where you have to surround your enemy's base by forming words

379
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and you encroach on their area by pushing your word barrier out closer to them.

380
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So you take over somebody's territory through words.

381
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes.

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Sounds like your kind of game.

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, it's pretty cool.

384
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I've been enjoying it and I got to use one of the alternative spellings of yogurt.

385
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The one with the H in it because it's in the Scrabble dictionary.

386
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Very good.

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
JD in chat says, I've heard about Capitals.

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm mad it's not available for Android yet.

389
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So I guess it's not.

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Get a real system.

391
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh, stop.

392
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
All right.

393
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's see.

394
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
J.D. points out the developer also made Tiny Tower a while ago.

395
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, that's a nimble bit game.

396
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, okay.

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Go, that game was huge when it first came out, the Tiny Tower.

399
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And then they had the Star Wars Tower.

400
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Right.

401
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then they've done some other games that are really good, too.

402
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It has a very unique retro style to the graphics.

403
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Does this game have that, too?

404
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The retro style?

405
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's very simple.

406
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It doesn't really need any of that.

407
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I see.

408
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's just tiles and letters and there's really not much to it.

409
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay.

410
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Fair enough.

411
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But you should play it with me.

412
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll think about it.

413
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay.

414
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Apparently Neil played it for a while.

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, really?

416
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But he hasn't responded to me challenging him.

417
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes.

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He's running away.

419
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Sometimes happens.

420
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You sign up for a game and then it's like you see, oh, all these friends are playing.

421
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, wait, they stopped playing after the first week.

422
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
How dare they?

423
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How very dare they?

424
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That happens.

425
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
All right.

426
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

427
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So, I played more No Man's Sky and it's pretty boring.

428
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What a glowing review.

429
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I know.

430
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

431
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There's not really a storyline.

432
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's just like, oh, hey, here's this place.

433
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay, cool.

434
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You go to this warehouse, you'll learn new technology.

435
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay.

436
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's it?

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I mean, it's like, it's basically the same as what I'm normally doing.

438
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And seriously, fuck you, this stupid space combat thing.

439
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That thing can go fuck itself with like a spiky run.

440
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I hate space combat.

441
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I just like, I just say, oh, I'm going to get attacked.

442
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm going back to the planet.

443
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, but then they attack you once you leave the planet.

444
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's why I pulse jump out of there as soon as I get out of there.

445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Like, fuck you.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm out of here.

447
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You're going to attack me?

448
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm going to jump.

449
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay, bye.

450
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Smart.

451
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So, yeah, their combat is just, it's god-awful.

452
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's seriously awful.

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But I ended up on like another planet now.

454
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I jumped another system and it's like this rainbow jungle planet now.

455
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Cool.

456
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's kind of cool.

457
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
With lots of water.

458
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then what else?

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, I've been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go and then tap my Katamari.

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I've stopped playing because their game froze up, so I shut it down, restarted it, freezes

461
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
on the restart, cleared the cache, restarted again, still freezing.

462
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So, I was like, fuck, I got to just reinstall this thing.

463
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So, uninstalled it, reinstalled it, my progress is gone.

464
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm like, fuck you, Namco, I'm gone.

465
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Didn't you cheat in that game anyway?

466
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It doesn't matter.

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You had it coming.

468
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You had it coming.

469
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I did not have it.

470
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Karma sucks.

471
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I did not have it fucking coming.

472
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes, you did.

473
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No, I didn't.

474
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You got banned.

475
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You're the first person to get banned from Katamari.

476
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I didn't get fucking banned from that stupid game.

477
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Good riddance, though.

478
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's a fucking waste of time.

479
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is the second time in your life Katamari's given you trouble.

480
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's, no, it's their stupid programming.

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's because they assign an ID to your game through Google Play services or whatever,

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and it's on every install.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They reassign you an ID.

484
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Instead of it assigning you the same fucking ID that you had before,

485
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
like every other fucking game would have.

486
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Like, oh my God, if Ingress or Pokemon Go or something just stops fucking working,

487
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and oh shit, I got to reinstall the app, I load back in there,

488
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and oh, hey, look, there's my account because I'm signed into a goddamn online service

489
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that saves my progress.

490
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Bo, but fucking Namco Bandai, who can't fucking program shit, decides,

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
hey, we're just going to store all that locally to this specific ID.

492
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Bo, but when you reinstall the app, because it's going to fuck up,

493
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because our shit is fucking broken anyways,

494
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
because they're fucking ads that they have break the game when you try to run them.

495
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, and then they have free candy offers that never fucking work anyways.

496
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So let's add that in there on top of all this shit.

497
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So their buggy-ass fucking game that's constantly broken

498
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and fucking reassigns a new fucking ID when I reinstall it.

499
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So you know what, that's it, that's good,

500
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
because I was looking for an excuse to get rid of it, and I'm done.

501
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't think anyone on the entire internet has gotten us upset

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
about Tap My Katamari issue, Loki, congratulations.

503
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Wait, don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.

504
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Just tell us how you really feel.

505
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's stupid, it's a stupid game, so I'm done playing it, I'm free now.

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It was a complete time waster, there was no point to the game whatsoever,

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
yet for some stupid reason, I kept playing it, and I'm done.

508
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm done, I'm done, I'm not going back.

509
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You've had it officially.

510
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I had it.

511
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Unless they want to fix that shit, then yeah, I'll go back after it's fixed,

512
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
but you know, it's just, it was just stupid.

513
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Alright, anything else in your gaming week?

514
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No, that was it.

515
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Nothing more pleasant, nothing you had a good time with?

516
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Alright, my gaming week.

517
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, okay, so a few weeks ago on the show, somebody called in to talk about this.

518
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think it was our pal Brad from Pod Culture.

519
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So I'm going to actually recommend this one to you, Loki,

520
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
because it's kind of like a tap game, like one of those cookie-clicker games,

521
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
but it's not by Bandai Namco, so already it's okay.

522
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's called Nonstop Night, like Night with a K,

523
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and you play this little, like, it looks like a Diablo-esque kind of game,

524
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
but it doesn't play like one at all, because it's a cookie-clicker type of game,

525
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but instead of tapping the screen repeatedly,

526
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
your little knight just endlessly runs through the dungeon slaughtering monsters,

527
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and you can use buttons to do little skills, or what, you like buy different upgrades,

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and I don't know, there's other stuff too, but it's got that same formula of,

529
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
ooh, the numbers get bigger, it's addicting, and oh, I ascended,

530
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
so I'm going to reset everything back to one.

531
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's like the exact same fucking formula,

532
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
but it's more of an automated hack-and-slash type of thing.

533
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
No, I'm just not going to do it anymore.

534
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You're done?

535
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm just done.

536
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's too bad too, because it was a good time waster when I had a few minutes and stuff,

537
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and I was enjoying it.

538
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Granted, yeah, I exploited stuff where I could, but who cares?

539
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What's it matter? It's basically a single-player game.

540
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, so they have online leaderboards, but who gives a shit?

541
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's just how long you play the stupid game.

542
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
All right, so I've been playing that a little bit,

543
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and your talk about Katamari made me think of that,

544
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
because it's kind of a similar-esque type of game,

545
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and I thought maybe I'm sure Brad's out there listening,

546
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and I see him in chat saying nonstop knight would probably get a kick out of the fact

547
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
that I actually did go download the game, and I've been playing it.

548
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So let's see, what else have I been playing on my gaming week?

549
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I've still been playing a lot of World of Warcraft,

550
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
because I didn't really play the last expansion hardly.

551
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I somehow got a character up to level 98.

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I don't remember Draenor at all.

553
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So thanks to this whole thing with the Legion expansion is launching next week, right?

554
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So they've been doing these invasions in-game that feel a lot like the fates of Final Fantasy XIV to me,

555
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
so it's kind of funny seeing how the MMOs are kind of feeding each other now.

556
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But through these invasion things, you can really level fast,

557
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and I've leveled a character from level 1 all the way to 95 I think I hit today,

558
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
mostly through these stupid invasion things.

559
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What side?

560
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Alliance. It's with the Game Buoy guys.

561
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
All right, well I want to play.

562
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So do I have to start on that server?

563
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I think you already have a character. It's with the Game Buoy guys.

564
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, it's on our normal one. Okay, duh. Never mind.

565
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah, so I think you're already there.

566
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I've already got like a 97 on one, so I'll have to play.

567
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Maybe play with Captain Spike and Slidekick and then that's it.

568
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I just took a little break from it after I did all the Draenor stuff.

569
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, and so, you know, obviously I took a long break from it,

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and I don't know what convinced me to come back.

571
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I think just everybody saying, oh, you got to check out the Legion stuff.

572
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I was like, whatever, I'll check.

573
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And I think I hit a point in Final Fantasy XIV where I was like, I still love a lot about XIV.

574
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There's so much I really enjoy about it.

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But the deep dungeon wasn't what I thought it would be, I think, which left me a little bit disappointed.

576
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Like, it's not something I really want to grind over and over and over again.

577
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I thought, I don't know what I was expecting, but it's not, what they have isn't it?

578
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Typical gamer, right?

579
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I don't know what I, it's like every review of No Man's Sky.

580
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't know what I was expecting, but this sure ain't it.

581
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Well, let's not be honest. I mean, No Man's Sky was, I still kind of enjoy it a little bit,

582
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
but there's really not a lot there.

583
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's like, it's just not, the guy seems like, seriously, Sean Murray seems like a fucking second coming to Peter Molyneux.

584
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's like fucking Molyneux all over again.

585
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You watch the interviews again, you're like, oh my God, he's totally Molyneux-ing right there.

586
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Well, I'll say this.

587
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I have been playing more No Man's Sky as well, and I do still enjoy the game,

588
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
but I think the element that I enjoy about No Man's Sky probably isn't the plot,

589
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
but it's more that it's the same thing that I find appealing about Minecraft.

590
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's that very, like, zen, chill, just, I'm gonna kick back on the couch and play this very low-maintenance game

591
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
that's all about, like, you know, in the case of No Man's Sky, it's about finding pretty things,

592
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and, oh, I'm on a new planet, and let's, you know, ooh, there's a cave over here, what's this?

593
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Or, ooh, there's a building over here.

594
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like, I still just kind of get a thrill in the exploration side of things,

595
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
even though when I really step back to think about, like, what's the fucking point of this game?

596
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It's really minimal.

597
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well, even that, though, it's like, there's not really anything there,

598
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
because, like, in the caves, I know there's nothing gonna be there in those caves.

599
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The caves are pretty much useless, because there's nothing hidden inside them.

600
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
All the minerals that you can find in there, you can find out in the surface, so what's the point?

601
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And even exploring the plants and stuff, it's just kind of, all the outposts are the same,

602
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
like, all the, like, there's only so many, like, space Winnebagos I can walk into,

603
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
with the chairs tossed over exactly the same way every time.

604
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It's like, it's just very rinse and repeat.

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And there's not, like, any, like, ooh, this is really different than that last planet.

606
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Ooh, there's some interesting stuff going on.

607
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
There's nothing interesting going on.

608
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's just grind, and that's it.

609
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And there's not even really much to grind.

610
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And from what I've seen or heard of the ending, it's just like, eh, fuck it, we just, we're just not gonna make one.

611
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Ziba in chat says,

612
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The story is amazing. I'm not sure if that comment's about Final Fantasy XIV or if it's about World of Warcraft.

613
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm assuming it's about Final Fantasy XIV, and I think that is an important point,

614
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is that, you know, if you still haven't played Final Fantasy XIV,

615
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you know, even though I'm talking about, oh, I kind of, I'm kind of burned out on it a little bit,

616
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
keep in mind, I've been playing for, like, two and a half years.

617
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Like, you know, and you just kind of hit a point where you've been playing a game long,

618
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
well, actually, no, the game's coming out on its third birthday, so I guess three years straight.

619
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Sorry, I'm laughing because Loki's yawning, and his tongue is completely blue from that slurpee.

620
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It is so delicious.

621
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I can't help but laugh, anyway.

622
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Where was I? Sorry.

623
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Horrible when this is a radio show and you guys can't see it, but trust me, it's funny.

624
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Okay, so Final Fantasy XIV, if you still have yet to play Final Fantasy XIV, especially Heavensward,

625
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
like, I realize it's gated because you have to play through all of Realm Reborn,

626
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
which in itself is a good experience, but I know some people get really turned off by the mandatory dungeons.

627
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But, man, I'm telling you, the story in Heavensward is easily, like, one of the top three stories

628
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
in the entirety of the Final Fantasy series.

629
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Like, it's the best. For me, it's my favorite since Final Fantasy VI.

630
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Some people would take issue that I'm not giving seven or ten, enough credit, or even eight.

631
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But, for me, it's, like, seriously the best story in the series in a very long time.

632
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Heavensward is mind-blowing amazing.

633
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Just for me, the patches and the follow-up on Heavensward haven't quite been there for me like Realm Reborn was.

634
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm not sure what that X-factor is that's missing for me.

635
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Maybe the fact that they're only doing two dungeons instead of three, so you get really burned out on the roulettes real quick.

636
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I think that might be part of it. I don't know.

637
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Anyway, so, let's see, other comments in chat.

638
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream says,

639
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm on a Lisa Frank planet now, talking about No Man's Sky, full of neon rainbow plants.

640
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm in Trapper Keeper land. That's awesome.

641
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't know if I'd ever leave that place. That sounds amazing.

642
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So, anyway, William Murderface asks,

643
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Sky, did you play before a Realm Reborn hit about Final Fantasy XIV?

644
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes, I did, but not for very long because it was terrible.

645
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I actually, I played the Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 alpha?

646
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No, beta. I think it was just the beta at that point.

647
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And even early on in the beta, I was worried.

648
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I was like, I don't know about this.

649
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But I ended up buying the game anyway and I played it and I was like,

650
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
they've made some real shit decisions with this game.

651
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, 1.0 was really, really bad.

652
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I understand 1.0 got better after Naoki Yoshida took over.

653
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It was planning a Realm Reborn.

654
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That 1.0 got really good towards the end, but I wasn't really around to see that.

655
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But I was there in the early days of 1.0 and I just,

656
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
God, like the maps were awful.

657
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I don't know if you remember what the shroud used to look like.

658
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It looked like a piece of fucking graph paper.

659
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's what the maps were, it was awful.

660
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But anyway, the game's great now.

661
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
A Realm Reborn fixed everything.

662
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's truly a legendary story in video games,

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
just how turned around they made that game.

664
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's pretty crazy.

665
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.

666
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I haven't played an awful, awful lot outside those,

667
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
what are becoming mainstay games.

668
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But next week should be pretty exciting with Dragon Con and all.

669
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And they've got arcades are new this year at Dragon Con.

670
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
They've got two different arcades, a classic gaming one

671
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and a Tokyo Attack arcade.

672
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So they're going to have, really, my two favorite things are going to be there,

673
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
classic gaming and Japanese gaming.

674
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So I'm pretty happy going into Dragon Con this year.

675
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm excited to check it out.

676
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Well, I mean, really, what else is there?

677
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because U.S. gaming? Modern U.S. gaming?

678
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
U.S. gaming makes me think of like...

679
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's like Ticket Redemption.

680
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Okay, well, we're not doing those.

681
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
What I'd find in a Dave & Buster's, which, I mean, don't get me wrong,

682
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I like Dave & Buster's, they have some good stuff, but...

683
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hey, you like cell phone games?

684
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
What if we made those cell phone games on a giant TV?

685
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Exactly, exactly.

686
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Like, I can do without that shit.

687
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't need the cell phone games.

688
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Hey, it's Tap My Katamari.

689
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But...

690
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yet another racing game, Daytona, whatever.

691
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Just kidding, I'm not really shading.

692
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Raw thrills in the cell phone games.

693
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah, it's pretty much it.

694
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah.

695
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So, yeah, but no, you know, good point, good point.

696
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, what else is there?

697
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But I'm just very excited about that.

698
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So more to come.

699
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Anyway, housekeeping, don't have a lot for you.

700
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think I've said a million times we're not going to be here next week.

701
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
However, stay tuned to our Twitter at VOG Network for the network,

702
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
at VOG Network.

703
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then also stay tuned for, on our website,

704
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
because instead of this show being on next Sunday,

705
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
we're trying to set up like a VOG Super Show at Dragon Con

706
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
that we're going to tape on Friday or Saturday.

707
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
We're still trying to nail down all the details,

708
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but we're going to tape it one night and then broadcast it

709
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
where Bobby and this show would usually be on Sunday night.

710
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So you may still have something new to listen to on Sunday,

711
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
which would be really cool,

712
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
but this show will not be live on the network next week

713
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
because I'm out of town and it's Labor Day

714
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and Dark Soccer and Loki probably want to make the most

715
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
of the three-day weekend as well.

716
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But we will be back.

717
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You don't want to play Sims 4 for three days straight?

718
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
No, I don't get a weekend anymore.

719
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Oh, yeah, your schedule. Sorry.

720
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, my God. I do have Labor Day also.

721
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You know what you should do? Quit.

722
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Do you know what they pay me? No.

723
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm just kidding. I'm just giving you crap.

724
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, I hope you're able to enjoy what you can.

725
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Anyway, but we will be back in two weeks.

726
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And here's the great part.

727
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So when we come back, it will be September 11th,

728
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
which is Loki's birthday.

729
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yes, it is.

730
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So Loki's birthday show.

731
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And we're also trying to ramp up the interview thing.

732
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I think I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.

733
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't remember if I did or not,

734
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
but Dark Soccer not being here is going to leave some big shoes to fill.

735
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So we're going to be trying to get some more interviews

736
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
in the coming months.

737
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
How are you calling your feet big?

738
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Just, well, I don't know.

739
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Is that a bad thing if I call your feet big, Dark Soccer?

740
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't have big feet.

741
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Like for guys, it's a compliment when you say you have big feet

742
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
because, you know, big feet means...

743
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Big twat.

744
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't think you have your anatomy lessons quite correctly.

745
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
No, that's not the kind of twat I was talking about. Thank you.

746
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Wow.

747
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That's not the delivery I was expecting, but okay.

748
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Anyway, so how do you transition?

749
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
How do you transition from big twat?

750
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Easy, easy, easy.

751
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Well, I was going to say, since we're going to go on a tangent here anyway,

752
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I just thought it'd be fun.

753
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Have you seen, now I can't remember off the top of my head,

754
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and I'm going to look up while I'm talking about it real quick.

755
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Have you seen this thing that uses like an emulator,

756
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
but it's like a WarioWare type of thing?

757
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So it's a bunch of classic games and like little bits and pieces of them

758
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that you're playing all together.

759
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
No.

760
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's pretty awesome. Like, I saw this on Destructoid,

761
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and they had, it's basically, I don't know if it's like within MAME or something,

762
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
but they had like, okay, whoever is in first in this level of Mario Kart,

763
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
you know, after like ten seconds gets going,

764
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and the next level is like, okay, kill this other person in like a fighting game.

765
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay, next one is like, you know, defeat the other person in this like puzzle game.

766
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's like ten seconds of things are, catch the most fish in this like Atari 2600 game.

767
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Okay, that sounds rad, actually.

768
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay, where can I get this again?

769
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm looking it up right now. It's called Multibull.

770
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay, I like this.

771
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah, Multibull. It's a two player thing where you can compete against snippets of emulated games.

772
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Now, it's not multitasking though, right?

773
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Because that's a patent pending thing from YYR.

774
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
No, this is just old, this is emulator games.

775
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So like, for example, they've got, they have Wild Guns in there versus Excitebike, Super Mario Kart.

776
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There's some other stuff.

777
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Apparently, it's a collaboration between Bennett Foddy, who did QWOP,

778
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and Alec Thompson, who did Be Glitched,

779
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and they're going to be doing as part of a couple different festivals,

780
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
including XOXO Festival in Portland on September 1st, or I'm sorry, in September 9th,

781
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and some festival in Austin on the 1st.

782
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Alright, festival game. Sounds like fun.

783
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Alright, before we get into other gaming news for this week,

784
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
let me tell you about, so we got on a tangent when we had the big feet reference,

785
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
but obviously Dark Soccer is going to leave a space on the show that will not be easy to fill,

786
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
but we're going to be inviting some guests on over the coming weeks.

787
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You know, because we were doing interviews for a while,

788
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and then we just kind of fell out of it, so I've been really trying to get some people to come back on the show.

789
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So on September 11th, Gabe from the Sacramento IGDA is going to be here,

790
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
because his game Crumple is just about ready to go,

791
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
so he's going to tell us a little more about that game, and then we'll talk about that.

792
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Also coming up in September, Aethernaut is going to be here.

793
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Aethernaut is a chiptune musician that is going to be at GamerX4.

794
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
He was at the very first GamerX, and if you haven't heard Aethernaut's stuff, he's awesome.

795
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
He kind of combines the chiptune stuff with violin, so it's really cool.

796
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So he'll be here in September.

797
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And I saw, was it this week?

798
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It was set in the arcade not this year, but last year.

799
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Monsters and Monocles finally released.

800
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That just came out, yeah.

801
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I follow one of the devs on Twitter, probably the same one you do.

802
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

803
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So definitely go check that out if you guys see it.

804
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah, have them on the show.

805
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Have them on September, October. It'll be great.

806
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah.

807
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Alright.

808
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I've still been trying to hear from the people that are doing the Office game.

809
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I've messaged them and hadn't heard anything, but I'd love for them to be on the show, even when I'm not here.

810
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Even if you're not here.

811
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Even if I'm not here.

812
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm going to invite you to this party at somebody else's house.

813
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
By the way, not all these.

814
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Gabe will be here in person, but we'll be certainly doing a lot of interviews over Skype and so forth as we usually have.

815
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And I see in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, RageNator says,

816
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
if and when you need someone on the show to fill in, I'll volunteer.

817
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We're not really looking actually for guest hosts right now.

818
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Just more people that are designing games or gaming culture contributions, those types of things, to come on and talk to us about it.

819
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Because it's always fun to hear about what's going on out there.

820
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Besides just the AAA stuff.

821
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Obviously we're not going to have the devs of Final Fantasy XV on this show, I'm sorry to say.

822
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But everybody kind of already knows about all that stuff.

823
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So we like to dig a little deeper and talk about some games maybe you haven't heard about.

824
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So we'll have that to look forward to in a few months.

825
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
MXC in chat says, what about Cap President?

826
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Still working on that.

827
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So I'm hoping we'll have something to announce when we come back.

828
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
For Loki's birthday on September 11th.

829
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
In two weeks.

830
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Show on your birthday.

831
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
We have a lot of shows on big days this year.

832
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We have a show on 20 November.

833
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Sadly if we hadn't missed so many shows, 666 was originally going to be on my birthday.

834
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Which is perfect, but you know.

835
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Speaking of missing shows, we also will not be here.

836
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's worth saying on October 2nd we will not be here.

837
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That is the week of GamerX.

838
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So Dark Soccer and I will still be in San Jose and won't be able to make it back in time for the show.

839
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But we will be here the weekend of Fan Fest because my flight gets back at noon.

840
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So I'll have time to roll in here and do a show that night.

841
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That'll be really exciting.

842
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Alright, enough housekeeping talk.

843
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Let's get into some more news.

844
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Gosh darn it, Loki.

845
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So let's talk more about Playstation.

846
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And hey we talked about that wonderful Playstation now and how they're going to charge you $20 a month for that.

847
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Well guess what, there's Playstation Plus and that's going up as well.

848
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So they're going to be raising the price of Playstation Plus by $10 up to $60.

849
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And that's going to be starting in September on the 22nd.

850
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So if your subscription expires after that, you'll have to pay $60 to get it.

851
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And yeah.

852
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And apparently they say that the reason for that is it brings it up with the current market conditions.

853
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

854
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's just like, we want more money.

855
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Inflation, we gotta balance the check.

856
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Well, but here's the thing, it's one of those, is it really a surprise?

857
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Did you not see it coming?

858
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Isn't that what Xbox Live charges?

859
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It is, yeah.

860
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So they know they can charge it because it's what people are paying for the competition.

861
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Honestly, this is one of those things where nobody likes to hear about paying more money, but it makes sense.

862
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's also $10 a year that's like a lunch.

863
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah, it's really, it's not that bad.

864
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean, not that we're encouraging them to bump it up another $10 or whatever, but you know, it's not the end of the world.

865
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Especially considering you do get a pretty good value through Plus.

866
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, I stopped doing my Live just because I don't actually use the Xbox really anymore.

867
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I was doing that just to get the free games off there, but I don't know.

868
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Maybe if I get an Xbox One someday.

869
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I just, right now, I'm holding off, I guess.

870
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Crackdown's not out yet, and you know.

871
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It's fair.

872
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Forza Horizon 3 does look pretty awesome.

873
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It does look awesome.

874
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But it's just like, you know.

875
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And at this point, I mean, for me, I already have an Xbox One, so this is a moot point, but you know, for you, what about this whole Scorpio thing?

876
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And the fact that you know something bigger and better is coming, does it make you want to wait for that?

877
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And on top of that, no, it doesn't make me want to wait for that, but on top of that, it's like, well shit, I'm thinking about building a new PC anyways.

878
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I'll just get it on PC, you know?

879
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, true.

880
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
What's the point? So, we'll see.

881
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I mean, I don't know about the whole Scorpio and PlayStation Neos or whatever.

882
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's just, I have to see what the point is of those.

883
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Right.

884
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I mean, I don't know.

885
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Still worry about PlayStation.

886
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
What are you going to get there that you don't get with the cheaper phone?

887
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Exactly.

888
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm still worried about the PlayStation, you know, VR thing, because I've got to, my gut feeling tells me that it ain't going to run as good as you think it's going to run.

889
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I mean, it's just like, why have that powerful system that's going to support VR, you know, better?

890
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Bo, but not better, but it's going to be better.

891
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I was looking at my Amazon orders, like what I have, because I didn't want to pre-order the same thing twice, which I did.

892
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You might remember when I bought Super Mario Maker, I bought two copies on Amazon because I'm an idiot, right?

893
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But, um, so I want to make sure I didn't do that for World of Warcraft because I went on Amazon to get World of Warcraft Legion because they, they, they match the Best Buy program, right?

894
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Where you get like the discount if you're a Prime member.

895
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So I bought it on Amazon, so I get the discount because I'm not even going to be here when the game comes out anyway, because I'm on my way to Atlantis.

896
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I don't need to be online the very first day.

897
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It'll be server issues galore anyway.

898
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So anyway, I was in my history making sure that I hadn't already pre-ordered it at some point and I saw the PlayStation VR thing in there and I was like, oh yeah.

899
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I forgot. I plucked down a lot of money on this thing. I'm about to pluck down a lot of money on this thing.

900
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And then I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, well, you did just buy a car. Maybe you should just cancel this.

901
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Is the VR thing going to be really all you hoped? But I didn't do it.

902
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It's like, yeah, I mean, I didn't do it. I'm still holding on to it, but I thought about it.

903
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm thinking about it as well because it's just like, that's quite expensive. It's like $400.

904
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And what exactly are you getting for that $400? I mean, some gimmicky games that they're going to have out for it?

905
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I mean, it's just not a whole lot of like really big, you know, experiences.

906
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Rez is cool, but is it $500 cool? I mean, well, hey, you can play it without VR though.

907
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So, I mean, I don't know.

908
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You know what? I'm going to keep it obviously because once I get rid of it, I probably won't be able to get it back.

909
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
But I also feel like Sony kind of has a chance because we know they're going to be doing something in the next few weeks.

910
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You know, obviously a lot of these things are leaking out and we'll get into some other stuff in a minute.

911
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And then they're expected to talk about whatever this Neo thing is or PS4K or whatever.

912
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So I feel like Sony has a chance to get me hyped about VR again and really make me understand,

913
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
yes, I'm going to be fine even if I don't have a Neo.

914
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And here's the type of awesome things that you just aren't going to be able to live without that aren't just Rez.

915
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah. The other thing though that they also announced recently that's been, actually it's already live now, is the two-factor authentication.

916
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So, hey, if you have a PlayStation account, might want to turn that on.

917
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You know, it's a good idea, especially with all those FIFA hacks and shit out there.

918
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah, I know some people that are getting hacked and it's ugly. It is ugly.

919
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I've got, I switched mine on as soon as I heard about it and yeah.

920
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah. Two-factor authentication is awesome. I'm surprised it took them this long to get it.

921
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Microsoft has one. I don't remember if it's through the Xbox One though. I know I have one on my Microsoft account.

922
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So I guess that does apply to my Xbox One.

923
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I have to double check my Steam account to see if it's still, I think it does. I thought I had it through the app.

924
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Usually, yeah, usually with a lot of these two-factor auths, like kind of once you sign in once, you don't get challenged on a lot.

925
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's kind of what happens with Steam. Like as long as you're still on the same computer, same account,

926
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
it doesn't really ask you for it every single time. But once in a while it'll come up and say, load the app and grant your request.

927
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I just get a pretty frequently email saying, someone's trying to log into your account.

928
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Do you really?

929
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
But they're trying to, but it sends the email, you know, they have to do the email confirmation thing.

930
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And so they can't get in, but you know, they're trying.

931
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I get that all the time on Facebook. Someone keeps trying to get into my Facebook and luckily Facebook has an option where you can say, this isn't me.

932
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Like a lot of the sites are just like, ignore this email, you know, or whatever.

933
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Facebook actually has a thing you can click where it's, this isn't me.

934
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And I'm hoping it kind of reports the IP or something as somebody who's trying to phish into accounts.

935
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So, because screw you, it's my Facebook, not yours. Stay out.

936
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's like, why would you want to be in my Facebook? It's boring.

937
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

938
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
SHG100Matt says, if you have something that is two-factor authentication, use it.

939
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I get lots of people trying to steal my gamertag through social engineering.

940
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They send me the confirmation code.

941
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah. So two-factor auth is so important.

942
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Like if you're not using it on your email, oh my God, get signed up with it on your email because your email is like tied to so much other stuff.

943
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So important. You know what I mean?

944
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So, and definitely, you know what I don't, you know what I think doesn't have two-factor auth though that's kind of concerning is my pank.

945
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But I use like a completely different login and password for my bank than anything else. Like it's totally unique.

946
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah, my bank still does. They have the two-factor as well, which doesn't make any sense too.

947
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's like, you know, when I'm on my mobile app as well, I'm like, this is a little stupid.

948
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm on a mobile app on my phone and you're sending a message to my phone.

949
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Right, right. Well, somebody could be running it in an emulator or something, you know.

950
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Well, I, it's just like, I mean, come on.

951
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
All right. Let's move on with some other news.

952
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Talking about a big release that people are looking forward to on Sony as well as Microsoft.

953
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Sorry, I have to respond to this comment in chat. Fifth Dream in chat says, oh, Rob Roberts bank account is insecure.

954
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Free money, guys. Yeah, what's he saying? You can't get blood out of a turnip.

955
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You might get in there and be surprised. Fine, there's nothing there.

956
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
If you want to get in there and put money in it, that would be great, but I don't think you're going to find much to dig out.

957
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Anyway, a game that I think a lot of people are looking forward to, no matter if it's Sony or Microsoft, Final Fantasy 15.

958
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You know, Final Fantasy 15 has been in development for, what, ten years and now two more months, right?

959
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Well, DLC is something that's going to be happening with Final Fantasy 15 and I'm a little bit concerned how that's going to play out.

960
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Because there's a season pass that they're selling that's going to have DLC and there's going to be six add-ons that are covered by the pass.

961
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But then apparently there's going to be more DLC that is not covered by the pass.

962
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Apparently in an interview with Famitsu, director Hajime Tabata actually was talking about DLC and mentioned that there are DLCs planned out that go beyond just these six.

963
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And there's possibly going to be VR content as well, something that's not even just the Prompto demo that was shown at E3.

964
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Cooking recipes and costumes. And now I'm starting to worry a little bit, like, how much fucking DLC is going to be in this game?

965
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Too much fucking DLC.

966
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm starting to worry. I'm like, is the base experience of this game going to justify the high price of the game?

967
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I mean, it's a Final Fantasy game, so that expectation is sort of there. But the more and more I hear about this stuff, I worry.

968
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Now, granted, Final Fantasy X-2 also had DLC, and it was okay. The way they did it in that game, it was handled fine.

969
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So I'm like, okay, I guess if it's not too crazy outside of what they did in, sorry, not X-2, XIII-2. There's too many sequels to numbered games.

970
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
If the DLC is handled similar to the way it was in XIII-2, then it probably won't be so bad.

971
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But I just, I don't know, I worry about all this stuff. Like, okay, we have to sell a season pass and there's going to be more DLC beyond that.

972
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Costumes and recipes and all this other stuff. I'm like, how much nickel and diming are they trying to stink and do in this game?

973
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I'm a little concerned. What about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com?

974
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
sg100matt says, do they let you preload the DLC before it goes live? I have no idea.

975
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
5th Dream says, I don't trust season passes anymore. I don't blame you, honestly. Everybody handles it so differently.

976
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And 5th Dream points out Mortal Kombat season 2. And yeah, there was, you know, Mortal Kombat was another one of those games that had a season pass, but then there were characters beyond that, right?

977
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So this is like, or outside of that whole thing, right? So I don't blame you.

978
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So act deft encourages, wait for a sale on the season pass.

979
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Or wait for the game of the year edition when it comes out in 2017.

980
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I don't know if I can do that for Final Fantasy 15.

981
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Or don't play it.

982
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That's certainly a fair response as well, but you know, Final Fantasy 15, it's a mainline Final Fantasy game. I can't think of one of those I haven't played.

983
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm pretty hyped about it and I've enjoyed the demos that I've played enough. So, but I'm just, you know.

984
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I think all I played, like I skipped 12. I played some 13 when I borrowed it from you and nothing else of it because it just wasn't interesting.

985
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
12 is really good though. The HD remix will be definitely worth checking out when that comes out.

986
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I have like the collector's edition that came with the book and the tin and the nice initial game. I might sell it.

987
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's Balthier and Fran. It'll change your life. I'm telling you.

988
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I'll just go back and play 5.

989
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
They're awesome.

990
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
5 is the best.

991
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Really? 5?

992
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I like 5. Actually, my favorite is 3.

993
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I like the battle. Oh, 3 is one of my least favorites.

994
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
No, the Japanese 3.

995
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
No, I know. It's one of my least. Well, I would never say that.

996
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Because it had the big job system in it.

997
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You know, I know.

998
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Which I really thought was, it was a big innovator.

999
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I liked the battling in 5, but I felt the story was really weak compared to...

1000
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But it is, it does have the tough task of being sandwiched between 4 and 6, which are like the two best stories in the entire series.

1001
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So, it's hard to live up to that. But, I don't know.

1002
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I will say that, I mean, story-wise, I'd put 6 as being the top for a story.

1003
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Although, the story in 5 was really good.

1004
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That and, you know, playing fun fan translations where his name was Butt.

1005
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah. I remember, that was like the first big ROM translation that was out there. It was such a big deal when that happened.

1006
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Although, I will go out on a limb and say that Seiken Densetsu 3 was still better than just about any of the Final Fantasy games.

1007
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
To be honest.

1008
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And, to this day, still nothing official with that.

1009
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Nope.

1010
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
To this day. Anyway.

1011
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Alright, so that's the DLC in Final Fantasy XV.

1012
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I just, it'll be interesting to see what happens when this game comes out in a couple months.

1013
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I'm dying to see these reviews when they start coming out.

1014
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I just, I hope it's good. I hope it's good.

1015
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1016
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Well, we do have some more Final Fantasy news.

1017
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:44,000
In the wake of all of the Final Fantasy XV announcements and World of Final Fantasy, there is a new Dissidia Final Fantasy that's going to be coming out.

1018
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It's going to be not like the other Dissidia games where it was a fighting game.

1019
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It will be called Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia and it is a JRPG style game.

1020
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's done by Team Ninja, actually.

1021
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So, I looked at it. It looks pretty neat. I mean, for mobile, it's not bad.

1022
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It will be out in Japan later this year. Nothing about any type of international release, but you know it's going to happen.

1023
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So, there's a trailer out for it. I would say look for it.

1024
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's interesting. It has that whole sort of look that the Final Fantasy III mobile had.

1025
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So, I don't know. It remains to be seen, but then again, there's not much that you can do wrong with anything made by Team Ninja.

1026
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Except maybe Metroid, other Z, other M.

1027
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
That doesn't exist in my universe, so I haven't involved it.

1028
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I throw unnecessary shade at that game. Actually, I think it's better than most people give it credit for.

1029
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Unnecessary?

1030
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,000
No, I think that game is better than most people give it credit for, but it just wasn't Super Metroid. That's the problem.

1031
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
There is a Moogle in VV and Cloud and that makes me happy.

1032
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And what's his face with the tail?

1033
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Oh my god, Y'shtola's in it.

1034
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
What, they probably just bring the best out of all the... It's probably the same characters that show up in theater.

1035
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, I was actually kind of surprised to see Final Fantasy XIV characters in there.

1036
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Y'shtola I think is really big overseas too.

1037
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Yeah, she's a cutie.

1038
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

1039
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So, one of the rumored announcements that was supposed to be coming out in just like a week or so here on September 7th was this PlayStation Slim.

1040
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And apparently someone has one already.

1041
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
They bought it off of an auction site called Gumtree.

1042
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And apparently they've posted lots of pictures online and Eurogamer's even had someone come out to the location and verify that it is authentic.

1043
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So, it is. It's apparently... It looks much slimmer than the original PlayStation 4.

1044
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's all matte black with that kind of textured finish on it.

1045
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
They have a couple USB ports in the front there.

1046
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It looks like instead of having the touch buttons on there, they actually have a physical reset and power button, which is kind of nice.

1047
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And, yeah.

1048
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:27,000
So, I guess we'll learn some more about this in the next week here, but it's kind of bad for Sony that that...

1049
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
How did that get to an auction site?

1050
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
How did that leak out? I mean, that's pretty bad.

1051
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So, I don't know.

1052
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:43,000
That is very bad that something they haven't even announced somehow already exists in a physical form and got...

1053
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So, my thought is they must be pulling the old Sega trick.

1054
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And they're out here today.

1055
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And they're out today type of thing, which actually I think Microsoft also did.

1056
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Well, they did like... It's out the day after tomorrow or something type of thing, right?

1057
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah, that was with the Xbox 360S.

1058
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So, I have a feeling Sony is about to drop that one where here it is and it's out today.

1059
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So, that's how these things already exist off the assembly line and so forth, which in a way props to them for keeping it a secret this long in that regard.

1060
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,000
But, yeah, that's really not good that one somehow already got in the wild in spite of all that. It's crazy.

1061
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I'd be curious to see what the other differences are aside from just it's smaller matte black now.

1062
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I mean, it doesn't... I don't know. I like the light bar in mine.

1063
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm hoping that it still has that because I don't really see that on here.

1064
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't know.

1065
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I think they said... If I remember correctly, I think when they had it like posted in NeoGaf that someone said that there was like a power button like light on there that kind of changes color like the light bar does.

1066
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah.

1067
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
But the light bar looks so much cooler than that. I mean, I don't know.

1068
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yeah. No, the light bar in the controller. I'm very curious to see like what... Well, you know, the light on the back of the controller, you know, it changes color to go with the mood in different games.

1069
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You know, developers kind of change that, but you don't ever really see that unless your hands are kind of, you know, like can you see the reflect?

1070
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So, I can see why maybe they want to put it a little more front center where you can see it.

1071
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You know, now that you say that, I wanted... I thought I saw a picture of the controller and it looked different like that you could see those lights.

1072
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But maybe I'm thinking something else. I don't know. But yeah, I want to say that there was something else different.

1073
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah, they have a picture with the original PlayStation 4 and it's quite slimmer. I mean, it's got kind of rounded edges on it versus like the sharp edges that they have.

1074
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Yeah, definitely not as kind of sexy looking as the other PlayStation.

1075
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's kind of neat though on the back though, they've got like the PlayStation button symbols on there. It's kind of raising it up a little bit and the PlayStation logo.

1076
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And then they've kind of... As far as ports on the back, it looks like they've just got the... an HDMI Ethernet and what I assume is the camera.

1077
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Although someone I think said it was the VR thing, but I think it's the camera. It looks like the camera port.

1078
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And then just, you know, the normal power cord spot and everything. But yeah, I mean, they posted a picture of the box. They posted a picture of everything that was in the box.

1079
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I mean, and someone saw it, so I don't know. It's authentic. It's just like, okay, you know, what are you gonna do?

1080
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah, it's the real deal. It's coming, but we'll just see how Sony puts a spin on it and what curious thing they'll say about the fact that it leaked so early, if nothing else.

1081
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Let's see now, Bobby Blackwell says, a dude posted the picture of the NX controller too, then admitted he faked it. But this whole thing, didn't they have like a YouTube motion unboxing?

1082
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Well, yeah, he had an unboxing. He had the actual thing being played and everything. They had, I think, a guy from Eurogamer or Digital Foundry come and look at it. And so, yeah, they confirmed it's legit.

1083
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So if it's a hoax, it's really the best one ever pulled. We'll put it that way. It's the best one ever, if it is indeed a hoax. Props. But it probably is not a hoax. It's looking very likely.

1084
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:43,000
All right. Now, let's see if this ends up being a hoax or not, although I could see that this is probably a real thing. Duke Nukem 3D rumored to be getting a remake, remaster type of thing, which I kind of feel like it's already been.

1085
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I mean, I know there hasn't been like a true HD remaster, but I do feel like Duke Nukem 3D has come back up with the Steam port that added the multiplayer inside Steam, right?

1086
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:04,000
They had one with 3D models. I don't remember what that was, if it was a mod or if that was an actual version of Duke Nukem 3D that they've had. They've had one with 3D models before.

1087
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Yeah.

1088
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
No, I don't remember which version that is.

1089
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Well, apparently, a teaser site for a Duke Nukem-related announcement came up, and this was as a part of dukenukem.com. And, of course, it's a countdown, so you know an announcement of an announcement.

1090
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:30,000
There's a banner that says, Happy 20th Anniversary, because, of course, the original Duke Nukem 3D was in 1996, so it is the 20th anniversary. So, likely going to be a re-release or remake.

1091
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Somebody on Reddit, so, you know, big grain of salt with this, but I'll go ahead and say, apparently knows that the game is called Duke Nukem 3D World Tour. It's part remaster, part remix.

1092
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But, you know, again, take that with a grain of salt.

1093
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Well, that was out in the webpage. They found that actually within the code on the webpage.

1094
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So, hey, I like Duke Nukem.

1095
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And, honestly, as long as the first level's the same with the movie theater and everything, that's the level everybody remembers. Anything can be pretty much different after that. Most people probably wouldn't even recognize that it's different levels, like a remix or whatever.

1096
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
There was so many, like, fan maps. I think I still have a CD somewhere.

1097
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh, I had multiple CDs of those maps.

1098
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Like, the Duke Nukem game and, like, just bunches and bunches of... Wasn't there, like, Duke Nukem at the White House?

1099
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh, yeah, they had tons of, like, mods that, like, made it onto disc that they sold and it was just, like...

1100
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
For sure.

1101
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah, so the announcement looks like it was almost five days away, so that would make it, what?

1102
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Just in time for Penny Arcade Expo.

1103
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Yeah, that seems appropriate.

1104
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So it makes a lot of sense, right? Because, you know, even though we've been talking a lot about Dragon Con on this show, you know, obviously there's a lot of people that are interested in Penny Arcade Expo, which is happening in Seattle at the same time.

1105
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So that would line up perfectly with it, especially if they do happen to have this game at the event there, so...

1106
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And really, you know, when you have all those, like, blunders of different developers having strippers and stuff at their parties, this is really the only game that's appropriate for that.

1107
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It was part of the game.

1108
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It was part of the game. It was part of the ambiance. Alright, anyway.

1109
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
The strippers and pick-ups.

1110
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Let's go to something completely different with Dark Soccer, and I mean different.

1111
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, sometimes you need to just sit back and look at the mundanity of life to just realize that all of your struggles were really not worth it in the end.

1112
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And so that's where this game comes in.

1113
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Are you saying, Dark Soccer, and in the end, it doesn't even matter.

1114
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You know, I call that the R-Type song because it's like playing R-Type. In the end, it doesn't really matter.

1115
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So there is a game, the ultimate of boredom, called Un-Wigi.

1116
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It is a Flash browser game.

1117
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And it's really just...

1118
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Not really a whole lot of much other than Luigi wandering around, smoking a cigarette, realizing that it's all gone horribly wrong.

1119
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:24,000
So basically, he's just depressed. He lights up a cigarette and walks around the Mushroom Kingdom.

1120
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Just giving these really sad observations and realizing that he's too old to change his ways.

1121
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And I'm going to read this quote here. This is great.

1122
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I looked down at Bowser's broken body and saw in it a map of a broken world.

1123
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And then you press another button and you get it all tastes of mushroom, of fungus, of molder, of damp ash.

1124
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It's just Un-Wii. Un-Wigi.

1125
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Sounds so fucking hipster.

1126
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I know, it's great.

1127
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It's got a lot of text. It's a lot of reading because apparently a very bored Luigi has a lot of observations about the fucked up Mushroom Kingdom.

1128
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
This piece is called Un-Wigi.

1129
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I like the picture here. I asked her, why do you stay with him? She laughed. The kind of laugh so empty it's less funny than a sob.

1130
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Wow, alright. Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are real and coming to a store shelf or a digital shelf near you. Loki.

1131
01:08:34,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Alright, so this week we have Armello coming out on Xbox One, Assault Suit Lanos on PC, Attack on Titan on PC, Playstation 4, Playstation 3, Playstation Vita and Xbox One, Champions of Anteria on PC, Hatsune Miku Project Diva X on Playstation 4 and Vita, God Eater Resurrection on PC, God Eater 2 Rage Burst on PC, Playstation 4 and Vita,

1132
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:27,000
One Way Trip on Playstation 4, Resident Evil 4, I'm assuming the remaster on Playstation 4 and Xbox One, Strike Vector EX on Playstation 4, The Final Station on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One, The Turing Test on PC and Xbox One, Vernon on PS4 and Xbox One,

1133
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:54,000
World of Warcraft Legion on PC and Mac, Shiny on PC and Xbox One, Taheria Echoes of the Astral Empire on PC, Mac and Linux, Earthlock Festival of Magic on PC, Mac and Xbox One, Luminous Puzzle and Music on iOS and Android, and finally One Piece Burning Blood on PC.

1134
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That was a busy week.

1135
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It's just a lot of small stuff.

1136
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, but still, there's a lot of stuff coming up. But then again, Labor Day. I feel like the week of Labor Day is always kind of like a little big week. It's a mini big week. It's not going to be Black Friday big, but it's, you know, big.

1137
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, actually the releases for the week after, it's not much.

1138
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah, because that's when all the kids are back in school at that point. I mean, I know kids are starting school around now, end of August, but Labor Day is like the end.

1139
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:36,000
They have, for example, the week after next, Just Sing, which is that new Ubisoft singing game, and the Tomorrow Children. Remember that weird-ass Russian Playstation 4 game?

1140
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Yeah, that's coming out.

1142
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Alright, let's see. We've got The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Game of the Year Edition coming to Japan on September the 1st. That is on the Playstation 4.

1143
01:10:48,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So not quite as busy of a week in Japan, because that's really the biggest thing on Playstation 4. Wii U, of course, is kind of, it's pretty dry right now in Japan as well as over here.

1144
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:17,000
But looking at the Nintendo 3DS to see what's out of there, also empty until the 15th of September. But they do still get releases on the Vita, and there's one this week. It's Barani Kaku Sarishi Veriti comes out this week.

1145
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It looks like a French Revolution anime type of thing. You've got, you know, the chick with the poofy hair and the fan and the guy with the...

1146
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Wait, wait, wait. What was the title again?

1147
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It's probably based on an anime that I just, I'm not aware of.

1148
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
The Rose of Versailles?

1149
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, it could be. Yeah, based on the art, there's a lot of roses in it.

1150
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Yeah, that is an anime actually based off of a real historical figure of a woman who would dress in men's clothes and duel people.

1151
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Well, I would think that this is probably some type of port of, or like an adventure game based on that. There's no description for this or anything available, so I have no idea what's all in it, if it's a visual novel or what it is.

1152
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Rose of Versailles is a pretty neat series.

1153
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah, listen, I like the art style. It's very cool. But a little bit slower in Japan this week, comparative to what Loki just had. But of course, Labor Day is an issue over there.

1154
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Dark Sakura.

1155
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:21,000
This is pretty slow in the UK, though. On the 26th, we have Attack on Titan, and we have King of Fighters XIV on Playstation 4.

1156
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Wait, it's already the 28th. Why am I doing the 26th?

1157
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Okay, on the 30th, we have Armello for Xbox One, and the Turing Test for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.

1158
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
On the 31st, we have RunGunJumpGun on Mac and PC.

1159
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
That's pretty much it. I already looked at September, and nope.

1160
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
That's it.

1161
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

1162
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Alright, it's that time of the episode where we have to talk about NX rumors, because there's always NX rumors, and let's get into it, I guess.

1163
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So this is coming from Emily Rogers, who has kind of supplied some more of the NX rumors before on Twitter.

1164
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So, kind of just going over some of the stuff. So, for example, it's basically saying that there's some truth to the NX having detachable controllers and supporting force feedback and motion controls.

1165
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:31,000
The NX prototype had a 6.2 inch 720p multi-touch touchscreen, and unknown if the final product size will be larger or smaller than the prototype.

1166
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And then it says the prototype for the dock station has USB ports. I heard two USB ports, but I don't know if this number will change in the final product.

1167
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And that is all the information that you have this week, speculate away.

1168
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
We still don't know what the fuck this thing is yet, and I think it's stupid at this point.

1169
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So the one reason I've heard before that Nintendo doesn't want to announce it early because they're afraid that someone's going to copy, but honestly, they're going to copy it anyways if they wanted to.

1170
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And, I mean, it's going to take a lot longer than six months to develop a console.

1171
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I think at this point, it's like, you gotta announce it so that at least people know what the hell it is to get excited about it.

1172
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Because right now, it's like, I don't know what the hell this is, and I'm not excited about it.

1173
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Well, maybe you'll be able to get excited very soon because, again, the rumor's building that this is going to be announced in September.

1174
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
This comes from the deputy news editor at Eurogamer who's answering some questions on Twitter.

1175
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
But again, what's Eurogamer going to know about this officially?

1176
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I mean, I suppose they could have been invited to something that's under embargo, but that would be about it, all I can think of.

1177
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
But anyway, it was asked about when the NX would be revealed, and it was interesting.

1178
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
The phrasing used was, haven't heard it's changed from September, but I think info is now on tighter lockdown.

1179
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So I think that's what people are reading into is the fact that he said changed, like something has already been in stone or what have you.

1180
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Also, expected to be that there's going to be a Nintendo Direct for fans at the same time that there is an event for the press that occurs.

1181
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And that really, honestly, it all winds up with the whole right before Tokyo Game Show theory that I threw out there months ago,

1182
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and I'm sure that's what we're walking towards right now, so it's really just a matter of some type of official confirmation,

1183
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
which may be Penny Arcade Expo, if they want to do an announcement of an announcement, that's a great time to do it.

1184
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
So maybe we'll know something by Labor Day.

1185
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:44,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bike.

1186
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Anyhow, let's travel back to when things were a little simpler.

1187
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We're going to go back in time to when, you know what, if you wanted the latest and greatest in the rumors, you got them out of a magazine.

1188
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
If you were lucky.

1189
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
If you were lucky, if you could get your parents to buy it for you.

1190
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
It's a classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1191
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
hey, pick up your copy of GamePro and read about this new game.

1192
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Yeah.

1193
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1194
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It's actually a game that was inspired by having watched another review of it.

1195
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It's this guy who does side-by-sides of different versions.

1196
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And I felt this one had to be shared with everybody because it's so freaking awesome.

1197
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Hellfire.

1198
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Is that not a great name for a game, Hellfire?

1199
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's a good name.

1200
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Anyway, it came out in 1989.

1201
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It's by Toaplan, which do you know what else they did?

1202
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Zeroing.

1203
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Oh, okay.

1204
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Same company.

1205
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
They also did Snow Brothers, for the record.

1206
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Okay.

1207
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
It was published by Taito.

1208
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
The game came out in the arcade, and then it was ported to the Mega Drive slash Genesis,

1209
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
and the PC Engine CD system as Hellfire S.

1210
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It actually has all kinds of interesting changes, by the way, for the PC Engine version,

1211
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,000
because they changed some of the story to where instead of having a character named Lancer,

1212
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
who was the main pilot, it's a female character named Kaoru.

1213
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And this is the soundtrack for it right here.

1214
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It was like many of the PC Engine CD games where it was all remixed CD audio music and really good.

1215
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So the game is where there is great peace.

1216
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Everything is nice and peaceful because, yay, humanity.

1217
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Woohoo!

1218
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And then this stuff called Black Nebula appears and then tries to take over the latest galaxy

1219
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
and that humanity is colonized, and it's being led by this force called Super mech,

1220
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
who's a robot dictator.

1221
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And this is actually, Dan and I now have a new in-joke because of this game.

1222
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It's Space Egypt.

1223
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
In this game, there is a level that is fucking Space Egypt.

1224
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So, anyway.

1225
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So is that like Stargate?

1226
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Yeah, well, I didn't make that idea, but yeah, I guess it would kind of be.

1227
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Like you go by pyramids and shit in space.

1228
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And, you know, people with Pharaoh masks in space.

1229
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I guess if you can have Moet heads and, you know, Grodius and...

1230
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So maybe we should leave Space Egypt to Toaplan and Easter Island to Konami.

1231
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:39,000
At any rate, in the arcade and Mega Drive version, Lancer gets back to Earth and everything is great.

1232
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:46,000
But Kaoru in the PC Engine version blows herself up to save the Earth.

1233
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Anyway, the game itself is...

1234
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Well, I'll put it this way, the arcade one is really freaking hard.

1235
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
But the cool thing about this one is that you start off being able to choose your weapons.

1236
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You've got multi-directional weapons.

1237
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So you can get a front fire, a back fire, top or bottom.

1238
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And then you can get a diagonal fire.

1239
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
This is a little weaker because you don't have like three concentration beams.

1240
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's just one coming at each direction.

1241
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,000
But it does give you a chance to hit different targets, you know, that you might not otherwise.

1242
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
You also get speed boosts, you get bombs, you get power-ups.

1243
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But now there are some changes for...

1244
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And that's just in the arcade game.

1245
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So for the Mega Drive game, as you're going through this, you also get this little thing that will...

1246
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Like an option almost that will go around and absorb energy from your enemies and blow them up.

1247
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And I think like a certain degree of homing to the missiles, the bombs.

1248
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It also introduced some parallax scrolling for the backgrounds and gave it a much faster feel to it.

1249
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It really did.

1250
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,000
The arcade version is pretty, but the Genesis one kind of blows it away in terms of graphical quality.

1251
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
The PC Engine one, though, was actually kind of a disappointment for its look.

1252
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I mean, it had the great music and the usual, you know, cheese ball, you know,

1253
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
same style of, you know, late 80s, early 90s animation.

1254
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
You know, those extra big eyes and extra big hair and, you know.

1255
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
But the soundtrack was really great.

1256
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You know, it was actually also easier than the other two versions.

1257
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Just didn't have the same extra option.

1258
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You know, the little homing weapons and the little guy following you around like the Mega Drive version.

1259
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
But it's probably the easiest of the three.

1260
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And that is Hellfire.

1261
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I mean, it actually was...

1262
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Mega Tech magazine actually gave this game number four in their top Mega Drive games of all time.

1263
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And the music was composed by Uemura Tatsuya, so...

1264
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, the soundtrack's pretty sweet.

1265
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah. So, the one thing I don't like is just how big the ship is on the screen.

1266
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I mean, it's fucking massive.

1267
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
So, the arcade version is really freaking hard.

1268
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
But the thing that was surprising is how easy the PC Engine version is,

1269
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
because usually when shooters come to the PC Engine, they get harder.

1270
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So... But it's a good game.

1271
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
All right.

1272
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Hellfire. You can find it, get it.

1273
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Hellfire.

1274
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
For PC Engine, TurboGrafx-16, whatever you prefer.

1275
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And a game, admittedly, I did not know much about.

1276
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
But it sounds very cool.

1277
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And there's a gameplay video as well I was looking at before. It looks pretty neat.

1278
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Well, there's... I've actually done other Toaplon games.

1279
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I think I've done Zero Wing before.

1280
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I think you did Zero Wing.

1281
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I've done Tatsujin, which was Truxton.

1282
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And I don't think I've done Snow Brothers yet,

1283
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
but I still want a copy of Batsu-kun, because it's just an e-game.

1284
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
All right. We're going to take a quick break here in studio,

1285
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
but when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

1286
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype,

1287
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
also your emails and the FUs of the week, and much more.

1288
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1289
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1290
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Live tonight, right in the middle of our 656th episode for this,

1291
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
August the 28th of 2016.

1292
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Our show already in progress before we have a little break here

1293
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
for Labor Day and Dragon Con.

1294
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And many of you guys, I'm sure, are doing Penny Arcade Expo out there.

1295
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
It's a big weekend for conventions.

1296
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
They're having one here locally, SacAnime.

1297
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That's a pretty big deal, and I haven't been in years

1298
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
since I'm always at Dragon Con these days,

1299
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
but didn't we do a panel at SacAnime once,

1300
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
like, years ago in the early days of OLR?

1301
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I feel like it was at SacAnime.

1302
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Yes, it was at SacAnime, and it was at, like, 8 in the morning.

1303
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
It was 8 in the morning, and I think we had one person show up.

1304
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
But you know what? We did the damn show anyway.

1305
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
We did the damn show anyway, and we had a great time.

1306
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Maybe we were, like, a last-minute ad or something anyway,

1307
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
so the promotion was really, really bad.

1308
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So, Dark Tetsuya says, I know you guys did one at Fanime.

1309
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah, we did a couple at Fanime. It's been a few years,

1310
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
but, yeah, we had done panels at Fanime.

1311
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I should mention, even though we, you know, here at OLR,

1312
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
we only have the Parsec Award appearance at Dragon Con,

1313
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
we will have a panel at GamerX4.

1314
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Dark Soccer, myself, and Captain Spike from GameBooey.org

1315
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
are going to be doing a live show.

1316
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
We're doing a super show, which we're still trying to plan out.

1317
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
We'll probably be adding to who is on that as well,

1318
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
but for right now, it's the three of us.

1319
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Probably some other friends and fun guests, too.

1320
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
We did a lot of panels previously that were about, like,

1321
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
how to podcast and why to podcast,

1322
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
so we thought this year we would just podcast,

1323
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
and that would be fun. Do an actual show.

1324
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So, that'll be happening live at GamerX, so look forward to that.

1325
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some news,

1326
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
some rapid-fire news, some quick news stories here. Loki.

1327
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
All right. So, this is kind of cool.

1328
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I remember seeing, like, a little video about it

1329
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
when they launched their Kickstarter,

1330
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
but Adult Swim Games is going to be helping ToeJam and Earl,

1331
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
the brand new ToeJam and Earl game, come back.

1332
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
The, what was it, Back in the Groove would be the subtitle on that.

1333
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And, yeah, looks pretty good so far, actually.

1334
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I don't know when it's releasing or what platforms yet.

1335
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
They said PC and consoles, but next year sometime.

1336
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
That's when they'll be releasing.

1337
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
But that's cool that they'll be actually published at some point.

1338
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I know that Adult Swim's been really kind of getting into gaming lately,

1339
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
so I will have to look forward to that, I guess.

1340
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And then we've got a couple free-to-play games being shut down by Ubisoft,

1341
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
and this includes Ghost Recon Phantoms and the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot.

1342
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Those are both closing down later this year.

1343
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Looks like the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot will close on October 25th,

1344
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,000
followed by Ghost Recon Phantoms on December 1st.

1345
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Who is playing those games?

1346
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I don't know.

1347
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Apparently not enough people, or they wouldn't be shutting them down, right?

1348
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Right.

1349
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Well, sorry to the fans of those games,

1350
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
but apparently there were not a lot of people playing them,

1351
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
and so Ubisoft didn't feel like paying the bill anymore.

1352
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Going back just a little bit to the ToeJam and Earl thing,

1353
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com going,

1354
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Adult Swim Games has really gotten big.

1355
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah, it does seem like they've been doing more and more,

1356
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
and I think this ToeJam and Earl thing is probably going to have a presence

1357
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
at Penny Arcade Expo, right?

1358
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Maybe.

1359
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Which I think is part of the reason why they announced it now.

1360
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Well, for those of you guys that have seen this on Netflix,

1361
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
it was really just only a matter of time before something like this happened,

1362
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
and of course I'm talking about Stranger Things on Netflix, which is great.

1363
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Of course, we raved about that a few episodes ago.

1364
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Well, apparently a group called Infamous Games,

1365
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
which they say that they like to do old-school adventure games,

1366
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
they have built a non-authorized, but it's a playable fan tribute to the series.

1367
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
The version that they've put out there, it's not complete,

1368
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
but they're just kind of looking at one of the show's scenes

1369
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
in that classic 80s adventure game style.

1370
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Actually, this looks a little more, it doesn't really look 80s to me,

1371
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
because where computing was in the mid-80s,

1372
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
couldn't have produced these types of graphics.

1373
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
This is more like that Lucas Games, early 90s loom type of look to it,

1374
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
is what this reminds me of, but it's still a great throwback,

1375
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
and I hope they don't get cease and desisted by Netflix,

1376
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
so they probably will,

1377
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
but I would like to see them be able to put out this full vision there.

1378
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Anyway, in the scene you get to help Hopper,

1379
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
who's one of the main characters of the game, the Sheriff,

1380
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,000
and the deputies look for a clue to why someone has disappeared in the woods,

1381
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
and then you find the clue and that ends the game.

1382
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It's a very short, playable scene, but why not?

1383
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Why not?

1384
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
So yeah, check that out.

1385
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
In between generating all those graphics on the Stranger Things generator,

1386
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
because that's all I saw on Twitter this week,

1387
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
was people generating their own words and phrases in the Stranger Things font.

1388
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Moving on to a game that I keep forgetting is coming out this fall,

1389
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and I don't know why, because I'm really excited about this game,

1390
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
and that is Civilization VI.

1391
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
There's a collector's edition, because of course there is,

1392
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
announced for Civilization VI this week.

1393
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It will come with an art book, some commemorative coins,

1394
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
some DLC, because that's where Civilization is now,

1395
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and all the bonus content that comes to the digital deluxe edition.

1396
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
90 bucks if you want all that, but coins, did I say coins?

1397
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Anyhow, pre-order DLC will be exclusive for 90 days.

1398
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That's something interesting with Civilization VI,

1399
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
but I'm assuming after those 90 days they want to open it up so that people can buy it,

1400
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
because of course they want people to buy it.

1401
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But Civilization VI, it's going to be awesome.

1402
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Dark Sakura.

1403
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Well, here's some other stuff.

1404
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:17,000
There is a few new titles coming out to the Virtual Console.

1405
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yay! Echo, echo, echo.

1406
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
So, among those is Super Mario 64 DS,

1407
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
that will be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console,

1408
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
and then also three Street Fighter titles.

1409
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Super Street Fighter Alpha 2, sorry, not Super,

1410
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo Hyper Fighting,

1411
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
and Street Fighter 2 The New Challengers will be released on August 25th.

1412
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
And then, kind of video game-y, but kind of not.

1413
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It's a good idea to pay attention to ergonomics when you are at your computer,

1414
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
and now there is a very cute way to do that,

1415
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
with an Eevee plushie that comes with a pillow that its little paws can attach to,

1416
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
and you can sit with it on your lap, which helps you maintain your posture,

1417
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,000
while still resting your wrists in a comfortable place in front of your keyboard,

1418
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
because you're supposed to have your hands resting higher than the keyboard a little bit,

1419
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
to relieve pressure on your wrists,

1420
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and so now you have a super adorable way to do it.

1421
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Yay, Eevee.

1422
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And Pokemon's all the rage right now, you know.

1423
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Well, yeah.

1424
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I also like that all their marketing there is still Pocket Monster.

1425
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
That is the old school name, absolutely.

1426
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Alright, we're going to get back into some of the long form news,

1427
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
and of course, coming up in a little bit here,

1428
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,000
the mailbag and the FUs of the Week, and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1429
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
But first, we have some more news stories for you with Loki.

1430
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
So, I'm sure you've heard that a lot of people aren't too happy with No Man's Sky,

1431
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and how a lot of the things that were promised aren't coming through,

1432
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
or, you know, a lot of the things that should be functioning in the game

1433
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
aren't necessarily functioning as well as they were supposed to.

1434
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So, there's been a lot of people looking to get their money back,

1435
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
and getting some refunds.

1436
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And thankfully, there's been some research into this,

1437
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and apparently multiple services are offering refunds for your purchases of No Man's Sky,

1438
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
including Steam, Amazon, and PlayStation Network.

1439
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Steam even going so far as to allow you to do a refund,

1440
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:38,000
even if you played longer, if you've, you know, had it,

1441
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
or you just played under two hours within two weeks.

1442
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
But I guess I want to say that I thought that they were bending that rule for this,

1443
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
and allowing you to do it anyways, but you might want to check into that.

1444
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And of course, you know, Amazon, they said they're looking at case by case spaces for those,

1445
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
and then it's only kind of the same thing.

1446
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
They'll refund any purchase within 14 days of the purchase.

1447
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yeah, I mean, it looks...

1448
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I mean, I guess I'm not surprised that people are asking for refunds for that stuff.

1449
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I mean, I still would like give it some time, just to see...

1450
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
It sounds like that they are working on patching the game,

1451
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and getting things up to, you know, where they should be.

1452
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I just kind of wish that that was there at launch.

1453
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I mean, honestly, since they gave themselves extra time,

1454
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and you basically see how many corners were cut for it,

1455
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
it's just kind of disappointing.

1456
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Well, and it seems like they fixed a lot of those PC issues within a few days, too.

1457
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You know what I mean?

1458
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Like the PC version with all the graphic issues people were complaining about and stuff,

1459
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
that seemed to get fixed relatively fast.

1460
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
They've done several updates.

1461
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It's like 1.07 now on PlayStation 4.

1462
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So, I mean, they're working on fixing some of that stuff,

1463
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
and I think a lot of the PC issues have been fixed.

1464
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I've seen, like, there's already been quite a few mods coming out for it.

1465
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
So, you know, what the developer doesn't fix, the modding community will.

1466
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So, I don't know, that's kind of interesting.

1467
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I'd be curious to see what mods that they have on there.

1468
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I know the one I did see seemed to add a lot more of the plant life,

1469
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and made the plants look a little bit more lush, I guess.

1470
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So, yeah.

1471
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I wish they had modding support on the PlayStation 4 version.

1472
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I kind of wish they had modding support on the PlayStation 4 version of Fallout 4 as well,

1473
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
but, you know, we can't all have everything, I guess.

1474
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,000
All right, well, it's probably just a matter of time before it mods.

1475
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh, it's just that complicated PlayStation 4 and PlayStation's, you know, network requirements and stuff.

1476
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
True.

1477
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I don't know. I don't really know what the excuse is, but I'm disappointed that we still don't have that yet.

1478
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Yeah. All right, well, moving on to talk about Pokémon GO,

1479
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
which, you know, still a lot of people are talking about, but there's a lot of buzz out there.

1480
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
In fact, I saw this, like, trending on Facebook or something this week.

1481
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
A lot of buzz out there that Pokémon GO is in decline,

1482
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and, of course, it's interesting how people really want to just, like, rally around, like,

1483
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,000
oh, look, this game is flopping already, but that's not really what's happening, you guys.

1484
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Pokémon GO peaked in popularity at some point in mid-July,

1485
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:33,000
but based on data collected by Sensor Tower, Survey Monkey, Aptopia,

1486
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
they have to use these third-party sites to measure this stuff because, you know,

1487
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
they don't really put anything official out there.

1488
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,000
It looks like that the worldwide daily active users have just dropped from about 40 million to 30 million.

1489
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
That's still 30 million people playing this game.

1490
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Show me any other mobile game that's at that level right now.

1491
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So, I think Pokémon GO is still doing very, very well, but, of course, you know,

1492
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
some people are complaining about, oh, the radar's got the issues, and, you know, you know,

1493
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I understand Ant just got to fix a bunch of that stuff, but the reality is it wasn't going to last forever.

1494
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I'm surprised they haven't switched up the, what was it, switched up the farms yet.

1495
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Remember, they were had-

1496
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I thought, I heard they did again last week.

1497
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Did they?

1498
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That the nest changed again, yeah.

1499
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I heard they changed again because, like, where people were finding, I think,

1500
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Poliwhirls, they were now finding, god, it changed to something else,

1501
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and it was something kind of rare-ish.

1502
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I don't remember, but, yeah, like, some of the nests has changed, so you wanted to look that up.

1503
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
That was, like, in the middle of the week last week.

1504
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So, but I think this is very natural.

1505
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I mean, it's like MMOs.

1506
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
An expansion comes out, big up, and then it'll slowly tick off,

1507
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and then I'm sure when the second gen of Pokémon comes out, it'll go back up,

1508
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
or when the radar thing gets, you know, which I saw when I was in San Francisco,

1509
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
when I went to Pokémon Worlds with Shane, we got to see, because, you know,

1510
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
when you're in San Francisco, you get the new radar, and it looked really cool,

1511
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
and I don't know why they haven't rolled that out worldwide yet,

1512
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
but I imagine that's going to be any day now, that's going to come out everywhere,

1513
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
and I think that'll get some people interested in the game again,

1514
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
who were getting a little frustrated with the way the radar thing played out.

1515
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
You know, so I think this game is far from dead.

1516
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,000
When, you know, when you've got another game, whether it be Candy Crush,

1517
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
or Words with Friends, or Draw Something, or whatever,

1518
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
that gets back up to this level, you let me know.

1519
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
So, alright.

1520
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
But, you know, and I'll say, you know, as much as I might be defending Pokémon Go here,

1521
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
and the fact that people are, like, you know, excited, it seems on Facebook to see it decline in popularity,

1522
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I myself have really scaled back in how much I've been playing the game,

1523
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
but that's just, I mean, because I've just been, when I go out to play a game,

1524
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I usually end up playing Ingress, just because that's the game I've always kind of been into,

1525
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
so I think that's more why my Pokémon Go stuff has been declining.

1526
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And I'm still waiting to really see, like, what the point of the team and the gym control thing becomes,

1527
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
because there's no, there's no real way to measure up in the community and so forth,

1528
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
like there is in Ingress.

1529
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I don't know, I just feel, I feel my progress more in Ingress than I do in a game like Pokémon Go.

1530
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So, whatever.

1531
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Alright, well let's move on.

1532
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1533
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Happiness. So much happiness, because the game, inspired by a preview,

1534
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
named after a 1990's Gin Blossom song,

1535
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
is back.

1536
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Ugh, Allison Road is back.

1537
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So, basically they had cancelled everything, they said we weren't going to do it,

1538
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
and now the creator, Christian Kessler, says it's back.

1539
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
He has a new company that he made with his wife called Far From Home,

1540
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and considered that cancellation moment a setback, and now they are back and working on it.

1541
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
He said he started making a few necessary changes to the story and the flow,

1542
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and it came back to life.

1543
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
So, they're working on it, no details yet, but they're still working on it.

1544
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So, yay!

1545
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Great.

1546
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Yes. Yes!

1547
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Yes, God.

1548
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Well, the fact that it's kind of been up and down and up, you know, it gives me some reservations,

1549
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
but I look forward to when they put an actual teaser out there or something,

1550
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I look forward to what they're going to deliver.

1551
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I just like the excuse to use Gin Blossoms in the background.

1552
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I can't, I'd like...

1553
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
You were very excited about that.

1554
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Other people had to have caught that that was a thing, right?

1555
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Whatever.

1556
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I feel extra old.

1557
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I'm going to go drink my Geritol now.

1558
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Alright, go watch the Matlock reruns while we go to a story from...

1559
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Actually, but you know what? I was going to say go watch some murder she wrote,

1560
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,000
but you can do that at any... Angela Lansbury is timeless, okay?

1561
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Actually, Matlock wasn't a bad show.

1562
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
My grandmother watched Matlock a lot.

1563
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
It was kind of boring.

1564
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I would end up watching Matlock with my grandmother while I did stuff.

1565
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Alright.

1566
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
You know, it wasn't that bad.

1567
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Alright, let's move on. Logie.

1568
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Alright, so this is kind of interesting,

1569
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
but one of the co-creators of Rick and Morty

1570
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
has teamed up with some former executive from Epic,

1571
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
and they're making VR games.

1572
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
So it's a new company called Squanchtendo,

1573
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
which sounds just kind of like a Nintendo thing, but...

1574
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yeah, they're...

1575
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Now that's a vegetable I'd eat.

1576
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Squashten? Squashtendo?

1577
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
No, that's Squash. Squanch.

1578
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Oh, Squanch. I thought you said Squash.

1579
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I was like, actually Squash is pretty good to begin with.

1580
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Alright, wow, when jokes go horrifically wrong on the next OLR.

1581
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Yeah, so they're going to be making VR games,

1582
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
and they had a funny little comic to announce it as well.

1583
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You know what VR game they should make?

1584
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Is that courtroom scene from Georgia, the short that they did for...

1585
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
What did they do with that? For Comic-Con or something like that?

1586
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Have you seen that YouTube of the Rick and Morty,

1587
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
that they do the voices for the court scene

1588
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
of the guy who's just going crazy that's like, you know,

1589
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
he says all these really obscene things about like,

1590
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
why don't you shut up and blow me or something.

1591
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
He's just talking back to the judge, and the judge starts talking back to him.

1592
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's hilarious, but it's in the Rick and Morty voices.

1593
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And because of this, no, fuck you.

1594
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
If you continue to fuck you, it was that one, right?

1595
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Kind of, but it was a lot more obscene than that.

1596
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It was really, really funny.

1597
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Why don't you go fuck yourself and other things like that, right?

1598
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I remember reading the thing like back in the day.

1599
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Yes, yes. Actually, I can do a little clip here.

1600
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I don't know, but again, this is like a nine and a half minute thing,

1601
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
so I don't know, but here's what I'm talking about.

1602
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Fuck yourself.

1603
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Okay, I'm going to tell you how this is going to work.

1604
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
You either listen or not. I don't care.

1605
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm through. Can I leave the courtroom?

1606
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
No, you've got to stay here.

1607
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
No, I'm not talking to the bastard.

1608
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
We are going to have the trial Monday week.

1609
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
No, the fuck we are. I ain't going to trial with this lawyer present.

1610
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Listen, if you do not-

1611
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Suck my dick, you stinking ass cracker.

1612
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
If you act like this, if you act like this,

1613
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I will send you out of the courtroom-

1614
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Old bitch ass cracker.

1615
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And leave you out of the courtroom during the trial.

1616
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Horse ass cracker.

1617
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Do you understand that?

1618
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Sucking ass.

1619
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Do you understand that?

1620
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I could just let that play all day. It's hilarious.

1621
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah, so that's the VR game I want.

1622
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Well, one of the VR games that they're working on right now

1623
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
is the Rick and Morty, it was the Morty Simulator,

1624
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Virtual Rick-ality, so that is one of the ones

1625
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
that they're working on right now.

1626
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Okay, maybe I will get that after all.

1627
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
That'd be great.

1628
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I'd play Phoenix Wright if it was that.

1629
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Well, one game I know I'm going to be playing

1630
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
because I am super excited about this series.

1631
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Even though the last few times it was on mobile,

1632
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
it was kind of garbage.

1633
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But I'm willing to give it another go,

1634
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
and that is Luminous.

1635
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
That's right, Luminous is coming back with a new version.

1636
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It's another mobile edition.

1637
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It's going to be, as I think Logie mentioned during release dates,

1638
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
it is out on Android and iOS on September 1st for $3.

1639
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
$2.99 was $3.

1640
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It's going to have some classic tracks and some new tracks.

1641
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You will be able to play in portrait mode on your phones,

1642
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
which is the way that it looked on an HD TV,

1643
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
so that should be fine.

1644
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
You mean landscape?

1645
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Is that what I mean?

1646
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
No, why does it say a portrait-style setup?

1647
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
You're right, that would be landscape, not portrait.

1648
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Maybe some people like to play in portrait.

1649
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
That would be weird, though.

1650
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Portrait is like the way you play Meteos or something.

1651
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But yeah, I can't imagine it won't be like,

1652
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
why would you suddenly want to play in portrait mode?

1653
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You're not going to be able to see as much.

1654
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Maybe they're just talking about, when they use that word,

1655
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
they're talking about the artistic style or something like that.

1656
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
That's a little weird.

1657
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
But anyway, I guess we'll find out when the game is out,

1658
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
because we don't really have screenshots or anything.

1659
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Well, good, I need a new game to play.

1660
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Yeah, since you banished one from your phone.

1661
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I don't mind you, the last Luminous game that was out

1662
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
was kind of earlier in the iPhone.

1663
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
It was around the time of the iPhone 4 or something.

1664
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
It was garbage.

1665
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
So hopefully this one's gotten the controls down better.

1666
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I should download that Space Invaders game that they had before.

1667
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
What was the other one that was on rails?

1668
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Oh, the Groove Coaster?

1669
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Groove Coaster, yeah.

1670
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
That's an arcade cabinet at round one,

1671
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
which, by the way, ready for the tangent train?

1672
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Choo choo!

1673
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Round one opened up in Concord this week.

1674
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Cool.

1675
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Not quite in Sacramento yet.

1676
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Yeah, but you don't have to go all the way to San Jose.

1677
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Now, I wasn't able to go because I was super busy this weekend

1678
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
with Rocky Horror last night and everything.

1679
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
But Shane went, and he wasn't able to be on tonight's show

1680
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
because he has some of this stuff going on.

1681
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
But Shane spoke very favorably of the new round one.

1682
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
He said there's not as many music games,

1683
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
but there's still a lot,

1684
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
and there's less people playing them, I guess,

1685
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
because it's Concord, so I guess he got to get more games in.

1686
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And he said they had the Luigi's Mansion arcade machine was there.

1687
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That's cool.

1688
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Which they don't have in San Jose.

1689
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
So just an interesting little side tangent.

1690
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Well, maybe.

1691
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
You know, they went in San Jose.

1692
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Now they're in Concord.

1693
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
The next logical place to keep moving this direction

1694
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
would be here in Sacramento, right?

1695
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Why not put that out in, I don't know, people will love that,

1696
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
in like Roseville or Folsom or, I don't know, West Sac.

1697
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
What else is growing around here?

1698
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Elk Grove?

1699
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Put it in the Palladio because there's like nothing there.

1700
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Yeah, maybe. That'd be awesome.

1701
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Or, I don't know, Sunrise Mall.

1702
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It's the whole mall.

1703
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Just tear the rest of the mall down.

1704
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
It's all the arcade.

1705
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
All right.

1706
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
All right.

1707
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Anyway, I don't know how we went from luminous to round one,

1708
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
but we did.

1709
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
There you go.

1710
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Let's get to the emails.

1711
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

1712
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1713
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
if you want to participate with our show.

1714
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the emails

1715
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
and find some emails to read for you tonight.

1716
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Again, that's Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1717
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
if you want to send us an email.

1718
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
There's two.

1719
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Two whole emails.

1720
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
All right, let's do it.

1721
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Hello, LR.

1722
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Hi.

1723
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Just a couple of thoughts on last week's episode.

1724
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I don't know if Shane is listening,

1725
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
but Time Crisis 5 is a phenomenal game

1726
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
when the guns are calibrated properly.

1727
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
So if he sees it again in a location

1728
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
where they care enough to calibrate it properly,

1729
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I hope he'll give it another try.

1730
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Maybe they had that in Concord.

1731
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I didn't ask.

1732
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I didn't ask about Time Crisis.

1733
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Alternatively, many recent gun games

1734
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
have some sort of user calibration.

1735
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Look on the machine to see if it mentions it.

1736
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Also mentioned was the Mario and Sonic

1737
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
at the Rio Olympics arcade game.

1738
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I actually did play this at my local Dave and Buster's

1739
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
a couple of months back when I discovered

1740
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
that some kid left like seven credits on it.

1741
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
You get to play one mini game per credit

1742
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
choosing from things like archery, hurdles,

1743
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
swimming, or your classic 100 meter dash.

1744
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Basically, it controls like the old world class

1745
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
track meet on your power pad,

1746
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
except that there's an infrared sensor

1747
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
watching your feet instead of physical buttons

1748
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
or that there are two joystick levers,

1749
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
one on each side that are used for things like jumping

1750
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
or the rhythmic gymnastics event,

1751
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,000
which is absolutely not part of the Rio Olympics.

1752
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
The other cool thing about this game

1753
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
is that just like Mario Kart arcade

1754
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
or even good old Daytona USA,

1755
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
there are several cabinets and you will compete

1756
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
against whoever else is playing at that time.

1757
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Of course, you can intentionally not join someone else's game

1758
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
and just play by yourself,

1759
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
but there's no difference except you'll be up against AI.

1760
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
The game was fun even if it was over pretty quickly.

1761
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
You play one event and that's it.

1762
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
The menu screens and post-game award ceremony

1763
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
definitely take longer than the actual game,

1764
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
but it was fun while it lasted.

1765
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Worth a look if you're in a place that has it

1766
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
and you don't mind being a bit sore the next day.

1767
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
And this one's for me, Jamie.

1768
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Good luck with the crappy shift. Hang in there.

1769
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Until next time, Aaron, YYR.

1770
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Always good to hear from YYR.

1771
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
You know, I will go ahead and just say this.

1772
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I am actually changing from a worse shift

1773
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
to the one I'm getting.

1774
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
It's just that the worse shift allows you to do the show at least.

1775
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Well, yeah, but I wouldn't be in any shape to do the show anyway.

1776
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
No, I understand. I understand.

1777
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
So it's between my health and doing the show,

1778
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
to be perfectly honest.

1779
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Well, I had not played that Mario and Sonic Rio Olympic Games,

1780
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
so that was cool to hear a little bit about it.

1781
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So I'll have to check it out at some point.

1782
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
The one thing I'm hearing about this whole round one thing and the new one,

1783
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Shane was telling me that the round one in Concord

1784
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
is not with the rest of the network,

1785
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
so my card won't work there, which seems a little bit ridiculous.

1786
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
But I don't think I had a lot of money left on my San Jose card anyway,

1787
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
so I guess it's not that big a deal.

1788
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I have a ton of friends in San Jose.

1789
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I'm sure I'll be back there at some point anyway.

1790
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Let's just go to Mills Garage.

1791
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Well, apparently there's a DDR machine there now with memory card slots.

1792
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
They're opening up a mini arcade.

1793
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Don't they have a one-car garage?

1794
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Yeah, and it's starting to fill with arcade games.

1795
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
They own the Para... Should I be talking about this on air?

1796
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I guess they wouldn't care.

1797
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
They own the Para Para machine that used to be Arcade Infinities back in the day,

1798
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
so that is still there.

1799
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And they moved stuff onto a flash drive,

1800
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
so it runs a lot smoother with that machine.

1801
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And then there is a Dance Maniacs,

1802
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and that's the last time I played Dance Maniacs.

1803
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Solo, and now there's a... Is it the Xtreme?

1804
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
It's the Xtreme that they bought.

1805
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I think their Solo wasn't really working anyway,

1806
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and at one point they kind of just unplugged the arcade part of it,

1807
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and they were just using the dance pad with a PlayStation 2.

1808
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So, yeah, I don't know what the story is behind that,

1809
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
but we'll have to get them back on the show at some point to ask.

1810
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
But, yeah, I know there's an Xtreme machine in there now.

1811
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
They just picked that up.

1812
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And the Xtreme machine came from this area.

1813
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Apparently there was some place over at Sunrise and 50

1814
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
and all those warehouses over there.

1815
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I think it was the bouncy... You know the bouncy trampoline place?

1816
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I think it came from there. I think that's who sold it.

1817
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Yeah, crazy, right?

1818
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yeah. Well, last email?

1819
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Yes. And by the way, sorry, Dark Tetsuya says,

1820
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I wonder if you upgraded the Dance Maniacs with that new version.

1821
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
As far as I know, the version they have has some type of...

1822
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
It's the...

1823
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
But it was the J-Paradise.

1824
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
It is the J-Paradise.

1825
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Korean edition.

1826
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yeah, it's whatever has the most songs,

1827
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
but I have heard there's an even newer one that has a ton of stuff.

1828
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I don't think they've tried that yet.

1829
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
As far as I know.

1830
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Email time.

1831
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yes.

1832
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Hey, OLR. I just wanted to share a gaming experience I had last night.

1833
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I was over my boyfriend's house

1834
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and he decided to turn on his Steam link

1835
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
to show me some of his games that he has.

1836
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
As he was going through his Steam library, I noticed he had Peggle.

1837
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Now, before yesterday, I only heard of Peggle from you guys.

1838
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
So I asked him to show me the game without knowing what to expect.

1839
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
At first, it kind of reminded me of the Miitomo Drop game

1840
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
and the music was very classic sounding and catchy,

1841
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
but nothing could prepare me for the fever thing that happens at the end of every level.

1842
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It is so over the top with all of these colors and rainbows

1843
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
and it tops off with blasting Ode to Joy.

1844
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Peggle was the most unexpected gaming experience I ever had.

1845
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I encourage anyone who never played it before

1846
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
to go and download it right now and play it.

1847
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So I was wondering, did you guys ever have an unexpected gaming experience?

1848
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
If so, what game was it?

1849
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Oh, good question.

1850
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
One of your longtime listeners, Ziba.

1851
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
For the record, you should see what happens if you fully clear the level.

1852
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:04,000
You get like ultra hyper fever and then sometimes you'll get,

1853
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
if you manage to ace the score, then you'll get like ribbons and everything for it too.

1854
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I love this story too because it's not like Peggle's,

1855
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I mean, Peggle is kind of an older game at this point, right?

1856
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It is, but it's super fun.

1857
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
But it's awesome that somebody's discovering that for the first time, right?

1858
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
It's like finding that old TV show that you've just found on everything.

1859
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Like, I don't know, like a lot of people now are finding Twin Peaks, let's say,

1860
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
which is like, that's a show I loved from the 90s,

1861
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
even if it got really weird in the second season.

1862
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
But like the fact that it's coming back and everything, you know.

1863
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
But like people are discovering that for the first time now.

1864
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And I just love this story that like, oh, somebody's discovering that first time.

1865
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
So that's great.

1866
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Can you read the question part of that again?

1867
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Because the question that she had.

1868
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
So I was wondering, did you guys ever have an unexpected gaming experience?

1869
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
If so, what game was it?

1870
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I know that actually another PopCap game Bejeweled was kind of fun for me

1871
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
because of that stupid butterfly mode.

1872
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I am addicted to butterfly mode.

1873
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And I scream every time that damn jewel spider eats my butterflies.

1874
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
It's just like the craziest thing.

1875
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Well, as cheesy of an answer as this might be,

1876
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
the honest to God first thing that comes to my mind, DDR.

1877
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I mean, that game literally changed my life.

1878
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Derby Owners Club.

1879
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Seriously, did you expect to like that fucking game?

1880
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
That's a good answer.

1881
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
If you guys don't know what Derby Owners Club is,

1882
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
gigantic, they probably still have it at some Dave and Busters.

1883
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
They've got to still have it.

1884
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
It's horse betting and horse racing.

1885
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Yeah, it's a horse racing game.

1886
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,000
And you actually breed a horse who's on these little magnetic cards that you use.

1887
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I still have my binder.

1888
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I don't have binders of women. I have binders of horses.

1889
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I love it.

1890
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
What about you, Loki?

1891
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
But DDR is my choice, honestly.

1892
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Who knew that Stomping Arrows would be here all these years later?

1893
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
As much shit as we give Konami now, and rightfully so, let's be real,

1894
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
none of the people who had anything to do with DDR's successes are even there anymore.

1895
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Maybe a few, but none of the big names.

1896
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
The show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for that arcade community at that time,

1897
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
and it really stinks that we don't have that.

1898
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Well, I don't know, but round one's bringing some of that back,

1899
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
some of these other experiences.

1900
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Maybe it will come back.

1901
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I shouldn't say we're never going to have it again.

1902
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I remember giving you Third Mix all the way back in the day,

1903
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
and you had the Mickey Mouse pads.

1904
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
It was not the Mickey Mouse pads. It was the Jungle Book PlayStation game.

1905
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That was the Jungle Book ones.

1906
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Which was a dumb fuck game.

1907
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
But the pad worked.

1908
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
But the pad was great.

1909
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It had a dance pad, and you could use it with DDR,

1910
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
and that was the first- I never realized.

1911
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
You know, I was a dirty casual at the time.

1912
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I only had a PlayStation.

1913
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I never realized you could put a little plug in the back of your PlayStation

1914
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
and play Japanese games.

1915
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
So somebody brought over-

1916
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I think I brought mine over.

1917
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Yeah, you brought yours over.

1918
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
And my burns.

1919
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I think the crazy guy I used to live with had the burned copy of the Third Mix

1920
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
and brought it over, and we played that, like, all night.

1921
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
It was so much fun.

1922
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
And I lived upstairs, and I think I got so many complaints.

1923
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
But I didn't care.

1924
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
We used to have all those Bimani parties back in the day.

1925
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Yeah, for real. It was fun.

1926
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
What about you, Logan?

1927
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Yeah, what about you, Logan?

1928
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Probably just DDR.

1929
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I don't know.

1930
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Copycat.

1931
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
What?

1932
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1933
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Did you expect Grand Theft Auto?

1934
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Did you expect Grand Theft Auto?

1935
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
You would love as much as you did?

1936
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Of course.

1937
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I seriously need to go back and play 5.

1938
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I may do that, because now that-

1939
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
One of the things I forgot to mention during my gaming week was,

1940
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
you know, recently my laptop was being stupid,

1941
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
and I had to reinstall Windows several times.

1942
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Well, prior to reinstalling Windows several times,

1943
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:52,000
my PlayStation, the second screen, I don't remember what they call that,

1944
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
where you can play the PlayStation on, like, your Vita or your PC,

1945
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
wasn't working.

1946
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
But now it does.

1947
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
So I'm like, yes.

1948
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I don't have to watch this stupid Grey's Anatomy shit.

1949
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I can play No Man's Sky, which is better, but it's not much.

1950
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
But I need to go back and play, you know, Grand Theft Auto,

1951
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
because I've watched a lot of people playing the new update that they have

1952
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
with all the stunt ramps and everything, and it looks seriously crazy.

1953
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Like, there's some fun racing going on there,

1954
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
so I need to go back and play that.

1955
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
All right. Well, I do want to mention,

1956
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
just the chat room is lighting up with responses to the question

1957
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
that was posed to us.

1958
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Very good email, Ziba.

1959
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Yeah, very good email and very good answers here.

1960
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
SHA100Matt, this isn't a game, but I think it's a good answer still.

1961
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I showed my girlfriend the Goonies last night.

1962
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
She had never seen it before, and she was an 80s kid also.

1963
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
She, of course, loved it.

1964
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So talk about discovering something, right?

1965
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Mm-hmm.

1966
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
RageNator reminding us, doesn't matter how old a game is,

1967
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
a good game is a good game, and a bad game is a bad game, no matter what.

1968
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Some other answers in chat, AkumaJP says, Zone of the Enders, for me.

1969
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I never thought it was going to be that good.

1970
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
BobbyBlackWolf saying, recently I tried Pokemon P-Cross.

1971
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I had never played a P-Cross game before.

1972
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I have now bought P-Cross E1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

1973
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
and I'm looking for P-Cross DS every time I go to a place that sells used DS games.

1974
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
That's a great answer.

1975
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:20,000
VidPower says, the arcade game Prop Cycle surprised me with how fun it is.

1976
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Oh, man, that game is legendary.

1977
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
You've got to look that up.

1978
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
If you don't know what Prop Cycle is, Google it or look up a picture of the machine.

1979
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
It was the silliest game and you get this big fat bicycle and you're riding it.

1980
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
It was amazing.

1981
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
There's another game that came out in 95 that I'm probably going to make a classic game sometime,

1982
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
but it was Psychic Force.

1983
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Did you ever play Psychic Force?

1984
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I don't think so.

1985
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:49,000
It was sort of like an in-space 3D fighting game, like multi-plane fighting game.

1986
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
It was kind of a weird one.

1987
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It was one of those Taito games, but yeah.

1988
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Just a couple more quick answers and then we'll move on.

1989
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Act Def says, Portal blew me away.

1990
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It still kind of does.

1991
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
JD says, Rhythm Tengoku on Game Boy Advance surprised me with how adorable it was.

1992
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,000
And SSG100Matt says, Undertale surprised the fuck out of me.

1993
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
So there you go.

1994
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Lots of great answers.

1995
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Great question.

1996
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
That's it for emails though, right?

1997
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for the future.

1998
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
For now though, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty.

1999
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Um, I guess FU to not having my weekends anymore, because I do a lot of stuff on the weekends.

2000
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And FU to plantar fasciitis.

2001
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I have developed it in my left heel, so I have to go shoe shopping.

2002
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
That's it.

2003
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
All right.

2004
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Loki.

2005
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:04,000
I guess this, um, FU2, it's just work stuff.

2006
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Just trying to get into a different department other than Wormat.

2007
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And, um, I'm rocking it, but they just aren't hiring.

2008
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
So they're like, yeah, we want you.

2009
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
We really do.

2010
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But, you know, so it's really hard.

2011
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Um, my FU of the week goes to my voice because I threw it out again last night because I was hosting Rocky Horror.

2012
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Although the crowd was phenomenal and it was a different setup.

2013
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
It was outside.

2014
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
It was really fun.

2015
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Great crowd.

2016
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I had a great time.

2017
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Um, and yeah, so just FU to the fact that I threw my voice out, even if it does make it a little bit sexy base here.

2018
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I wish I could kind of, I wish I could hang on to the voice without some of the pain.

2019
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Might work out better for radio.

2020
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Although I just, I have to face that my voice will never be like Captain Spikes from Gameboy.org.

2021
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
It's just never going to be.

2022
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
All right.

2023
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2024
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And then we'll get to our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

2025
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
But first, Loki.

2026
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
All right.

2027
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:07,000
So it's been a few weeks since we talked about the ZeniMax lawsuit, but they've appended their complaint.

2028
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:16,000
And now they are straight up basically accusing John Carmack of, you know, stealing patent stuff.

2029
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
You know, basically stealing information.

2030
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Basically, they're also now naming Facebook as well with the amended charges.

2031
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And basically saying that the key source of conflict is misappropriated ZeniMax property.

2032
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Specifically, it spells out like they're saying the theft of alleged id software technology and stuff developed from John Carmack.

2033
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Basically saying, instead of complying with his contract during his last days of ZeniMax, he copied thousands of documents from a computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device.

2034
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:00,000
He never returned those files or all copies of them after his employment with ZeniMax was terminated.

2035
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:15,000
In addition, after Carmack's employment with ZeniMax was terminated, he returned the ZeniMax premises to take a customized tool for developing VR technology belonging to ZeniMax that itself is a part of ZeniMax VR technology.

2036
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
So basically saying he stole the information.

2037
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Or, I don't know.

2038
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I guess we'll have to see it play out.

2039
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I mean, I don't know.

2040
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I see what they're trying to paint the picture that he came in and sold these documents.

2041
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
But I kind of wonder if like a lot of it is just stuff that he was working on.

2042
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
But then again, you know, if he's employed at that company and it's their property.

2043
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
So it's hard to say.

2044
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
You can't really, you know, who's his thoughts or, you know, whose property.

2045
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I mean, it's kind of confusing.

2046
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
But that's thankfully for a courtroom to decide, not me.

2047
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I would probably just say, fuck you ZeniMax.

2048
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Not any of you on Twitter.

2049
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Fuck you ZeniMax, where's my fucking Fallout 4, you know.

2050
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Where's my mod support on PlayStation 4.

2051
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Oh, it's not fucking done yet? Well then you're fucking done.

2052
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
That's how my courtroom works.

2053
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It'll be like that court scene we just played from Rick and Morty.

2054
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
How about fuck you?

2055
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Fuck you, fuck you. Yes, fuck you.

2056
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Alright, let's talk about the Super Nintendo because it celebrated a birthday this past week.

2057
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:34,000
That's right, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System arrived in North America on August 23rd, 1991.

2058
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So the Super Nintendo turned 25 this past week.

2059
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Which means, guess what everybody?

2060
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
You're old.

2061
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Didn't Valve have like an anniversary or something this week?

2062
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I thought they were like 20 or 25.

2063
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Yeah, probably like the 10th anniversary of them not announcing Half-Life 3.

2064
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I think it's 20, yeah.

2065
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
But in Valve time though, that's like an eternity.

2066
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Well anyhow, maybe you didn't know this, but Super Nintendo never did outsell the original NES.

2067
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Of course, some of the best games, at least if you talk to gamers of a certain age, like our age,

2068
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
many would agree that the best games came out on Super Nintendo.

2069
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Games like Super Mario World, Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Metroid.

2070
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Can you imagine when that SNES mini comes out finally?

2071
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Right, and Chrono Trigger.

2072
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:29,000
It was some of the great, great games of Super Nintendo.

2073
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Yeah, Mario Kart started on Super Nintendo, Star Fox, Donkey Kong Country.

2074
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I mean, Super Nintendo was just the system.

2075
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Will there ever be a better video game?

2076
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:45,000
And just think, when they do end up coming out with an SNES mini, and for whatever reason they omit Chrono Trigger,

2077
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
then that's just more fuel to go, I'm sorry, it feels like one of the best games ever.

2078
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
It would have clearly been on that system.

2079
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Well, the third party thing is going to throw a monkey wrench into that.

2080
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Whereas Super Metroid was a first party game, Chrono Trigger was not.

2081
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
They put Final Fantasy in there.

2082
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
They did, yeah.

2083
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I mean, I would hope that that's in there.

2084
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Anything is possible.

2085
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

2086
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Final Fantasy 2 and 3, or 4 and 6, will probably be in there first.

2087
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Much to the angerment of Chrono Trigger fans everywhere.

2088
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I hope the mini SNES isn't a real thing, that would be awesome.

2089
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I would love to get one of the old school controllers, just like they have one coming out for the NES, and make that a USB thing.

2090
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,000
That would be awesome.

2091
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
They do have USB SNES style controllers.

2092
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
SNES style or actual SNES?

2093
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
They may as well be.

2094
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Are they that good?

2095
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
The body is exactly the same.

2096
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I mean, the insides really aren't as great, but it feels like one in your hand.

2097
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Officially supported virtual console on PC wouldn't be bad.

2098
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Nintendo, if you want to make some bank.

2099
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mini SNES will only have Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

2100
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Hey, at least you'll get the great music.

2101
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,000
If I'm challenged, say something nice about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

2102
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
It had great music.

2103
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
There you go.

2104
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I'll give you that.

2105
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

2106
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
How about right now?

2107
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2108
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:27,000
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or perhaps something else that we didn't bring up.

2109
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
While we wait for a call to come in, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories.

2110
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
No, I don't.

2111
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,000
But I was checking out what the NES turned into over here, and it turned into an Eakins NES.

2112
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Which is like, it's a common Pokemon already.

2113
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
It's like, eh.

2114
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's not very good.

2115
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:51,000
So, but the buzz is that Cameron Park Lake, though, is pretty nice to go up there for Pokemon.

2116
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Really?

2117
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So I may have to head up there.

2118
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Is that where the Dratini's all went?

2119
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:01,000
No, that's where a lot of Magikarp and Psyducks and what else do they have?

2120
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
They actually have Dratini's up there, too.

2121
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Nice.

2122
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
That might be worth it.

2123
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Might be worth it, because they don't spawn in Anatolia.

2124
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Psyducks.

2125
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,000
People from the Bay Area were going out to Anatolia to farm Dratini's.

2126
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Like, it was just nuts.

2127
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Yeah.

2128
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Eventually it'll come back, I'm sure.

2129
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Alright, well, let's get to the phones.

2130
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
We have a call coming in.

2131
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

2132
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Who's this?

2133
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Hey, it's Raginator.

2134
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Hey, Raginator.

2135
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2136
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Well, just before you opened up the phone lines, you were bringing up the 25th anniversary of the Super Nintendo being released in the US.

2137
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Now, that being said, I'm not sure if Dark Sakura had one back then.

2138
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I almost have to say she had a Genesis back then.

2139
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Let's ask.

2140
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
There's one way to find out, Raginator.

2141
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Did you have a Super Nintendo Dark Sakura when it first came out?

2142
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Or were you only at Genesis' house?

2143
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Yeah.

2144
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:01,000
In fact, we had to choose, and my mom asked me specifically, what gaming system do we need in the house?

2145
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
And I said, I want a Super Nintendo because Link to the Past is on it.

2146
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
And that's how it went, and we had a Super Scope as well.

2147
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I guess I was mistaken.

2148
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I must remember.

2149
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
No, it's an easy mistake to make, because she is such a Sega fangirl, it is a very easy mistake to make.

2150
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:25,000
But yeah, so she had the Super Nintendo, and how appropriate that she had the bazooka for the Super Nintendo as well.

2151
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Well, that obviously leads to my question, which I'll open up to you three, and anyone in the chat there wants to answer.

2152
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Do you remember off the top of your heads, when you got the Super Nintendo, why you got it,

2153
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,000
in what case did you at least bear with the system?

2154
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Sure, I'll go first. I think I've told this story on the show, but it's worth telling again, and I'll abbreviate it a little bit.

2155
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I got it for Christmas, I think the year after it was out, so I don't think I had it the very first year.

2156
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
No, maybe I did get it the first year. I think I did actually get it the first year, in 1991.

2157
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I'm trying to think how old it would have been. Yeah, I was in junior high, so yeah, that adds up.

2158
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:24,000
So yeah, I think I got it for Christmas that year, but my parents did that really cool trick where it was not actually under the tree at all,

2159
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:31,000
and so I opened all the other gifts, and there was no Super Nintendo, so you're kind of trying to do that thing where it's like,

2160
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I'm trying not to be an ungrateful little shit because I didn't get what I wanted, but I'm still kind of like,

2161
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,000
God damn it, that's the one thing I wanted, but you're just trying to hide it and suck it up best you can.

2162
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:49,000
But then of course, after everything is done, then I think my sister came out and was like,

2163
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Oh, there's one more thing, and it was this little tiny card, and the card opened up and it said,

2164
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Go look here, and then you go look in, I don't know, it was a closet or something, you go look in the closet,

2165
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,000
and it's like, go look here. You had to go look, so it was one of those stupid scavenger hunts where you went around the whole house,

2166
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:09,000
and then finally it ends up, I think it was under my mom's bed, big box, and I knew what it was,

2167
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:16,000
it was Super Nintendo, and I was excited, happy tears from a dumb junior high kid, but here's the hilarious thing,

2168
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I got the Super Nintendo, and I got Super Mario World, it was packed in with it, obviously, everybody got that game,

2169
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,000
but then my parents had no idea what other game to get, so they bought a game called Drakken,

2170
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:34,000
which was, I guess, an early title on the Super Nintendo, and they didn't know what to get,

2171
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,000
they asked the guy at, and I want to say it was Montgomery Ward, I feel like was where they said they got it,

2172
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:46,000
they asked the guy, what game should we get, because they didn't know what to get, and the guy said,

2173
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:53,000
well this one's selling well, or something like that, I don't know, turns out this game, it's like, nobody,

2174
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:59,000
like I would tell my friends that I had this game, nobody knew what the fuck this game was, Drakken was a real,

2175
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
and it's what, D-R-A-K-K-H-E-N, something like that?

2176
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Yeah, that was actually a pretty decent game.

2177
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It was a PC title, or something, I think they ported it over to Super Nintendo, and so when I first,

2178
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I didn't play it much, obviously, because I was obsessed with Mario World, and then I got, I think,

2179
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I think I picked up F-Zero pretty quickly after that, so I didn't really play a lot of Drakken,

2180
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:26,000
it really wasn't until about two years later I went back and I kind of sat down and forced myself to play Drakken,

2181
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,000
and I was like, I actually really like this game, it was weird, it was a role playing game, but it was like,

2182
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
you didn't control the battles at all, like you would kind of like walk around the screen and everything would auto attack,

2183
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:44,000
but it was kind of cool because it was a first person mode game, which for early Super Nintendo you didn't see a lot of that.

2184
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:52,000
There was a sequel that came out after that called Dragon's View, that's really fucking good, like that game was really good,

2185
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:58,000
and it has that same kind of first person, but then it's mixed with like a side scroll or action thing,

2186
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:04,000
which they completely changed from the original Drakken. So anyway, there's the tangent, that was my first,

2187
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:11,000
how I got my Super Nintendo and what the first game was that I had with it. Loki, your family has Super Nintendo? Yeah?

2188
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Yeah, I bought it because I sold my, I think I sold my Nintendo to get a Super Nintendo,

2189
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:26,000
and so I don't remember all the early games they got with it, maybe I think Legend of Zelda was one of them,

2190
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:35,000
but I do remember one of the first games I had, because they didn't have Super Mario World, was Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally.

2191
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Awesome. Which actually it's not a bad game, it's just like it's basically Roadrunner's Sonic the Hedgehog.

2192
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Isn't that like one of the few games they like can't emulate right? Yeah, I think it is.

2193
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I think I heard about like the boxes on stage six or something, they don't appear, it's like some really weird emulation,

2194
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
I was reading some article about it. I did end up beating him, but yeah, it's a pretty hard game.

2195
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Because you end up going like to Mars and there's Marvin the Martian stuff. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't bad.

2196
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I, well first of all my mom got it from my brothers, but forget them, it was mine.

2197
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:18,000
So we got A Link to the Past, of course we got the package of Super Mario World, and Home Alone.

2198
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Because my brothers were super into Home Alone at the time. That game was terrible.

2199
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
It wasn't just terrible, it was terra-bad. It gave me virtual cancer.

2200
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Jamie. Virtual, not real. I felt ill playing it, I'll put it that way.

2201
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And then we also had the Super Scope, and I played a lot of Blastress. A lot of Blastress.

2202
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Of course you loved the bazooka. Of course I did. But I probably beat A Link to the Past like...

2203
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Oh yeah, game was so good. So quickly, and then I played through it again.

2204
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,000
And my mom's like, now you need to let your brothers play, it's like they can play when I'm at school.

2205
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
They're in school too. So, that's their problem.

2206
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Here's some answers from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2207
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
JD says, my first Super Nintendo game was Donkey Kong Country.

2208
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:15,000
AkumaJP said, I got my Super Nintendo late because I had to work to get it. I got it with Street Fighter 2.

2209
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:20,000
SSJ100Matt says, my parents made me save up my money to get a Super Nintendo.

2210
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I had to roll pennies and do chores for my grandparents to get the money for it.

2211
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I was seven when this happened. It taught me the value of saving and importance of spending it wisely.

2212
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I like that. Let's see, and yeah, those are some comments.

2213
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Oh, Act F says, I can't remember what game I got with my Super Nintendo.

2214
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Aside Super Mario World, of course. Those are some answers from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2215
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Ooh, this is another good answer. Dungeon Buster says, one of my first games was Actraiser.

2216
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Yes, the game was so good. Stayed up all night to play it.

2217
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Thank goodness it was on a weekend, so no school the next day. Ooh, I love that game.

2218
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I remember renting that, and yes, I did stay up all night to play it.

2219
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I think we all did. The game was awesome.

2220
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I had a lot of Mega Man X fun too.

2221
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Ragenator, what about you? Did you ever officially get to buy a Super Nintendo? What was your story behind it?

2222
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Yeah, in fact, a slight tangent that relates to the story.

2223
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Back in the early 90s, my one brother and I used to have paper routes together, and that's how we made a little extra money for ourselves.

2224
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And we used to do those on the weekend, and pretty much every single cent that we made went into our respective bank accounts.

2225
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:43,000
All that being said, I didn't get the Super Nintendo right away back in 91.

2226
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,000
However, I kept seeing the commercials for it.

2227
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I saw it mentioned on GameProTV, and even the neighbors across the street in the game line, and I saw it being played and all that.

2228
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I thought, this is the most awesome system I've ever seen in my life.

2229
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:14,000
And considering that I had all this money in the bank saved up, I begged my parents to let me spend my own money to go buy a Super Nintendo.

2230
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And as a second sight, they were a little hypocritical spending money left and right that they didn't have, but they wouldn't let me spend my own money on something that I could afford.

2231
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:37,000
But eventually I did make them break down and let me buy a Super Nintendo on my own.

2232
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:48,000
My father took me over to this little store that's local to my area at the time called Best Buy, not Best Buy, Brand Aims.

2233
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:54,000
And I bought the Super Nintendo itself, which came with Super Mario World.

2234
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:08,000
And just for shits and giggles, my father bought two games that I recommended that I researched the crap out of, which was Super Castlevania IV and Actraiser.

2235
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Because I thought that... Castlevania was a good series. I played the original on the Nintendo.

2236
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I saw the gameplay on GameProTV. It looked good, especially the one on stage with the rotating tunnel.

2237
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And plus, the soundtrack seemed amazing, and it was. It really showed off the sound chip on the system.

2238
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Same with Actraiser. Great soundtrack. And for a while, those three games lasted us a while. We played the crap out of them.

2239
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Eventually I ended up getting all the games like SimCity, SimEarth, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo.

2240
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
You know, it's interesting because SimCity was really good on Super Nintendo because they added kind of the Nintendo-y elements to it.

2241
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,000
They added like the... Bowser replaced Godzilla, and you get like a Mario statue and all the silly stuff.

2242
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:09,000
But SimEarth was really bad compared to the PC version.

2243
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Yeah, honestly, the only game that I bought over the years that I regretted buying was the original Mortal Kombat.

2244
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Because back then I was really into fighting games, and I thought, oh, Mortal Kombat, I know that was a great arcade game.

2245
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I wanted it for home. Bought the game. Oh my God, I regretted that purchase virtually instantly.

2246
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I still loved it, but the whole sweat thing was really cheesy.

2247
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Yeah, but eventually, obviously, Nintendo learned their mistake from that game.

2248
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
They put the violence and the blood back into Mortal Kombat 2 and whatnot.

2249
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
And the later games were definitely better.

2250
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:03,000
But, you know, a great system. One of my favorite, you know, two favorite games for the system was from React Tracer Castlevania IV.

2251
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:11,000
It would be Killer Instinct with the Pakken soundtrack, which was the first soundtrack I ever got.

2252
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And that got me started on collecting soundtracks.

2253
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Super Ghost of Ghosts. Great game.

2254
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Wow, lots of good picks. Lots of good reminiscent down memory lane for Super Nintendo.

2255
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for the trip down memory lane tonight.

2256
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Sure, have a nice night.

2257
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Yep, take care of you too.

2258
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,000
A lot of positive feedback to Castlevania IV in our chat room.

2259
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
By the way, OrangeLoungeRadio, all in a word on Skype if you want to call in.

2260
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I see a lot of positive feedback for the Castlevania IV. DungeonBuster says,

2261
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Yay, I love the track that plays during the swinging chandelier stage.

2262
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Oh yeah, that stage was so awesome too.

2263
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Let's see, VidPower says, Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat had sweat and neutered fatalities. So sad.

2264
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
It was so interesting what they could have and what they couldn't have.

2265
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Because if I remember right, like, Sonya still had the kiss thing that would incinerate.

2266
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Like, that was okay. You could set somebody on fire and that was okay.

2267
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,000
But what was it? Like, Johnny Cage would just uppercut them. That's it.

2268
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Because the head can't pop off like it did in the arcade game.

2269
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
And then what? They really changed sub-zeroes, right?

2270
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Sub-zero would do the deep freeze and then shatter them into a million pieces.

2271
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
But again, no blood, so it was okay.

2272
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
But then didn't they, in one of the later Mortal Kombat games,

2273
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
didn't they actually give him that fatality again as a throwback?

2274
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
But it was, like, way gorier.

2275
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I think so.

2276
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I think they did in one of the later ones. Either it was the Mortal Kombat 9 or one of the other ones.

2277
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
They kind of redid it.

2278
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Alright, one last call here for calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2279
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
You could also use the phone lines to do an old-school 1877 game, O-L-R, if you want to do it that way.

2280
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,000
One other thing I was thinking of that wasn't in our show world tonight,

2281
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
but it occurred to me was a big news thing.

2282
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I guess maybe because I've been playing World of Warcraft or Battle.net related games.

2283
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
I don't know if you guys know, but Battle.net added into the launcher this week.

2284
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
And I knew it was coming, because I think we talked about that the feature was coming on the show.

2285
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
But now you can stream to Facebook natively within the Battle.net app.

2286
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:22,000
So Facebook is starting to make their play for a piece of that Twitch TV, YouTube gaming, and that whole thing.

2287
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:30,000
But I've got to admit, part of why I like Twitch and why I like YouTube gaming and stuff

2288
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
is more the discoverability there.

2289
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
But if I stream on Facebook, it's only going to be limited to my friends.

2290
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:41,000
There's not going to be as much discoverability there to meet new people and stuff.

2291
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Which, I mean, I guess it could be cool that I could stream games just for friends.

2292
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Like, you know, come see how bad I am at Overwatch.

2293
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Or watch, you know, I'm going to play some of my friends on Facebook at Overwatch,

2294
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
and here's what it looks like from my perspective, that whole thing.

2295
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
But I don't know, I'm not really interested in Facebook as a streaming platform.

2296
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Plus, one reason why I think Twitch does so well with the streaming and everything is because

2297
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:12,000
it's on mobile, it's on PlayStation, it's on Xbox, it's everywhere.

2298
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
You know, there's a Twitch app almost everywhere.

2299
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I guess, granted, though, Facebook, you know, they do have the mobile app,

2300
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
and you can watch things within that, so there is that.

2301
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:24,000
But I just don't know if I see that being as big of a thing.

2302
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
But it is built into the Battle.net thing, which is, you know,

2303
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Blizzard's a pretty big company, and those are some heavy-hitting PC games.

2304
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I mean, that means now you can stream directly what?

2305
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Overwatch, all right there.

2306
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Very, very, very easily. So, interesting.

2307
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Alright, well, oh, and DarkTetsuya in chat says,

2308
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
oh, no wonder, a friend of mine was streaming Overwatch to her Facebook,

2309
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
so I guess that's what that was about, yeah.

2310
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
And BobbyBlackWolf says, can I stream Rock and Roll Racing?

2311
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I don't think that's in the Battle.net launcher, sadly.

2312
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:08,000
At one point, they released, was it that or was it their other game from that era?

2313
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Maybe it was, but it's not actually within the Battle.net launcher.

2314
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
It's just like a separate executable file you just play.

2315
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
So, I think it does have to be built into the launcher.

2316
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I don't think you could actually stream old Warcraft.

2317
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Or is, I don't know, is old Warcraft in the Battle.net launcher?

2318
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Warcraft 3 might be, but I don't think Warcraft 1 and 2 are.

2319
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Unless you still have CDs.

2320
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Well, yeah, but then, but the CDs are still gonna be independent of the launcher,

2321
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
which has the broadcast software built in it.

2322
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Oh, I was thinking of like Twitch.

2323
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I just thought maybe they were too old, like, you know,

2324
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
some of those older games don't play well, even though they're on newer systems.

2325
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Sure, sure.

2326
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,000
All right, well, let's see, and Kaijuto says,

2327
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
you can pretty much produce a show on just Twitch alone.

2328
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Yeah, that's true.

2329
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
I mean, if we were to set up this show on Twitch,

2330
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
we probably would get exposed to new people,

2331
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
and that's something we may still think about doing in the future,

2332
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
but right now, you know, we're still orange on radio for the time being.

2333
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
But yeah, you know, whole nother platform there.

2334
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
All right, well, nobody else is calling in,

2335
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
so I guess too many people watching those silly video music awards on MTV.

2336
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Oh my God, did you see what Beyoncé did?

2337
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,000
No, I've been doing this fucking show, Jamie.

2338
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Yeah, but you were looking at your phone.

2339
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
How did you see it?

2340
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Because I'm on Facebook right now.

2341
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Oh, what did she do?

2342
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
She brought out the, uh, Traven Martin's mother

2343
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,000
and the other two boys' mother on the red carpet with her,

2344
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
and her daughter who has the tutu I always wanted as a kid.

2345
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Ah.

2346
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
So, bravo to her.

2347
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Yeah, but did she do anything in her, did she perform?

2348
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Yeah, she did Lemonade.

2349
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Oh, okay. Okay.

2350
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
And then, um, all the queens, except for Adore,

2351
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,000
were all wearing other famous celebrity outfits.

2352
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Yeah, I saw that from Drag Race, right?

2353
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Like, Fifi did the meat dress.

2354
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Um, Adore just posted, she was, like, in Manchester Pride District.

2355
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
She's overseas right now.

2356
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Yeah.

2357
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
So, I guess it didn't work out.

2358
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Anyway, interesting.

2359
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Uh, Sia Tabarian Chat says,

2360
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:07,000
When will we get the MTV Video Game Music Awards?

2361
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with Act Deaf,

2362
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:13,000
hopefully never, because that's just not something I want MTV producing.

2363
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
You know, the one that Jeff Keighley did,

2364
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
which I don't even remember the name of it now,

2365
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
but it's in December.

2366
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
It's just the Video Game Awards?

2367
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Yeah, the Video Game Awards.

2368
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Okay.

2369
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Like, the first year, the fact that it acknowledged Roberta Williams

2370
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
gave it big props in my book,

2371
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
and then, you know, it's getting to be,

2372
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
remember the whole, like, throwing shade at Konami Live

2373
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
during the thing?

2374
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
That was pretty cool.

2375
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Where he just, like, read the house down,

2376
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
why Hideo Kojima couldn't be there?

2377
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
So, like, I'm like,

2378
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
okay, this thing shows a lot of promise,

2379
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
and I think it's going to age very well,

2380
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
so I'm willing to let that, you know,

2381
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
see what that looks like year three.

2382
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I think a lot of us were very worried,

2383
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
because he was also involved with the Spike TV thing,

2384
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,000
which is kind of what an MTV Video Game Music Awards,

2385
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
whatever the fuck, would have looked like.

2386
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
But this new one he's doing is pretty good,

2387
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,000
so we'll see what happens year three.

2388
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
We will.

2389
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
All right.

2390
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Well, that is going to do it

2391
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2392
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,000
We will be back to do this all again in two weeks.

2393
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Loki's birthday show on September 11th.

2394
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
How old are you this year?

2395
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
36.

2396
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
36.

2397
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
You're old, so am I.

2398
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I can't wait until you're 37.

2399
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
In a row.

2400
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
In a row.

2401
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
All right.

2402
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Well, anyway, we'll be back.

2403
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Dark Sakura, we're going to be shaking things up a little bit.

2404
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Dark Sakura will be here.

2405
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
She just won't be here live.

2406
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I'll be here dead.

2407
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
She'll be here.

2408
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I'll hunt.

2409
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Dark Sakura is going to still grace us

2410
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
with the Classic Game of the Week

2411
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,000
and ensure that Loki doesn't put Halo there in her absence.

2412
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I won't put Halo there.

2413
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Well, I still won't be there if I don't approve it.

2414
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
But it doesn't matter.

2415
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
You can say it, but it doesn't mean it'll happen.

2416
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
It doesn't matter because Dark Sakura's

2417
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
going to still do that segment for us,

2418
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
so we'll have just a few little cosmetic changes on the show.

2419
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Fine.

2420
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I'll start my own Classic Game of the Week

2421
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
with hookers and blackjack.

2422
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Was that a game, hookers and blackjack?

2423
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
No, it's from Futurama.

2424
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
It should be.

2425
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
No.

2426
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Well, that should be a game.

2427
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,000
So, as we say here every week at Orange Lounge Radio,

2428
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
if you enjoyed what you heard on the show,

2429
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
please tell a friend or five about the show.

2430
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Help us spread the word.

2431
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,000
A nice five-star review wherever you found this show,

2432
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,000
like iTunes or Google Music or wherever,

2433
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
that goes an awful long way, so please consider that.

2434
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I'd really appreciate it,

2435
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
as would we all here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2436
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I hope to see many of you at Dragon Con this next week

2437
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
or at some of the other conventions coming up

2438
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
in the next few months.

2439
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
But until then, let's go around and get everybody's

2440
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
final thought for the night.

2441
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Dark Sakura, we'll see you in a few months.

2442
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Probably not that long.

2443
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
You might have some time off or something

2444
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
where you can still play with us at some point,

2445
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
but do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2446
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Same.

2447
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
All right, and my final thought tonight is

2448
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,000
you need to take those pineapple cake things with you

2449
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
because I don't want any more.

2450
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,000
You need to take the rest of those cookies

2451
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
that you brought here with you,

2452
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
get them out of my house

2453
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
because I'm going on an emergency diet.

2454
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,000
No, I'm leaving them.

2455
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:04,000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

2456
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I don't know.

2457
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I guess I'll play more No Man's Sky.

2458
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Might as well.

2459
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Might as well.

2460
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Got nothing else to do.

2461
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Got to get to that center of the universe

2462
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,000
so that I can have no ending.

2463
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I'm hearing people are not happy about that.

2464
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I'm trying to keep myself free of the spoilers and all that,

2465
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
but I'm hearing people are like,

2466
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
it's the new Mass Effect 3.

2467
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
We'll see, though.

2468
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I thought I already spoiled it.

2469
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

2470
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
If you did, I wasn't listening,

2471
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
and that's probably for the best.

2472
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
All right, times when it was a good idea

2473
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
to not listen to Loki.

2474
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
All right, that's it.

2475
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
We're out of here.

2476
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
We'll see you in two weeks.

2477
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Have a wonderful Labor Day and be safe.

2478
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Goodbye, everybody.

2479
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
