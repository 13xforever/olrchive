7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, could you soon be playing PlayStation games on your PC and legally? Sure looks like it. Of course, there's always a weak slim PS4 if that doesn't work. We talk about this news and much more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight. Episode number 656 for this, August the 28th of 2016.
44000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining you from lovely Sacramento, California Studio N7 with my co-hosts here in studio and all of you in our chat room around the world.
56000	69000	Live.vognetwork.com but here in studio by my side as she always is and would never leave me for an extended period of time. Not on purpose. Is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Bitch I brought you cookies.
69000	82000	You did. Oh my gosh. She brought me cookies. They're the best cookies I've ever put in my mouth. And I've been thinking about, you know, maybe I should try to lose some weight before like GamerX and Final Fantasy Fan Fest.
82000	95000	That's why I'm doing this now so we have a month. Get it out of your system Rob. And then also, well, Alan has also, I don't know if you know, but he's lost quite a bit of weight and was, you know, was kind of humble bragging a little bit the other day about how he's lost weight.
95000	107000	I've decided I'm going to call him Alan Aska. Because of the hair. And no listeners are going to understand. In fact, Alan probably won't even understand. Because of the hair. It's Alaska hair.
107000	115000	We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
115000	123000	And if you are listening live, you can join our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and Rover Desk starting us off tonight wanting to know where are our cookies.
123000	124000	Come get them.
124000	128000	Actually, when you visit vognetwork.com, I think we put a cookie in your browser.
128000	129000	Yeah.
129000	137000	But it's not one of those like skeezy kinds that you read about. It's just to remember like that you're logged into the site. So you can check in and get your points and all that good stuff.
137000	138000	Hint, hint.
138000	139000	Yeah.
139000	140000	Check in.
140000	151000	That's right. Sign up for the, it's free. We don't spam you. We just, you know, like to be able to tell potential people to come on the network and partner with like look at all these engaged users we have because that does go a long way.
151000	156000	So, all right. Say hello, of course, to Techmaster Loki.
156000	157000	Hi.
157000	158000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
158000	159000	I'm okay.
159000	166000	Are you, now is that Slurpee your dinner? Because usually you bring dinner to the show with you because, you know, we're right about dinner time, but tonight you just brought a Slurpee.
166000	170000	Yeah, because I made food like I had lunch at like four or so.
170000	173000	Oh, I thought maybe you were on the Slurpee diet and I was like, that's my kind of diet.
173000	174000	Slurpee diet?
174000	175000	Yeah.
175000	176000	That's not a bad idea.
176000	180000	I don't think I'd lose any weight from that, but very unhealthy.
180000	181000	It would sure be fun trying.
181000	185000	It's like fast track to diabetes. Yeah.
185000	187000	I know, right? Oh my gosh.
187000	195000	So anyhow, here we are assembled in studio and as I referenced a minute ago, Dark Soccer is actually going to be taking a hiatus in the show.
195000	201000	She doesn't want to, but you know, some things are more important than OLR, including jobs that pay bills.
201000	204000	So Dark Soccer is going to be taking some time off for about a couple months.
204000	208000	I'm going to do my best to get, you know, some Sundays off when I can.
208000	210000	And I told her she needs 20 November off.
210000	211000	Well, of course.
211000	213000	Because that is like a DDR holiday.
213000	219000	And if we stay on track, that's going to line up with episode 666 of our show, which is going to be hilarious.
219000	230000	Well, the one thing is that I've already requested like pretty much the rest of my time off until the end of September for GamerX.
230000	231000	Right, right.
231000	234000	So it's going to be really difficult for me to take time.
235000	240000	Apparently, Alan says I'm going to I was offered my own podcast on TBS and I'm going rogue.
240000	252000	I think there's a reference to Samantha Bee when she, you know, she kind of went off to do her own thing and she she's kind of doing better than the people she left behind at Comedy Central with all with all respect to Trevor Noah and all that Samantha Bee's kind of on fire.
252000	258000	Well, there are podcasts in the planning, but I would never do anything that wouldn't be vog material.
258000	260000	Well, I do I do like four podcasts.
260000	262000	I want to do another one.
262000	265000	One of the podcasts isn't even on vog.
265000	270000	I want to do another one because I think that you guys need more of me.
270000	273000	Well, we can speaking of more of me, I'm having more cookies.
273000	274000	All right.
274000	277000	You go in and you go ahead. You get those cookies.
277000	279000	Go for it.
279000	283000	We are, of course, saying, you know, temporary hiatus, dark soccer.
283000	291000	I do want to mention, since we brought up conventions, there may be some folks checking out this show for the first time because of Dragon Con, which we're going to be at.
291000	294000	Well, I'm going to be at next week in Atlanta.
294000	296000	Of course, I think this is the 30th year of Dragon Con.
296000	298000	It's a very long running convention.
298000	307000	They get tons of I kind of I try to describe it to people as like Comic Con of the south, but without the Hollywood like it's like pretty much all fan driven.
307000	319000	And my understanding more and more, especially as I talk to more cosplayers, is that it's really becoming known as like a cosplay like like bring your a game of cosplay to Dragon Con and lots of great stuff comes out of that.
319000	327000	In fact, I did my first and only cosplay at Dragon Con last year, which sadly I'm not bringing back this year, but it was fun last year.
327000	335000	So I have we have that and some folks we will be you can catch me as a presenter at the Parsick Awards on Sunday night.
335000	338000	We're actually we have our pal at Pod Culture.
338000	342000	Pals at Pod Culture are nominated for their spinoff show, TARDIS interrupt us.
342000	344000	They are actually nominated this year.
344000	345000	That's very exciting.
345000	348000	But we're presenting a different award, obviously conflict of interest.
348000	350000	We're presenting a different award at the show.
350000	352000	So that's really cool that we're involved there.
352000	356000	Our pals at Critical Myth and British Invaders are all over the TV related tracks.
356000	361000	Brit track, of course, for British invaders and some of the television related tracks for Critical Myth.
361000	362000	They have some panels.
362000	366000	We're going to be compiling all that over at VOG Network dot com in this coming week.
366000	368000	So you guys know where to catch us at Dragon Con.
368000	370000	That's very exciting.
370000	372000	And then we will also be Dark Soccer.
372000	377000	Myself will be at Gamer X4, which I'm now hearing is supposed to be the last one.
377000	380000	I guess is I feel like they say that every year.
380000	382000	They say that every year it's going to be the last one.
382000	384000	Then suddenly there's another one.
384000	386000	But regardless, I hope it's not.
386000	388000	But regardless, we have fun every year we go.
388000	390000	So we're gonna be there again this year and we will.
390000	394000	In fact, they we just we just wrote the check this past week.
394000	399000	We will have a table once again where you can come say hello to us there at the festival.
399000	400000	And possibly get condoms.
400000	403000	And I mean, yes, that's a whole nother side story.
403000	406000	Dark Soccer got a donation for Gamer X.
406000	407000	You know what they gave her?
407000	409000	A big box of condoms.
409000	413000	Condoms, Rose. Condoms, condoms, condoms.
413000	414000	Yes.
414000	418000	This is why you don't go to like one of those family planning clinics for free donations.
420000	425000	So we'll be making balloon animals at our table over at VOG Network at GX4.
425000	427000	And then go fuck yourself.
427000	428000	Here you go.
428000	433000	And then I will be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest, which I know is a lot more niche.
433000	436000	But I do really enjoy Final Fantasy 14.
436000	438000	So I I made sure to get tickets to that event.
438000	439000	So I'm excited to go to that.
439000	443000	I know that's and if you didn't get tickets to it, you're not going to because it's sold out a long time ago.
443000	447000	But there is Mag Fest if you want to look forward to 2017.
447000	449000	So I have a lot of cons coming up in the next few months.
449000	455000	It's like I've had a con drought and now I'm going to I'm going to be fucking sick of conventions by the time Mag Fest is over.
455000	457000	Although that's not going to be true.
457000	458000	I love Mag Fest.
458000	460000	So I'm just very excited for the coming months.
460000	462000	So I look forward to seeing you all.
462000	465000	Anyhow, we need to get into some gaming talk.
465000	469000	I want to talk about our gaming weeks as well as what's going on in the gaming news.
469000	475000	But we like to usually start off with a kickoff topic, something to kind of get us started here with what's going on.
475000	478000	So, Loki, you've got a report here.
478000	481000	Could you tell us about this here about what's going on with PlayStation Plus?
481000	484000	Obviously, this is getting a lot of social media buzz this week.
484000	488000	So PlayStation Plus, they've decided to bring it to the PC.
488000	498000	So along with bringing the service there, they're also bringing this USB controller adapter so you don't have to be wired into the PC with it.
498000	501000	Which is nice, I guess.
501000	503000	Yeah.
503000	508000	But does this mean we're not getting backwards compatibility for the PlayStation games?
508000	511000	Because it's like, but PlayStation now?
511000	513000	Yeah?
513000	515000	You want to sign up for it still?
515000	517000	Because I don't want to sign up for it still.
517000	522000	I don't fucking give a crap about it on the PlayStation, let alone on PC.
522000	524000	Ooh, I can play the classic games.
524000	528000	Well, I'd rather just have the games I bought already work on it.
528000	531000	I wonder how that service is doing.
531000	538000	I wonder if the numbers are not where Sony was hoping for them to be, which might be part of the reason why they're putting it on PC.
539000	545000	But at the end of the day, even if PlayStation Now is doing very, very well, why not expand your audience?
545000	547000	Hell, it works for Netflix, right?
547000	551000	Why is Netflix so popular? Probably because it's on every single stinking device that's out there.
551000	554000	I think it'd be cooler if it was on smart TVs or something like that.
554000	557000	I think it'd be neat if it was on Xbox One.
557000	566000	So, since I never used the PlayStation Now service, is that the ones for just the old PlayStation games?
566000	568000	Well, by old, we mean PlayStation 3.
568000	574000	You know, it's a PC app, and if they developed it for the Windows Store, which I really don't think they'd ever get past them,
574000	578000	it could be a universal app, which they could be playable on the PlayStation, or Xbox One.
578000	581000	I'd be interested if they had the Vita stuff.
581000	589000	Oh, okay. Well, yeah, because I'm thinking, you know, one thing that Sony did try to do is that they have the Vita TV.
589000	591000	This is the PlayStation TV in the U.S.
591000	597000	But it played Vita games, some of them, which was a weird thing to begin with.
597000	602000	But then it also was, hey, you can hook in PlayStation Now right into your TV, right?
602000	607000	Just because there's a few games that I think I would want to play.
607000	617000	But, I mean, we actually have our PS3 still hooked up, because for some reason our PS4 doesn't like our sound system,
617000	620000	so we've never been able to get it to work with our Blu-rays.
620000	623000	And we've got a really good Harman Kardon system in the house, so.
623000	630000	Yeah. I do like the fact that there's such a huge library on PlayStation Now,
630000	633000	so I do feel like, wow, I could catch up with all these games.
633000	638000	But in a way, I mean, one of the reasons why I haven't gone for it is that I'm worried it's almost overload.
638000	643000	It would be like so many games, and, you know, I'm already bad when it comes to gamer ADD.
643000	648000	It's like, you know, I play one thing for a week, and then it's like, ooh, shiny, something else is out.
648000	650000	Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I guess.
650000	655000	It's part of the reason I'm almost happy that Final Fantasy XV got delayed,
655000	657000	because maybe I actually will get to the center of the game.
657000	660000	When I've seen the PlayStation Now, like, they have the library available,
660000	667000	like, you can see what's available on their service, and it's not really anything I want to play.
667000	669000	And I just don't see the...
669000	671000	It isn't everything. That's a very important point.
671000	674000	And I think it's stupid, like, come on, you guys.
674000	678000	I mean, yeah, I understand you're really trying to push the service because you can see money being made on it,
678000	681000	but no one wants it. No one wants that service.
681000	685000	They just want you to do backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2.
685000	689000	Now, granted, I understand the PlayStation 2 might be a little bit more difficult to do,
689000	692000	but come on, the PSP plays PlayStation 1 games.
692000	698000	You can't tell me that the PlayStation 4, this powerhouse of, like, a PC,
698000	701000	can't possibly emulate PlayStation 1 games.
701000	706000	Like, a really shitty cell phone can emulate PlayStation 1 games.
706000	710000	I do feel a little bit like, as a consumer or whatever,
710000	714000	that it would be really nice if I had a PlayStation 3 disc,
714000	716000	which I still have many PlayStation 3 games,
716000	720000	I could put it in my PlayStation 4 and I could play that game on PlayStation Now.
720000	724000	Like, you know, clearly that technology is available,
724000	727000	so I just don't understand why I guess I can't do it.
727000	729000	Maybe they're worried about piracy or something,
729000	732000	where people could fake discs that have the ID or something.
732000	734000	Maybe that's what they're concerned about.
734000	736000	That's why I feel like it's double dipping.
736000	739000	But that's a lot of trouble just to play a PlayStation 3 game.
739000	741000	That's a lot of trouble.
741000	744000	Oh, to make a fake game or whatever?
744000	746000	Yeah, but a hacker's gonna hack, Loki. It'll happen.
746000	748000	No one's gonna do that for PlayStation Now.
748000	749000	You don't think so?
749000	750000	I don't think it's worth it.
750000	752000	Well, it doesn't matter because it's not a thing anyway.
752000	755000	For whatever reason, that's not what Sony's doing.
755000	757000	But, yeah, I don't know.
757000	760000	It's just like, I'm sorry, but Microsoft's kicking their ass
760000	762000	as far as backwards compatibility support.
762000	765000	Granted, they don't have three systems to support,
765000	769000	but they're supporting the Xbox 360, which is, I think, pretty decent.
769000	773000	That's better than PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.
773000	776000	And, I don't know, it seems pretty awesome.
776000	780000	Yeah, again, it would be nice if, you know,
780000	782000	even as a PlayStation Plus subscriber,
782000	785000	if I could get one or two games on PlayStation Now or something.
785000	787000	Well, here's the rub on that, too.
787000	789000	It's like, oh, yeah, we made it.
789000	790000	We got an emulator.
790000	795000	We are able to get these PlayStation 2 games to work on the system,
795000	797000	but you gotta buy them again.
797000	798000	Yeah, you gotta buy them again.
798000	800000	It's like, what the hell?
800000	802000	I mean, it's just greed.
802000	804000	Let's get to some comments from our chat room
804000	806000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
806000	807000	Ragenator in chat says,
807000	811000	Sky, it sounds like PlayStation Now on the PC might be good
811000	815000	for those like me who no longer have a Sony system for whatever reason.
815000	820000	Yeah, there's people out there that don't have a Sony system.
820000	823000	Kind of interesting because that makes me think,
823000	826000	okay, well, maybe there's people out there that decided to go Microsoft only.
826000	831000	They're an Xbox household, and they decided not to go with Sony,
831000	833000	that Xbox One was what they wanted, and so that's what they have,
833000	835000	and they're not getting both systems.
836000	840000	What's interesting is that if Sony has PlayStation Now on the PC,
840000	844000	it's interesting how like Microsoft and the PC due to Windows 10,
844000	846000	how those are so tied together.
846000	849000	So it's almost interesting how Sony kind of fits into that dynamic now
849000	856000	is that, well, I guess in a way you don't need a PlayStation 3,
856000	859000	but you still need a PlayStation 4 to play those games,
859000	862000	but you wouldn't necessarily need a PlayStation 3 unless,
862000	864000	well, the games you want to play aren't included in PlayStation Now,
864000	866000	which is also a distinct possibility.
866000	874000	And let's also talk about the other thing about PlayStation Now is the cost.
874000	878000	It's $20 a month, or, oh, I'm sorry, $45 for three months
878000	880000	if you want to do it that way.
880000	883000	That's fucking expensive, especially when you have like Netflix and stuff
883000	888000	that's like eight bucks, and this isn't like brand new games either.
888000	890000	Yeah, I don't know.
890000	892000	I don't know where the right price is because then I'm thinking,
892000	895000	well, Loki, a new game costs 60 bucks.
895000	897000	And I know these are not new games,
897000	900000	but many of them were 60 bucks when they came out.
900000	904000	So in that regard, I'm kind of like, actually, the price doesn't seem awful,
904000	908000	but maybe if there was just a few more of the big, big, big titles in there,
908000	912000	or heck, maybe if they started doing some of the PlayStation 4 stuff,
912000	916000	because I would imagine it's capable of doing PlayStation 4 stuff as well
916000	918000	with the whole streaming thing,
918000	922000	maybe it would make the pot a little sweeter, I don't know.
922000	928000	So, let's see, more comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
928000	932000	Let's see, Raginator says maybe the PlayStation 4 can't do PlayStation 1 games
932000	934000	due to the differences in chipsets.
934000	937000	Yeah, but if it can do PlayStation 2 games at this point,
937000	939000	they've figured it out.
939000	941000	If it can do PlayStation 2, it can do PlayStation 4.
941000	943000	It's not even chips anymore.
943000	945000	It's not running off of native hardware.
945000	947000	It's running off of an emulator.
947000	948000	Come on.
948000	952000	I mean, the PlayStation Portable was not native hardware either,
952000	955000	but that was able to run PlayStation 1 games.
955000	957000	What is the deal here?
957000	958000	I don't understand.
958000	960000	And then SGA100Matt points out in chat,
960000	965000	they have those humble PlayStation bundles this week with PlayStation 3 games.
965000	967000	That's a really good point.
967000	970000	I haven't really looked into this week's bundle,
970000	972000	but would I necessarily want to get that
972000	975000	because my PlayStation 3 isn't really hooked up anymore.
975000	977000	There's some PlayStation 4 games in there.
977000	978000	I might still do it for charity, but you know.
978000	979000	Well, and also it's Capcom,
979000	981000	and there's some PlayStation 4 games in there as well.
981000	983000	Oh, that's good. That's good.
983000	984000	So there's a handful of those.
984000	987000	But wouldn't it be nice if I bought something like that,
987000	991000	then the stuff that is on PlayStation 3 is enabled in PlayStation Now,
991000	993000	and I can go play those things,
993000	996000	because that's the way it works on Microsoft's side essentially.
996000	998000	I mean, it doesn't stream on Microsoft's side,
998000	1002000	but the nice thing about my Xbox One is that every other week
1002000	1005000	it's I have this little present in my games inventory
1005000	1007000	of something I played on Xbox 360.
1007000	1008000	Because you invested all that money in,
1008000	1009000	and they're keeping it with you,
1009000	1013000	but now you have these other companies,
1013000	1015000	Nintendo, PlayStation.
1015000	1019000	Oh, and PlayStation, it's kind of surprising
1019000	1022000	because they've been so good about this whole cross-buy thing
1022000	1024000	for like the longest time now,
1024000	1025000	and now they're kind of going back on it.
1025000	1031000	Well, yeah, these are different because they're on PlayStation 4 now,
1031000	1033000	and you have to re-buy these PlayStation 2 games.
1033000	1037000	It's stupid. It really is.
1037000	1040000	S2100Matt says, yeah, Microsoft got blasted
1040000	1043000	for their backwards compatibility when the system was announced.
1043000	1045000	Now they're doing it better than Sony right now,
1045000	1046000	and I would agree.
1046000	1050000	Microsoft is essentially kind of a model for backwards compatibility.
1050000	1053000	Now, it would have been nicer if this was there when the system launched
1053000	1056000	and if maybe it was more games at a time,
1056000	1059000	especially if it had been like a good big large chunk of them
1059000	1060000	all at once in the beginning.
1060000	1063000	But you can't alter the past, so I feel like...
1063000	1064000	At least they're working on it.
1064000	1065000	At least they're working on it.
1065000	1068000	Versus Sony, who's just radio silence.
1068000	1069000	Yeah, yeah.
1069000	1071000	Or wants you to subscribe for this thing for 20 bucks a month.
1071000	1075000	So, yeah, I think I really think Sony ought to think about
1075000	1080000	maybe at least if they're hurting for PlayStation Now or whatever,
1080000	1086000	let people play at least the stuff they bought digitally on PlayStation 3.
1086000	1090000	Let them use PlayStation Now for that stuff on their PlayStation 4.
1090000	1093000	And heck, maybe that would get the thing installed on people's computers,
1093000	1097000	well, on their computers now with the PC or their PlayStation 4,
1097000	1100000	and maybe it would make them curious to perhaps jump in
1100000	1103000	and spend the 20 bucks a month to get all the games unlocked.
1103000	1105000	So, just something to think about.
1105000	1108000	I think if I were Sony, I would really want to give some thought
1108000	1110000	to this backwards compatibility
1110000	1113000	and how essentially Microsoft's doing it better right now.
1113000	1115000	So, let's see.
1115000	1119000	Also in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
1119000	1124000	Kossen wants to point out the Humble Bundle has Okami HD and Strider,
1124000	1126000	so it's worth looking into.
1126000	1129000	Strider was a PlayStation Plus game at one point, though, if I'm not mistaken.
1129000	1134000	So, I think a lot of people already have that, but it was still a good game.
1134000	1136000	It doesn't take away from the fact that if you missed it somehow,
1136000	1138000	now is a good time to get it.
1138000	1139000	Let's see.
1139000	1141000	Also, Raginator says, well, I can tell you this, Sky.
1141000	1146000	If Super Stardust HD is on the PC version of PlayStation Now, sold.
1146000	1148000	Take my money.
1148000	1150000	I feel like that ought to be.
1150000	1154000	All the Sony first and second party stuff is on there, right?
1154000	1156000	I like the PlayStation 3 things, yeah.
1156000	1158000	Yeah, I don't see why Super Stardust HD isn't in there.
1158000	1161000	I mean, double check, but I think, Raginator, you might have some luck there.
1161000	1163000	It ought to be in there.
1163000	1167000	Is it going to be worth 20 bucks a month, though, to play that one game?
1167000	1170000	Well, of course, granted, you're going to have access to a ton of other games as well.
1170000	1172000	Well, and on top of that, it's like, okay.
1172000	1176000	Still, I don't like the fact that I have to still stream this stuff,
1176000	1179000	because I have bandwidth.
1179000	1183000	I mean, if my wife is watching Netflix or something,
1183000	1189000	streaming a game to my PC and Netflix, thank God I don't have bandwidth caps.
1189000	1192000	It's just kind of unreasonable, I think.
1192000	1198000	Just enable this to be downloaded to my PC, or not my PC, but my PlayStation 4,
1198000	1200000	and be done with it.
1200000	1202000	I don't understand what the big deal is.
1202000	1206000	Fifth Dream actually linked us to a resource, a good old Wikipedia,
1206000	1209000	that actually lists all of the PlayStation Now games.
1209000	1211000	They have it also on their own site, too.
1211000	1213000	Of course they do. I'm sure they do.
1213000	1215000	But isn't Wiki awfully convenient?
1215000	1217000	As I think so.
1217000	1219000	Let's see, and Super...
1219000	1221000	Actually, I don't see Super Stardust HD in here.
1221000	1224000	Interesting. I would have assumed that was a given.
1224000	1227000	Unless I'm not looking for the right name.
1227000	1231000	Star... There's a game called Stealth Bastard Deluxe.
1231000	1233000	I've never heard of that one.
1233000	1234000	That's like the best name ever.
1234000	1236000	Yeah, I know, right?
1236000	1238000	Well, unless the game is being a stealth bastard,
1238000	1240000	it is not actually on the list.
1240000	1242000	That actually kind of surprised me.
1242000	1243000	Huh.
1243000	1247000	Alright, JD also points out Wikipedia is often better formatted
1247000	1249000	than publisher websites, lol.
1249000	1252000	Yeah, it's very low bandwidth, which sometimes makes it easier.
1252000	1254000	It's not so bloated as a website.
1254000	1258000	Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks
1258000	1261000	and the types of things that we've been playing this week.
1261000	1263000	And then we'll come back and cover some other news.
1263000	1265000	So, our gaming week, Stark Sakura.
1265000	1266000	How was your gaming week?
1266000	1269000	Danganronpa 2 and Sims 4.
1269000	1271000	And a little Pokemon Go.
1271000	1274000	I've also started playing this game called Capitals.
1274000	1279000	It's sort of like a cross between Go and Scrabble.
1279000	1282000	Not Pokemon Go, but the ancient game.
1282000	1284000	Yeah, board game Go.
1284000	1290000	Where you have to surround your enemy's base by forming words
1290000	1296000	and you encroach on their area by pushing your word barrier out closer to them.
1296000	1299000	So you take over somebody's territory through words.
1299000	1300000	Yes.
1300000	1301000	Sounds like your kind of game.
1301000	1303000	Well, it's pretty cool.
1303000	1307000	I've been enjoying it and I got to use one of the alternative spellings of yogurt.
1307000	1311000	The one with the H in it because it's in the Scrabble dictionary.
1311000	1313000	Very good.
1313000	1316000	JD in chat says, I've heard about Capitals.
1316000	1318000	I'm mad it's not available for Android yet.
1318000	1320000	So I guess it's not.
1320000	1321000	Get a real system.
1321000	1322000	Oh, stop.
1322000	1323000	All right.
1323000	1324000	Let's see.
1324000	1328000	J.D. points out the developer also made Tiny Tower a while ago.
1328000	1330000	Oh, that's a nimble bit game.
1330000	1331000	Oh, okay.
1331000	1332000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1332000	1335000	Go, that game was huge when it first came out, the Tiny Tower.
1335000	1337000	And then they had the Star Wars Tower.
1337000	1338000	Right.
1338000	1340000	And then they've done some other games that are really good, too.
1340000	1343000	It has a very unique retro style to the graphics.
1343000	1345000	Does this game have that, too?
1345000	1346000	The retro style?
1346000	1347000	It's very simple.
1347000	1348000	It doesn't really need any of that.
1348000	1349000	I see.
1349000	1353000	It's just tiles and letters and there's really not much to it.
1353000	1354000	Okay.
1354000	1355000	Fair enough.
1355000	1356000	But you should play it with me.
1356000	1358000	I'll think about it.
1358000	1359000	Okay.
1359000	1360000	Apparently Neil played it for a while.
1360000	1361000	Oh, really?
1361000	1363000	But he hasn't responded to me challenging him.
1363000	1364000	Yes.
1364000	1365000	He's running away.
1365000	1366000	Sometimes happens.
1366000	1369000	You sign up for a game and then it's like you see, oh, all these friends are playing.
1369000	1371000	Oh, wait, they stopped playing after the first week.
1371000	1372000	How dare they?
1372000	1373000	How very dare they?
1373000	1374000	That happens.
1374000	1375000	All right.
1375000	1376000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1376000	1381000	So, I played more No Man's Sky and it's pretty boring.
1381000	1383000	What a glowing review.
1383000	1384000	I know.
1384000	1386000	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
1386000	1388000	There's not really a storyline.
1388000	1391000	It's just like, oh, hey, here's this place.
1391000	1392000	Okay, cool.
1392000	1395000	You go to this warehouse, you'll learn new technology.
1395000	1396000	Okay.
1396000	1397000	That's it?
1397000	1401000	I mean, it's like, it's basically the same as what I'm normally doing.
1401000	1405000	And seriously, fuck you, this stupid space combat thing.
1405000	1408000	That thing can go fuck itself with like a spiky run.
1408000	1409000	I hate space combat.
1409000	1412000	I just like, I just say, oh, I'm going to get attacked.
1412000	1413000	I'm going back to the planet.
1413000	1416000	Yeah, but then they attack you once you leave the planet.
1416000	1420000	That's why I pulse jump out of there as soon as I get out of there.
1420000	1421000	Like, fuck you.
1421000	1422000	I'm out of here.
1422000	1423000	You're going to attack me?
1423000	1424000	I'm going to jump.
1424000	1425000	Okay, bye.
1425000	1426000	Smart.
1426000	1430000	So, yeah, their combat is just, it's god-awful.
1430000	1432000	It's seriously awful.
1432000	1435000	But I ended up on like another planet now.
1435000	1441000	I jumped another system and it's like this rainbow jungle planet now.
1441000	1442000	Cool.
1442000	1443000	It's kind of cool.
1443000	1445000	With lots of water.
1445000	1446000	And then what else?
1446000	1455000	Oh, I've been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go and then tap my Katamari.
1455000	1464000	I've stopped playing because their game froze up, so I shut it down, restarted it, freezes
1464000	1469000	on the restart, cleared the cache, restarted again, still freezing.
1469000	1472000	So, I was like, fuck, I got to just reinstall this thing.
1472000	1475000	So, uninstalled it, reinstalled it, my progress is gone.
1475000	1477000	I'm like, fuck you, Namco, I'm gone.
1477000	1478000	Didn't you cheat in that game anyway?
1478000	1479000	It doesn't matter.
1479000	1480000	You had it coming.
1480000	1481000	You had it coming.
1481000	1482000	I did not have it.
1482000	1483000	Karma sucks.
1483000	1484000	I did not have it fucking coming.
1484000	1485000	Yes, you did.
1485000	1486000	No, I didn't.
1486000	1487000	You got banned.
1487000	1489000	You're the first person to get banned from Katamari.
1489000	1491000	I didn't get fucking banned from that stupid game.
1491000	1492000	Good riddance, though.
1492000	1493000	It's a fucking waste of time.
1493000	1496000	This is the second time in your life Katamari's given you trouble.
1496000	1499000	It's, no, it's their stupid programming.
1500000	1505000	It's because they assign an ID to your game through Google Play services or whatever,
1505000	1507000	and it's on every install.
1507000	1509000	They reassign you an ID.
1509000	1512000	Instead of it assigning you the same fucking ID that you had before,
1512000	1514000	like every other fucking game would have.
1514000	1521000	Like, oh my God, if Ingress or Pokemon Go or something just stops fucking working,
1521000	1524000	and oh shit, I got to reinstall the app, I load back in there,
1524000	1527000	and oh, hey, look, there's my account because I'm signed into a goddamn online service
1527000	1529000	that saves my progress.
1529000	1533000	Bo, but fucking Namco Bandai, who can't fucking program shit, decides,
1533000	1536000	hey, we're just going to store all that locally to this specific ID.
1536000	1539000	Bo, but when you reinstall the app, because it's going to fuck up,
1539000	1541000	because our shit is fucking broken anyways,
1541000	1546000	because they're fucking ads that they have break the game when you try to run them.
1546000	1550000	Oh, and then they have free candy offers that never fucking work anyways.
1550000	1552000	So let's add that in there on top of all this shit.
1552000	1556000	So their buggy-ass fucking game that's constantly broken
1556000	1559000	and fucking reassigns a new fucking ID when I reinstall it.
1559000	1561000	So you know what, that's it, that's good,
1561000	1564000	because I was looking for an excuse to get rid of it, and I'm done.
1564000	1568000	I don't think anyone on the entire internet has gotten us upset
1568000	1571000	about Tap My Katamari issue, Loki, congratulations.
1571000	1573000	Wait, don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.
1573000	1574000	Just tell us how you really feel.
1574000	1579000	It's stupid, it's a stupid game, so I'm done playing it, I'm free now.
1579000	1584000	It was a complete time waster, there was no point to the game whatsoever,
1584000	1588000	yet for some stupid reason, I kept playing it, and I'm done.
1589000	1593000	I'm done, I'm done, I'm not going back.
1595000	1596000	You've had it officially.
1596000	1597000	I had it.
1598000	1601000	Unless they want to fix that shit, then yeah, I'll go back after it's fixed,
1601000	1605000	but you know, it's just, it was just stupid.
1605000	1608000	Alright, anything else in your gaming week?
1608000	1609000	No, that was it.
1609000	1612000	Nothing more pleasant, nothing you had a good time with?
1612000	1614000	Alright, my gaming week.
1614000	1619000	Well, okay, so a few weeks ago on the show, somebody called in to talk about this.
1619000	1621000	I think it was our pal Brad from Pod Culture.
1621000	1625000	So I'm going to actually recommend this one to you, Loki,
1625000	1630000	because it's kind of like a tap game, like one of those cookie-clicker games,
1630000	1634000	but it's not by Bandai Namco, so already it's okay.
1634000	1638000	It's called Nonstop Night, like Night with a K,
1638000	1643000	and you play this little, like, it looks like a Diablo-esque kind of game,
1643000	1646000	but it doesn't play like one at all, because it's a cookie-clicker type of game,
1646000	1649000	but instead of tapping the screen repeatedly,
1649000	1653000	your little knight just endlessly runs through the dungeon slaughtering monsters,
1653000	1658000	and you can use buttons to do little skills, or what, you like buy different upgrades,
1658000	1663000	and I don't know, there's other stuff too, but it's got that same formula of,
1663000	1666000	ooh, the numbers get bigger, it's addicting, and oh, I ascended,
1666000	1668000	so I'm going to reset everything back to one.
1668000	1670000	It's like the exact same fucking formula,
1670000	1674000	but it's more of an automated hack-and-slash type of thing.
1674000	1676000	No, I'm just not going to do it anymore.
1676000	1677000	You're done?
1677000	1679000	I'm just done.
1679000	1683000	It's too bad too, because it was a good time waster when I had a few minutes and stuff,
1683000	1685000	and I was enjoying it.
1685000	1689000	Granted, yeah, I exploited stuff where I could, but who cares?
1689000	1692000	What's it matter? It's basically a single-player game.
1692000	1695000	Okay, so they have online leaderboards, but who gives a shit?
1695000	1697000	That's just how long you play the stupid game.
1697000	1701000	All right, so I've been playing that a little bit,
1701000	1704000	and your talk about Katamari made me think of that,
1704000	1706000	because it's kind of a similar-esque type of game,
1706000	1710000	and I thought maybe I'm sure Brad's out there listening,
1710000	1713000	and I see him in chat saying nonstop knight would probably get a kick out of the fact
1713000	1716000	that I actually did go download the game, and I've been playing it.
1716000	1719000	So let's see, what else have I been playing on my gaming week?
1719000	1721000	I've still been playing a lot of World of Warcraft,
1721000	1725000	because I didn't really play the last expansion hardly.
1725000	1728000	I somehow got a character up to level 98.
1728000	1730000	I don't remember Draenor at all.
1730000	1735000	So thanks to this whole thing with the Legion expansion is launching next week, right?
1735000	1740000	So they've been doing these invasions in-game that feel a lot like the fates of Final Fantasy XIV to me,
1740000	1744000	so it's kind of funny seeing how the MMOs are kind of feeding each other now.
1744000	1749000	But through these invasion things, you can really level fast,
1749000	1756000	and I've leveled a character from level 1 all the way to 95 I think I hit today,
1756000	1759000	mostly through these stupid invasion things.
1759000	1760000	What side?
1760000	1763000	Alliance. It's with the Game Buoy guys.
1763000	1765000	All right, well I want to play.
1765000	1768000	So do I have to start on that server?
1768000	1770000	I think you already have a character. It's with the Game Buoy guys.
1770000	1772000	Oh, it's on our normal one. Okay, duh. Never mind.
1772000	1774000	Yeah, so I think you're already there.
1774000	1778000	I've already got like a 97 on one, so I'll have to play.
1778000	1781000	Maybe play with Captain Spike and Slidekick and then that's it.
1781000	1784000	I just took a little break from it after I did all the Draenor stuff.
1784000	1786000	Well, and so, you know, obviously I took a long break from it,
1786000	1788000	and I don't know what convinced me to come back.
1788000	1791000	I think just everybody saying, oh, you got to check out the Legion stuff.
1791000	1792000	I was like, whatever, I'll check.
1792000	1798000	And I think I hit a point in Final Fantasy XIV where I was like, I still love a lot about XIV.
1798000	1800000	There's so much I really enjoy about it.
1800000	1806000	But the deep dungeon wasn't what I thought it would be, I think, which left me a little bit disappointed.
1806000	1809000	Like, it's not something I really want to grind over and over and over again.
1809000	1814000	I thought, I don't know what I was expecting, but it's not, what they have isn't it?
1814000	1815000	Typical gamer, right?
1815000	1819000	I don't know what I, it's like every review of No Man's Sky.
1819000	1822000	I don't know what I was expecting, but this sure ain't it.
1822000	1827000	Well, let's not be honest. I mean, No Man's Sky was, I still kind of enjoy it a little bit,
1827000	1830000	but there's really not a lot there.
1830000	1837000	It's like, it's just not, the guy seems like, seriously, Sean Murray seems like a fucking second coming to Peter Molyneux.
1837000	1839000	It's like fucking Molyneux all over again.
1839000	1844000	You watch the interviews again, you're like, oh my God, he's totally Molyneux-ing right there.
1844000	1845000	Well, I'll say this.
1845000	1849000	I have been playing more No Man's Sky as well, and I do still enjoy the game,
1849000	1854000	but I think the element that I enjoy about No Man's Sky probably isn't the plot,
1854000	1858000	but it's more that it's the same thing that I find appealing about Minecraft.
1858000	1867000	It's that very, like, zen, chill, just, I'm gonna kick back on the couch and play this very low-maintenance game
1867000	1871000	that's all about, like, you know, in the case of No Man's Sky, it's about finding pretty things,
1871000	1875000	and, oh, I'm on a new planet, and let's, you know, ooh, there's a cave over here, what's this?
1875000	1876000	Or, ooh, there's a building over here.
1876000	1880000	Like, I still just kind of get a thrill in the exploration side of things,
1880000	1884000	even though when I really step back to think about, like, what's the fucking point of this game?
1884000	1886000	It's really minimal.
1886000	1889000	Well, even that, though, it's like, there's not really anything there,
1889000	1893000	because, like, in the caves, I know there's nothing gonna be there in those caves.
1893000	1898000	The caves are pretty much useless, because there's nothing hidden inside them.
1898000	1902000	All the minerals that you can find in there, you can find out in the surface, so what's the point?
1902000	1909000	And even exploring the plants and stuff, it's just kind of, all the outposts are the same,
1909000	1915000	like, all the, like, there's only so many, like, space Winnebagos I can walk into,
1915000	1919000	with the chairs tossed over exactly the same way every time.
1919000	1922000	It's like, it's just very rinse and repeat.
1922000	1927000	And there's not, like, any, like, ooh, this is really different than that last planet.
1927000	1929000	Ooh, there's some interesting stuff going on.
1929000	1931000	There's nothing interesting going on.
1931000	1933000	It's just grind, and that's it.
1933000	1935000	And there's not even really much to grind.
1936000	1944000	And from what I've seen or heard of the ending, it's just like, eh, fuck it, we just, we're just not gonna make one.
1944000	1949000	And going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Ziba in chat says,
1949000	1953000	The story is amazing. I'm not sure if that comment's about Final Fantasy XIV or if it's about World of Warcraft.
1953000	1957000	I'm assuming it's about Final Fantasy XIV, and I think that is an important point,
1957000	1960000	is that, you know, if you still haven't played Final Fantasy XIV,
1960000	1964000	you know, even though I'm talking about, oh, I kind of, I'm kind of burned out on it a little bit,
1964000	1966000	keep in mind, I've been playing for, like, two and a half years.
1966000	1969000	Like, you know, and you just kind of hit a point where you've been playing a game long,
1969000	1972000	well, actually, no, the game's coming out on its third birthday, so I guess three years straight.
1972000	1977000	Sorry, I'm laughing because Loki's yawning, and his tongue is completely blue from that slurpee.
1977000	1979000	It is so delicious.
1979000	1981000	I can't help but laugh, anyway.
1981000	1983000	Where was I? Sorry.
1983000	1987000	Horrible when this is a radio show and you guys can't see it, but trust me, it's funny.
1987000	1992000	Okay, so Final Fantasy XIV, if you still have yet to play Final Fantasy XIV, especially Heavensward,
1992000	1997000	like, I realize it's gated because you have to play through all of Realm Reborn,
1997000	2001000	which in itself is a good experience, but I know some people get really turned off by the mandatory dungeons.
2001000	2008000	But, man, I'm telling you, the story in Heavensward is easily, like, one of the top three stories
2008000	2010000	in the entirety of the Final Fantasy series.
2010000	2013000	Like, it's the best. For me, it's my favorite since Final Fantasy VI.
2013000	2017000	Some people would take issue that I'm not giving seven or ten, enough credit, or even eight.
2018000	2023000	But, for me, it's, like, seriously the best story in the series in a very long time.
2023000	2026000	Heavensward is mind-blowing amazing.
2026000	2033000	Just for me, the patches and the follow-up on Heavensward haven't quite been there for me like Realm Reborn was.
2033000	2036000	I'm not sure what that X-factor is that's missing for me.
2036000	2041000	Maybe the fact that they're only doing two dungeons instead of three, so you get really burned out on the roulettes real quick.
2041000	2043000	I think that might be part of it. I don't know.
2043000	2047000	Anyway, so, let's see, other comments in chat.
2047000	2050000	Live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream says,
2050000	2054000	I'm on a Lisa Frank planet now, talking about No Man's Sky, full of neon rainbow plants.
2054000	2057000	I'm in Trapper Keeper land. That's awesome.
2057000	2061000	I don't know if I'd ever leave that place. That sounds amazing.
2061000	2065000	So, anyway, William Murderface asks,
2065000	2069000	Sky, did you play before a Realm Reborn hit about Final Fantasy XIV?
2070000	2073000	Yes, I did, but not for very long because it was terrible.
2073000	2078000	I actually, I played the Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 alpha?
2078000	2081000	No, beta. I think it was just the beta at that point.
2081000	2084000	And even early on in the beta, I was worried.
2084000	2086000	I was like, I don't know about this.
2086000	2089000	But I ended up buying the game anyway and I played it and I was like,
2089000	2092000	they've made some real shit decisions with this game.
2092000	2094000	Yeah, 1.0 was really, really bad.
2094000	2098000	I understand 1.0 got better after Naoki Yoshida took over.
2098000	2101000	It was planning a Realm Reborn.
2101000	2104000	That 1.0 got really good towards the end, but I wasn't really around to see that.
2104000	2107000	But I was there in the early days of 1.0 and I just,
2107000	2110000	God, like the maps were awful.
2110000	2112000	I don't know if you remember what the shroud used to look like.
2112000	2115000	It looked like a piece of fucking graph paper.
2115000	2117000	That's what the maps were, it was awful.
2117000	2119000	But anyway, the game's great now.
2119000	2121000	A Realm Reborn fixed everything.
2121000	2124000	It's truly a legendary story in video games,
2124000	2127000	just how turned around they made that game.
2127000	2129000	It's pretty crazy.
2129000	2132000	Anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.
2132000	2135000	I haven't played an awful, awful lot outside those,
2135000	2137000	what are becoming mainstay games.
2137000	2140000	But next week should be pretty exciting with Dragon Con and all.
2140000	2143000	And they've got arcades are new this year at Dragon Con.
2143000	2145000	They've got two different arcades, a classic gaming one
2145000	2147000	and a Tokyo Attack arcade.
2147000	2151000	So they're going to have, really, my two favorite things are going to be there,
2151000	2153000	classic gaming and Japanese gaming.
2153000	2156000	So I'm pretty happy going into Dragon Con this year.
2156000	2158000	I'm excited to check it out.
2158000	2160000	Well, I mean, really, what else is there?
2160000	2164000	Because U.S. gaming? Modern U.S. gaming?
2164000	2165000	U.S. gaming makes me think of like...
2165000	2166000	It's like Ticket Redemption.
2166000	2168000	Okay, well, we're not doing those.
2168000	2170000	What I'd find in a Dave & Buster's, which, I mean, don't get me wrong,
2170000	2172000	I like Dave & Buster's, they have some good stuff, but...
2172000	2174000	Hey, you like cell phone games?
2174000	2177000	What if we made those cell phone games on a giant TV?
2177000	2178000	Exactly, exactly.
2178000	2179000	Like, I can do without that shit.
2179000	2180000	I don't need the cell phone games.
2180000	2182000	Hey, it's Tap My Katamari.
2182000	2183000	But...
2183000	2187000	Yet another racing game, Daytona, whatever.
2187000	2188000	Just kidding, I'm not really shading.
2188000	2190000	Raw thrills in the cell phone games.
2190000	2191000	Yeah, it's pretty much it.
2191000	2192000	Yeah.
2192000	2195000	So, yeah, but no, you know, good point, good point.
2195000	2196000	I mean, what else is there?
2196000	2198000	But I'm just very excited about that.
2198000	2200000	So more to come.
2200000	2203000	Anyway, housekeeping, don't have a lot for you.
2203000	2205000	I think I've said a million times we're not going to be here next week.
2205000	2209000	However, stay tuned to our Twitter at VOG Network for the network,
2209000	2210000	at VOG Network.
2210000	2213000	And then also stay tuned for, on our website,
2213000	2217000	because instead of this show being on next Sunday,
2217000	2220000	we're trying to set up like a VOG Super Show at Dragon Con
2220000	2222000	that we're going to tape on Friday or Saturday.
2222000	2224000	We're still trying to nail down all the details,
2224000	2227000	but we're going to tape it one night and then broadcast it
2227000	2230000	where Bobby and this show would usually be on Sunday night.
2230000	2232000	So you may still have something new to listen to on Sunday,
2232000	2233000	which would be really cool,
2233000	2235000	but this show will not be live on the network next week
2235000	2237000	because I'm out of town and it's Labor Day
2237000	2239000	and Dark Soccer and Loki probably want to make the most
2239000	2241000	of the three-day weekend as well.
2241000	2244000	But we will be back.
2244000	2246000	You don't want to play Sims 4 for three days straight?
2246000	2248000	No, I don't get a weekend anymore.
2248000	2251000	Oh, yeah, your schedule. Sorry.
2251000	2254000	Oh, my God. I do have Labor Day also.
2254000	2257000	You know what you should do? Quit.
2257000	2260000	Do you know what they pay me? No.
2260000	2263000	I'm just kidding. I'm just giving you crap.
2263000	2266000	Well, I hope you're able to enjoy what you can.
2266000	2270000	Anyway, but we will be back in two weeks.
2270000	2271000	And here's the great part.
2271000	2274000	So when we come back, it will be September 11th,
2274000	2276000	which is Loki's birthday.
2276000	2277000	Yes, it is.
2277000	2279000	So Loki's birthday show.
2279000	2281000	And we're also trying to ramp up the interview thing.
2281000	2282000	I think I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.
2282000	2283000	I don't remember if I did or not,
2283000	2287000	but Dark Soccer not being here is going to leave some big shoes to fill.
2287000	2289000	So we're going to be trying to get some more interviews
2289000	2290000	in the coming months.
2290000	2292000	How are you calling your feet big?
2292000	2293000	Just, well, I don't know.
2293000	2295000	Is that a bad thing if I call your feet big, Dark Soccer?
2295000	2297000	I don't have big feet.
2297000	2299000	Like for guys, it's a compliment when you say you have big feet
2299000	2301000	because, you know, big feet means...
2301000	2305000	Big twat.
2305000	2308000	I don't think you have your anatomy lessons quite correctly.
2308000	2313000	No, that's not the kind of twat I was talking about. Thank you.
2313000	2316000	Wow.
2316000	2319000	That's not the delivery I was expecting, but okay.
2319000	2324000	Anyway, so how do you transition?
2324000	2326000	How do you transition from big twat?
2326000	2328000	Easy, easy, easy.
2328000	2333000	Well, I was going to say, since we're going to go on a tangent here anyway,
2333000	2335000	I just thought it'd be fun.
2335000	2338000	Have you seen, now I can't remember off the top of my head,
2338000	2341000	and I'm going to look up while I'm talking about it real quick.
2341000	2345000	Have you seen this thing that uses like an emulator,
2345000	2347000	but it's like a WarioWare type of thing?
2347000	2352000	So it's a bunch of classic games and like little bits and pieces of them
2352000	2356000	that you're playing all together.
2356000	2357000	No.
2357000	2360000	It's pretty awesome. Like, I saw this on Destructoid,
2360000	2365000	and they had, it's basically, I don't know if it's like within MAME or something,
2365000	2372000	but they had like, okay, whoever is in first in this level of Mario Kart,
2372000	2375000	you know, after like ten seconds gets going,
2375000	2378000	and the next level is like, okay, kill this other person in like a fighting game.
2378000	2383000	Okay, next one is like, you know, defeat the other person in this like puzzle game.
2383000	2387000	It's like ten seconds of things are, catch the most fish in this like Atari 2600 game.
2387000	2389000	Okay, that sounds rad, actually.
2389000	2391000	Okay, where can I get this again?
2391000	2395000	I'm looking it up right now. It's called Multibull.
2395000	2397000	Okay, I like this.
2397000	2402000	Yeah, Multibull. It's a two player thing where you can compete against snippets of emulated games.
2402000	2404000	Now, it's not multitasking though, right?
2404000	2407000	Because that's a patent pending thing from YYR.
2407000	2409000	No, this is just old, this is emulator games.
2409000	2416000	So like, for example, they've got, they have Wild Guns in there versus Excitebike, Super Mario Kart.
2416000	2417000	There's some other stuff.
2417000	2422000	Apparently, it's a collaboration between Bennett Foddy, who did QWOP,
2422000	2426000	and Alec Thompson, who did Be Glitched,
2426000	2430000	and they're going to be doing as part of a couple different festivals,
2430000	2436000	including XOXO Festival in Portland on September 1st, or I'm sorry, in September 9th,
2436000	2442000	and some festival in Austin on the 1st.
2442000	2444000	Alright, festival game. Sounds like fun.
2444000	2447000	Alright, before we get into other gaming news for this week,
2447000	2451000	let me tell you about, so we got on a tangent when we had the big feet reference,
2451000	2455000	but obviously Dark Soccer is going to leave a space on the show that will not be easy to fill,
2455000	2459000	but we're going to be inviting some guests on over the coming weeks.
2459000	2461000	You know, because we were doing interviews for a while,
2461000	2465000	and then we just kind of fell out of it, so I've been really trying to get some people to come back on the show.
2465000	2471000	So on September 11th, Gabe from the Sacramento IGDA is going to be here,
2471000	2474000	because his game Crumple is just about ready to go,
2474000	2477000	so he's going to tell us a little more about that game, and then we'll talk about that.
2477000	2481000	Also coming up in September, Aethernaut is going to be here.
2481000	2485000	Aethernaut is a chiptune musician that is going to be at GamerX4.
2485000	2489000	He was at the very first GamerX, and if you haven't heard Aethernaut's stuff, he's awesome.
2489000	2493000	He kind of combines the chiptune stuff with violin, so it's really cool.
2493000	2494000	So he'll be here in September.
2494000	2496000	And I saw, was it this week?
2496000	2501000	It was set in the arcade not this year, but last year.
2501000	2503000	Monsters and Monocles finally released.
2503000	2504000	That just came out, yeah.
2504000	2507000	I follow one of the devs on Twitter, probably the same one you do.
2507000	2508000	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
2508000	2510000	So definitely go check that out if you guys see it.
2510000	2511000	Yeah, have them on the show.
2511000	2513000	Have them on September, October. It'll be great.
2513000	2514000	Yeah.
2514000	2515000	Alright.
2515000	2522000	I've still been trying to hear from the people that are doing the Office game.
2522000	2527000	I've messaged them and hadn't heard anything, but I'd love for them to be on the show, even when I'm not here.
2527000	2528000	Even if you're not here.
2528000	2529000	Even if I'm not here.
2529000	2531000	I'm going to invite you to this party at somebody else's house.
2531000	2533000	By the way, not all these.
2533000	2539000	Gabe will be here in person, but we'll be certainly doing a lot of interviews over Skype and so forth as we usually have.
2539000	2544000	And I see in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, RageNator says,
2544000	2546000	if and when you need someone on the show to fill in, I'll volunteer.
2547000	2550000	We're not really looking actually for guest hosts right now.
2550000	2558000	Just more people that are designing games or gaming culture contributions, those types of things, to come on and talk to us about it.
2558000	2561000	Because it's always fun to hear about what's going on out there.
2561000	2563000	Besides just the AAA stuff.
2563000	2566000	Obviously we're not going to have the devs of Final Fantasy XV on this show, I'm sorry to say.
2566000	2568000	But everybody kind of already knows about all that stuff.
2568000	2572000	So we like to dig a little deeper and talk about some games maybe you haven't heard about.
2572000	2575000	So we'll have that to look forward to in a few months.
2575000	2578000	MXC in chat says, what about Cap President?
2578000	2580000	Still working on that.
2580000	2583000	So I'm hoping we'll have something to announce when we come back.
2583000	2585000	For Loki's birthday on September 11th.
2585000	2587000	In two weeks.
2587000	2589000	Show on your birthday.
2589000	2591000	We have a lot of shows on big days this year.
2591000	2593000	We have a show on 20 November.
2593000	2598000	Sadly if we hadn't missed so many shows, 666 was originally going to be on my birthday.
2598000	2600000	Which is perfect, but you know.
2601000	2603000	Speaking of missing shows, we also will not be here.
2603000	2606000	It's worth saying on October 2nd we will not be here.
2606000	2609000	That is the week of GamerX.
2609000	2613000	So Dark Soccer and I will still be in San Jose and won't be able to make it back in time for the show.
2613000	2618000	But we will be here the weekend of Fan Fest because my flight gets back at noon.
2618000	2621000	So I'll have time to roll in here and do a show that night.
2621000	2623000	That'll be really exciting.
2623000	2625000	Alright, enough housekeeping talk.
2625000	2627000	Let's get into some more news.
2627000	2628000	Gosh darn it, Loki.
2628000	2630000	So let's talk more about Playstation.
2630000	2635000	And hey we talked about that wonderful Playstation now and how they're going to charge you $20 a month for that.
2635000	2639000	Well guess what, there's Playstation Plus and that's going up as well.
2639000	2646000	So they're going to be raising the price of Playstation Plus by $10 up to $60.
2646000	2650000	And that's going to be starting in September on the 22nd.
2650000	2657000	So if your subscription expires after that, you'll have to pay $60 to get it.
2657000	2658000	And yeah.
2658000	2664000	And apparently they say that the reason for that is it brings it up with the current market conditions.
2664000	2667000	That doesn't make any fucking sense.
2667000	2669000	It's just like, we want more money.
2669000	2671000	Inflation, we gotta balance the check.
2671000	2675000	Well, but here's the thing, it's one of those, is it really a surprise?
2675000	2677000	Did you not see it coming?
2677000	2679000	Isn't that what Xbox Live charges?
2679000	2680000	It is, yeah.
2680000	2683000	So they know they can charge it because it's what people are paying for the competition.
2683000	2690000	Honestly, this is one of those things where nobody likes to hear about paying more money, but it makes sense.
2690000	2693000	It's also $10 a year that's like a lunch.
2693000	2695000	Yeah, it's really, it's not that bad.
2695000	2703000	I mean, not that we're encouraging them to bump it up another $10 or whatever, but you know, it's not the end of the world.
2703000	2706000	Especially considering you do get a pretty good value through Plus.
2706000	2712000	Yeah, I stopped doing my Live just because I don't actually use the Xbox really anymore.
2712000	2718000	I was doing that just to get the free games off there, but I don't know.
2718000	2720000	Maybe if I get an Xbox One someday.
2720000	2725000	I just, right now, I'm holding off, I guess.
2725000	2727000	Crackdown's not out yet, and you know.
2727000	2728000	It's fair.
2728000	2730000	Forza Horizon 3 does look pretty awesome.
2730000	2731000	It does look awesome.
2731000	2733000	But it's just like, you know.
2733000	2741000	And at this point, I mean, for me, I already have an Xbox One, so this is a moot point, but you know, for you, what about this whole Scorpio thing?
2741000	2744000	And the fact that you know something bigger and better is coming, does it make you want to wait for that?
2744000	2751000	And on top of that, no, it doesn't make me want to wait for that, but on top of that, it's like, well shit, I'm thinking about building a new PC anyways.
2751000	2753000	I'll just get it on PC, you know?
2753000	2754000	Yeah, true.
2754000	2756000	What's the point? So, we'll see.
2756000	2763000	I mean, I don't know about the whole Scorpio and PlayStation Neos or whatever.
2763000	2767000	It's just, I have to see what the point is of those.
2767000	2768000	Right.
2768000	2769000	I mean, I don't know.
2769000	2770000	Still worry about PlayStation.
2770000	2772000	What are you going to get there that you don't get with the cheaper phone?
2772000	2773000	Exactly.
2773000	2785000	I'm still worried about the PlayStation, you know, VR thing, because I've got to, my gut feeling tells me that it ain't going to run as good as you think it's going to run.
2785000	2792000	I mean, it's just like, why have that powerful system that's going to support VR, you know, better?
2792000	2795000	Bo, but not better, but it's going to be better.
2795000	2802000	I was looking at my Amazon orders, like what I have, because I didn't want to pre-order the same thing twice, which I did.
2802000	2807000	You might remember when I bought Super Mario Maker, I bought two copies on Amazon because I'm an idiot, right?
2807000	2815000	But, um, so I want to make sure I didn't do that for World of Warcraft because I went on Amazon to get World of Warcraft Legion because they, they, they match the Best Buy program, right?
2815000	2817000	Where you get like the discount if you're a Prime member.
2817000	2823000	So I bought it on Amazon, so I get the discount because I'm not even going to be here when the game comes out anyway, because I'm on my way to Atlantis.
2823000	2825000	I don't need to be online the very first day.
2825000	2827000	It'll be server issues galore anyway.
2827000	2836000	So anyway, I was in my history making sure that I hadn't already pre-ordered it at some point and I saw the PlayStation VR thing in there and I was like, oh yeah.
2836000	2840000	I forgot. I plucked down a lot of money on this thing. I'm about to pluck down a lot of money on this thing.
2840000	2846000	And then I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, well, you did just buy a car. Maybe you should just cancel this.
2846000	2849000	Is the VR thing going to be really all you hoped? But I didn't do it.
2849000	2853000	It's like, yeah, I mean, I didn't do it. I'm still holding on to it, but I thought about it.
2853000	2858000	I'm thinking about it as well because it's just like, that's quite expensive. It's like $400.
2858000	2866000	And what exactly are you getting for that $400? I mean, some gimmicky games that they're going to have out for it?
2866000	2870000	I mean, it's just not a whole lot of like really big, you know, experiences.
2870000	2878000	Rez is cool, but is it $500 cool? I mean, well, hey, you can play it without VR though.
2878000	2880000	So, I mean, I don't know.
2880000	2886000	You know what? I'm going to keep it obviously because once I get rid of it, I probably won't be able to get it back.
2886000	2891000	But I also feel like Sony kind of has a chance because we know they're going to be doing something in the next few weeks.
2891000	2895000	You know, obviously a lot of these things are leaking out and we'll get into some other stuff in a minute.
2895000	2901000	And then they're expected to talk about whatever this Neo thing is or PS4K or whatever.
2901000	2907000	So I feel like Sony has a chance to get me hyped about VR again and really make me understand,
2907000	2909000	yes, I'm going to be fine even if I don't have a Neo.
2909000	2914000	And here's the type of awesome things that you just aren't going to be able to live without that aren't just Rez.
2914000	2922000	Yeah. The other thing though that they also announced recently that's been, actually it's already live now, is the two-factor authentication.
2922000	2927000	So, hey, if you have a PlayStation account, might want to turn that on.
2927000	2932000	You know, it's a good idea, especially with all those FIFA hacks and shit out there.
2932000	2935000	Yeah, I know some people that are getting hacked and it's ugly. It is ugly.
2935000	2939000	I've got, I switched mine on as soon as I heard about it and yeah.
2940000	2945000	Yeah. Two-factor authentication is awesome. I'm surprised it took them this long to get it.
2945000	2951000	Microsoft has one. I don't remember if it's through the Xbox One though. I know I have one on my Microsoft account.
2951000	2953000	So I guess that does apply to my Xbox One.
2953000	2959000	I have to double check my Steam account to see if it's still, I think it does. I thought I had it through the app.
2959000	2964000	Usually, yeah, usually with a lot of these two-factor auths, like kind of once you sign in once, you don't get challenged on a lot.
2964000	2968000	That's kind of what happens with Steam. Like as long as you're still on the same computer, same account,
2968000	2973000	it doesn't really ask you for it every single time. But once in a while it'll come up and say, load the app and grant your request.
2973000	2978000	I just get a pretty frequently email saying, someone's trying to log into your account.
2978000	2979000	Do you really?
2979000	2984000	But they're trying to, but it sends the email, you know, they have to do the email confirmation thing.
2984000	2988000	And so they can't get in, but you know, they're trying.
2988000	2996000	I get that all the time on Facebook. Someone keeps trying to get into my Facebook and luckily Facebook has an option where you can say, this isn't me.
2996000	2999000	Like a lot of the sites are just like, ignore this email, you know, or whatever.
2999000	3001000	Facebook actually has a thing you can click where it's, this isn't me.
3001000	3006000	And I'm hoping it kind of reports the IP or something as somebody who's trying to phish into accounts.
3006000	3011000	So, because screw you, it's my Facebook, not yours. Stay out.
3011000	3014000	It's like, why would you want to be in my Facebook? It's boring.
3014000	3018000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3018000	3022000	SHG100Matt says, if you have something that is two-factor authentication, use it.
3022000	3027000	Bobby Black Wolf says, I get lots of people trying to steal my gamertag through social engineering.
3027000	3029000	They send me the confirmation code.
3029000	3032000	Yeah. So two-factor auth is so important.
3032000	3041000	Like if you're not using it on your email, oh my God, get signed up with it on your email because your email is like tied to so much other stuff.
3041000	3043000	So important. You know what I mean?
3043000	3051000	So, and definitely, you know what I don't, you know what I think doesn't have two-factor auth though that's kind of concerning is my pank.
3051000	3057000	But I use like a completely different login and password for my bank than anything else. Like it's totally unique.
3057000	3061000	Yeah, my bank still does. They have the two-factor as well, which doesn't make any sense too.
3061000	3066000	It's like, you know, when I'm on my mobile app as well, I'm like, this is a little stupid.
3066000	3072000	I'm on a mobile app on my phone and you're sending a message to my phone.
3072000	3076000	Right, right. Well, somebody could be running it in an emulator or something, you know.
3076000	3079000	Well, I, it's just like, I mean, come on.
3080000	3083000	All right. Let's move on with some other news.
3083000	3090000	Talking about a big release that people are looking forward to on Sony as well as Microsoft.
3090000	3094000	Sorry, I have to respond to this comment in chat. Fifth Dream in chat says, oh, Rob Roberts bank account is insecure.
3094000	3099000	Free money, guys. Yeah, what's he saying? You can't get blood out of a turnip.
3099000	3103000	You might get in there and be surprised. Fine, there's nothing there.
3103000	3108000	If you want to get in there and put money in it, that would be great, but I don't think you're going to find much to dig out.
3108000	3116000	Anyway, a game that I think a lot of people are looking forward to, no matter if it's Sony or Microsoft, Final Fantasy 15.
3116000	3121000	You know, Final Fantasy 15 has been in development for, what, ten years and now two more months, right?
3121000	3129000	Well, DLC is something that's going to be happening with Final Fantasy 15 and I'm a little bit concerned how that's going to play out.
3129000	3136000	Because there's a season pass that they're selling that's going to have DLC and there's going to be six add-ons that are covered by the pass.
3136000	3141000	But then apparently there's going to be more DLC that is not covered by the pass.
3141000	3153000	Apparently in an interview with Famitsu, director Hajime Tabata actually was talking about DLC and mentioned that there are DLCs planned out that go beyond just these six.
3153000	3159000	And there's possibly going to be VR content as well, something that's not even just the Prompto demo that was shown at E3.
3159000	3169000	Cooking recipes and costumes. And now I'm starting to worry a little bit, like, how much fucking DLC is going to be in this game?
3169000	3171000	Too much fucking DLC.
3171000	3178000	I'm starting to worry. I'm like, is the base experience of this game going to justify the high price of the game?
3178000	3186000	I mean, it's a Final Fantasy game, so that expectation is sort of there. But the more and more I hear about this stuff, I worry.
3186000	3195000	Now, granted, Final Fantasy X-2 also had DLC, and it was okay. The way they did it in that game, it was handled fine.
3195000	3205000	So I'm like, okay, I guess if it's not too crazy outside of what they did in, sorry, not X-2, XIII-2. There's too many sequels to numbered games.
3205000	3212000	If the DLC is handled similar to the way it was in XIII-2, then it probably won't be so bad.
3212000	3218000	But I just, I don't know, I worry about all this stuff. Like, okay, we have to sell a season pass and there's going to be more DLC beyond that.
3218000	3225000	Costumes and recipes and all this other stuff. I'm like, how much nickel and diming are they trying to stink and do in this game?
3225000	3231000	I'm a little concerned. What about you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com?
3231000	3237000	sg100matt says, do they let you preload the DLC before it goes live? I have no idea.
3238000	3244000	5th Dream says, I don't trust season passes anymore. I don't blame you, honestly. Everybody handles it so differently.
3244000	3253000	And 5th Dream points out Mortal Kombat season 2. And yeah, there was, you know, Mortal Kombat was another one of those games that had a season pass, but then there were characters beyond that, right?
3253000	3258000	So this is like, or outside of that whole thing, right? So I don't blame you.
3258000	3262000	So act deft encourages, wait for a sale on the season pass.
3262000	3269000	Or wait for the game of the year edition when it comes out in 2017.
3269000	3271000	I don't know if I can do that for Final Fantasy 15.
3271000	3273000	Or don't play it.
3273000	3282000	That's certainly a fair response as well, but you know, Final Fantasy 15, it's a mainline Final Fantasy game. I can't think of one of those I haven't played.
3282000	3287000	I'm pretty hyped about it and I've enjoyed the demos that I've played enough. So, but I'm just, you know.
3287000	3295000	I think all I played, like I skipped 12. I played some 13 when I borrowed it from you and nothing else of it because it just wasn't interesting.
3295000	3300000	12 is really good though. The HD remix will be definitely worth checking out when that comes out.
3300000	3307000	I have like the collector's edition that came with the book and the tin and the nice initial game. I might sell it.
3307000	3312000	It's Balthier and Fran. It'll change your life. I'm telling you.
3312000	3313000	I'll just go back and play 5.
3313000	3314000	They're awesome.
3314000	3315000	5 is the best.
3315000	3316000	Really? 5?
3316000	3318000	I like 5. Actually, my favorite is 3.
3318000	3321000	I like the battle. Oh, 3 is one of my least favorites.
3321000	3323000	No, the Japanese 3.
3323000	3325000	No, I know. It's one of my least. Well, I would never say that.
3325000	3328000	Because it had the big job system in it.
3328000	3329000	You know, I know.
3329000	3331000	Which I really thought was, it was a big innovator.
3331000	3337000	I liked the battling in 5, but I felt the story was really weak compared to...
3337000	3343000	But it is, it does have the tough task of being sandwiched between 4 and 6, which are like the two best stories in the entire series.
3343000	3347000	So, it's hard to live up to that. But, I don't know.
3347000	3352000	I will say that, I mean, story-wise, I'd put 6 as being the top for a story.
3352000	3354000	Although, the story in 5 was really good.
3354000	3358000	That and, you know, playing fun fan translations where his name was Butt.
3358000	3364000	Yeah. I remember, that was like the first big ROM translation that was out there. It was such a big deal when that happened.
3364000	3369000	Although, I will go out on a limb and say that Seiken Densetsu 3 was still better than just about any of the Final Fantasy games.
3369000	3370000	To be honest.
3370000	3372000	And, to this day, still nothing official with that.
3372000	3373000	Nope.
3373000	3374000	To this day. Anyway.
3374000	3378000	Alright, so that's the DLC in Final Fantasy XV.
3378000	3383000	I just, it'll be interesting to see what happens when this game comes out in a couple months.
3383000	3386000	I'm dying to see these reviews when they start coming out.
3386000	3388000	I just, I hope it's good. I hope it's good.
3388000	3390000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3390000	3392000	Well, we do have some more Final Fantasy news.
3393000	3404000	In the wake of all of the Final Fantasy XV announcements and World of Final Fantasy, there is a new Dissidia Final Fantasy that's going to be coming out.
3404000	3412000	It's going to be not like the other Dissidia games where it was a fighting game.
3412000	3419000	It will be called Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia and it is a JRPG style game.
3419000	3423000	It's done by Team Ninja, actually.
3423000	3428000	So, I looked at it. It looks pretty neat. I mean, for mobile, it's not bad.
3428000	3434000	It will be out in Japan later this year. Nothing about any type of international release, but you know it's going to happen.
3436000	3440000	So, there's a trailer out for it. I would say look for it.
3440000	3449000	It's interesting. It has that whole sort of look that the Final Fantasy III mobile had.
3449000	3460000	So, I don't know. It remains to be seen, but then again, there's not much that you can do wrong with anything made by Team Ninja.
3460000	3464000	Except maybe Metroid, other Z, other M.
3464000	3468000	That doesn't exist in my universe, so I haven't involved it.
3468000	3473000	I throw unnecessary shade at that game. Actually, I think it's better than most people give it credit for.
3473000	3474000	Unnecessary?
3474000	3482000	No, I think that game is better than most people give it credit for, but it just wasn't Super Metroid. That's the problem.
3482000	3486000	There is a Moogle in VV and Cloud and that makes me happy.
3486000	3489000	And what's his face with the tail?
3489000	3492000	Oh my god, Y'shtola's in it.
3492000	3499000	What, they probably just bring the best out of all the... It's probably the same characters that show up in theater.
3499000	3503000	Well, I was actually kind of surprised to see Final Fantasy XIV characters in there.
3503000	3506000	Y'shtola I think is really big overseas too.
3506000	3508000	Yeah, she's a cutie.
3508000	3511000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
3511000	3520000	So, one of the rumored announcements that was supposed to be coming out in just like a week or so here on September 7th was this PlayStation Slim.
3520000	3523000	And apparently someone has one already.
3523000	3526000	They bought it off of an auction site called Gumtree.
3526000	3536000	And apparently they've posted lots of pictures online and Eurogamer's even had someone come out to the location and verify that it is authentic.
3536000	3542000	So, it is. It's apparently... It looks much slimmer than the original PlayStation 4.
3542000	3546000	It's all matte black with that kind of textured finish on it.
3547000	3550000	They have a couple USB ports in the front there.
3550000	3557000	It looks like instead of having the touch buttons on there, they actually have a physical reset and power button, which is kind of nice.
3557000	3559000	And, yeah.
3559000	3567000	So, I guess we'll learn some more about this in the next week here, but it's kind of bad for Sony that that...
3567000	3569000	How did that get to an auction site?
3569000	3573000	How did that leak out? I mean, that's pretty bad.
3573000	3575000	So, I don't know.
3575000	3583000	That is very bad that something they haven't even announced somehow already exists in a physical form and got...
3583000	3588000	So, my thought is they must be pulling the old Sega trick.
3588000	3590000	And they're out here today.
3590000	3593000	And they're out today type of thing, which actually I think Microsoft also did.
3593000	3597000	Well, they did like... It's out the day after tomorrow or something type of thing, right?
3597000	3599000	Yeah, that was with the Xbox 360S.
3599000	3605000	So, I have a feeling Sony is about to drop that one where here it is and it's out today.
3605000	3612000	So, that's how these things already exist off the assembly line and so forth, which in a way props to them for keeping it a secret this long in that regard.
3612000	3619000	But, yeah, that's really not good that one somehow already got in the wild in spite of all that. It's crazy.
3619000	3626000	I'd be curious to see what the other differences are aside from just it's smaller matte black now.
3626000	3630000	I mean, it doesn't... I don't know. I like the light bar in mine.
3630000	3634000	I'm hoping that it still has that because I don't really see that on here.
3637000	3638000	I don't know.
3638000	3648000	I think they said... If I remember correctly, I think when they had it like posted in NeoGaf that someone said that there was like a power button like light on there that kind of changes color like the light bar does.
3648000	3649000	Yeah.
3649000	3653000	But the light bar looks so much cooler than that. I mean, I don't know.
3653000	3662000	Yeah. No, the light bar in the controller. I'm very curious to see like what... Well, you know, the light on the back of the controller, you know, it changes color to go with the mood in different games.
3662000	3668000	You know, developers kind of change that, but you don't ever really see that unless your hands are kind of, you know, like can you see the reflect?
3668000	3672000	So, I can see why maybe they want to put it a little more front center where you can see it.
3672000	3680000	You know, now that you say that, I wanted... I thought I saw a picture of the controller and it looked different like that you could see those lights.
3680000	3688000	But maybe I'm thinking something else. I don't know. But yeah, I want to say that there was something else different.
3688000	3698000	Yeah, they have a picture with the original PlayStation 4 and it's quite slimmer. I mean, it's got kind of rounded edges on it versus like the sharp edges that they have.
3698000	3705000	Yeah, definitely not as kind of sexy looking as the other PlayStation.
3705000	3714000	It's kind of neat though on the back though, they've got like the PlayStation button symbols on there. It's kind of raising it up a little bit and the PlayStation logo.
3714000	3726000	And then they've kind of... As far as ports on the back, it looks like they've just got the... an HDMI Ethernet and what I assume is the camera.
3726000	3731000	Although someone I think said it was the VR thing, but I think it's the camera. It looks like the camera port.
3732000	3742000	And then just, you know, the normal power cord spot and everything. But yeah, I mean, they posted a picture of the box. They posted a picture of everything that was in the box.
3742000	3757000	I mean, and someone saw it, so I don't know. It's authentic. It's just like, okay, you know, what are you gonna do?
3757000	3771000	Yeah, it's the real deal. It's coming, but we'll just see how Sony puts a spin on it and what curious thing they'll say about the fact that it leaked so early, if nothing else.
3771000	3780000	Let's see now, Bobby Blackwell says, a dude posted the picture of the NX controller too, then admitted he faked it. But this whole thing, didn't they have like a YouTube motion unboxing?
3780000	3795000	Well, yeah, he had an unboxing. He had the actual thing being played and everything. They had, I think, a guy from Eurogamer or Digital Foundry come and look at it. And so, yeah, they confirmed it's legit.
3795000	3808000	So if it's a hoax, it's really the best one ever pulled. We'll put it that way. It's the best one ever, if it is indeed a hoax. Props. But it probably is not a hoax. It's looking very likely.
3808000	3823000	All right. Now, let's see if this ends up being a hoax or not, although I could see that this is probably a real thing. Duke Nukem 3D rumored to be getting a remake, remaster type of thing, which I kind of feel like it's already been.
3823000	3835000	I mean, I know there hasn't been like a true HD remaster, but I do feel like Duke Nukem 3D has come back up with the Steam port that added the multiplayer inside Steam, right?
3835000	3844000	They had one with 3D models. I don't remember what that was, if it was a mod or if that was an actual version of Duke Nukem 3D that they've had. They've had one with 3D models before.
3844000	3845000	Yeah.
3845000	3847000	No, I don't remember which version that is.
3847000	3858000	Well, apparently, a teaser site for a Duke Nukem-related announcement came up, and this was as a part of dukenukem.com. And, of course, it's a countdown, so you know an announcement of an announcement.
3858000	3870000	There's a banner that says, Happy 20th Anniversary, because, of course, the original Duke Nukem 3D was in 1996, so it is the 20th anniversary. So, likely going to be a re-release or remake.
3870000	3883000	Somebody on Reddit, so, you know, big grain of salt with this, but I'll go ahead and say, apparently knows that the game is called Duke Nukem 3D World Tour. It's part remaster, part remix.
3883000	3885000	But, you know, again, take that with a grain of salt.
3885000	3890000	Well, that was out in the webpage. They found that actually within the code on the webpage.
3890000	3894000	So, hey, I like Duke Nukem.
3894000	3907000	And, honestly, as long as the first level's the same with the movie theater and everything, that's the level everybody remembers. Anything can be pretty much different after that. Most people probably wouldn't even recognize that it's different levels, like a remix or whatever.
3907000	3911000	There was so many, like, fan maps. I think I still have a CD somewhere.
3911000	3913000	Oh, I had multiple CDs of those maps.
3913000	3920000	Like, the Duke Nukem game and, like, just bunches and bunches of... Wasn't there, like, Duke Nukem at the White House?
3920000	3925000	Oh, yeah, they had tons of, like, mods that, like, made it onto disc that they sold and it was just, like...
3925000	3926000	For sure.
3926000	3932000	Yeah, so the announcement looks like it was almost five days away, so that would make it, what?
3932000	3934000	Just in time for Penny Arcade Expo.
3934000	3937000	Yeah, that seems appropriate.
3937000	3946000	So it makes a lot of sense, right? Because, you know, even though we've been talking a lot about Dragon Con on this show, you know, obviously there's a lot of people that are interested in Penny Arcade Expo, which is happening in Seattle at the same time.
3946000	3952000	So that would line up perfectly with it, especially if they do happen to have this game at the event there, so...
3952000	3961000	And really, you know, when you have all those, like, blunders of different developers having strippers and stuff at their parties, this is really the only game that's appropriate for that.
3961000	3963000	It was part of the game.
3963000	3967000	It was part of the game. It was part of the ambiance. Alright, anyway.
3967000	3968000	The strippers and pick-ups.
3968000	3973000	Let's go to something completely different with Dark Soccer, and I mean different.
3973000	3990000	Well, sometimes you need to just sit back and look at the mundanity of life to just realize that all of your struggles were really not worth it in the end.
3991000	3993000	And so that's where this game comes in.
3993000	3996000	Are you saying, Dark Soccer, and in the end, it doesn't even matter.
3996000	4002000	You know, I call that the R-Type song because it's like playing R-Type. In the end, it doesn't really matter.
4005000	4012000	So there is a game, the ultimate of boredom, called Un-Wigi.
4013000	4017000	It is a Flash browser game.
4018000	4023000	And it's really just...
4024000	4035000	Not really a whole lot of much other than Luigi wandering around, smoking a cigarette, realizing that it's all gone horribly wrong.
4036000	4044000	So basically, he's just depressed. He lights up a cigarette and walks around the Mushroom Kingdom.
4044000	4054000	Just giving these really sad observations and realizing that he's too old to change his ways.
4054000	4057000	And I'm going to read this quote here. This is great.
4057000	4063000	I looked down at Bowser's broken body and saw in it a map of a broken world.
4064000	4072000	And then you press another button and you get it all tastes of mushroom, of fungus, of molder, of damp ash.
4073000	4075000	It's just Un-Wii. Un-Wigi.
4076000	4078000	Sounds so fucking hipster.
4078000	4080000	I know, it's great.
4081000	4090000	It's got a lot of text. It's a lot of reading because apparently a very bored Luigi has a lot of observations about the fucked up Mushroom Kingdom.
4090000	4092000	This piece is called Un-Wigi.
4092000	4101000	I like the picture here. I asked her, why do you stay with him? She laughed. The kind of laugh so empty it's less funny than a sob.
4104000	4114000	Wow, alright. Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are real and coming to a store shelf or a digital shelf near you. Loki.
4114000	4143000	Alright, so this week we have Armello coming out on Xbox One, Assault Suit Lanos on PC, Attack on Titan on PC, Playstation 4, Playstation 3, Playstation Vita and Xbox One, Champions of Anteria on PC, Hatsune Miku Project Diva X on Playstation 4 and Vita, God Eater Resurrection on PC, God Eater 2 Rage Burst on PC, Playstation 4 and Vita,
4143000	4167000	One Way Trip on Playstation 4, Resident Evil 4, I'm assuming the remaster on Playstation 4 and Xbox One, Strike Vector EX on Playstation 4, The Final Station on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One, The Turing Test on PC and Xbox One, Vernon on PS4 and Xbox One,
4167000	4194000	World of Warcraft Legion on PC and Mac, Shiny on PC and Xbox One, Taheria Echoes of the Astral Empire on PC, Mac and Linux, Earthlock Festival of Magic on PC, Mac and Xbox One, Luminous Puzzle and Music on iOS and Android, and finally One Piece Burning Blood on PC.
4194000	4195000	That was a busy week.
4195000	4197000	It's just a lot of small stuff.
4197000	4209000	Yeah, but still, there's a lot of stuff coming up. But then again, Labor Day. I feel like the week of Labor Day is always kind of like a little big week. It's a mini big week. It's not going to be Black Friday big, but it's, you know, big.
4209000	4214000	Yeah, actually the releases for the week after, it's not much.
4214000	4222000	Yeah, because that's when all the kids are back in school at that point. I mean, I know kids are starting school around now, end of August, but Labor Day is like the end.
4222000	4236000	They have, for example, the week after next, Just Sing, which is that new Ubisoft singing game, and the Tomorrow Children. Remember that weird-ass Russian Playstation 4 game?
4236000	4237000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4237000	4238000	Yeah, that's coming out.
4238000	4248000	Alright, let's see. We've got The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Game of the Year Edition coming to Japan on September the 1st. That is on the Playstation 4.
4248000	4260000	So not quite as busy of a week in Japan, because that's really the biggest thing on Playstation 4. Wii U, of course, is kind of, it's pretty dry right now in Japan as well as over here.
4260000	4277000	But looking at the Nintendo 3DS to see what's out of there, also empty until the 15th of September. But they do still get releases on the Vita, and there's one this week. It's Barani Kaku Sarishi Veriti comes out this week.
4277000	4285000	It looks like a French Revolution anime type of thing. You've got, you know, the chick with the poofy hair and the fan and the guy with the...
4285000	4287000	Wait, wait, wait. What was the title again?
4287000	4289000	It's probably based on an anime that I just, I'm not aware of.
4289000	4290000	The Rose of Versailles?
4290000	4294000	Oh, it could be. Yeah, based on the art, there's a lot of roses in it.
4294000	4303000	Yeah, that is an anime actually based off of a real historical figure of a woman who would dress in men's clothes and duel people.
4303000	4319000	Well, I would think that this is probably some type of port of, or like an adventure game based on that. There's no description for this or anything available, so I have no idea what's all in it, if it's a visual novel or what it is.
4319000	4321000	Rose of Versailles is a pretty neat series.
4321000	4330000	Yeah, listen, I like the art style. It's very cool. But a little bit slower in Japan this week, comparative to what Loki just had. But of course, Labor Day is an issue over there.
4330000	4332000	Dark Sakura.
4332000	4341000	This is pretty slow in the UK, though. On the 26th, we have Attack on Titan, and we have King of Fighters XIV on Playstation 4.
4341000	4344000	Wait, it's already the 28th. Why am I doing the 26th?
4344000	4352000	Okay, on the 30th, we have Armello for Xbox One, and the Turing Test for PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.
4352000	4357000	On the 31st, we have RunGunJumpGun on Mac and PC.
4357000	4361000	That's pretty much it. I already looked at September, and nope.
4361000	4363000	That's it.
4363000	4369000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
4369000	4377000	Alright, it's that time of the episode where we have to talk about NX rumors, because there's always NX rumors, and let's get into it, I guess.
4377000	4386000	So this is coming from Emily Rogers, who has kind of supplied some more of the NX rumors before on Twitter.
4386000	4399000	So, kind of just going over some of the stuff. So, for example, it's basically saying that there's some truth to the NX having detachable controllers and supporting force feedback and motion controls.
4399000	4411000	The NX prototype had a 6.2 inch 720p multi-touch touchscreen, and unknown if the final product size will be larger or smaller than the prototype.
4411000	4421000	And then it says the prototype for the dock station has USB ports. I heard two USB ports, but I don't know if this number will change in the final product.
4421000	4425000	And that is all the information that you have this week, speculate away.
4425000	4431000	We still don't know what the fuck this thing is yet, and I think it's stupid at this point.
4432000	4443000	So the one reason I've heard before that Nintendo doesn't want to announce it early because they're afraid that someone's going to copy, but honestly, they're going to copy it anyways if they wanted to.
4443000	4450000	And, I mean, it's going to take a lot longer than six months to develop a console.
4450000	4459000	I think at this point, it's like, you gotta announce it so that at least people know what the hell it is to get excited about it.
4459000	4464000	Because right now, it's like, I don't know what the hell this is, and I'm not excited about it.
4464000	4473000	Well, maybe you'll be able to get excited very soon because, again, the rumor's building that this is going to be announced in September.
4474000	4479000	This comes from the deputy news editor at Eurogamer who's answering some questions on Twitter.
4479000	4482000	But again, what's Eurogamer going to know about this officially?
4482000	4487000	I mean, I suppose they could have been invited to something that's under embargo, but that would be about it, all I can think of.
4487000	4493000	But anyway, it was asked about when the NX would be revealed, and it was interesting.
4493000	4500000	The phrasing used was, haven't heard it's changed from September, but I think info is now on tighter lockdown.
4500000	4506000	So I think that's what people are reading into is the fact that he said changed, like something has already been in stone or what have you.
4506000	4514000	Also, expected to be that there's going to be a Nintendo Direct for fans at the same time that there is an event for the press that occurs.
4514000	4520000	And that really, honestly, it all winds up with the whole right before Tokyo Game Show theory that I threw out there months ago,
4520000	4526000	and I'm sure that's what we're walking towards right now, so it's really just a matter of some type of official confirmation,
4526000	4531000	which may be Penny Arcade Expo, if they want to do an announcement of an announcement, that's a great time to do it.
4531000	4534000	So maybe we'll know something by Labor Day.
4536000	4544000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bike.
4544000	4548000	Anyhow, let's travel back to when things were a little simpler.
4548000	4554000	We're going to go back in time to when, you know what, if you wanted the latest and greatest in the rumors, you got them out of a magazine.
4555000	4556000	If you were lucky.
4556000	4559000	If you were lucky, if you could get your parents to buy it for you.
4559000	4564000	It's a classic game of the week, and Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4564000	4569000	hey, pick up your copy of GamePro and read about this new game.
4569000	4570000	Yeah.
4570000	4572000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4572000	4576000	It's actually a game that was inspired by having watched another review of it.
4577000	4581000	It's this guy who does side-by-sides of different versions.
4581000	4586000	And I felt this one had to be shared with everybody because it's so freaking awesome.
4586000	4587000	Hellfire.
4588000	4591000	Is that not a great name for a game, Hellfire?
4591000	4592000	It's a good name.
4592000	4594000	Anyway, it came out in 1989.
4594000	4598000	It's by Toaplan, which do you know what else they did?
4598000	4600000	Zeroing.
4600000	4601000	Oh, okay.
4601000	4602000	Same company.
4602000	4604000	They also did Snow Brothers, for the record.
4604000	4605000	Okay.
4605000	4607000	It was published by Taito.
4607000	4612000	The game came out in the arcade, and then it was ported to the Mega Drive slash Genesis,
4612000	4617000	and the PC Engine CD system as Hellfire S.
4617000	4623000	It actually has all kinds of interesting changes, by the way, for the PC Engine version,
4623000	4629000	because they changed some of the story to where instead of having a character named Lancer,
4629000	4634000	who was the main pilot, it's a female character named Kaoru.
4634000	4638000	And this is the soundtrack for it right here.
4638000	4647000	It was like many of the PC Engine CD games where it was all remixed CD audio music and really good.
4647000	4652000	So the game is where there is great peace.
4652000	4655000	Everything is nice and peaceful because, yay, humanity.
4655000	4656000	Woohoo!
4656000	4663000	And then this stuff called Black Nebula appears and then tries to take over the latest galaxy
4663000	4669000	and that humanity is colonized, and it's being led by this force called Super mech,
4669000	4670000	who's a robot dictator.
4670000	4674000	And this is actually, Dan and I now have a new in-joke because of this game.
4674000	4676000	It's Space Egypt.
4676000	4680000	In this game, there is a level that is fucking Space Egypt.
4680000	4683000	So, anyway.
4683000	4685000	So is that like Stargate?
4685000	4692000	Yeah, well, I didn't make that idea, but yeah, I guess it would kind of be.
4692000	4695000	Like you go by pyramids and shit in space.
4695000	4700000	And, you know, people with Pharaoh masks in space.
4700000	4704000	I guess if you can have Moet heads and, you know, Grodius and...
4704000	4710000	So maybe we should leave Space Egypt to Toaplan and Easter Island to Konami.
4710000	4719000	At any rate, in the arcade and Mega Drive version, Lancer gets back to Earth and everything is great.
4719000	4726000	But Kaoru in the PC Engine version blows herself up to save the Earth.
4726000	4730000	Anyway, the game itself is...
4730000	4734000	Well, I'll put it this way, the arcade one is really freaking hard.
4734000	4739000	But the cool thing about this one is that you start off being able to choose your weapons.
4739000	4741000	You've got multi-directional weapons.
4741000	4744000	So you can get a front fire, a back fire, top or bottom.
4744000	4746000	And then you can get a diagonal fire.
4746000	4750000	This is a little weaker because you don't have like three concentration beams.
4750000	4752000	It's just one coming at each direction.
4752000	4759000	But it does give you a chance to hit different targets, you know, that you might not otherwise.
4759000	4762000	You also get speed boosts, you get bombs, you get power-ups.
4762000	4766000	But now there are some changes for...
4766000	4768000	And that's just in the arcade game.
4768000	4776000	So for the Mega Drive game, as you're going through this, you also get this little thing that will...
4776000	4781000	Like an option almost that will go around and absorb energy from your enemies and blow them up.
4781000	4787000	And I think like a certain degree of homing to the missiles, the bombs.
4787000	4795000	It also introduced some parallax scrolling for the backgrounds and gave it a much faster feel to it.
4795000	4796000	It really did.
4796000	4802000	The arcade version is pretty, but the Genesis one kind of blows it away in terms of graphical quality.
4802000	4807000	The PC Engine one, though, was actually kind of a disappointment for its look.
4807000	4812000	I mean, it had the great music and the usual, you know, cheese ball, you know,
4812000	4817000	same style of, you know, late 80s, early 90s animation.
4817000	4821000	You know, those extra big eyes and extra big hair and, you know.
4821000	4823000	But the soundtrack was really great.
4823000	4828000	You know, it was actually also easier than the other two versions.
4828000	4830000	Just didn't have the same extra option.
4830000	4837000	You know, the little homing weapons and the little guy following you around like the Mega Drive version.
4837000	4840000	But it's probably the easiest of the three.
4840000	4842000	And that is Hellfire.
4842000	4845000	I mean, it actually was...
4845000	4853000	Mega Tech magazine actually gave this game number four in their top Mega Drive games of all time.
4853000	4860000	And the music was composed by Uemura Tatsuya, so...
4860000	4862000	Yeah, the soundtrack's pretty sweet.
4862000	4868000	Yeah. So, the one thing I don't like is just how big the ship is on the screen.
4868000	4870000	I mean, it's fucking massive.
4870000	4874000	So, the arcade version is really freaking hard.
4874000	4877000	But the thing that was surprising is how easy the PC Engine version is,
4877000	4881000	because usually when shooters come to the PC Engine, they get harder.
4881000	4884000	So... But it's a good game.
4884000	4885000	All right.
4885000	4887000	Hellfire. You can find it, get it.
4887000	4892000	All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Hellfire.
4892000	4896000	For PC Engine, TurboGrafx-16, whatever you prefer.
4896000	4899000	And a game, admittedly, I did not know much about.
4899000	4900000	But it sounds very cool.
4900000	4903000	And there's a gameplay video as well I was looking at before. It looks pretty neat.
4903000	4906000	Well, there's... I've actually done other Toaplon games.
4906000	4908000	I think I've done Zero Wing before.
4908000	4909000	I think you did Zero Wing.
4909000	4912000	I've done Tatsujin, which was Truxton.
4912000	4915000	And I don't think I've done Snow Brothers yet,
4915000	4920000	but I still want a copy of Batsu-kun, because it's just an e-game.
4920000	4923000	All right. We're going to take a quick break here in studio,
4923000	4925000	but when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,
4925000	4928000	your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype,
4928000	4931000	also your emails and the FUs of the week, and much more.
4931000	4935000	When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4941000	4944000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4944000	4949000	Live tonight, right in the middle of our 656th episode for this,
4949000	4952000	August the 28th of 2016.
4952000	4956000	Our show already in progress before we have a little break here
4956000	4958000	for Labor Day and Dragon Con.
4958000	4961000	And many of you guys, I'm sure, are doing Penny Arcade Expo out there.
4961000	4963000	It's a big weekend for conventions.
4963000	4965000	They're having one here locally, SacAnime.
4965000	4968000	That's a pretty big deal, and I haven't been in years
4968000	4970000	since I'm always at Dragon Con these days,
4970000	4972000	but didn't we do a panel at SacAnime once,
4972000	4974000	like, years ago in the early days of OLR?
4974000	4975000	I feel like it was at SacAnime.
4975000	4978000	Yes, it was at SacAnime, and it was at, like, 8 in the morning.
4978000	4981000	It was 8 in the morning, and I think we had one person show up.
4981000	4983000	But you know what? We did the damn show anyway.
4983000	4985000	We did the damn show anyway, and we had a great time.
4985000	4987000	Maybe we were, like, a last-minute ad or something anyway,
4987000	4989000	so the promotion was really, really bad.
4989000	4992000	So, Dark Tetsuya says, I know you guys did one at Fanime.
4992000	4994000	Yeah, we did a couple at Fanime. It's been a few years,
4994000	4997000	but, yeah, we had done panels at Fanime.
4997000	5001000	I should mention, even though we, you know, here at OLR,
5001000	5005000	we only have the Parsec Award appearance at Dragon Con,
5005000	5008000	we will have a panel at GamerX4.
5008000	5011000	Dark Soccer, myself, and Captain Spike from GameBooey.org
5011000	5013000	are going to be doing a live show.
5013000	5016000	We're doing a super show, which we're still trying to plan out.
5016000	5019000	We'll probably be adding to who is on that as well,
5019000	5021000	but for right now, it's the three of us.
5021000	5024000	Probably some other friends and fun guests, too.
5024000	5027000	We did a lot of panels previously that were about, like,
5027000	5029000	how to podcast and why to podcast,
5029000	5032000	so we thought this year we would just podcast,
5032000	5034000	and that would be fun. Do an actual show.
5034000	5038000	So, that'll be happening live at GamerX, so look forward to that.
5038000	5041000	Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some news,
5041000	5044000	some rapid-fire news, some quick news stories here. Loki.
5044000	5048000	All right. So, this is kind of cool.
5048000	5050000	I remember seeing, like, a little video about it
5050000	5052000	when they launched their Kickstarter,
5052000	5056000	but Adult Swim Games is going to be helping ToeJam and Earl,
5056000	5059000	the brand new ToeJam and Earl game, come back.
5059000	5063000	The, what was it, Back in the Groove would be the subtitle on that.
5063000	5067000	And, yeah, looks pretty good so far, actually.
5067000	5069000	I don't know when it's releasing or what platforms yet.
5069000	5073000	They said PC and consoles, but next year sometime.
5073000	5075000	That's when they'll be releasing.
5075000	5078000	But that's cool that they'll be actually published at some point.
5078000	5082000	I know that Adult Swim's been really kind of getting into gaming lately,
5082000	5086000	so I will have to look forward to that, I guess.
5086000	5093000	And then we've got a couple free-to-play games being shut down by Ubisoft,
5093000	5099000	and this includes Ghost Recon Phantoms and the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot.
5099000	5102000	Those are both closing down later this year.
5102000	5106000	Looks like the Mighty Quest for Epic Loot will close on October 25th,
5106000	5111000	followed by Ghost Recon Phantoms on December 1st.
5113000	5114000	Who is playing those games?
5114000	5115000	I don't know.
5115000	5118000	Apparently not enough people, or they wouldn't be shutting them down, right?
5118000	5119000	Right.
5119000	5121000	Well, sorry to the fans of those games,
5121000	5124000	but apparently there were not a lot of people playing them,
5124000	5127000	and so Ubisoft didn't feel like paying the bill anymore.
5127000	5130000	Going back just a little bit to the ToeJam and Earl thing,
5130000	5133000	SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com going,
5133000	5136000	Adult Swim Games has really gotten big.
5136000	5139000	Yeah, it does seem like they've been doing more and more,
5139000	5141000	and I think this ToeJam and Earl thing is probably going to have a presence
5141000	5143000	at Penny Arcade Expo, right?
5143000	5144000	Maybe.
5144000	5146000	Which I think is part of the reason why they announced it now.
5146000	5150000	Well, for those of you guys that have seen this on Netflix,
5150000	5153000	it was really just only a matter of time before something like this happened,
5153000	5157000	and of course I'm talking about Stranger Things on Netflix, which is great.
5157000	5159000	Of course, we raved about that a few episodes ago.
5160000	5163000	Well, apparently a group called Infamous Games,
5163000	5167000	which they say that they like to do old-school adventure games,
5167000	5173000	they have built a non-authorized, but it's a playable fan tribute to the series.
5173000	5176000	The version that they've put out there, it's not complete,
5176000	5179000	but they're just kind of looking at one of the show's scenes
5179000	5182000	in that classic 80s adventure game style.
5182000	5185000	Actually, this looks a little more, it doesn't really look 80s to me,
5185000	5187000	because where computing was in the mid-80s,
5187000	5188000	couldn't have produced these types of graphics.
5188000	5195000	This is more like that Lucas Games, early 90s loom type of look to it,
5195000	5198000	is what this reminds me of, but it's still a great throwback,
5198000	5202000	and I hope they don't get cease and desisted by Netflix,
5202000	5203000	so they probably will,
5203000	5207000	but I would like to see them be able to put out this full vision there.
5207000	5211000	Anyway, in the scene you get to help Hopper,
5211000	5213000	who's one of the main characters of the game, the Sheriff,
5214000	5220000	and the deputies look for a clue to why someone has disappeared in the woods,
5220000	5222000	and then you find the clue and that ends the game.
5222000	5225000	It's a very short, playable scene, but why not?
5225000	5226000	Why not?
5226000	5227000	So yeah, check that out.
5227000	5231000	In between generating all those graphics on the Stranger Things generator,
5231000	5234000	because that's all I saw on Twitter this week,
5234000	5239000	was people generating their own words and phrases in the Stranger Things font.
5239000	5242000	Moving on to a game that I keep forgetting is coming out this fall,
5242000	5245000	and I don't know why, because I'm really excited about this game,
5245000	5247000	and that is Civilization VI.
5247000	5249000	There's a collector's edition, because of course there is,
5249000	5251000	announced for Civilization VI this week.
5251000	5254000	It will come with an art book, some commemorative coins,
5254000	5258000	some DLC, because that's where Civilization is now,
5258000	5262000	and all the bonus content that comes to the digital deluxe edition.
5262000	5267000	90 bucks if you want all that, but coins, did I say coins?
5268000	5273000	Anyhow, pre-order DLC will be exclusive for 90 days.
5273000	5276000	That's something interesting with Civilization VI,
5276000	5280000	but I'm assuming after those 90 days they want to open it up so that people can buy it,
5280000	5282000	because of course they want people to buy it.
5282000	5285000	But Civilization VI, it's going to be awesome.
5285000	5287000	Dark Sakura.
5287000	5290000	Well, here's some other stuff.
5290000	5297000	There is a few new titles coming out to the Virtual Console.
5297000	5299000	Yay! Echo, echo, echo.
5299000	5303000	So, among those is Super Mario 64 DS,
5303000	5306000	that will be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console,
5306000	5310000	and then also three Street Fighter titles.
5310000	5313000	Super Street Fighter Alpha 2, sorry, not Super,
5313000	5316000	Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo Hyper Fighting,
5316000	5321000	and Street Fighter 2 The New Challengers will be released on August 25th.
5321000	5325000	And then, kind of video game-y, but kind of not.
5325000	5332000	It's a good idea to pay attention to ergonomics when you are at your computer,
5332000	5335000	and now there is a very cute way to do that,
5335000	5342000	with an Eevee plushie that comes with a pillow that its little paws can attach to,
5342000	5346000	and you can sit with it on your lap, which helps you maintain your posture,
5346000	5352000	while still resting your wrists in a comfortable place in front of your keyboard,
5352000	5356000	because you're supposed to have your hands resting higher than the keyboard a little bit,
5356000	5358000	to relieve pressure on your wrists,
5358000	5362000	and so now you have a super adorable way to do it.
5362000	5364000	Yay, Eevee.
5364000	5367000	And Pokemon's all the rage right now, you know.
5367000	5368000	Well, yeah.
5368000	5371000	I also like that all their marketing there is still Pocket Monster.
5371000	5375000	That is the old school name, absolutely.
5375000	5379000	Alright, we're going to get back into some of the long form news,
5379000	5381000	and of course, coming up in a little bit here,
5381000	5387000	the mailbag and the FUs of the Week, and your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5387000	5390000	But first, we have some more news stories for you with Loki.
5390000	5394000	So, I'm sure you've heard that a lot of people aren't too happy with No Man's Sky,
5394000	5398000	and how a lot of the things that were promised aren't coming through,
5398000	5403000	or, you know, a lot of the things that should be functioning in the game
5403000	5406000	aren't necessarily functioning as well as they were supposed to.
5406000	5411000	So, there's been a lot of people looking to get their money back,
5411000	5413000	and getting some refunds.
5413000	5417000	And thankfully, there's been some research into this,
5417000	5422000	and apparently multiple services are offering refunds for your purchases of No Man's Sky,
5422000	5426000	including Steam, Amazon, and PlayStation Network.
5426000	5430000	Steam even going so far as to allow you to do a refund,
5430000	5438000	even if you played longer, if you've, you know, had it,
5438000	5442000	or you just played under two hours within two weeks.
5442000	5447000	But I guess I want to say that I thought that they were bending that rule for this,
5447000	5450000	and allowing you to do it anyways, but you might want to check into that.
5450000	5455000	And of course, you know, Amazon, they said they're looking at case by case spaces for those,
5455000	5457000	and then it's only kind of the same thing.
5457000	5461000	They'll refund any purchase within 14 days of the purchase.
5464000	5466000	Yeah, I mean, it looks...
5466000	5470000	I mean, I guess I'm not surprised that people are asking for refunds for that stuff.
5470000	5474000	I mean, I still would like give it some time, just to see...
5474000	5477000	It sounds like that they are working on patching the game,
5477000	5480000	and getting things up to, you know, where they should be.
5481000	5484000	I just kind of wish that that was there at launch.
5484000	5488000	I mean, honestly, since they gave themselves extra time,
5488000	5492000	and you basically see how many corners were cut for it,
5492000	5494000	it's just kind of disappointing.
5494000	5503000	Well, and it seems like they fixed a lot of those PC issues within a few days, too.
5503000	5504000	You know what I mean?
5504000	5508000	Like the PC version with all the graphic issues people were complaining about and stuff,
5508000	5510000	that seemed to get fixed relatively fast.
5510000	5512000	They've done several updates.
5512000	5515000	It's like 1.07 now on PlayStation 4.
5515000	5519000	So, I mean, they're working on fixing some of that stuff,
5519000	5522000	and I think a lot of the PC issues have been fixed.
5522000	5525000	I've seen, like, there's already been quite a few mods coming out for it.
5525000	5529000	So, you know, what the developer doesn't fix, the modding community will.
5529000	5532000	So, I don't know, that's kind of interesting.
5532000	5534000	I'd be curious to see what mods that they have on there.
5534000	5539000	I know the one I did see seemed to add a lot more of the plant life,
5539000	5543000	and made the plants look a little bit more lush, I guess.
5543000	5547000	So, yeah.
5547000	5550000	I wish they had modding support on the PlayStation 4 version.
5550000	5554000	I kind of wish they had modding support on the PlayStation 4 version of Fallout 4 as well,
5554000	5558000	but, you know, we can't all have everything, I guess.
5558000	5563000	All right, well, it's probably just a matter of time before it mods.
5563000	5570000	Oh, it's just that complicated PlayStation 4 and PlayStation's, you know, network requirements and stuff.
5570000	5571000	True.
5571000	5576000	I don't know. I don't really know what the excuse is, but I'm disappointed that we still don't have that yet.
5576000	5581000	Yeah. All right, well, moving on to talk about Pokémon GO,
5581000	5585000	which, you know, still a lot of people are talking about, but there's a lot of buzz out there.
5585000	5588000	In fact, I saw this, like, trending on Facebook or something this week.
5588000	5591000	A lot of buzz out there that Pokémon GO is in decline,
5591000	5596000	and, of course, it's interesting how people really want to just, like, rally around, like,
5596000	5602000	oh, look, this game is flopping already, but that's not really what's happening, you guys.
5602000	5607000	Pokémon GO peaked in popularity at some point in mid-July,
5607000	5613000	but based on data collected by Sensor Tower, Survey Monkey, Aptopia,
5613000	5616000	they have to use these third-party sites to measure this stuff because, you know,
5616000	5618000	they don't really put anything official out there.
5618000	5624000	It looks like that the worldwide daily active users have just dropped from about 40 million to 30 million.
5624000	5628000	That's still 30 million people playing this game.
5628000	5631000	Show me any other mobile game that's at that level right now.
5631000	5635000	So, I think Pokémon GO is still doing very, very well, but, of course, you know,
5635000	5640000	some people are complaining about, oh, the radar's got the issues, and, you know, you know,
5640000	5645000	I understand Ant just got to fix a bunch of that stuff, but the reality is it wasn't going to last forever.
5645000	5651000	I'm surprised they haven't switched up the, what was it, switched up the farms yet.
5651000	5652000	Remember, they were had-
5652000	5653000	I thought, I heard they did again last week.
5653000	5654000	Did they?
5654000	5656000	That the nest changed again, yeah.
5656000	5661000	I heard they changed again because, like, where people were finding, I think,
5661000	5666000	Poliwhirls, they were now finding, god, it changed to something else,
5666000	5668000	and it was something kind of rare-ish.
5668000	5672000	I don't remember, but, yeah, like, some of the nests has changed, so you wanted to look that up.
5672000	5674000	That was, like, in the middle of the week last week.
5674000	5677000	So, but I think this is very natural.
5677000	5679000	I mean, it's like MMOs.
5679000	5683000	An expansion comes out, big up, and then it'll slowly tick off,
5683000	5688000	and then I'm sure when the second gen of Pokémon comes out, it'll go back up,
5688000	5693000	or when the radar thing gets, you know, which I saw when I was in San Francisco,
5693000	5698000	when I went to Pokémon Worlds with Shane, we got to see, because, you know,
5698000	5701000	when you're in San Francisco, you get the new radar, and it looked really cool,
5701000	5704000	and I don't know why they haven't rolled that out worldwide yet,
5704000	5708000	but I imagine that's going to be any day now, that's going to come out everywhere,
5708000	5710000	and I think that'll get some people interested in the game again,
5710000	5713000	who were getting a little frustrated with the way the radar thing played out.
5713000	5717000	You know, so I think this game is far from dead.
5717000	5723000	When, you know, when you've got another game, whether it be Candy Crush,
5723000	5726000	or Words with Friends, or Draw Something, or whatever,
5726000	5729000	that gets back up to this level, you let me know.
5730000	5732000	So, alright.
5732000	5736000	But, you know, and I'll say, you know, as much as I might be defending Pokémon Go here,
5736000	5742000	and the fact that people are, like, you know, excited, it seems on Facebook to see it decline in popularity,
5742000	5746000	I myself have really scaled back in how much I've been playing the game,
5746000	5751000	but that's just, I mean, because I've just been, when I go out to play a game,
5751000	5755000	I usually end up playing Ingress, just because that's the game I've always kind of been into,
5755000	5760000	so I think that's more why my Pokémon Go stuff has been declining.
5760000	5765000	And I'm still waiting to really see, like, what the point of the team and the gym control thing becomes,
5765000	5770000	because there's no, there's no real way to measure up in the community and so forth,
5770000	5771000	like there is in Ingress.
5771000	5775000	I don't know, I just feel, I feel my progress more in Ingress than I do in a game like Pokémon Go.
5775000	5777000	So, whatever.
5777000	5778000	Alright, well let's move on.
5778000	5781000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
5781000	5792000	Happiness. So much happiness, because the game, inspired by a preview,
5792000	5797000	named after a 1990's Gin Blossom song,
5800000	5802000	is back.
5804000	5807000	Ugh, Allison Road is back.
5808000	5814000	So, basically they had cancelled everything, they said we weren't going to do it,
5814000	5819000	and now the creator, Christian Kessler, says it's back.
5819000	5823000	He has a new company that he made with his wife called Far From Home,
5823000	5830000	and considered that cancellation moment a setback, and now they are back and working on it.
5830000	5834000	He said he started making a few necessary changes to the story and the flow,
5834000	5836000	and it came back to life.
5836000	5842000	So, they're working on it, no details yet, but they're still working on it.
5842000	5845000	So, yay!
5846000	5847000	Great.
5848000	5850000	Yes. Yes!
5851000	5852000	Yes, God.
5852000	5859000	Well, the fact that it's kind of been up and down and up, you know, it gives me some reservations,
5859000	5864000	but I look forward to when they put an actual teaser out there or something,
5864000	5867000	I look forward to what they're going to deliver.
5867000	5870000	I just like the excuse to use Gin Blossoms in the background.
5870000	5872000	I can't, I'd like...
5872000	5874000	You were very excited about that.
5874000	5877000	Other people had to have caught that that was a thing, right?
5877000	5879000	Whatever.
5879000	5881000	I feel extra old.
5881000	5883000	I'm going to go drink my Geritol now.
5883000	5886000	Alright, go watch the Matlock reruns while we go to a story from...
5886000	5889000	Actually, but you know what? I was going to say go watch some murder she wrote,
5889000	5893000	but you can do that at any... Angela Lansbury is timeless, okay?
5893000	5895000	Actually, Matlock wasn't a bad show.
5896000	5898000	My grandmother watched Matlock a lot.
5898000	5900000	It was kind of boring.
5900000	5904000	I would end up watching Matlock with my grandmother while I did stuff.
5904000	5905000	Alright.
5905000	5907000	You know, it wasn't that bad.
5907000	5909000	Alright, let's move on. Logie.
5910000	5913000	Alright, so this is kind of interesting,
5913000	5917000	but one of the co-creators of Rick and Morty
5917000	5923000	has teamed up with some former executive from Epic,
5923000	5925000	and they're making VR games.
5925000	5929000	So it's a new company called Squanchtendo,
5929000	5933000	which sounds just kind of like a Nintendo thing, but...
5934000	5935000	Yeah, they're...
5935000	5937000	Now that's a vegetable I'd eat.
5938000	5940000	Squashten? Squashtendo?
5940000	5942000	No, that's Squash. Squanch.
5942000	5944000	Oh, Squanch. I thought you said Squash.
5944000	5947000	I was like, actually Squash is pretty good to begin with.
5947000	5951000	Alright, wow, when jokes go horrifically wrong on the next OLR.
5953000	5958000	Yeah, so they're going to be making VR games,
5958000	5963000	and they had a funny little comic to announce it as well.
5963000	5965000	You know what VR game they should make?
5965000	5969000	Is that courtroom scene from Georgia, the short that they did for...
5969000	5972000	What did they do with that? For Comic-Con or something like that?
5972000	5974000	Have you seen that YouTube of the Rick and Morty,
5974000	5977000	that they do the voices for the court scene
5977000	5980000	of the guy who's just going crazy that's like, you know,
5980000	5984000	he says all these really obscene things about like,
5984000	5987000	why don't you shut up and blow me or something.
5987000	5990000	He's just talking back to the judge, and the judge starts talking back to him.
5990000	5993000	It's hilarious, but it's in the Rick and Morty voices.
5994000	5996000	And because of this, no, fuck you.
5998000	6001000	If you continue to fuck you, it was that one, right?
6002000	6005000	Kind of, but it was a lot more obscene than that.
6005000	6007000	It was really, really funny.
6007000	6010000	Why don't you go fuck yourself and other things like that, right?
6010000	6012000	I remember reading the thing like back in the day.
6012000	6016000	Yes, yes. Actually, I can do a little clip here.
6016000	6019000	I don't know, but again, this is like a nine and a half minute thing,
6019000	6021000	so I don't know, but here's what I'm talking about.
6022000	6023000	Fuck yourself.
6023000	6025000	Okay, I'm going to tell you how this is going to work.
6025000	6027000	You either listen or not. I don't care.
6027000	6029000	I'm through. Can I leave the courtroom?
6029000	6030000	No, you've got to stay here.
6030000	6031000	No, I'm not talking to the bastard.
6031000	6033000	We are going to have the trial Monday week.
6033000	6036000	No, the fuck we are. I ain't going to trial with this lawyer present.
6036000	6037000	Listen, if you do not-
6037000	6039000	Suck my dick, you stinking ass cracker.
6039000	6041000	If you act like this, if you act like this,
6041000	6043000	I will send you out of the courtroom-
6043000	6044000	Old bitch ass cracker.
6044000	6047000	And leave you out of the courtroom during the trial.
6047000	6048000	Horse ass cracker.
6048000	6049000	Do you understand that?
6049000	6050000	Sucking ass.
6050000	6052000	Do you understand that?
6054000	6056000	I could just let that play all day. It's hilarious.
6056000	6058000	Yeah, so that's the VR game I want.
6059000	6061000	Well, one of the VR games that they're working on right now
6061000	6065000	is the Rick and Morty, it was the Morty Simulator,
6065000	6068000	Virtual Rick-ality, so that is one of the ones
6068000	6069000	that they're working on right now.
6069000	6072000	Okay, maybe I will get that after all.
6072000	6073000	That'd be great.
6074000	6076000	I'd play Phoenix Wright if it was that.
6080000	6082000	Well, one game I know I'm going to be playing
6082000	6086000	because I am super excited about this series.
6086000	6089000	Even though the last few times it was on mobile,
6089000	6090000	it was kind of garbage.
6090000	6092000	But I'm willing to give it another go,
6092000	6093000	and that is Luminous.
6093000	6096000	That's right, Luminous is coming back with a new version.
6096000	6098000	It's another mobile edition.
6098000	6100000	It's going to be, as I think Logie mentioned during release dates,
6100000	6104000	it is out on Android and iOS on September 1st for $3.
6104000	6106000	$2.99 was $3.
6107000	6110000	It's going to have some classic tracks and some new tracks.
6110000	6113000	You will be able to play in portrait mode on your phones,
6113000	6116000	which is the way that it looked on an HD TV,
6116000	6117000	so that should be fine.
6120000	6121000	You mean landscape?
6122000	6123000	Is that what I mean?
6123000	6125000	No, why does it say a portrait-style setup?
6125000	6127000	You're right, that would be landscape, not portrait.
6127000	6129000	Maybe some people like to play in portrait.
6130000	6131000	That would be weird, though.
6131000	6134000	Portrait is like the way you play Meteos or something.
6134000	6136000	But yeah, I can't imagine it won't be like,
6136000	6139000	why would you suddenly want to play in portrait mode?
6139000	6140000	You're not going to be able to see as much.
6140000	6142000	Maybe they're just talking about, when they use that word,
6142000	6144000	they're talking about the artistic style or something like that.
6144000	6145000	That's a little weird.
6145000	6148000	But anyway, I guess we'll find out when the game is out,
6148000	6150000	because we don't really have screenshots or anything.
6150000	6152000	Well, good, I need a new game to play.
6152000	6155000	Yeah, since you banished one from your phone.
6156000	6159000	I don't mind you, the last Luminous game that was out
6159000	6160000	was kind of earlier in the iPhone.
6160000	6162000	It was around the time of the iPhone 4 or something.
6162000	6164000	It was garbage.
6164000	6167000	So hopefully this one's gotten the controls down better.
6167000	6171000	I should download that Space Invaders game that they had before.
6171000	6173000	What was the other one that was on rails?
6173000	6174000	Oh, the Groove Coaster?
6174000	6175000	Groove Coaster, yeah.
6175000	6177000	That's an arcade cabinet at round one,
6177000	6179000	which, by the way, ready for the tangent train?
6179000	6180000	Choo choo!
6180000	6182000	Round one opened up in Concord this week.
6182000	6183000	Cool.
6183000	6184000	Not quite in Sacramento yet.
6184000	6186000	Yeah, but you don't have to go all the way to San Jose.
6186000	6188000	Now, I wasn't able to go because I was super busy this weekend
6188000	6190000	with Rocky Horror last night and everything.
6190000	6193000	But Shane went, and he wasn't able to be on tonight's show
6193000	6195000	because he has some of this stuff going on.
6195000	6198000	But Shane spoke very favorably of the new round one.
6198000	6200000	He said there's not as many music games,
6200000	6201000	but there's still a lot,
6201000	6204000	and there's less people playing them, I guess,
6204000	6207000	because it's Concord, so I guess he got to get more games in.
6207000	6211000	And he said they had the Luigi's Mansion arcade machine was there.
6211000	6212000	That's cool.
6212000	6213000	Which they don't have in San Jose.
6213000	6216000	So just an interesting little side tangent.
6216000	6217000	Well, maybe.
6217000	6219000	You know, they went in San Jose.
6219000	6220000	Now they're in Concord.
6220000	6223000	The next logical place to keep moving this direction
6223000	6225000	would be here in Sacramento, right?
6225000	6228000	Why not put that out in, I don't know, people will love that,
6228000	6232000	in like Roseville or Folsom or, I don't know, West Sac.
6232000	6234000	What else is growing around here?
6234000	6235000	Elk Grove?
6235000	6237000	Put it in the Palladio because there's like nothing there.
6237000	6239000	Yeah, maybe. That'd be awesome.
6239000	6242000	Or, I don't know, Sunrise Mall.
6242000	6244000	It's the whole mall.
6244000	6246000	Just tear the rest of the mall down.
6246000	6248000	It's all the arcade.
6248000	6249000	All right.
6249000	6250000	All right.
6250000	6252000	Anyway, I don't know how we went from luminous to round one,
6252000	6253000	but we did.
6253000	6254000	There you go.
6254000	6255000	Let's get to the emails.
6255000	6257000	Every week you guys send us emails.
6257000	6259000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6259000	6262000	if you want to participate with our show.
6262000	6264000	Dark Soccer's going to dive into the emails
6264000	6267000	and find some emails to read for you tonight.
6267000	6269000	Again, that's Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6269000	6270000	if you want to send us an email.
6270000	6272000	There's two.
6272000	6273000	Two whole emails.
6273000	6274000	All right, let's do it.
6274000	6275000	Hello, LR.
6275000	6276000	Hi.
6277000	6279000	Just a couple of thoughts on last week's episode.
6279000	6281000	I don't know if Shane is listening,
6281000	6283000	but Time Crisis 5 is a phenomenal game
6283000	6285000	when the guns are calibrated properly.
6285000	6287000	So if he sees it again in a location
6287000	6289000	where they care enough to calibrate it properly,
6289000	6291000	I hope he'll give it another try.
6291000	6292000	Maybe they had that in Concord.
6292000	6293000	I didn't ask.
6293000	6294000	I didn't ask about Time Crisis.
6294000	6297000	Alternatively, many recent gun games
6297000	6299000	have some sort of user calibration.
6299000	6301000	Look on the machine to see if it mentions it.
6301000	6303000	Also mentioned was the Mario and Sonic
6303000	6305000	at the Rio Olympics arcade game.
6305000	6308000	I actually did play this at my local Dave and Buster's
6308000	6310000	a couple of months back when I discovered
6310000	6313000	that some kid left like seven credits on it.
6313000	6315000	You get to play one mini game per credit
6315000	6318000	choosing from things like archery, hurdles,
6318000	6320000	swimming, or your classic 100 meter dash.
6320000	6322000	Basically, it controls like the old world class
6322000	6324000	track meet on your power pad,
6324000	6326000	except that there's an infrared sensor
6326000	6328000	watching your feet instead of physical buttons
6328000	6331000	or that there are two joystick levers,
6331000	6334000	one on each side that are used for things like jumping
6334000	6336000	or the rhythmic gymnastics event,
6336000	6341000	which is absolutely not part of the Rio Olympics.
6341000	6343000	The other cool thing about this game
6343000	6345000	is that just like Mario Kart arcade
6345000	6347000	or even good old Daytona USA,
6347000	6349000	there are several cabinets and you will compete
6349000	6352000	against whoever else is playing at that time.
6352000	6355000	Of course, you can intentionally not join someone else's game
6355000	6357000	and just play by yourself,
6357000	6360000	but there's no difference except you'll be up against AI.
6360000	6363000	The game was fun even if it was over pretty quickly.
6363000	6365000	You play one event and that's it.
6365000	6368000	The menu screens and post-game award ceremony
6368000	6370000	definitely take longer than the actual game,
6370000	6372000	but it was fun while it lasted.
6372000	6376000	Worth a look if you're in a place that has it
6376000	6379000	and you don't mind being a bit sore the next day.
6379000	6381000	And this one's for me, Jamie.
6381000	6383000	Good luck with the crappy shift. Hang in there.
6383000	6386000	Until next time, Aaron, YYR.
6386000	6388000	Always good to hear from YYR.
6388000	6390000	You know, I will go ahead and just say this.
6390000	6393000	I am actually changing from a worse shift
6393000	6395000	to the one I'm getting.
6395000	6399000	It's just that the worse shift allows you to do the show at least.
6399000	6405000	Well, yeah, but I wouldn't be in any shape to do the show anyway.
6405000	6407000	No, I understand. I understand.
6407000	6410000	So it's between my health and doing the show,
6410000	6412000	to be perfectly honest.
6412000	6416000	Well, I had not played that Mario and Sonic Rio Olympic Games,
6416000	6418000	so that was cool to hear a little bit about it.
6418000	6420000	So I'll have to check it out at some point.
6420000	6423000	The one thing I'm hearing about this whole round one thing and the new one,
6423000	6425000	Shane was telling me that the round one in Concord
6425000	6427000	is not with the rest of the network,
6427000	6431000	so my card won't work there, which seems a little bit ridiculous.
6431000	6434000	But I don't think I had a lot of money left on my San Jose card anyway,
6434000	6436000	so I guess it's not that big a deal.
6436000	6438000	I have a ton of friends in San Jose.
6438000	6440000	I'm sure I'll be back there at some point anyway.
6440000	6443000	Let's just go to Mills Garage.
6443000	6447000	Well, apparently there's a DDR machine there now with memory card slots.
6447000	6449000	They're opening up a mini arcade.
6449000	6452000	Don't they have a one-car garage?
6452000	6455000	Yeah, and it's starting to fill with arcade games.
6455000	6457000	They own the Para... Should I be talking about this on air?
6457000	6459000	I guess they wouldn't care.
6459000	6462000	They own the Para Para machine that used to be Arcade Infinities back in the day,
6462000	6464000	so that is still there.
6464000	6468000	And they moved stuff onto a flash drive,
6468000	6471000	so it runs a lot smoother with that machine.
6471000	6473000	And then there is a Dance Maniacs,
6473000	6475000	and that's the last time I played Dance Maniacs.
6475000	6478000	Solo, and now there's a... Is it the Xtreme?
6478000	6480000	It's the Xtreme that they bought.
6480000	6482000	I think their Solo wasn't really working anyway,
6482000	6486000	and at one point they kind of just unplugged the arcade part of it,
6486000	6488000	and they were just using the dance pad with a PlayStation 2.
6488000	6492000	So, yeah, I don't know what the story is behind that,
6492000	6494000	but we'll have to get them back on the show at some point to ask.
6494000	6497000	But, yeah, I know there's an Xtreme machine in there now.
6497000	6499000	They just picked that up.
6499000	6501000	And the Xtreme machine came from this area.
6501000	6504000	Apparently there was some place over at Sunrise and 50
6504000	6505000	and all those warehouses over there.
6505000	6508000	I think it was the bouncy... You know the bouncy trampoline place?
6508000	6511000	I think it came from there. I think that's who sold it.
6511000	6512000	Yeah, crazy, right?
6512000	6514000	Yeah. Well, last email?
6514000	6516000	Yes. And by the way, sorry, Dark Tetsuya says,
6516000	6519000	I wonder if you upgraded the Dance Maniacs with that new version.
6519000	6523000	As far as I know, the version they have has some type of...
6523000	6524000	It's the...
6524000	6525000	But it was the J-Paradise.
6525000	6527000	It is the J-Paradise.
6527000	6528000	Korean edition.
6528000	6530000	Yeah, it's whatever has the most songs,
6530000	6533000	but I have heard there's an even newer one that has a ton of stuff.
6533000	6535000	I don't think they've tried that yet.
6536000	6537000	As far as I know.
6537000	6538000	Email time.
6538000	6539000	Yes.
6539000	6542000	Hey, OLR. I just wanted to share a gaming experience I had last night.
6542000	6545000	I was over my boyfriend's house
6545000	6548000	and he decided to turn on his Steam link
6548000	6550000	to show me some of his games that he has.
6550000	6553000	As he was going through his Steam library, I noticed he had Peggle.
6553000	6556000	Now, before yesterday, I only heard of Peggle from you guys.
6556000	6559000	So I asked him to show me the game without knowing what to expect.
6559000	6562000	At first, it kind of reminded me of the Miitomo Drop game
6562000	6565000	and the music was very classic sounding and catchy,
6565000	6570000	but nothing could prepare me for the fever thing that happens at the end of every level.
6570000	6573000	It is so over the top with all of these colors and rainbows
6573000	6576000	and it tops off with blasting Ode to Joy.
6576000	6580000	Peggle was the most unexpected gaming experience I ever had.
6580000	6582000	I encourage anyone who never played it before
6582000	6585000	to go and download it right now and play it.
6585000	6589000	So I was wondering, did you guys ever have an unexpected gaming experience?
6589000	6590000	If so, what game was it?
6590000	6591000	Oh, good question.
6591000	6593000	One of your longtime listeners, Ziba.
6593000	6597000	For the record, you should see what happens if you fully clear the level.
6597000	6604000	You get like ultra hyper fever and then sometimes you'll get,
6604000	6609000	if you manage to ace the score, then you'll get like ribbons and everything for it too.
6609000	6612000	I love this story too because it's not like Peggle's,
6612000	6614000	I mean, Peggle is kind of an older game at this point, right?
6614000	6616000	It is, but it's super fun.
6616000	6620000	But it's awesome that somebody's discovering that for the first time, right?
6620000	6623000	It's like finding that old TV show that you've just found on everything.
6623000	6626000	Like, I don't know, like a lot of people now are finding Twin Peaks, let's say,
6626000	6628000	which is like, that's a show I loved from the 90s,
6628000	6630000	even if it got really weird in the second season.
6630000	6633000	But like the fact that it's coming back and everything, you know.
6633000	6635000	But like people are discovering that for the first time now.
6635000	6639000	And I just love this story that like, oh, somebody's discovering that first time.
6639000	6641000	So that's great.
6641000	6643000	Can you read the question part of that again?
6643000	6645000	Because the question that she had.
6645000	6650000	So I was wondering, did you guys ever have an unexpected gaming experience?
6650000	6652000	If so, what game was it?
6652000	6657000	I know that actually another PopCap game Bejeweled was kind of fun for me
6657000	6659000	because of that stupid butterfly mode.
6659000	6661000	I am addicted to butterfly mode.
6661000	6666000	And I scream every time that damn jewel spider eats my butterflies.
6666000	6668000	It's just like the craziest thing.
6668000	6672000	Well, as cheesy of an answer as this might be,
6672000	6675000	the honest to God first thing that comes to my mind, DDR.
6675000	6678000	I mean, that game literally changed my life.
6678000	6680000	Derby Owners Club.
6680000	6684000	Seriously, did you expect to like that fucking game?
6684000	6685000	That's a good answer.
6685000	6687000	If you guys don't know what Derby Owners Club is,
6687000	6689000	gigantic, they probably still have it at some Dave and Busters.
6689000	6690000	They've got to still have it.
6690000	6692000	It's horse betting and horse racing.
6692000	6693000	Yeah, it's a horse racing game.
6693000	6698000	And you actually breed a horse who's on these little magnetic cards that you use.
6698000	6700000	I still have my binder.
6700000	6704000	I don't have binders of women. I have binders of horses.
6706000	6708000	I love it.
6708000	6709000	What about you, Loki?
6709000	6712000	But DDR is my choice, honestly.
6712000	6717000	Who knew that Stomping Arrows would be here all these years later?
6717000	6721000	As much shit as we give Konami now, and rightfully so, let's be real,
6721000	6725000	none of the people who had anything to do with DDR's successes are even there anymore.
6725000	6729000	Maybe a few, but none of the big names.
6729000	6732000	The show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for that arcade community at that time,
6732000	6736000	and it really stinks that we don't have that.
6736000	6738000	Well, I don't know, but round one's bringing some of that back,
6738000	6740000	some of these other experiences.
6740000	6742000	Maybe it will come back.
6742000	6743000	I shouldn't say we're never going to have it again.
6743000	6746000	I remember giving you Third Mix all the way back in the day,
6746000	6748000	and you had the Mickey Mouse pads.
6748000	6751000	It was not the Mickey Mouse pads. It was the Jungle Book PlayStation game.
6751000	6752000	That was the Jungle Book ones.
6752000	6754000	Which was a dumb fuck game.
6754000	6755000	But the pad worked.
6755000	6756000	But the pad was great.
6756000	6758000	It had a dance pad, and you could use it with DDR,
6758000	6760000	and that was the first- I never realized.
6760000	6762000	You know, I was a dirty casual at the time.
6762000	6764000	I only had a PlayStation.
6764000	6766000	I never realized you could put a little plug in the back of your PlayStation
6766000	6768000	and play Japanese games.
6768000	6769000	So somebody brought over-
6769000	6770000	I think I brought mine over.
6770000	6771000	Yeah, you brought yours over.
6771000	6773000	And my burns.
6773000	6778000	I think the crazy guy I used to live with had the burned copy of the Third Mix
6778000	6783000	and brought it over, and we played that, like, all night.
6783000	6784000	It was so much fun.
6784000	6787000	And I lived upstairs, and I think I got so many complaints.
6788000	6789000	But I didn't care.
6789000	6791000	We used to have all those Bimani parties back in the day.
6791000	6792000	Yeah, for real. It was fun.
6792000	6793000	What about you, Logan?
6793000	6795000	Yeah, what about you, Logan?
6795000	6797000	Probably just DDR.
6797000	6798000	I don't know.
6798000	6799000	Copycat.
6799000	6800000	What?
6800000	6802000	Just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
6802000	6804000	Did you expect Grand Theft Auto?
6804000	6805000	Did you expect Grand Theft Auto?
6805000	6807000	You would love as much as you did?
6807000	6809000	Of course.
6809000	6812000	I seriously need to go back and play 5.
6812000	6814000	I may do that, because now that-
6814000	6817000	One of the things I forgot to mention during my gaming week was,
6817000	6821000	you know, recently my laptop was being stupid,
6821000	6823000	and I had to reinstall Windows several times.
6823000	6826000	Well, prior to reinstalling Windows several times,
6826000	6832000	my PlayStation, the second screen, I don't remember what they call that,
6832000	6836000	where you can play the PlayStation on, like, your Vita or your PC,
6836000	6837000	wasn't working.
6837000	6839000	But now it does.
6839000	6841000	So I'm like, yes.
6841000	6843000	I don't have to watch this stupid Grey's Anatomy shit.
6843000	6848000	I can play No Man's Sky, which is better, but it's not much.
6848000	6853000	But I need to go back and play, you know, Grand Theft Auto,
6853000	6857000	because I've watched a lot of people playing the new update that they have
6857000	6860000	with all the stunt ramps and everything, and it looks seriously crazy.
6860000	6862000	Like, there's some fun racing going on there,
6862000	6864000	so I need to go back and play that.
6864000	6865000	All right. Well, I do want to mention,
6865000	6868000	just the chat room is lighting up with responses to the question
6868000	6869000	that was posed to us.
6869000	6870000	Very good email, Ziba.
6870000	6872000	Yeah, very good email and very good answers here.
6872000	6875000	SHA100Matt, this isn't a game, but I think it's a good answer still.
6875000	6878000	I showed my girlfriend the Goonies last night.
6878000	6881000	She had never seen it before, and she was an 80s kid also.
6881000	6882000	She, of course, loved it.
6882000	6884000	So talk about discovering something, right?
6884000	6885000	Mm-hmm.
6885000	6888000	RageNator reminding us, doesn't matter how old a game is,
6888000	6891000	a good game is a good game, and a bad game is a bad game, no matter what.
6891000	6895000	Some other answers in chat, AkumaJP says, Zone of the Enders, for me.
6895000	6898000	I never thought it was going to be that good.
6899000	6902000	BobbyBlackWolf saying, recently I tried Pokemon P-Cross.
6902000	6904000	I had never played a P-Cross game before.
6904000	6908000	I have now bought P-Cross E1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6908000	6913000	and I'm looking for P-Cross DS every time I go to a place that sells used DS games.
6913000	6914000	That's a great answer.
6914000	6920000	VidPower says, the arcade game Prop Cycle surprised me with how fun it is.
6920000	6923000	Oh, man, that game is legendary.
6923000	6924000	You've got to look that up.
6924000	6927000	If you don't know what Prop Cycle is, Google it or look up a picture of the machine.
6927000	6932000	It was the silliest game and you get this big fat bicycle and you're riding it.
6932000	6933000	It was amazing.
6933000	6939000	There's another game that came out in 95 that I'm probably going to make a classic game sometime,
6939000	6941000	but it was Psychic Force.
6941000	6942000	Did you ever play Psychic Force?
6942000	6943000	I don't think so.
6943000	6949000	It was sort of like an in-space 3D fighting game, like multi-plane fighting game.
6949000	6950000	It was kind of a weird one.
6950000	6953000	It was one of those Taito games, but yeah.
6953000	6955000	Just a couple more quick answers and then we'll move on.
6956000	6958000	Act Def says, Portal blew me away.
6958000	6959000	It still kind of does.
6959000	6964000	JD says, Rhythm Tengoku on Game Boy Advance surprised me with how adorable it was.
6964000	6969000	And SSG100Matt says, Undertale surprised the fuck out of me.
6969000	6970000	So there you go.
6970000	6971000	Lots of great answers.
6971000	6972000	Great question.
6972000	6973000	That's it for emails though, right?
6973000	6979000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for the future.
6979000	6983000	For now though, it's time for us to get a little bit angsty.
6985000	7007000	Um, I guess FU to not having my weekends anymore, because I do a lot of stuff on the weekends.
7007000	7009000	And FU to plantar fasciitis.
7010000	7014000	I have developed it in my left heel, so I have to go shoe shopping.
7015000	7016000	That's it.
7016000	7017000	All right.
7017000	7018000	Loki.
7018000	7024000	I guess this, um, FU2, it's just work stuff.
7024000	7027000	Just trying to get into a different department other than Wormat.
7027000	7032000	And, um, I'm rocking it, but they just aren't hiring.
7032000	7035000	So they're like, yeah, we want you.
7035000	7036000	We really do.
7037000	7041000	But, you know, so it's really hard.
7042000	7048000	Um, my FU of the week goes to my voice because I threw it out again last night because I was hosting Rocky Horror.
7048000	7050000	Although the crowd was phenomenal and it was a different setup.
7050000	7051000	It was outside.
7051000	7052000	It was really fun.
7052000	7053000	Great crowd.
7053000	7054000	I had a great time.
7054000	7059000	Um, and yeah, so just FU to the fact that I threw my voice out, even if it does make it a little bit sexy base here.
7059000	7063000	I wish I could kind of, I wish I could hang on to the voice without some of the pain.
7064000	7066000	Might work out better for radio.
7066000	7070000	Although I just, I have to face that my voice will never be like Captain Spikes from Gameboy.org.
7070000	7072000	It's just never going to be.
7072000	7073000	All right.
7073000	7075000	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
7075000	7078000	And then we'll get to our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
7078000	7079000	But first, Loki.
7079000	7080000	All right.
7080000	7087000	So it's been a few weeks since we talked about the ZeniMax lawsuit, but they've appended their complaint.
7087000	7096000	And now they are straight up basically accusing John Carmack of, you know, stealing patent stuff.
7096000	7098000	You know, basically stealing information.
7098000	7103000	Basically, they're also now naming Facebook as well with the amended charges.
7103000	7110000	And basically saying that the key source of conflict is misappropriated ZeniMax property.
7111000	7123000	Specifically, it spells out like they're saying the theft of alleged id software technology and stuff developed from John Carmack.
7123000	7133000	Basically saying, instead of complying with his contract during his last days of ZeniMax, he copied thousands of documents from a computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device.
7133000	7140000	He never returned those files or all copies of them after his employment with ZeniMax was terminated.
7140000	7155000	In addition, after Carmack's employment with ZeniMax was terminated, he returned the ZeniMax premises to take a customized tool for developing VR technology belonging to ZeniMax that itself is a part of ZeniMax VR technology.
7155000	7158000	So basically saying he stole the information.
7158000	7160000	Or, I don't know.
7160000	7162000	I guess we'll have to see it play out.
7162000	7167000	I mean, I don't know.
7167000	7171000	I see what they're trying to paint the picture that he came in and sold these documents.
7171000	7175000	But I kind of wonder if like a lot of it is just stuff that he was working on.
7175000	7178000	But then again, you know, if he's employed at that company and it's their property.
7178000	7180000	So it's hard to say.
7180000	7185000	You can't really, you know, who's his thoughts or, you know, whose property.
7185000	7188000	I mean, it's kind of confusing.
7188000	7192000	But that's thankfully for a courtroom to decide, not me.
7192000	7194000	I would probably just say, fuck you ZeniMax.
7194000	7195000	Not any of you on Twitter.
7195000	7199000	Fuck you ZeniMax, where's my fucking Fallout 4, you know.
7199000	7201000	Where's my mod support on PlayStation 4.
7201000	7207000	Oh, it's not fucking done yet? Well then you're fucking done.
7207000	7210000	That's how my courtroom works.
7210000	7213000	It'll be like that court scene we just played from Rick and Morty.
7213000	7215000	How about fuck you?
7215000	7218000	Fuck you, fuck you. Yes, fuck you.
7218000	7226000	Alright, let's talk about the Super Nintendo because it celebrated a birthday this past week.
7226000	7234000	That's right, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System arrived in North America on August 23rd, 1991.
7234000	7237000	So the Super Nintendo turned 25 this past week.
7237000	7239000	Which means, guess what everybody?
7239000	7241000	You're old.
7242000	7247000	Didn't Valve have like an anniversary or something this week?
7247000	7249000	I thought they were like 20 or 25.
7249000	7252000	Yeah, probably like the 10th anniversary of them not announcing Half-Life 3.
7252000	7254000	I think it's 20, yeah.
7254000	7260000	But in Valve time though, that's like an eternity.
7260000	7266000	Well anyhow, maybe you didn't know this, but Super Nintendo never did outsell the original NES.
7266000	7271000	Of course, some of the best games, at least if you talk to gamers of a certain age, like our age,
7271000	7274000	many would agree that the best games came out on Super Nintendo.
7274000	7280000	Games like Super Mario World, Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Super Metroid.
7280000	7283000	Can you imagine when that SNES mini comes out finally?
7283000	7285000	Right, and Chrono Trigger.
7285000	7289000	It was some of the great, great games of Super Nintendo.
7289000	7293000	Yeah, Mario Kart started on Super Nintendo, Star Fox, Donkey Kong Country.
7293000	7296000	I mean, Super Nintendo was just the system.
7296000	7298000	Will there ever be a better video game?
7298000	7305000	And just think, when they do end up coming out with an SNES mini, and for whatever reason they omit Chrono Trigger,
7305000	7309000	then that's just more fuel to go, I'm sorry, it feels like one of the best games ever.
7309000	7311000	It would have clearly been on that system.
7311000	7314000	Well, the third party thing is going to throw a monkey wrench into that.
7314000	7320000	Whereas Super Metroid was a first party game, Chrono Trigger was not.
7320000	7323000	They put Final Fantasy in there.
7323000	7324000	They did, yeah.
7324000	7326000	I mean, I would hope that that's in there.
7326000	7327000	Anything is possible.
7327000	7329000	Final Fantasy 2 and 3.
7329000	7333000	Final Fantasy 2 and 3, or 4 and 6, will probably be in there first.
7333000	7337000	Much to the angerment of Chrono Trigger fans everywhere.
7337000	7340000	I hope the mini SNES isn't a real thing, that would be awesome.
7340000	7355000	I would love to get one of the old school controllers, just like they have one coming out for the NES, and make that a USB thing.
7355000	7356000	That would be awesome.
7356000	7360000	They do have USB SNES style controllers.
7360000	7362000	SNES style or actual SNES?
7362000	7364000	They may as well be.
7364000	7365000	Are they that good?
7365000	7367000	The body is exactly the same.
7367000	7371000	I mean, the insides really aren't as great, but it feels like one in your hand.
7371000	7375000	Officially supported virtual console on PC wouldn't be bad.
7375000	7377000	Nintendo, if you want to make some bank.
7377000	7383000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mini SNES will only have Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
7383000	7386000	Hey, at least you'll get the great music.
7386000	7391000	If I'm challenged, say something nice about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
7391000	7393000	It had great music.
7393000	7395000	There you go.
7395000	7396000	I'll give you that.
7396000	7398000	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.
7398000	7399000	How about right now?
7399000	7401000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7401000	7407000	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or perhaps something else that we didn't bring up.
7407000	7411000	While we wait for a call to come in, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories.
7411000	7412000	No, I don't.
7412000	7418000	But I was checking out what the NES turned into over here, and it turned into an Eakins NES.
7418000	7422000	Which is like, it's a common Pokemon already.
7422000	7423000	It's like, eh.
7423000	7424000	It's not very good.
7424000	7431000	So, but the buzz is that Cameron Park Lake, though, is pretty nice to go up there for Pokemon.
7431000	7432000	Really?
7432000	7433000	So I may have to head up there.
7433000	7434000	Is that where the Dratini's all went?
7434000	7441000	No, that's where a lot of Magikarp and Psyducks and what else do they have?
7441000	7443000	They actually have Dratini's up there, too.
7443000	7444000	Nice.
7444000	7445000	That might be worth it.
7445000	7447000	Might be worth it, because they don't spawn in Anatolia.
7447000	7448000	Psyducks.
7448000	7451000	People from the Bay Area were going out to Anatolia to farm Dratini's.
7451000	7452000	Like, it was just nuts.
7452000	7453000	Yeah.
7453000	7455000	Eventually it'll come back, I'm sure.
7455000	7457000	Alright, well, let's get to the phones.
7457000	7458000	We have a call coming in.
7458000	7459000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.
7459000	7460000	Who's this?
7460000	7461000	Hey, it's Raginator.
7461000	7462000	Hey, Raginator.
7462000	7463000	What's on your mind, buddy?
7463000	7473000	Well, just before you opened up the phone lines, you were bringing up the 25th anniversary of the Super Nintendo being released in the US.
7474000	7482000	Now, that being said, I'm not sure if Dark Sakura had one back then.
7482000	7486000	I almost have to say she had a Genesis back then.
7486000	7487000	Let's ask.
7487000	7489000	There's one way to find out, Raginator.
7489000	7492000	Did you have a Super Nintendo Dark Sakura when it first came out?
7492000	7494000	Or were you only at Genesis' house?
7494000	7495000	Yeah.
7495000	7501000	In fact, we had to choose, and my mom asked me specifically, what gaming system do we need in the house?
7501000	7505000	And I said, I want a Super Nintendo because Link to the Past is on it.
7505000	7508000	And that's how it went, and we had a Super Scope as well.
7508000	7510000	I guess I was mistaken.
7510000	7513000	I must remember.
7513000	7518000	No, it's an easy mistake to make, because she is such a Sega fangirl, it is a very easy mistake to make.
7518000	7525000	But yeah, so she had the Super Nintendo, and how appropriate that she had the bazooka for the Super Nintendo as well.
7526000	7539000	Well, that obviously leads to my question, which I'll open up to you three, and anyone in the chat there wants to answer.
7539000	7550000	Do you remember off the top of your heads, when you got the Super Nintendo, why you got it,
7550000	7556000	in what case did you at least bear with the system?
7556000	7562000	Sure, I'll go first. I think I've told this story on the show, but it's worth telling again, and I'll abbreviate it a little bit.
7562000	7567000	I got it for Christmas, I think the year after it was out, so I don't think I had it the very first year.
7567000	7571000	No, maybe I did get it the first year. I think I did actually get it the first year, in 1991.
7571000	7575000	I'm trying to think how old it would have been. Yeah, I was in junior high, so yeah, that adds up.
7575000	7584000	So yeah, I think I got it for Christmas that year, but my parents did that really cool trick where it was not actually under the tree at all,
7584000	7591000	and so I opened all the other gifts, and there was no Super Nintendo, so you're kind of trying to do that thing where it's like,
7591000	7597000	I'm trying not to be an ungrateful little shit because I didn't get what I wanted, but I'm still kind of like,
7597000	7603000	God damn it, that's the one thing I wanted, but you're just trying to hide it and suck it up best you can.
7604000	7609000	But then of course, after everything is done, then I think my sister came out and was like,
7609000	7614000	Oh, there's one more thing, and it was this little tiny card, and the card opened up and it said,
7614000	7618000	Go look here, and then you go look in, I don't know, it was a closet or something, you go look in the closet,
7618000	7623000	and it's like, go look here. You had to go look, so it was one of those stupid scavenger hunts where you went around the whole house,
7623000	7629000	and then finally it ends up, I think it was under my mom's bed, big box, and I knew what it was,
7629000	7636000	it was Super Nintendo, and I was excited, happy tears from a dumb junior high kid, but here's the hilarious thing,
7636000	7644000	I got the Super Nintendo, and I got Super Mario World, it was packed in with it, obviously, everybody got that game,
7644000	7649000	but then my parents had no idea what other game to get, so they bought a game called Drakken,
7649000	7654000	which was, I guess, an early title on the Super Nintendo, and they didn't know what to get,
7654000	7660000	they asked the guy at, and I want to say it was Montgomery Ward, I feel like was where they said they got it,
7660000	7666000	they asked the guy, what game should we get, because they didn't know what to get, and the guy said,
7666000	7673000	well this one's selling well, or something like that, I don't know, turns out this game, it's like, nobody,
7673000	7679000	like I would tell my friends that I had this game, nobody knew what the fuck this game was, Drakken was a real,
7680000	7682000	and it's what, D-R-A-K-K-H-E-N, something like that?
7682000	7684000	Yeah, that was actually a pretty decent game.
7684000	7690000	It was a PC title, or something, I think they ported it over to Super Nintendo, and so when I first,
7690000	7695000	I didn't play it much, obviously, because I was obsessed with Mario World, and then I got, I think,
7695000	7700000	I think I picked up F-Zero pretty quickly after that, so I didn't really play a lot of Drakken,
7700000	7706000	it really wasn't until about two years later I went back and I kind of sat down and forced myself to play Drakken,
7706000	7712000	and I was like, I actually really like this game, it was weird, it was a role playing game, but it was like,
7712000	7717000	you didn't control the battles at all, like you would kind of like walk around the screen and everything would auto attack,
7717000	7724000	but it was kind of cool because it was a first person mode game, which for early Super Nintendo you didn't see a lot of that.
7724000	7732000	There was a sequel that came out after that called Dragon's View, that's really fucking good, like that game was really good,
7732000	7738000	and it has that same kind of first person, but then it's mixed with like a side scroll or action thing,
7738000	7744000	which they completely changed from the original Drakken. So anyway, there's the tangent, that was my first,
7744000	7751000	how I got my Super Nintendo and what the first game was that I had with it. Loki, your family has Super Nintendo? Yeah?
7751000	7758000	Yeah, I bought it because I sold my, I think I sold my Nintendo to get a Super Nintendo,
7758000	7766000	and so I don't remember all the early games they got with it, maybe I think Legend of Zelda was one of them,
7766000	7775000	but I do remember one of the first games I had, because they didn't have Super Mario World, was Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally.
7775000	7783000	Awesome. Which actually it's not a bad game, it's just like it's basically Roadrunner's Sonic the Hedgehog.
7783000	7788000	Isn't that like one of the few games they like can't emulate right? Yeah, I think it is.
7788000	7793000	I think I heard about like the boxes on stage six or something, they don't appear, it's like some really weird emulation,
7793000	7797000	I was reading some article about it. I did end up beating him, but yeah, it's a pretty hard game.
7797000	7804000	Because you end up going like to Mars and there's Marvin the Martian stuff. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't bad.
7805000	7811000	I, well first of all my mom got it from my brothers, but forget them, it was mine.
7811000	7818000	So we got A Link to the Past, of course we got the package of Super Mario World, and Home Alone.
7820000	7824000	Because my brothers were super into Home Alone at the time. That game was terrible.
7824000	7829000	It wasn't just terrible, it was terra-bad. It gave me virtual cancer.
7830000	7835000	Jamie. Virtual, not real. I felt ill playing it, I'll put it that way.
7835000	7841000	And then we also had the Super Scope, and I played a lot of Blastress. A lot of Blastress.
7841000	7848000	Of course you loved the bazooka. Of course I did. But I probably beat A Link to the Past like...
7848000	7852000	Oh yeah, game was so good. So quickly, and then I played through it again.
7852000	7857000	And my mom's like, now you need to let your brothers play, it's like they can play when I'm at school.
7858000	7862000	They're in school too. So, that's their problem.
7862000	7866000	Here's some answers from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7866000	7869000	JD says, my first Super Nintendo game was Donkey Kong Country.
7869000	7875000	AkumaJP said, I got my Super Nintendo late because I had to work to get it. I got it with Street Fighter 2.
7875000	7880000	SSJ100Matt says, my parents made me save up my money to get a Super Nintendo.
7880000	7884000	I had to roll pennies and do chores for my grandparents to get the money for it.
7885000	7890000	I was seven when this happened. It taught me the value of saving and importance of spending it wisely.
7890000	7895000	I like that. Let's see, and yeah, those are some comments.
7895000	7899000	Oh, Act F says, I can't remember what game I got with my Super Nintendo.
7899000	7906000	Aside Super Mario World, of course. Those are some answers from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7906000	7910000	Ooh, this is another good answer. Dungeon Buster says, one of my first games was Actraiser.
7910000	7913000	Yes, the game was so good. Stayed up all night to play it.
7913000	7916000	Thank goodness it was on a weekend, so no school the next day. Ooh, I love that game.
7916000	7919000	I remember renting that, and yes, I did stay up all night to play it.
7919000	7921000	I think we all did. The game was awesome.
7921000	7924000	I had a lot of Mega Man X fun too.
7924000	7929000	Ragenator, what about you? Did you ever officially get to buy a Super Nintendo? What was your story behind it?
7929000	7934000	Yeah, in fact, a slight tangent that relates to the story.
7934000	7944000	Back in the early 90s, my one brother and I used to have paper routes together, and that's how we made a little extra money for ourselves.
7944000	7955000	And we used to do those on the weekend, and pretty much every single cent that we made went into our respective bank accounts.
7956000	7963000	All that being said, I didn't get the Super Nintendo right away back in 91.
7963000	7968000	However, I kept seeing the commercials for it.
7968000	7979000	I saw it mentioned on GameProTV, and even the neighbors across the street in the game line, and I saw it being played and all that.
7979000	7983000	I thought, this is the most awesome system I've ever seen in my life.
7983000	7994000	And considering that I had all this money in the bank saved up, I begged my parents to let me spend my own money to go buy a Super Nintendo.
7995000	8009000	And as a second sight, they were a little hypocritical spending money left and right that they didn't have, but they wouldn't let me spend my own money on something that I could afford.
8009000	8017000	But eventually I did make them break down and let me buy a Super Nintendo on my own.
8017000	8028000	My father took me over to this little store that's local to my area at the time called Best Buy, not Best Buy, Brand Aims.
8028000	8034000	And I bought the Super Nintendo itself, which came with Super Mario World.
8034000	8048000	And just for shits and giggles, my father bought two games that I recommended that I researched the crap out of, which was Super Castlevania IV and Actraiser.
8049000	8056000	Because I thought that... Castlevania was a good series. I played the original on the Nintendo.
8056000	8067000	I saw the gameplay on GameProTV. It looked good, especially the one on stage with the rotating tunnel.
8067000	8075000	And plus, the soundtrack seemed amazing, and it was. It really showed off the sound chip on the system.
8075000	8084000	Same with Actraiser. Great soundtrack. And for a while, those three games lasted us a while. We played the crap out of them.
8084000	8095000	Eventually I ended up getting all the games like SimCity, SimEarth, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo.
8095000	8100000	You know, it's interesting because SimCity was really good on Super Nintendo because they added kind of the Nintendo-y elements to it.
8100000	8105000	They added like the... Bowser replaced Godzilla, and you get like a Mario statue and all the silly stuff.
8105000	8109000	But SimEarth was really bad compared to the PC version.
8109000	8118000	Yeah, honestly, the only game that I bought over the years that I regretted buying was the original Mortal Kombat.
8118000	8124000	Because back then I was really into fighting games, and I thought, oh, Mortal Kombat, I know that was a great arcade game.
8124000	8133000	I wanted it for home. Bought the game. Oh my God, I regretted that purchase virtually instantly.
8133000	8137000	I still loved it, but the whole sweat thing was really cheesy.
8137000	8147000	Yeah, but eventually, obviously, Nintendo learned their mistake from that game.
8147000	8151000	They put the violence and the blood back into Mortal Kombat 2 and whatnot.
8151000	8155000	And the later games were definitely better.
8155000	8163000	But, you know, a great system. One of my favorite, you know, two favorite games for the system was from React Tracer Castlevania IV.
8163000	8171000	It would be Killer Instinct with the Pakken soundtrack, which was the first soundtrack I ever got.
8171000	8175000	And that got me started on collecting soundtracks.
8176000	8181000	Super Ghost of Ghosts. Great game.
8181000	8186000	Wow, lots of good picks. Lots of good reminiscent down memory lane for Super Nintendo.
8186000	8191000	Rage Nator, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for the trip down memory lane tonight.
8191000	8193000	Sure, have a nice night.
8193000	8194000	Yep, take care of you too.
8194000	8198000	A lot of positive feedback to Castlevania IV in our chat room.
8198000	8201000	By the way, OrangeLoungeRadio, all in a word on Skype if you want to call in.
8201000	8205000	I see a lot of positive feedback for the Castlevania IV. DungeonBuster says,
8205000	8209000	Yay, I love the track that plays during the swinging chandelier stage.
8209000	8211000	Oh yeah, that stage was so awesome too.
8211000	8218000	Let's see, VidPower says, Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat had sweat and neutered fatalities. So sad.
8218000	8221000	It was so interesting what they could have and what they couldn't have.
8221000	8225000	Because if I remember right, like, Sonya still had the kiss thing that would incinerate.
8225000	8229000	Like, that was okay. You could set somebody on fire and that was okay.
8229000	8233000	But what was it? Like, Johnny Cage would just uppercut them. That's it.
8233000	8237000	Because the head can't pop off like it did in the arcade game.
8237000	8240000	And then what? They really changed sub-zeroes, right?
8240000	8244000	Sub-zero would do the deep freeze and then shatter them into a million pieces.
8244000	8245000	But again, no blood, so it was okay.
8245000	8249000	But then didn't they, in one of the later Mortal Kombat games,
8249000	8252000	didn't they actually give him that fatality again as a throwback?
8252000	8254000	But it was, like, way gorier.
8254000	8255000	I think so.
8255000	8259000	I think they did in one of the later ones. Either it was the Mortal Kombat 9 or one of the other ones.
8259000	8261000	They kind of redid it.
8261000	8267000	Alright, one last call here for calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8267000	8271000	You could also use the phone lines to do an old-school 1877 game, O-L-R, if you want to do it that way.
8271000	8275000	One other thing I was thinking of that wasn't in our show world tonight,
8275000	8277000	but it occurred to me was a big news thing.
8277000	8282000	I guess maybe because I've been playing World of Warcraft or Battle.net related games.
8282000	8286000	I don't know if you guys know, but Battle.net added into the launcher this week.
8286000	8289000	And I knew it was coming, because I think we talked about that the feature was coming on the show.
8289000	8293000	But now you can stream to Facebook natively within the Battle.net app.
8293000	8302000	So Facebook is starting to make their play for a piece of that Twitch TV, YouTube gaming, and that whole thing.
8302000	8310000	But I've got to admit, part of why I like Twitch and why I like YouTube gaming and stuff
8310000	8312000	is more the discoverability there.
8312000	8316000	But if I stream on Facebook, it's only going to be limited to my friends.
8316000	8321000	There's not going to be as much discoverability there to meet new people and stuff.
8321000	8327000	Which, I mean, I guess it could be cool that I could stream games just for friends.
8327000	8330000	Like, you know, come see how bad I am at Overwatch.
8330000	8334000	Or watch, you know, I'm going to play some of my friends on Facebook at Overwatch,
8334000	8336000	and here's what it looks like from my perspective, that whole thing.
8336000	8340000	But I don't know, I'm not really interested in Facebook as a streaming platform.
8340000	8346000	Plus, one reason why I think Twitch does so well with the streaming and everything is because
8346000	8352000	it's on mobile, it's on PlayStation, it's on Xbox, it's everywhere.
8352000	8354000	You know, there's a Twitch app almost everywhere.
8354000	8358000	I guess, granted, though, Facebook, you know, they do have the mobile app,
8358000	8361000	and you can watch things within that, so there is that.
8361000	8364000	But I just don't know if I see that being as big of a thing.
8364000	8368000	But it is built into the Battle.net thing, which is, you know,
8368000	8372000	Blizzard's a pretty big company, and those are some heavy-hitting PC games.
8372000	8375000	I mean, that means now you can stream directly what?
8375000	8382000	Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Overwatch, all right there.
8382000	8386000	Very, very, very easily. So, interesting.
8386000	8389000	Alright, well, oh, and DarkTetsuya in chat says,
8389000	8392000	oh, no wonder, a friend of mine was streaming Overwatch to her Facebook,
8392000	8395000	so I guess that's what that was about, yeah.
8395000	8398000	And BobbyBlackWolf says, can I stream Rock and Roll Racing?
8398000	8401000	I don't think that's in the Battle.net launcher, sadly.
8401000	8408000	At one point, they released, was it that or was it their other game from that era?
8408000	8412000	Maybe it was, but it's not actually within the Battle.net launcher.
8412000	8414000	It's just like a separate executable file you just play.
8414000	8417000	So, I think it does have to be built into the launcher.
8417000	8420000	I don't think you could actually stream old Warcraft.
8420000	8423000	Or is, I don't know, is old Warcraft in the Battle.net launcher?
8423000	8426000	Warcraft 3 might be, but I don't think Warcraft 1 and 2 are.
8426000	8429000	Unless you still have CDs.
8429000	8433000	Well, yeah, but then, but the CDs are still gonna be independent of the launcher,
8433000	8436000	which has the broadcast software built in it.
8436000	8438000	Oh, I was thinking of like Twitch.
8438000	8440000	I just thought maybe they were too old, like, you know,
8440000	8443000	some of those older games don't play well, even though they're on newer systems.
8443000	8445000	Sure, sure.
8445000	8448000	All right, well, let's see, and Kaijuto says,
8448000	8450000	you can pretty much produce a show on just Twitch alone.
8450000	8451000	Yeah, that's true.
8451000	8454000	I mean, if we were to set up this show on Twitch,
8454000	8456000	we probably would get exposed to new people,
8456000	8458000	and that's something we may still think about doing in the future,
8458000	8463000	but right now, you know, we're still orange on radio for the time being.
8463000	8465000	But yeah, you know, whole nother platform there.
8465000	8468000	All right, well, nobody else is calling in,
8468000	8472000	so I guess too many people watching those silly video music awards on MTV.
8472000	8475000	Oh my God, did you see what Beyoncé did?
8475000	8478000	No, I've been doing this fucking show, Jamie.
8478000	8480000	Yeah, but you were looking at your phone.
8480000	8481000	How did you see it?
8481000	8483000	Because I'm on Facebook right now.
8483000	8484000	Oh, what did she do?
8484000	8487000	She brought out the, uh, Traven Martin's mother
8487000	8491000	and the other two boys' mother on the red carpet with her,
8491000	8494000	and her daughter who has the tutu I always wanted as a kid.
8494000	8495000	Ah.
8495000	8497000	So, bravo to her.
8497000	8499000	Yeah, but did she do anything in her, did she perform?
8499000	8501000	Yeah, she did Lemonade.
8501000	8503000	Oh, okay. Okay.
8503000	8507000	And then, um, all the queens, except for Adore,
8507000	8511000	were all wearing other famous celebrity outfits.
8511000	8513000	Yeah, I saw that from Drag Race, right?
8513000	8514000	Like, Fifi did the meat dress.
8514000	8517000	Um, Adore just posted, she was, like, in Manchester Pride District.
8517000	8518000	She's overseas right now.
8518000	8519000	Yeah.
8519000	8521000	So, I guess it didn't work out.
8521000	8522000	Anyway, interesting.
8522000	8524000	Uh, Sia Tabarian Chat says,
8524000	8527000	When will we get the MTV Video Game Music Awards?
8527000	8529000	And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with Act Deaf,
8529000	8533000	hopefully never, because that's just not something I want MTV producing.
8533000	8535000	You know, the one that Jeff Keighley did,
8535000	8537000	which I don't even remember the name of it now,
8537000	8540000	but it's in December.
8540000	8541000	It's just the Video Game Awards?
8541000	8542000	Yeah, the Video Game Awards.
8542000	8543000	Okay.
8543000	8547000	Like, the first year, the fact that it acknowledged Roberta Williams
8547000	8549000	gave it big props in my book,
8549000	8551000	and then, you know, it's getting to be,
8551000	8554000	remember the whole, like, throwing shade at Konami Live
8554000	8555000	during the thing?
8555000	8556000	That was pretty cool.
8556000	8557000	Where he just, like, read the house down,
8557000	8558000	why Hideo Kojima couldn't be there?
8558000	8559000	So, like, I'm like,
8559000	8561000	okay, this thing shows a lot of promise,
8561000	8563000	and I think it's going to age very well,
8563000	8566000	so I'm willing to let that, you know,
8566000	8568000	see what that looks like year three.
8568000	8570000	I think a lot of us were very worried,
8570000	8572000	because he was also involved with the Spike TV thing,
8572000	8576000	which is kind of what an MTV Video Game Music Awards,
8576000	8578000	whatever the fuck, would have looked like.
8578000	8580000	But this new one he's doing is pretty good,
8580000	8584000	so we'll see what happens year three.
8584000	8585000	We will.
8585000	8586000	All right.
8586000	8588000	Well, that is going to do it
8588000	8590000	for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8590000	8594000	We will be back to do this all again in two weeks.
8594000	8597000	Loki's birthday show on September 11th.
8597000	8598000	How old are you this year?
8598000	8599000	36.
8599000	8600000	36.
8600000	8601000	You're old, so am I.
8601000	8602000	I can't wait until you're 37.
8602000	8603000	In a row.
8603000	8604000	In a row.
8604000	8605000	All right.
8605000	8607000	Well, anyway, we'll be back.
8607000	8610000	Dark Sakura, we're going to be shaking things up a little bit.
8610000	8611000	Dark Sakura will be here.
8611000	8612000	She just won't be here live.
8612000	8613000	I'll be here dead.
8613000	8614000	She'll be here.
8614000	8615000	I'll hunt.
8615000	8616000	Dark Sakura is going to still grace us
8616000	8617000	with the Classic Game of the Week
8617000	8620000	and ensure that Loki doesn't put Halo there in her absence.
8620000	8622000	I won't put Halo there.
8622000	8624000	Well, I still won't be there if I don't approve it.
8624000	8625000	But it doesn't matter.
8625000	8627000	You can say it, but it doesn't mean it'll happen.
8627000	8628000	It doesn't matter because Dark Sakura's
8628000	8630000	going to still do that segment for us,
8630000	8633000	so we'll have just a few little cosmetic changes on the show.
8633000	8634000	Fine.
8634000	8635000	I'll start my own Classic Game of the Week
8635000	8638000	with hookers and blackjack.
8638000	8639000	Was that a game, hookers and blackjack?
8639000	8641000	No, it's from Futurama.
8641000	8642000	It should be.
8642000	8643000	No.
8643000	8644000	Well, that should be a game.
8644000	8647000	So, as we say here every week at Orange Lounge Radio,
8647000	8649000	if you enjoyed what you heard on the show,
8649000	8651000	please tell a friend or five about the show.
8651000	8652000	Help us spread the word.
8652000	8655000	A nice five-star review wherever you found this show,
8655000	8658000	like iTunes or Google Music or wherever,
8658000	8661000	that goes an awful long way, so please consider that.
8661000	8662000	I'd really appreciate it,
8662000	8664000	as would we all here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8664000	8666000	I hope to see many of you at Dragon Con this next week
8666000	8668000	or at some of the other conventions coming up
8668000	8670000	in the next few months.
8670000	8672000	But until then, let's go around and get everybody's
8672000	8674000	final thought for the night.
8674000	8677000	Dark Sakura, we'll see you in a few months.
8677000	8678000	Probably not that long.
8678000	8679000	You might have some time off or something
8679000	8681000	where you can still play with us at some point,
8681000	8687000	but do you have a final thought for us tonight?
8687000	8688000	Same.
8688000	8690000	All right, and my final thought tonight is
8690000	8694000	you need to take those pineapple cake things with you
8694000	8695000	because I don't want any more.
8695000	8696000	You need to take the rest of those cookies
8696000	8697000	that you brought here with you,
8697000	8698000	get them out of my house
8698000	8700000	because I'm going on an emergency diet.
8700000	8701000	No, I'm leaving them.
8701000	8704000	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought.
8704000	8707000	I don't know.
8707000	8710000	I guess I'll play more No Man's Sky.
8710000	8711000	Might as well.
8711000	8712000	Might as well.
8712000	8713000	Got nothing else to do.
8713000	8715000	Got to get to that center of the universe
8715000	8718000	so that I can have no ending.
8718000	8722000	I'm hearing people are not happy about that.
8722000	8724000	I'm trying to keep myself free of the spoilers and all that,
8724000	8726000	but I'm hearing people are like,
8726000	8729000	it's the new Mass Effect 3.
8729000	8730000	We'll see, though.
8730000	8731000	I thought I already spoiled it.
8731000	8732000	I'm sorry.
8732000	8734000	If you did, I wasn't listening,
8734000	8735000	and that's probably for the best.
8735000	8738000	All right, times when it was a good idea
8738000	8739000	to not listen to Loki.
8739000	8740000	All right, that's it.
8740000	8741000	We're out of here.
8741000	8743000	We'll see you in two weeks.
8743000	8746000	Have a wonderful Labor Day and be safe.
8746000	8747000	Goodbye, everybody.
