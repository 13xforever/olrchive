00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Join me here live in studio is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello and welcome.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hi.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We had a little bit of a scare there because we thought this might be your last week before the break, but it's actually going to be next week.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm just not looking forward to that last week right before that. You know why?

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because I'm going to be working six days in a row.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Eww.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ewwww.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What did you do to deserve that punishment?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I had surgery, therefore I missed my shift bid.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, no, no. I meant, what did you do to deserve six days in a row? That's awful.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I had surgery and missed my shift bid.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I see. All right. Well, you know, again, you will be missed during the break, but we did figure out a way. We are going to have you continue to do the Classic Game of the Week through the magic of recording segments in advance.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So there will be that.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We'll call it time travel. It'll be, it'll, it'll call TARDIS posting.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes. It'll be a classically recorded segment.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, but we'll bust out like the old little recorder and the mic.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes. Oh, yeah. The old timey thing. We'll get, we'll get some razor blades and edit the tape, like actual physical edit, like I learned to do in college.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
When I was studying radio and here I am having done a podcast for the last 15 years, never had to touch a razor blade except for my face.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know what?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We've had to, I've had to do actual photo editing in the old school way.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, yeah?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Where you cut out with an exacto knife.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, like actual cropping.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You don't take, that little tool in Photoshop is an actual picture of a cropper.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It is. Or even on top of that where you use like transparent ink to reshade so that the shading looks natural.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All that stuff I learned how to do. And you know how often I've had to do it? Once. And that was on purpose since I graduated.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Understandable. All right. Well, let's also say hello to.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And Raginator, no, that's not going to happen. Halo will never be a classic game of the week because I will never approve it.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And Dark Soccer responding to a live chat comment at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where if you are listening live, you can come make a comment and get yelled at by Dark Soccer as well.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But sometimes she'll also say nice things to you. Okay. Also, say hello, of course, to Tech Master Loki.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How are you?

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm all right.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have a headache for yelling at slow drivers on the way home.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sorry, there's so much anger tonight. My gosh.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They were driving super slow. It's like you're merging onto a freeway and you're driving 15 miles an hour.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I understand. I drove to, as we'll talk about in a minute here, I drove to San Francisco yesterday and it took me three hours to get there because it's just like not only did Waze say hello,

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
but it definitely did Waze send me on the most backwards way to get there because I'm sure the roads were a mess.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That app usually tends to know what it's doing.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But just slow drivers that cut people off left and right causing backup for everybody.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's horrible.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Were they doing construction on the bridge? Because they're always doing construction on the bridge.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Actually, I don't think they were. I think this is one of those.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, my God. That's like the one time.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah. No, I don't think I saw any construction on the bridge for a change.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So it's just it was backed up because traffic always backs up.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It stinks.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right. Have you ever edited tape using a razor blade?

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Actual audio tape.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've cut a tape apart to pull it out of a tape player.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then and then possibly drag it behind a car.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That doesn't necessarily that's not it's editing the tape to be something different than it was.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You know, like, is it the whole like pencil and the tape to unwind it?

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's the trick we see today.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We'll never know this.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, no, it wasn't that.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was like we had all these video cassette tapes that we weren't going to be using.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So what's better to do with them than to just throw them away, but to destroy them and then throw them away.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And, you know, those tape, they're very long.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's fun to drag the whole thing out.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We wouldn't TP trees. We would tape trees.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Did you just moan into the microphone over there?

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I did. I had a Cinnabon delight. It was in my mouth.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Exploded in your mouth.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was beautiful with a creamy center. It was quite obscene.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's see, going to live.vognetwork.com.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SS2100 Matt says also Rob is number two on my friend's leaderboard on Waze.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm number one on my own leaderboard. Who's beating me?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Is that like being the top of the leaderboard at Google Maps or something?

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, it's not it's not it's not a very serious game.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's just something I pretty much always use it when I'm driving long distance.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I use it on my commute to work a lot, too.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So anyway, let's see.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Also looking for more chat in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Some folks talking about Halo.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Kaijuto says I agree. Halo should never be a classic because of its fans.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I do like Halo 2, 3 and Reach, though.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So all right. Well, it is what it is.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I think there's thousands of more games out there that deserve a little attention.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And maybe Halo on the last episode. Who knows?

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In regards to our discussion about Sugimansato Rena.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
2019 will be when it qualifies.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, for a classic game of the week? Yes, because a classic game has to be 10 years old.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It came out in 2009.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So since you brought it up, I'll mention this real fast before we get into the kickoff topic.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So we were looking on Twitter.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Actually, no, one of my friends randomly retweeted this on Twitter and was like, WTF is this?

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And it was a Steam game that was called Cat President.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And so when I saw this, you know I did a double take because, you know, again, this is a long time ago.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was probably, what, 2008, 2009.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There was a Wii game out there called Sukiban Senchou Rena Wii.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sukiban Shacho Rena.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I always mess up the pronunciation.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But the translation was roughly President Cat.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And it led to this whole discussion about why don't we get these more off-the-wall types of games.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is a cat being president? This sounds hilarious.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We talked this whole thing up.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And then we ended up getting some of our listeners to tweet at the developers who actually noticed us.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And that caused some of the game blogs at the time out there.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Senpai noticed us.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, Senpai noticed us essentially.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And some of the game blogs were running with this story.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Fans are clamoring and petitioning for President Cat to come to the US and all this.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Which I think is funny because Jamie essentially named that game.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because she was like, it's not exactly that, but roughly that.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But I would say it's a great name.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sukiban is like a delinquent girl leader.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And then a shacho is more like a company president.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So it was like delinquent company president Rena.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah. And you were like, I think you said boss cat first.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Like boss cat, yeah.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's not good.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like a gang leader boss cat.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So anyway, so the game blogs ran with this.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And of course the game never came west.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What was interesting about it is that then there were follow up articles out there that said,

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, now it's the worst selling Wii game of all time.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And it only sold 100 copies.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And to this day, I want to see the receipts.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Like nobody's really been able to produce receipts that that game only sold that many copies.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Which would shock me, especially considering Wii imported several of those copies because of this show.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So I have like maybe it only sold 100 at this store or at this demo or whatever it was.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But you know, and then on top of that, I mean the minimum print quantity, because you have to manufacture those.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The minimum quantity that they do is several thousands.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can get 130 bucks on Amazon now.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, they copy the game.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I'm sure it's I can play it, but it should be a cult hit at this point.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, um, I actually there was a book.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think it was based on the comic or something manga or something like that was was where it all tied together from.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But anyway, so OK, so that's that was the background.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So there was a huge campaign for President Cat.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And what's really funny, like years later, one of those websites like Destructoid or something,

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ran a 10 games that also need to be localized for the Wii.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And this was right around the height of Operation Rainfall when it was like, you know, we need to get the last guardian.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We need to get Pandora's Tower and Xenoblade and all this stuff.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then Destructoid actually ran a story that was like, here's 10 more games that need to be localized.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And President Cat was on it.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And that made me laugh like all the years later.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So obviously, when we saw Cat President.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Here's the article about us. I'll link it in the chatroom.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, you found it? Yeah.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Not that one, but it was like grassroots effort to bring bizarre game to the US.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's funny. You can Google it and all these.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's funny that of all the things we've done in the 15 year history of the show,

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that and the beautiful Katamari issues, I'll leave it at that, were the things that got us on the gaming blogs.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So it's just funny.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But anyway, so anyway, so we see this game called Cat President.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Of course, I do a double take. I'm like, oh, my God, someone made it. Someone did it.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And then my second thought was, are we getting a cut?

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Although, to be fair, we had nothing to do with the original Wii game.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I didn't really think that. But, you know, I laughed it in my head.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was like, did somebody actually make an OLR dream game come true?

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, it turns out I actually did a little research on this game in Steam, this Cat President.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was something that was greenlit recently.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And it's a visual novel game.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So it's nothing like I think you actually said it looks more like Hatoful Boyfriend in the art style than anything else.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It does just with the background being actual photographs.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But, I mean, it makes me think a lot more of Hatoful Boyfriend.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And, you know, it is logical that a lot of people are talking about an election right now for some strange reason,

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
which was the case eight years ago when this President Cat thing first happened.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So, I mean, it is natural that somebody had the same idea because cats are awesome.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So anyway, I am going to reach out. We found who made the game and found them on Twitter.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I am going to reach out and try to get them on the show in a future week because I do want to ask.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want to say, did you know about President Cat?

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Did you know that's the thing? Because I want my money.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm just kidding. I would not say that.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I'm very curious to hear where the inspiration for that came from and so forth.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So we'll figure that all out.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So anyway, since you brought that up, I had to mention that because I think I tweeted about it on the OLR account.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I put like, what's this?

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I put the emote icon that goes, what's this?

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
With the little screenshot I saw on Twitter.

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So that's where that all came from.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So there really is a cat president game on its way to Steam.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So we'll get more on that later.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So I want to talk a little bit about an adventure that I went on this weekend.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And maybe I should introduce somebody else who's sitting here in studio.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Who is always sitting here in studio, it seems like, during the show.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Shane is back with us this week.

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I just haven't left.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, I know you've literally been here since Saturday.

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I just don't like my new place I live.

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So I don't really like going back there as much as possible.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You just hang out here now.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was actually saying earlier, he's kind of turned into Kramer from Seinfeld.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But like, you know.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
My hair isn't stupid.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So that's really rude.

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I brought you Cinnabons, so I'm going to go spit on yours now.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, no, no, just let me eat them.

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay, I'm going to let Jamie eat them.

208
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Because they're amazing.

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I love how he says, I'm not rude, and I'm going to go spit on your Cinnabons all in the same breath.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I didn't say rude, I said I didn't have dumb hair.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Alright, anyway, look.

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's see.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh good, Shane's on the show.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want his take on the Color Splash Power Rangers.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's the thing.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is that the Mario?

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think there's like a reference in the new Mario.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, yeah.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I saw like that video, and I already forgot it.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So that's how memorable it was.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Here's the weird...

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And like Final Fantasy XIV is doing an event all about...

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, shucks.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Did I miss it?

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I might have missed my first Final Fantasy XIV holiday.

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's doing an event all about like Power Rangers or Super Sentai, and Shane cannot be bothered.

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I really don't care about it.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not like actual Super Sentai stuff, and the outfits you get aren't cool enough.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So that's fine.

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't need it.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, anyway, you're here to talk about an adventure that we went on.

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, and if we're going to talk about Nintendo Sentai stuff, it's all about the Axiom Rangers

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
from Super Mario RPG.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Alright, look.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's talk about this adventure that we went on yesterday.

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So, Shane, you decided...

238
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, first, the story was we're going to go to round one today because my friend Tyler's

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
never been, and I was like, oh, round one adventure.

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That sounds like fun.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So, yeah.

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I said I'll drive.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I've got the new car.

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's go to San Jose.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Let's go to round one, which did end up being part of the plan.

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But then the day before, you heard, oh, people are getting to go to Pokémon Worlds after

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
all.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, so...

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What happened?

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can tell this story.

251
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't need to tell it for me.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay, fine.

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Please.

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So when I was at Power Morphicon, we met this like gay couple that's married, and we hung

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
out with them, and they were coming up to San Francisco after Power Morphicon in Pasadena.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I randomly get a text while I'm at work from one of the guys saying, hey, the Pokémon

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Center is open to the public.

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Look at what we just got for myself and my nephew.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was like all these plush toys.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I was like, really?

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He's like, yeah.

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's going to be open throughout the weekend, so you should go if you want.

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm like, okay, bye.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So we went to the Pokémon Center.

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I want to go.

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, we did.

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We went to...

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why didn't anyone tell me?

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, A, it was literally last minute.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, it was super last minute.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I didn't think we were actually going to go.

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So we went and picked up.

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I got some plushies and a coffee mug.

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, you got a Pikachu butt coffee mug.

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I love that coffee mug.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I got a shirt and a hat and Pikachu.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But we were not able to go to the actual event.

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, and I actually really, really would have loved to do that part.

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But you've been watching it all.

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, yeah.

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I watched it all.

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So tell us a little bit about the event, because I was able to listen to it while I was riding

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
in the car, but I wasn't really able to watch it.

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, what do you want to know about it?

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How was it?

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What do you get out of it?

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What do I get out of it?

288
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's just like watching a competition on TV.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It could be baseball or another sport or whatever.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's just a sport to me, and I love watching the competition.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A card game is kind of boring sometimes, but the actual video game is really fun to watch.

292
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So I watched a lot of the...

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I saw some Swiss on Friday, which is where they just kind of randomly fight each other.

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They get paired up.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And then I saw some of the top eight yesterday, and I saw the top four yesterday before it

296
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
cut out, and then watched the...

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And that was all for Masters.

298
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I only watched the Masters.

299
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And then today I watched the Finals for Juniors, Seniors, and Masters.

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And USA took everything for those, so that's nice.

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But we got shut out in the card game, but who cares?

302
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Which I still don't understand how the card game works.

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And the card game's where all the money's at too, because first place as a Master gets

304
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you $25,000.

305
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You gotta buy all those cards.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's where the money goes.

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I guess.

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
To beef up those debts.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Not that expensive to get.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't spend no $25,000 on them.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, so we went...

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, that was a big chunk of the morning just to go there and shop for things that

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
pretty much you could buy online.

314
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Nope.

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Nope.

316
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's not true.

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Some people, yes, like something you got, yeah, and what Tyler got.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But if you were smart like me, you only got the stuff that's branded Worlds, because that

319
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
will not go online.

320
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, and also, if I don't get it now, I'm not going to think to go online later and

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
get it.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's true.

323
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sometimes it just boils down to that.

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I don't even like Pikachu, but I love the San Francisco Pikachu, because he's holding

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
a little trolley car, and he's adorable.

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And if I could get San Francisco Pikachu in the game, I'd probably play with Pikachu sometimes.

327
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So they announced that the next one's in Anaheim.

328
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, today they announced it's in Anaheim, which is kind of surprising.

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I thought they would have moved off of the continent and gone like Europe or something.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Or the other coast, at least.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Even though they were just in Boston, you'd think they'd at least go, but that's kind

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
of surprising.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They're not going that far away.

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But that's awesome, because that's another road trip potential.

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If they let people in, but I made a decision that I'm going to try to play competitively

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
this year, so I don't have to worry about not being allowed to go.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Even if I lose first day, I'll still get to watch everything.

338
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So you are, this is a big declaration you're making.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You are going to try to compete in Pokemon at the competitive level.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, starting with Generation 7.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
How are you going to prepare for that?

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, Generation 7's almost going to be a reset, because it's like everything changes.

343
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's why I'm not really caring about it right now.

344
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm just sticking with my shiny hunting.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay, I got you.

346
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So what are you going to do to prepare?

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like, how are you going to play Pokemon even more than I already do?

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I really don't know how it's going to work, but I'll start following.

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like, I've already started to follow some of the best on Twitter, and I know there's

350
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
like YouTubes I can watch to kind of learn more about the competitive side, and so I'm

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
just going to kind of immerse myself in that.

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Because, man, winning $25,000, it's what?

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's not 25 for the video game.

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I forget how much it's like $15,000, I think.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Something like that.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But if you could win that, that's pretty awesome.

357
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
SSG100Matt says, Shane is going to have a Rocky IV training montage in the snowy mountains.

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Are you going to get people to train you?

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You were talking today about getting that 10-year-old kid that won the juniors to train

361
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you.

362
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, there's some 10-year-old that could have totally killed me at this.

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm like, he should be my trainer.

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because he said he wanted to give back to the community, so hey, I'm a case.

365
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I may be ordering a Team Rocket tank top right now.

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What a perfect fit.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's awesome.

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I love it.

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Let's see.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Going to chat at live.vognetwork.com.

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Actf says, I missed the Pokken tournament stuff at Worlds.

372
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I think everybody did.

373
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They did that in the beginning real fast.

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, the finals were yesterday.

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Everything else was today because they didn't care enough, I don't think.

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's just not big enough yet.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I have to say, though, for something as massive as Pokemon Worlds is supposed to be,

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I was a little surprised at how small that venue was.

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because you remember, we got to go in the hotel where they were having it.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We just couldn't go in the actual hall where the competition was going on.

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But it seemed like they were really only doing it in one hall there.

382
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then the Pokemon Center was another little space that was kind of off to the side.

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Can't they just get in?

384
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It was interesting because this place where it was at was literally across the street from Moscone Center,

385
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
where they did TwitchCon.

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And the PlayStation event.

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And the PlayStation event a couple years ago.

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, last year.

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, was it last year, too?

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I thought they moved it one year to Vegas.

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Vegas was the first one.

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Vegas was the first one. Last year was Moscone.

393
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay, okay. I got it all mixed up. But whatever. So they did Moscone.

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So it just kind of surprised me that the Pokemon Worlds thing just didn't do Moscone,

395
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and then they could have fit more people in there.

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, but I really think it was a precaution.

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I mean, they would have let people in, I bet, more spectators.

398
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because they eventually did start letting spectators in through various ways to get badges.

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But I think they would have done it had Go not come out.

400
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think Go really is what killed it.

401
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Exactly. Go brought out all the fucking retards.

402
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And I'm sorry. No, seriously.

403
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's not a nice thing to say.

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's exactly the thing to say. You know why?

405
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because when people were playing Ingress, there weren't fucking signs that said,

406
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sorry, Pokemon Go players. Maybe don't throw your trash on the ground.

407
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't try to access classified fucking secure locations.

408
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because you don't have to tell people that have common sense that.

409
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They're like, hmm, maybe I shouldn't go there.

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Whereas Pokemon Go players are like,

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm gonna walk through the door because you're the Pikachu over there.

412
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm sorry. No, it's just.

413
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If you have to tell people that, you know.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Like, why do I have 50,000 stupid pop-ups on fucking Go?

415
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Please don't trespass. Please don't play in your car.

416
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, yeah, fuck that. I'm gonna play in my car all the fucking time I want.

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Because I've been doing Ingress and it's been just fine.

418
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You know, hey, be respectful of this and that.

419
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I mean, come on.

420
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Nobody gives a shit.

421
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And that's why. Because those people would be like,

422
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
oh, I'm gonna go in here. I'm gonna catch a Pokemon.

423
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Darktitsuyu in chat says, wow, Loki, I just can't even right now.

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, same. But to a point, I agree to a point.

425
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Because we talked about this on Pokestop podcast this week, cheap plug.

426
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Was that, you know, the sales of the 3DS have been impacted by Pokemon Go.

427
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And it is causing a lot more people to become interested in Pokemon

428
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
that weren't before. Hell, I'm kind of even one of them.

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like, I think for a long time, Shane was like, Rob, play Pokemon.

430
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, Rob, play Pokemon. No.

431
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Or I would, but I'd kind of quit by the first gym.

432
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But then when Go came out, it was like, oh, I'm kind of feeling energized about Pokemon again.

433
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And I've been playing the handheld games more than I have in an extremely long time.

434
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So, and now I do this podcast about it, too.

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So it's like, you know, and there's a lot of people, I think, in my shoes.

436
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
A lot of the guests we've had on the Pokestop podcast have said the same thing.

437
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
They've said that, you know, well, I was playing in like Gen 1, 2, and then I kind of fell out of it.

438
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But Pokemon Go has brought me back.

439
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So actually, you know, even though Loki uses very extreme descriptions in what he's saying,

440
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
but I think the point about Pokemon Go is causing this huge in-surge of interest in Pokemon that wasn't there before.

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I think that is true.

442
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I think, and I think that there's a lot of assumptions that, oh, they were going to spawn a legendary of Pokemon worlds.

443
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And I think they kind of had to go out of their way to say, that ain't happening, stay home.

444
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Another thing.

445
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Would they listen like they would listen to all the pop-ups in the app? No, they're not.

446
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Another thing that I think also kind of ruined it for spectators this year is the addition of Pokken Tournament.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Because from what I understand, it was really easy to qualify to get into worlds.

448
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So people that wanted a guaranteed like, you know, badge at worlds so they could get the cool free stuff, that may have overflowed it as well.

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But the joke was on them because their badges were only good for a day unless they qualified for the second day.

450
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Interesting.

451
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But they still got all the cool free stuff.

452
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I just think they should just pick a bigger venue next time.

453
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I mean, now they know Pokemon is a bigger deal.

454
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Pokemon Go is probably going to bring more people in.

455
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And it'll be interesting to see if that's represented at worlds next year.

456
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'd be very, I mean.

457
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't think it will be.

458
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There's not really competition in Pokemon Go.

459
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But they could do a live event in Anaheim if Niantic is ready to start hosting those for Pokemon.

460
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Because they're still doing them for Ingress.

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What? Denver and Portland, Maine have big events next Saturday for Ingress.

462
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So Niantic will start doing it for Pokemon Go eventually.

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's just a matter of what and when.

464
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So we'll see.

465
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's see.

466
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

467
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Dungeon Buster says, kind of sad when places like the National Holocaust Museum have to ask people not to look for Pokemon there.

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And again, I talked about this a little bit on Pokestop.

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll just summarize it here.

470
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:59,000
A lot of that has to do with an error that Niantic made by they incentivized people to submit as many portals, which are the Pokestops and Ingress.

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They incentivized people to submit as many of those as they could.

472
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because you got a badge for it.

473
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And leveling up in Ingress is locked behind badges at a certain point.

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You know, I want to play devil's advocate really quick, which I hate doing. I think it's a dumb thing to do.

475
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But you're going to do it anyway.

476
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, but I'm going to do it anyway.

477
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
While it is terrible for people to go to the National Holocaust Museum or whatever for Pokemon Go.

478
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It also might be the only reason why they'd ever go and then actually get exposed to that stuff.

479
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't necessarily disagree with that.

480
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I think, you know, you want to not stare at your phone the entire time. You got to look up.

481
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, yeah, but I feel like if I were to go, like if I played Pokemon Go like that and I were to go to a place like that museum.

482
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, I'd do my Pokemon Go, but I feel like I would be so interested in seeing the rest of the stuff.

483
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's a business like, well, I don't know if they charge you or whatever, but I think it's like a good way to actually make me more interested in going there.

484
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You also understand the boundaries of common respect, which unfortunately the teenagers to it, not to brand all teenagers, but sorry, guys.

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You know, it's a lot of that that's doing this is at these cemeteries and stuff that are disrespecting the area and so forth that you were mentioning earlier.

486
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I think it's that audience that they can't be respectful, like you're mentioning that Arunia.

487
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Because, well, because Ingress has existed for years and those portals have existed for a long time.

488
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Why is it only just now coming out?

489
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because it wasn't as popular as Pokemon.

490
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And that's true. That's true. And that's a fair read.

491
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But, you know, but I think the players, the general player base also kind of knew a little bit more how to respect a place like that, if that makes sense.

492
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So, um, anyway, uh, and as 200 Matt and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, it's all about being respectful.

493
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If someone isn't being respectful, then they ruin ruin it for everyone.

494
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Ain't that the truth?

495
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Um, before we get into our gaming weeks, I just wanted to talk quickly about competitive gaming because I kind of found watching, even though I didn't get to watch a lot of it because I was driving, but listening to the commentary for Pokemon worlds, I found it very fascinating.

496
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You know, I, I, I'm more casual Pokemon fan and I admit that openly.

497
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Um, so I thought it was interesting, but it was like, wow, I really, I really can't dissect it on the level that they are. I know Shane can.

498
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But yeah, like I'd start laughing or be like, well, that's so cool. And you wouldn't understand.

499
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah, I didn't. Well, a, I didn't see it and b, I didn't wouldn't necessarily understand.

500
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You can just listen.

501
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But I just thought, I think it's very interesting that now we live in this age of, of the direct broadcasting because of things like Twitch, heck, because of things like podcasting and live streaming, that we have more niche gaming events.

502
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Although, you know, I realize I'm calling Pokemon a niche gaming event, but in some, in some elements it is, it's just one of the larger ones. We'll, we'll leave it at that.

503
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Oh my God. And this year's worlds is going to spawn so much fan fiction because of the German player and the U S player that totally are in love.

504
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And they had this like Pokeball pendant that splits in half and they each have piece of it. And it's just, it's going viral.

505
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay. But it's okay. But it's stories like that. Like there's that. And the fact that, you know, when we, when even you were watching it, I was like, what are you watching the Olympics over there?

506
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Because they're doing all these profiles of the people and like, this is where they come from. And this is how I was training my Pokemon.

507
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Like all these things that I would expect to see during the Olympics and your witty retort, which was kind of true was, yeah, this is the Olympics of Pokemon gaming.

508
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I was like, Oh, so I guess this is just the way we treat all sports broadcasts at that level.

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But I, I just, I thought that was very interesting that, you know, it was, it was kind of all put together like that.

510
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then, you know, you have former champions that are doing a lot of the commentating, which I, you know, I find that kind of stuff very interesting.

511
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And that they will say, Oh, and so-and-so this guy's a household name, you know, in the Pokemon community.

512
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And they were right.

513
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And I'm thinking, I'm like, who the hell is this person? I've never heard this name before. Shane had to explain it to me.

514
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But when you explain, well, what's the guy's name? What do you know?

515
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Seijun Park.

516
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Okay. And he's a big deal because he won worlds with a Pachirisu.

517
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah. He, okay. So he won worlds with a Pokemon that's kind of a, I don't want to say a trash Pokemon, but it's not one that you would expect to see in a finals.

518
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And if I'm not mistaken, doesn't he also compete in the card game?

519
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I think that was his first, this year was his first time. He got like 29th, I think.

520
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
See, so once I hear all that, I'm like, okay, well that, that makes sense why people that are really into Pokemon, like, Oh, it's, it's like that guy who plays baseball and plays football or basketball.

521
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Wasn't there some sports guy that did that?

522
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Michael Jordan.

523
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Was it Michael Jordan?

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
He played baseball.

525
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He played baseball. Okay. He wasn't the only one though. And not the one I was thinking off the top of my head. There was somebody who did like football.

526
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The Charamzy is Bo Jackson.

527
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Okay. Yeah, that sounds right. Bo Jackson. Thank you. So yeah, he's kind of like that.

528
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Does Bo know Pokemon?

529
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Maybe, you know, I'm sure he's retired at this point. So maybe, who knows?

530
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh my God. I can't believe I did an eighties reference.

531
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So anyway, um, I just, I just thought, I just thought it was very fascinating. What do you guys think of this, this competitive gaming stuff?

532
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I love it.

533
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Do you watch any of it? Do you watch any besides Pokemon?

534
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
No.

535
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No?

536
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
No, none of the rest of that's interesting to me.

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It adds a little bit of legitimacy to the years and years of being made fun of for being a girl gamer.

538
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, I could see that.

539
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah. It's just, I get to go back and get, you see all these people who are making money doing all the stuff that you gave me shit for. Fuck you.

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah. And I, you know, and I have to admit like when they were doing the Ingress live thing from San Diego, they were doing a very similar type of broadcast and they would talk about the strategy and so forth.

541
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I was like super into it because I play Ingress really heavy. And I was like, this is so rad that this is getting like an ESPN level treatment and that they're talking about it, like on this serious level, which, you know, I'm really invested in the game.

542
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So I kind of,

543
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
When was that?

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It was during the San Diego anomaly. They actually did that live broadcast.

545
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And they were doing, I think they used a group that does a bunch of YouTube videos. And so I think they kind of leverage that and they kind of did live broadcast, but I just, you know, watching it was, was awesome.

546
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And like, you know, they were talking about the strategy. Oh, it looks like a resistance is the resistance is throwing a link through the city.

547
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And it looks like what they're trying to do is prevent the enlightened from linking from here to here. And did it, you know, they'll just kind of analyze it on the big map.

548
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Like it's like watching Madden draw the plays on the map with the pen, you know, it's like, like, like, like that kind of thing.

549
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So I just, I kind of love that that exists for all these different games, no matter what it is that you're into, like Shane's into Pokemon, I'm into Ingress, Dark Soccer.

550
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What were you watching when you saw this Dark Soccer? What, what, what, what competitive stuff do you like to watch?

551
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Um, America's Next Top Model?

552
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Drag Race?

553
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'll take it. Drag Race. You know what, you know what, you laugh, but believe me, and you know, this comes from somebody who does co-host a Drag Race podcast.

554
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I was just watching the bad hair makeovers, that's all.

555
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
People treat Drag Race like it is a Olympic sport.

556
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This is not RuPaul's best friend race.

557
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Exactly. I mean, whatever it is that you're into, it's kind of, kind of neat to see that, to see things dive.

558
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It is the Drag Olympics.

559
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I love it. Let's see. JD is in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com saying, I'm excited for Drag Race to come back this week. Okay.

560
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes. Okay. I already put in my order on my Apple TV.

561
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Love it.

562
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So I could watch it. And I need people to watch it with me.

563
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
All right. Let's, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

564
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We'll talk about television later, but video games. Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing this week?

565
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I got back into Danganronpa 2. I got into, I'm still playing Sims 4 a little bit.

566
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I just got my controller for my Apple TV. So I'm going to be playing some Sonic CD on it.

567
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And, um, we busted out the ColecoVision and I think my needs, it's a power thing fixed. So that's shitty.

568
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh, yeah. And Peggle and Pokemon Go and, um, Miitomo. Cause now it's the Metroid week. So I have like Samus gear.

569
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh yeah. I got to sign in to actually get that stuff.

570
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Hurry.

571
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I finally fell off the Miitomo bandwagon. I was playing it longer than anybody. And then I finally stopped.

572
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Miitomo is great.

573
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
No, it's still cute. All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Um, I played mainly just Ingress and a little bit of Pokemon Go. A lot of Ingress actually, which is kind of weird, but, um, yeah.

575
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And I just checked the leaderboard. Apparently I'm ranked eight in our little cell here. So that's pretty good.

576
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Um, I just, it's been easy because no one's been taking down stuff.

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You know, normally I get a lot of like pushback from the other team, but nope, they've been like on vacation or something.

578
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So it's been very like, Oh, Hey, I can throw this field over here.

579
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
There was a lot of drama, which I'm not going to get into on this part, but yeah, there was, there was a lot of drama.

580
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But even still though, I mean like they've been having to send people from other areas and to clean up my stuff.

581
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And we had Pepper hit through here and they had Marty the other day come through. Although he was like, like incredibly lazy.

582
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Like just like, yeah, I'm going to destroy this thing. Oh, but I'm going to leave one resident around there.

583
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I can't believe you're naming names on this show.

584
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I don't care. It doesn't matter. No one knows who we're talking about.

585
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Um, but it's like, it's incredibly lazy. It's like, dude, like I literally, I'm lazy when I bust stuff, I find the hub, I kill it and then I move on.

586
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm literally like, I literally just drove back and just read through it even bigger. Like I'm like, fine, cool.

587
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You have to block if you're going to, and that's the, that's the way to do it.

588
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He threw one link, so it was cool, but unfortunately he threw it from the portal that's by my house and he didn't shield anything.

589
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So I was like, okay, well I'm just going to break this really fast. And then, so yeah, so I played that.

590
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Um, I played a little bit more No Man's Sky. Um, just haven't done a whole lot with that though.

591
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Um, and then I played a little bit of Tap My Katamari. I did eventually update the app so I can't do the exploit anymore.

592
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And I really wish I hadn't because the update, what they added was, hey, there's some candy offers you can do by doing some bullshit that, you know.

593
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You know, have you ever seen those things when you try to go to websites? Like, oh hey, you want to download this file?

594
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You're going to need to do one of these offers for it to work. And the offers, you end up doing it and it never fucking credits you for it.

595
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yep, that's, that's fucking Tap My Katamari. It's just a piece of shit.

596
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's funny though, is they also had some of these games that they advertised in their, um, thing.

597
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
They have like these little interactive ads, which I think are pretty cool and it gets you interested in the game.

598
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So I was like, oh hey, you know what? These tower defense games look pretty cool. I'm going to try downloading one of them.

599
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And I downloaded it and it's completely fucking different than that little demo. It is just like, holy shit, this stuff is just super complicated.

600
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And it just feels like that they're trying to get me to pay. They're just like shoving those transactions just down my throat.

601
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm like, nah, I'm uninstalling this immediately.

602
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It was just like, what the fuck is going on here? This is not at all. It's just like so blatant with, oh please have, we want money. Give us your money. Money now.

603
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Um, so I just kind of ignored that, but yeah, I'm hopefully going to play some more in a man's sky.

604
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I really do need to go back to Fallout now that all that DLC is out and I haven't actually played any of it yet.

605
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So I need to do that. That's it.

606
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
All right. By the way, just some late breaking news because some folks are sharing this in the chat room, um, over at live.voggenover.com and I'm seeing this on Twitter.

607
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Apparently during the Olympics, because the Rio closing ceremony is going on right now.

608
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, they always do at the end of the closing ceremonies, they always, you know, pass the torch, so to speak, to the next city that's hosting the Olympics, which is going to be Tokyo.

609
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Tokyo is hosting the Olympics in 2020. Well, apparently, uh, somebody came out actually dressed as Mario, uh, and they actually did a whole little montage.

610
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, it's on Twitter right now. They did a whole little Mario montage.

611
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I saw it was the Japanese prime minister.

612
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Was that the Japanese prime minister?

613
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That's what it said on Twitter.

614
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh wow. Okay.

615
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Got it. Got to sell those Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games.

616
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Right.

617
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They have an arcade machine of that.

618
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Like, yeah, they do.

619
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's four player, crazy, huge, ginormous garbage.

620
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So yeah. So, um, you know, just, just a little, I bring that up here and interrupt the show to mention that because you know, that's kind of, kind of a big deal.

621
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You know, the Olympics kind of a big deal for a lot of people since we've just been talking about competitive gaming and so forth.

622
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And, and the fact that, you know, Mario just made an appearance at that event is, is kind of a big deal.

623
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Uh, and, and it turns out it's the prime minister nonetheless. That's pretty, pretty darn big deal.

624
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So anyway, the prime minister of Japan is Mario? Man, I learned something today.

625
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
All right. Anyway, uh, Shane, how was your gaming week? What did you play this week?

626
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
One day two of not having any shinies in Pokemon.

627
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You poor thing.

628
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Um, it hurts me physically right now.

629
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Uh, other than that, I, uh, can start playing PS4 games again.

630
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes, I got a PS4 controller finally.

631
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Not going to throw this one away in a Taco Bell bag.

632
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I hope not at least.

633
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And then I played DDR and only played my songs.

634
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's all we played.

635
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And I'm a jerk I've decided because some of those were just way too tiring for me.

636
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It also makes me realize I'm going to start going to the gym because that was just pathetic.

637
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah, I, I really need to go to the gym too. So, but then it's like, ah, but I'm going to be maybe leaving for a week.

638
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And so I won't get any exercise in while I'm at Dragon Con.

639
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
In fact, that's going to be worse for my health because I'll be doing so much drinking while I'm at Dragon Con.

640
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But I'm, I'm all for trying to get up and do more exercise and DDR is always a great motivator for that.

641
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, it was. It just kicked my butt. And so I've got to fix that for whenever I play it again.

642
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay, I'm watching the clip.

643
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah.

644
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And he's just, it's Mario going down a pipe in Tokyo in the big crosswalk at Shibuya.

645
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And then coming up wearing a robe that he drops off of him and he's just wearing the Mario hat.

646
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

647
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That's not.

648
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Okay, but still, come on. That's acknowledging.

649
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's cute, but.

650
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's acknowledging that the next Olympics are going to be in the Mushroom Kingdom and they better watch out for Koopa.

651
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You think it was bad with thieves in fucking Rio.

652
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You got the fucking Koopas to deal with now.

653
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
At least it won't be.

654
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And you better not be sending any princesses because that shit is just going to get fucking kidnapped.

655
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
At least it's not going to be in a place where the government allows its citizens to remain impoverished while spending all that money on a big Olympic stadium. I mean.

656
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well, and hopefully nobody lies about Wendy Okupa robbing them, but you know, anyway.

657
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
They just pee on her though.

658
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
What a piece of shit, okay?

659
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm going to do an early F you to that piece of shit who pretty much got away with being a major asshole when people are giving Gabby shit for not holding her hand over her heart.

660
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Sorry, he's a fucking embarrassment.

661
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay, I'm done.

662
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
All right.

663
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Lots of feelings.

664
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
All right.

665
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Let's see.

666
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
My gaming week.

667
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So I went to round one with Shane, obviously.

668
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm really sad I didn't get to play DDR ace, but there were just so many people like, you know, there's just a huge line.

669
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And so I got to watch a little bit of it.

670
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It looked neat, but I want an addendum.

671
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh, please.

672
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I played time crisis five because I love time crisis.

673
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Time crisis five is garbage or at least the one around one.

674
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, the guns are not calibrated whatsoever.

675
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So you will like hold perfectly still and shoot.

676
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And it's just going to go all over the place, at least on their machine, which really ruined the experience for me.

677
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So I hate that game now.

678
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What was I going to say?

679
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So, okay.

680
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So, yeah, round one.

681
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I did play DDR supernova two because that's the machine we played on.

682
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You can get on ace.

683
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
No, nobody.

684
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Everybody was playing ace.

685
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So nobody was playing supernova to us.

686
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I was like, all right, well, I haven't played this game a lot.

687
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
A lot.

688
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I played it before, but not a lot.

689
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So I played it, played around on that.

690
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But I actually played, you know, the music game I played more than anything was I played pop and music because it's been a long time since I really like sat down and played some pop music.

691
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So I actually played like I played like several games back to back.

692
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And if you don't know pop and music, imagine a music game where the controller is trouble with the Pop-O-Matic bubble.

693
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's nine of those.

694
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And that's how you control.

695
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Because that was the best part about playing that game.

696
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You all know what I'm talking about, right?

697
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
The board game trouble.

698
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The Pop-O-Matic bubble.

699
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Well, imagine that that was a game that you just hit that bubble over and over in time.

700
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You mean it wasn't?

701
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Wait, why are we talking about how pop and music works?

702
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Because did you not just hear?

703
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's what I played a bunch of at round one.

704
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I was looking at text and playing Pokemon.

705
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Good lord.

706
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I played like a bunch of games of pop and music.

707
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
No, but everybody that listens to this show probably knows.

708
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Not everybody. Not everybody.

709
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
At this point?

710
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Maybe.

711
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
At this point?

712
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm just giving you the quick description in case you don't know.

713
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But I will say after playing that, like my hands were glowing red.

714
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Like didn't I show you?

715
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I was like, look, my hands are in pain because I played so much pop music back to back.

716
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But it was worth it.

717
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It was fun.

718
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I like pop music.

719
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I played a little 2DX as well and some of the other stuff in the arcade that I enjoy.

720
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And then as far as home games go, I've been playing more World of Warcraft.

721
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I've been doing a lot of invasions to level up my character in World of Warcraft.

722
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So that's been fun.

723
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And then I played some more No Man's Sky this week, which I'm still enjoying that game.

724
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Alan's making me think I missed something, though.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Like now he has me wondering, like, do I need to go back to a galaxy I was in a while ago

726
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
because I might have missed something or will it show up eventually?

727
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Apparently I missed the recipe for the Atlas Pass somehow.

728
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Like he got it in the galaxy right after he visited the first Atlas.

729
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That didn't happen to me.

730
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So did I miss it? Was I not looking out?

731
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out the whole hyperdrive things.

732
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You're still trying to figure out how to get off the goddamn planet?

733
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Oh, I've already gone off the goddamn planet and then went to another planet.

734
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And I was like, oh, hey, I'm going to find I found a broken ship.

735
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm going to fix it up and take it.

736
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And then so I fix it up and I'm like, oh, shit, I don't have a hyperdrive or the means to make a hyperdrive.

737
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Where's my old ship? Oh, fuck, I don't remember the fuck that is because I looked and I don't know where it is.

738
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So now I'm worried. I'm like, do I have to start the whole thing over?

739
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But I feel like, OK, if I miss something, the game will put it back.

740
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's like the recipe that you can like not get on that first planet or whatever.

741
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Like if you have the DLC thing, you get that recipe eventually.

742
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But you just it might take you a while to get it. So I don't know.

743
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Well, we'll see. I'm hoping I don't didn't miss that thing for good, but I've still been enjoying No Man's Sky.

744
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I like exploring the different planets and stuff. I realize there's still a lot of controversy.

745
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
There's a lot of stuff, though, there like I found like when I was flying from place to place, I'm like, oh, there's another settlement.

746
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
That's exactly the same as the last settlement and no one there and the same chairs turned over.

747
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's like like some alien race came in there. I'm throwing this chair over exactly the same in every single one of these places.

748
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Fucking like space, you know, trailers or whatever.

749
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
When you consider it, the whole thing is randomly generated.

750
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Obviously, there are some templates that come up in the random.

751
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh, I found some pretty fucked up buildings that are like up in the air.

752
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And there's like one of those shrine things that the idols that you're supposed to find.

753
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It shows me a map spot. I go there. There's a lake. There's nothing there. Not even in the lake.

754
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It must be below the ground somewhere. I don't know how the hell to get down there.

755
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, the same thing happened to me. It's like there's like a shrine below the lake.

756
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And I'm like, where the fuck is this? Because there was one in a lake, which is fine.

757
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But like, nope, there's nothing here.

758
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh, God.

759
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And they keep going to those places like where you can like find stuff.

760
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's all located shrine. Cool. It keeps sending back to that one that there's nothing there.

761
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Fuck, you know what I just realized?

762
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Alan was trying to tell me what the thing looked like that I missed.

763
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I think that was the thing at the bottom of the lake.

764
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Alan, are you listening? Is Alan listening to the show?

765
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Did the lady of the lake forget to throw you a sword?

766
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Alan, if you're listening, I think the purple dot was at the bottom of the lake.

767
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
No, that's on Atlas Pass. That's something to learn language and stuff.

768
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh, OK. Oh, I guess this is a web.

769
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But yeah, I don't know. Whatever. We'll figure it out.

770
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
All right. So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

771
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
A lot of the standard stuff besides a fun trip to round one with Shane and our other friend.

772
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So that brings us to housekeeping. Do follow us on Twitter. Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.

773
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook dot com slash orange lounge radio.

774
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And we will be bringing back interactivity on Facebook and Google in the coming weeks.

775
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So stay tuned for that, because I know some of you have been wondering what happened to that.

776
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And we have a plan. So there's that.

777
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Also, I wanted to say we will not be here in two weeks because I will be back east for Dragon Con in Atlanta, Georgia.

778
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I know one thing I will be at for sure is the Parsec Awards, which were usually on Sunday night, if I'm not mistaken.

779
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't know if they're Saturday or Sunday night this year, but look out for the Parsec Awards.

780
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Our pal Brad and his crew over at Pod Culture were nominated for a Parsec Award for TARDIS interruptus,

781
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
which is their Doctor Who themed kind of spin off of Pod Culture.

782
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So I'm very excited. OK. And Brad's confirming it Saturday.

783
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So I'm very excited to go there and support him and hopefully he'll win.

784
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But even if he doesn't, we're going to cheer him on all the same and all the great indie podcasters that make that stuff.

785
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So we'll be there at the Parsec Awards. But that's the only thing I know for sure I'm doing.

786
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Otherwise, I should be around the podcast track, the gaming track.

787
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There's going to be an arcade at Dragon Con for the very first time.

788
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
A lot of these same Japanese games, now classic games, this is going to be a new thing for Dragon Con.

789
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So I'm very excited about it. So I'll be there as well.

790
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So we will not be here Labor Day weekend as I will be out of town in Atlanta.

791
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:59,000
That also is going to mark Jamie taking a leave from the show for a few months while she has her work schedule snafu thing going on.

792
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So but she'll be back. You're going to have to take the day off for Episode 666 or something.

793
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I just I can't we can't do that show without Jamie without the most evil person here.

794
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I just need the day. Excuse me.

795
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Well, you're pretty you're you're kind of an asshole, too. So I don't know.

796
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We all need to be here to get out the Ouija board. That's for sure.

797
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I just know what I want, but I just need the specific date so I can ask it off in enough time.

798
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Sadly, we don't know it yet, but we'll we'll try to plot it out and figure it out.

799
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But I thought that it was going to be in December after.

800
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I think so.

801
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Then I should be fine.

802
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, well, we'll figure it out. I'll try to I'll try to bring up a calendar and we'll figure that out.

803
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But we're going to get into some news right now and talk about what's going on in the gaming world this week.

804
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So, Loki, what's up?

805
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We'll just do like a holiday themed episode that's dedicated to Krampus and then it kind of ties both together.

806
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I like it. I like it.

807
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So No Man's Sky got a patch for PlayStation 4.

808
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's, I guess, improved some stability, which means I haven't actually played it since the patch yet.

809
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's supposed to improve some of the frame rate and also add support for more hardware, which I don't understand.

810
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I guess that's more of the PC stuff.

811
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Stability basically is the main thing.

812
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm not sure if that was one of the things that they fixed was maybe the whole, I don't know, the issue with, you know, if you have the DLC shipped, not getting that hyperdrive recipe right away.

813
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So maybe that was one of the things that was in there.

814
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I will actually have to check that out.

815
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But, yep.

816
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So PC version, the patch should be, you know, should be coming around the same time.

817
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So hopefully that's good because the PC version here is really broken.

818
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So I did the plotting real quick for episode 666 because you guys have to hear this.

819
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So we're not going to be here the week of Dragon Con.

820
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So I took that that week out of it.

821
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We won't be here the week of GamerX4 because VOG Network will be there.

822
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So I took that week out of it.

823
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Now, I don't remember if I am back in time on Sunday, the week of Final Fantasy Fan Fest, but I think I am.

824
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So I think we still have a show that weekend of Final Fantasy Fan Fest because I'm only coming back from Vegas, which is now our flight.

825
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So that puts episode 666 on the 20th of November.

826
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's just too perfect.

827
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I shit you not.

828
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The way things plot out right now, episode 666 is on 20 November.

829
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Dark Sakura, do you think that'll work out?

830
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I know it's a little early.

831
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I don't know. Actually, that might be too early.

832
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
No.

833
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'll have to see what I can do.

834
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
No. Okay, I'll have to see what you can do.

835
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Because that would work out a little too perfectly.

836
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You have to admit that's a pretty perfect day for episode 666 to fall.

837
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
For those that may not know, that is the name of an old school song that was in DDR and Beatmania was 20 November.

838
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Like in the very first. So it's really funny if it works out that it's that day.

839
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Didn't that have to do with 20 November? Wasn't that something to do with Beatmania?

840
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I think it was the release date, yeah. How ironic.

841
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Going back to No Man's Sky real quick, some people are actually asking for refunds from PlayStation for No Man's Sky.

842
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Because it is a broken piece of shit for some people.

843
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So because of that, they've run into some issues with their return policy.

844
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Apparently, I guess, you can do a return on.

845
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But I guess the thing was they're not allowing you to repurchase it later on.

846
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So say, yeah, it's not worth my purchase right now, but after they iron out all the bugs, I do want to repurchase this later on down the road.

847
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
They're saying that no, you can't. Which is a little unusual.

848
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Steam, of course, I don't think has that sort of stimulation.

849
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's basically you can cancel the game, or if you haven't played two hours worth of the game, I think you can do a refund on that.

850
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And then they said season passes, 14 days of data transaction for those.

851
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Why not just go to the store and buy the physical game then, if they're not going to let you buy the-

852
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I guess, I mean, yeah, you could do that.

853
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That does seem strange.

854
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, basically, I was told I couldn't rebuy off the store digitally, and I couldn't buy a physical copy because whatever system they employ in the background wouldn't let me run it.

855
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
They delete the license from your account, and that seems to put a block on it.

856
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I would happily rebuy the game at a later date if it's improved, if the features promised were put in, and if the crashing was fixed.

857
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Because these things do get fixed over time, but I didn't really want to get my money back and then never be able to play it again.

858
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So it seems counterproductive.

859
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah, they basically said, okay, well, you can either wait for it to be fixed, or you get a refund and you can't play the game again.

860
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That's a real weird- I mean, I understand the PlayStation 4 has the whole licensing thing, but that's a real weird convoluted thing.

861
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I can't believe that they wouldn't still want people to try and buy it eventually, kind of like what Steam does. That's very odd.

862
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And yeah, maybe I'm just special or something, but I have a PlayStation 4 I bought at launch.

863
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Did the game crash on me? Yeah, maybe two or three times.

864
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Maybe three times, but I sent the- the game saves so much. I hardly lost any progress, so just whatever.

865
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Now, that was one person saying that. So basically, this article came from Eurogamer, and they had contacted Sony saying, hey, this kind of sounds a little odd.

866
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I mean, you're really not going to allow them to repurchase it. And apparently, they were told that players who do get a refund for No Man's Sky would be able to rebuy the game in the future.

867
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Contrary to what the representative had stated previously.

868
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Interesting.

869
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I guess if you haven't purchased it yet, maybe just hold on until it gets better. Like, I kind of- you know, I was all gung ho about Just Cause 3, and that was a fucking mess.

870
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You know, and I purchased it digitally, and yeah, I'm kind of stuck with it because, I don't know, I just- that's one game I haven't gone back to play in a while.

871
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Do you wish you'd done a refund on it?

872
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I wish I hadn't bought it in the first place, because that was just- I bought too many games around that time and just haven't gotten around to playing it.

873
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And I, you know, I did buy it, and I was like, ooh, yeah, I'm really going to play this, and then I played, like, twice, and, eh, don't forget.

874
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Alright, well, let's move on to talk about some more rumors and news that's brewing around the Nintendo NX.

875
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Although, you know, part of the reason we like to bring these things up on the show is that, A, it's what a lot of people are talking about out there in the gaming blogs and gaming culture.

876
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But, B, especially when we're talking about things like patents and so forth, you know, not that every patent is used, but it's usually a case of where there's smoke, there's fire type of thing.

877
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And so these are things that are highly likely to be in the Nintendo NX. But, of course, we don't know for sure until Nintendo actually says.

878
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Which is when, at this point, because are we expecting next month?

879
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's supposed to be, I think, next month, maybe? That's the thought?

880
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I feel like it has to be.

881
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
As much of a rumor as any of these other things that are coming out, my assumption is that they will either get the jump on.

882
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Well, I'm still sticking with they're going to announce in advance of Tokyo Game Show so that third parties can show their games at Tokyo Game Show.

883
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Even though Nintendo doesn't participate themselves, they can still be part of the conversation.

884
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That's still my prediction for when they announce as the week before Tokyo Game Show.

885
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I think it's kind of unusual not to announce anything by now, I mean, because people are curious about it.

886
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They're just repeating the mistakes they had with the Wii U. It's the same thing all over again.

887
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
They're not going to have time to get the branding out to make sure people understand what it is.

888
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That's really what did the Wii U and it's like everybody didn't understand it and they still don't to this day.

889
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
All they have to do is add a splash screen to Pokemon Go.

890
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
People just say that doesn't affect that.

891
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I don't think that's going to matter at this point because there's so many people playing Pokemon Go.

892
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't think that, oh damn, I don't have anything to play this on is really a problem.

893
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And honestly, by the time that comes out, since they haven't really announced any new expansions or anything that updates to it,

894
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
aside from fixing shit that should have been fixed a while ago, I don't think the hype and buzz is there right now.

895
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I think that a month from now, even if you look at parks now, there's not a lot of people out there like it used to be at launch.

896
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So I don't think that's going to be a big deal like, oh yeah, we have Pokemon Go.

897
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah, you and every fucking other phone out there. I mean, I just don't think that's going to be a big deal.

898
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, we'll see. I mean, I knew the bubble was going to burst on that eventually, but we just talked about how 30 million people are still playing it.

899
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So I'm just, that's one way they could get brand awareness out there.

900
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But I think, you know, don't read too much into that.

901
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But I don't think, I just don't think it's as doom and gloom as you guys think it is.

902
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
No, I don't. I think that's what they're relying on is Pokemon Go to launch that system.

903
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And they need more than that.

904
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I don't think it's doom and gloom. I just think they're falling into the same trap they had last time.

905
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And they need to not if they want to be super successful this generation.

906
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I think they want to stay out of the conversation during the holidays when there's all this other stuff going on.

907
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And then when gaming dies down in January, February next year, when things slow down after the holidays, that's when Nintendo can start the hype train.

908
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Nintendo doesn't have anything for this holiday really. Nothing that's going to give them tons of money.

909
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
They've got Pokemon and that's really it.

910
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So like what's on Wii U this holiday? The Paper Mario game, I think that's it.

911
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So they have two games technically.

912
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And so they needed to be talking about their other stuff that's upcoming.

913
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
They can't afford to just sit there and wait until after the holidays.

914
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I still think the minute Nintendo announces this, it's going to drive what everybody's talking about in the media for a while.

915
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But we'll see. But anyway, trying to figure out what some of that could be with the NX.

916
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
There's a new patent filing that's basically for a more mod...

917
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So this controller they're just talking about doing with the tablet that has the things that you can hook up and the base and all that.

918
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
They're talking about a modular component to this.

919
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Imagine the D-pad could actually slip in and out and change with another D-pad.

920
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And honestly, as far as the whole collecting faces for the DS in Japan and all that,

921
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
this seems really right in line with that.

922
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That Nintendo would be all about special, like, controller layouts or things.

923
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I mean, but it could even be like, imagine that it seems like maybe you could have one type of D-pad for this game,

924
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
but maybe you could flip it out and it would be a stick for another game. That would be really cool.

925
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
They already do that with like, they have, was it Nintendo Elite, or not Nintendo, the Microsoft Elite controller can do that.

926
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And they've got other third-party controllers that do something similar where you can swap that stuff out.

927
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So it's not anything new. I'm surprised it's something that they're patenting.

928
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I think it's the fact that it's on the tablet device is the new element to that. I think that's how they're able to do it.

929
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But how would you keep track of all the little pieces for every game?

930
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Exactly. It was more of a customization thing.

931
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Versus like, I need this specific set of buttons for this game.

932
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, exactly. Because it's going to become a nightmare. It's just like, oh, I need this attachment for this game, and I need this attachment for this game.

933
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And like, oh shit, what attachment do I need for this? And that was one of the problems that we had.

934
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It's like, well shit, I can play this game, but oh, I need a nunchuck. Now I gotta go buy this extra accessory or something.

935
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, but that's not as bad as what it could potentially be with this controller.

936
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Like, a nunchuck that's easy to get, but what if like, say the newest Smash Brothers game needs this specific D-pad to work properly.

937
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You're going to run into shortages and stuff like that again.

938
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Now, I would be happy with stuff being able to be hot-swapped. One, we're talking like analog sticks, which I have several of my controllers.

939
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
The analog stick has gone bad. It'd be nice just to replace that one component without having to open it up.

940
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Or buy an entirely new controller.

941
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Exactly, yeah. Or buy another controller. But I just, I don't see the point yet with this.

942
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's like, it's a neat gimmick, but I don't know what it's going to be used for.

943
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And I'm, I'm just worried that it's going to be like the Wii U is now, where they still are trying to convince people what that gamepad's supposed to be used for.

944
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And it's like, dude, it's too late now. It is too late. Like, it's Star Fox Zero.

945
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Whoa, shit, we need those fucking motion controls. For why? Because you need some sort of justification for the gamepad? It's too fucking late for that.

946
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Well, I'll be curious to see how Nintendo sells that to the audience, hopefully next month. Hopefully when they announce it.

947
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But I think another audience they really have to sell the concept to is third-party developers, EA being one of them.

948
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And what's interesting is that Eurogamer actually cornered Peter Moore from EA. Well, not cornered him, but you know, they were doing an interview.

949
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And asked some pretty direct questions about, basically, the new Nintendo console.

950
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:02,000
In the interview, it was asked that Nintendo has a new console. EA was kind of quiet on Wii U. What is EA going to do with the NX?

951
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And Peter Moore responded, I don't know. Obviously, a lot of details are still to be unveiled.

952
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
EA has developed for Nintendo for 30 years, and I was famously quoted as saying we're still good friends.

953
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I've lived the console cycles up and downs. I launched the Dreamcast. Some publishers got behind that and some didn't.

954
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But certainly, EA has never come out and said it won't develop for Nintendo.

955
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And then the thing moved on. Eurogamer kind of cornered him on the whole, well, you mentioned that special relationship for Wii U, which never really materialized.

956
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And then went on to ask about the whole, like, you know, Nintendo kind of does their own thing.

957
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
They don't necessarily want to compete with Xbox or PlayStation. Does it make Nintendo more difficult to support?

958
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Peter Moore said, Nintendo has always based its success on its first-party games because it's a brilliant first-party developer.

959
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:57,000
If you ask that question to them, they'd say they have to launch with first-party software first. That's where the first dev kits go, which is a very interesting answer to that question.

960
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Either he, I mean, it could really go either way. He could be either hiding something really big that EA is working on, which, you know, or they are not planning on it right now.

961
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Which could, I mean, I guess it would largely depend on, did they get their Frostbite engine working on NX or not?

962
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And if the NX is not as on a technical level as PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, perhaps they have not.

963
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And so if Frostbite doesn't run on it, they're probably not going to be developing as many games for it.

964
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But I would still think that, you know, their more casual arm, like, you know, the former PopCap that does the, you know, Pagle and the Plants vs. Zombies stuff.

965
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You would think that there's room there to develop on NX.

966
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But I don't think they're really developing for 3DS very much either. I think that's all gone mobile now. It's like, because they're making more money there.

967
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And yeah, I mean, I could see them, you know, developing for the NX that they can capture more of that mobile, that 3DS audience.

968
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But, I don't know. I mean, it's money. It's just, how much money are they talking about?

969
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It's not the same as having a big title like Battlefield 1 or, you know, the next Battlefront or something like that.

970
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Doomplague in chat says Nintendo patents a lot of things and doesn't always use them. True.

971
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So you always have to take these things with a grain of salt.

972
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Vitality sensor.

973
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
That's very true. Well, they even came out and announced that one.

974
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Doomplague continues, the more interesting patent is the supplemental processing device, which looks like it's essentially a more powerful upgrade that you leave at home.

975
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Like a dock that gives the system better graphics.

976
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And that could certainly be a thing that maybe, you know, if we're talking about this whole tablet that plugs into a device in your home to put it on the TV,

977
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
it would make a lot of sense that maybe that device has something in it that makes the games capable of running at an even better resolution on your TV.

978
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You know, again, don't really know until Nintendo comes out and says, here's what Mario looks like on our new console that is named blank.

979
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Named that is not NX because that is not the actual name of the console.

980
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So hopefully a month from now, we're having a very different conversation. We'll see.

981
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Anyway, let's move on to our next story. Dark Sakura.

982
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Something that has very little to do with Nintendo. Pokemon Go.

983
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I see what you did there.

984
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yes.

985
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It does have to do with Nintendo, but not a lot.

986
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But not really, because Nintendo doesn't technically own Pokemon.

987
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Yeah, I gotcha.

988
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Anyway, Niantic, who is the developer behind Pokemon Go, is putting down the ban hammer for sure.

989
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:37,000
We've kind of talked about this before, but it's official that after getting so many reports of in-game cheating,

990
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
that moving forward, this is actually a direct quote,

991
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
moving forward we will continue to terminate accounts that show clear signs of cheating.

992
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:54,000
They do have an appeal process in place for people to, you know, well, appeal the decision of them,

993
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,000
but for right now they are looking for people who are using bots to cheat, who are spoofing,

994
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:10,000
who are basically using various other methods to try to circumvent the system and give themselves an advantage.

995
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So many third party little bots out there have already started pulling their software away.

996
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Like Necrobot, that one's gone.

997
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Just because Niantic is really putting it down so that this doesn't ruin the game for everybody else.

998
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And I've been fairly happy with what's been going on.

999
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't really care about losing the proximity thing.

1000
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I actually like how they're doing it now.

1001
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Well, how they're going to roll it out where you see what PokeStops have what Pokemon.

1002
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:57,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, state.

1003
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,000
S2100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, I think they banned that shitlord who was taking over gyms in New York City using eggs.

1004
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Good. Bye.

1005
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Well, that was a glitch in the game that they should have fixed in the first place.

1006
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But here's the thing.

1007
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Still exploiting the glitch in a way that affects other people. He deserved it.

1008
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Agreed.

1009
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But the system, of course, is not perfect.

1010
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
In fact, there was actually a charity livestream of someone playing Pokemon Go that they're trying to get as much experience in one day.

1011
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Their goal was a million.

1012
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And they got soft banned because they were earning experience too fast.

1013
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Even though they weren't botting, they were livestreaming it.

1014
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And they even tweeted out to one of the guys at Niantic saying, hey, can you whitelist me?

1015
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Because I'm clearly not cheating, but your software thinks I am.

1016
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Interesting.

1017
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So, you know, we talked about this a little bit, again, plugging the other show.

1018
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But we talked a little bit about this on this week's PokeStop, which I know isn't posted yet, but it will be tonight.

1019
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
But we talked a little bit about this, the whole fact that there's going to be errors in the system that are going to catch people that didn't really cheat.

1020
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And sometimes it's people that really, really don't want you to know that they cheated and it just kind of sucks.

1021
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But sometimes it's cases like this where it's like, hey, they've been taping the whole thing and it was just an unusual play circumstance where, you know, this person was playing for 24 hours straight.

1022
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
But they did it for charity, but it probably set off alarms that they got too much experience.

1023
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Okay, so I wasn't paying attention to what was just going on, but I heard little bits of it.

1024
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Sorry, I was reading.

1025
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And there's actually an article on Kotaku exactly about this guy who's doing what you just said.

1026
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah.

1027
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Did you talk about that?

1028
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah, that's what he was talking about.

1029
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Okay, the, the, okay, never mind.

1030
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah.

1031
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Thanks, thanks for your contributions.

1032
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I was reading about Danganronpa.

1033
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Sorry, it was more important than whatever you were talking about.

1034
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I wasn't talking about anything.

1035
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You were being rude to the others, but that's, that's all right.

1036
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I'd like to know more about Danganronpa.

1037
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
What were you reading?

1038
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah, Jamie will forgive you for-

1039
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Just, just impressions of the anime right now that's going on.

1040
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
If I had known you were going to be here, I would have given you those episodes.

1041
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Oh, I just actually watched them.

1042
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I just made a new account on Funimation under a different name.

1043
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Okay.

1044
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So I got another 14 day trial.

1045
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
They're so good.

1046
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
All right, let's move on with something.

1047
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Shane, pay attention.

1048
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Loki.

1049
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
All right.

1050
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
So Facebook is launching a gaming platform, you know, and I'm kind of surprised that this

1051
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
isn't already launched because I swear all those trivia things that people keep posting

1052
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
on their walls about like, hey, do this math question.

1053
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Isn't that a game?

1054
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Am I already playing the game?

1055
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Is this already a thing?

1056
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Yes, the game is don't get blocked by your friends when you post-

1057
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Game is.

1058
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Figure out how do you turn off those fucking Instagram notifications.

1059
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh, guess what?

1060
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You can't because fuck you.

1061
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That's why.

1062
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Because you will fucking like Instagram whether you fucking like it or not.

1063
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I don't have this problem, Loki.

1064
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
They fucking hate me is why.

1065
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't even have fucking Instagram.

1066
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I have no Instagram account.

1067
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Because I deleted it.

1068
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I thought creating one would allow me to shut off the notifications.

1069
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
No, they just fucking get you Instagram.

1070
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That's all it does.

1071
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Anyways, so yes, they are going to be branching out.

1072
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
One of the people that they're partnering with actually is Unity.

1073
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So they're going to be allowing seamless integration with Facebook home pages.

1074
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And I guess they're going to have an option I think pretty soon actually

1075
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
where you'll be able to export using Unity to Facebook as a platform.

1076
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
So that's cool.

1077
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I'll have to check that out.

1078
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
It's interesting.

1079
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
When you see the headline, you think, oh, God,

1080
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
is Facebook going to release a console?

1081
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And it's really not that at all.

1082
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But it's interesting when you think about how they're saying that Pokemon Go,

1083
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
you know, to keep picking on that game,

1084
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
has been getting more eyes recently than Facebook has been getting.

1085
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So do you think that Facebook wants to build some of this gaming into their mobile platform?

1086
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
They're sad and neglected, poor baby.

1087
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
They don't control everything and they don't want that.

1088
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
They probably just want money.

1089
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I mean, because they want people to have their games revolving around Facebook

1090
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
so that when I'm playing like a Tap My Kata Mario or something

1091
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and if I purchase an in-game thing, they get a portion of that money and not Google.

1092
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I think it's also easy to tie this to Oculus

1093
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
because Facebook has the Oculus thing.

1094
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
But I kind of feel like, I don't know,

1095
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
at least the original direction of what they wanted to use Oculus for

1096
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
was not strictly gaming, and that's why Facebook being involved was interesting

1097
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
because it makes you think that there could be more lifestyle type of uses for Oculus.

1098
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And heck, you already see on Facebook these 360 degree immersive experiences

1099
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
and you can do it on your desktop by clicking and holding around.

1100
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You can imagine what that's probably going to look like in VR.

1101
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So I kind of always thought like, oh, okay, Facebook was actually bringing

1102
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
a very specifically non-gaming element to Oculus to kind of enrichen that device

1103
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
to make it more than just a gaming thing.

1104
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But now it's interesting to hear like, oh, but Facebook wants to kind of up its game

1105
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
on its gaming because Facebook games used to be the whole conversation

1106
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
when it was stuff like Farmville.

1107
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Now that's gone away.

1108
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Well, it's not gone away, but it's scaled way back in favor of mobile.

1109
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So I almost feel like Facebook wants to build in gaming again,

1110
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
but they probably want to do it in a way that includes mobile

1111
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
so that way you can play games on your Facebook,

1112
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
but you're still kind of tuned into it on mobile, if that makes sense.

1113
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense at all,

1114
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
but I feel like that's what they kind of want to do.

1115
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1116
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Kaijuto in chat says the Facebook console is going to make you post your mood

1117
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
every time you turn it on.

1118
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Tell us a little bit about the game you're playing.

1119
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Tell your friends about it.

1120
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Tag friends that you're playing the game with right now.

1121
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
All right, moving on.

1122
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Let's talk about the PlayStation 4 slim.

1123
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
We know something's coming with a slimmer PlayStation 4,

1124
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and we might know a whole lot more.

1125
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Apparently some images have leaked of this PlayStation 4.

1126
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
There's an online classified listing that is selling this unreleased

1127
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
slim line PlayStation 4.

1128
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Apparently it does not look like it is the souped up PlayStation 4K

1129
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
or whatever you want to call it,

1130
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but it is a slimmer PlayStation 4 probably in line with what

1131
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Microsoft just did with Xbox One and the whole S system.

1132
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
So, you know, again though, take this stuff with a grain of salt,

1133
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
because we've all been fooled with photoshops before,

1134
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
so it could be an elaborate thing, but I don't know.

1135
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You look at the console, you kind of go, okay, it makes sense.

1136
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
There's nothing on this that makes you go, that's crazy.

1137
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I don't think it's a hoax at all.

1138
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I mean, it's got the box that looks real enough.

1139
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
The system looks exactly like I would expect a slim line version to look like.

1140
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
They even removed something from it.

1141
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So, that makes sense too.

1142
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And apparently people are asking this person on Twitter to actually,

1143
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
like, take different pictures of it and so forth,

1144
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and they're actually complying.

1145
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So, it seems like they just posted a picture of the new PlayStation 4,

1146
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
the slimmer one, on top of an older one.

1147
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So, you know, the fact that they can kind of respond to those custom picture

1148
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
requests certainly lessens the chance that it's some type of Photoshop.

1149
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And again, there's nothing here that makes me go, oh, this is crazy different.

1150
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
This is kind of what I would expect.

1151
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So, yeah, there it is.

1152
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It doesn't look like there's a lot of new features with it.

1153
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I imagine it probably just runs a little differently.

1154
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I do like this, though.

1155
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The power button and the eject button, they're on the side kind of,

1156
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and one of them is a lot bigger than the other one,

1157
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
and so I won't always mistake one to the other.

1158
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah, I can never remember which one's which.

1159
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I'm like, uh, this one?

1160
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
No, this just popped out.

1161
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Okay, this one?

1162
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That could very well be the new slim PlayStation 4's greatest improvement.

1163
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Kaijito in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1164
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I thought the new PlayStation 4 was a bathroom scale.

1165
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I like it.

1166
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah, that's a good, it kind of looks like a bathroom scale.

1167
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Doesn't it keep its angular, like?

1168
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Yeah, it keeps the look a little bit.

1169
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Which is cool.

1170
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It looks like a sandwich.

1171
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You're going to need a bathroom scale after, you know, the George Foreman one.

1172
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1173
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Well, some Microsoft stuff.

1174
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It's kind of sticky.

1175
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Anyway, it has been gathered from a discussion with a few Microsoft people,

1176
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:38,000
namely Phil Spencer, was that they're looking that this might be

1177
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
the last console generation.

1178
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:49,000
That everything's going to be going back to PCs or different units like VR,

1179
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
which I think is kind of bullshit.

1180
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And then they basically were like, no, no, no, that's not it, that's not it.

1181
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,000
But there's a lot of just really interesting things going on there.

1182
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
They're really looking to make sure that the ongoing support for this Project Scorpio thing

1183
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:16,000
is going to be able to incorporate anything that worked on the older systems should work with this.

1184
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Just not vice versa, of course.

1185
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
You know, you can't go backwards.

1186
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And then they also did go in and say that they're not having console exclusives for it.

1187
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That they're all going to be compatible for Xbox One S or Project Scorpio.

1188
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So I don't know.

1189
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Honestly, I haven't cared about the Xbox system since the 360.

1190
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:50,000
They're just really working on trying to close that gap between the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One for right now.

1191
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But Sony is already kind of crushing them, like doubling their sales.

1192
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Yeah, I mean, Microsoft definitely wants a little more of those sales.

1193
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But, you know, they're really trying with the exclusives.

1194
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,000
They are working on that Xbox Play anywhere where they're working on having all the games work on PCs.

1195
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
But that, of course, requires that you run Windows 10.

1196
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And Windows 10 is kind of janky still.

1197
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
See, I'm not the only one that doesn't...

1198
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Windows 10 is fine for me.

1199
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I'm in the hate camp. I don't like it.

1200
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I don't really care for it.

1201
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I hate it less than Windows 8.

1202
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh, I love 8. 8 was so fun.

1203
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The only thing I dislike about 10 is just the forced updates that they do.

1204
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's like, I don't want to update right now.

1205
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Well, I'm sorry, you're going to be updated.

1206
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I don't like it.

1207
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
After having dug through the OS on it, I would rather stick with a more stable operating system, thank you.

1208
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I actually kind of like the whole...

1209
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Especially the way the Xbox One integrates with the whole Xbox app and everything.

1210
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I actually really dig that.

1211
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I'm not going to lie.

1212
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I enjoy Windows 10, personally.

1213
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Keep in mind, I was running 7 before.

1214
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But I guess some people prefer that.

1215
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I loathed 8.

1216
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
All iterations of 8 I think were shit.

1217
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Everybody did except Shane.

1218
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Yeah, I thought 8 was fun. I actually thought it was a nice change of pace.

1219
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And I have found, just with all the things that I do, that honestly, even dealing with Mac OS is a lot more stable than Windows 10.

1220
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
In my experience.

1221
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1222
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And some things that will be coming at you probably around the same time as the new Windows update.

1223
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Loki, starting in the US.

1224
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000

That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000

Attack on Titan coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Vita and Xbox One.

1244
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Champions of Anteria, that's on PC.

1245
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000

1246
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:11,000
God Eater Resurrection on PC and God Eater 2 Rage Burst on PC, PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1247
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Alright, wow. This does seem like a pretty busy week this week.

1248
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I think just a lot of smaller stuff being released, but yeah.

1249
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah, I don't think there's a huge title.

1250
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I didn't realize Attack on Titan was coming out so soon, but in Deus Ex that's pretty interesting too.

1251
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Well, let's travel to Japan. Let's get in a plane right now.

1252
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
We're going to the Olympics four years early. How's that sound, everybody?

1253
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And we'll check out the releases over there this week coming out on the 25th of August on the PlayStation 4.

1254
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Hey, I'm excited for this. I almost want to import this.

1255
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Hatsune Miku Project Diva X HD is out this week on the PlayStation 4.

1256
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
But that was coming out this week, though.

1257
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Oh, it's because it's coming out here as well, right?

1258
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Project Diva X, I just said.

1259
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Is there really a reason for it to be in HD?

1260
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Because it's on PlayStation 3, so it's HD-er.

1261
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, it's more high def-er. So there you go.

1262
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,000
King of Fighters XIV, also out in Japan this week, as well as a fighting stick that will work for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

1263
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
No Man's Sky gets its Japanese release this week, so yes, you guys are getting into Japan as well.

1264
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I'm curious, will they be on the same network as us, or a separate one with their own named planets and stuff?

1265
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
No, they'll be on the same network.

1266
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
If you notice, there's some planets that have Russian names and stuff.

1267
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Oh, interesting.

1268
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I think they'll be on the same one.

1269
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I figured that could have been somebody who speaks a couple languages.

1270
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Or to be honest, it could have not been Russian. It could have just been someone going,

1271
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm pushing random letters!

1272
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You thought it was Russian.

1273
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Alright, and then from Capcom we have this week on PlayStation 4, Sengoku Basara Sanada Yukimura Den comes out this week.

1274
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I am not sure if this is based on an anime or what, but those are the types of characters we're looking at in this game.

1275
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Sengoku Basara, it's not Dynasty Warriors, it's like Dynasty Warriors, it's called...

1276
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
God, I can't remember what the hell it's called over here.

1277
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
It's Capcom's Dynasty Warriors type thing.

1278
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah, I think it is called.

1279
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yeah, I think it's Dynasty Warriors, Capcom's one is.

1280
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
The romance of the Three Kingdoms was Taito, wasn't it?

1281
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It wasn't called Dynasty Warriors, it was...

1282
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I think it is called Sengoku Basara here, actually.

1283
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Maybe I'm thinking of another series. There's one that Capcom has as well.

1284
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah.

1285
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
No, but Sengoku Basara, that is Dynasty Warriors.

1286
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And Bob Coffee in chat kind of collaborates that, saying it is Capcom's take on the Musou genre.

1287
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And then Act F confirms that is what they call it here as well.

1288
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
You can see how much attention I've been paying to all those types of games.

1289
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Although I did download one that was, I think it was like a PlayStation Plus game or something.

1290
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Messed around with that for a little bit.

1291
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Let's see, going to the PlayStation 3.

1292
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
That same Sengoku Basara game is out on the PlayStation 3 as well.

1293
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And that is really it in Japan this week on the PlayStation 3.

1294
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Quickly looking at the Vita and the 3DS, though, for the handheld world.

1295
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,000
On the Vita, Pyuramai Wars V, as well as Moju Tachi To Ohime-sama,

1296
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.

1297
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So you have that to look forward to.

1298
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And lastly on the 3DS this week, Metroid Prime Federation Force gets its Japanese release.

1299
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And Armed Blue Gunvolt Striker pack, which I think is like a two-in-one type of game set, is out.

1300
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Because that is a game, but it looks like it's got like two sides to it.

1301
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
That is out in Japan as well this week.

1302
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I was thinking of Devil Kings is what I think they call it over here.

1303
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
There was one on the Wii as well.

1304
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And I can't remember what that one was.

1305
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Samurai Heroes looks like.

1306
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, that was number three.

1307
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
That's a samurai, yeah, I thought it was Samurai Heroes.

1308
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Okay, that's what it is.

1309
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And AkumaGP actually confirms, he's in Japan, so he knows a little bit about Japanese.

1310
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Basara means slash.

1311
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And that's what you do in those games, a lot of slash.

1312
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And mash, what's the name for, or what's the Japanese word for mash?

1313
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
That's what you do is you button mash in those games over and over again.

1314
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Bayonetta.

1315
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

1316
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
On the 23rd we have Tempest for Mac and PC.

1317
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Deus Ex Mankind Divided for PS4, PC, and X-Bone.

1318
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And then on the 25th we have Assault Squad 2 Men of War Origins.

1319
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Why's it gotta be men?

1320
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
There's also, well, if no one gives a shit, there's a Madden game, whatever.

1321
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Madden NFL 17, whoopty shit.

1322
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
N++ for PC, the other 99 for PC.

1323
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
On the 26th we have Attack on Titan, yay!

1324
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And King of Fighters XIV.

1325
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So is N++ just really N plus one?

1326
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
No, it's like C++.

1327
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That's a programming joke there.

1328
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I know, right?

1329
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I see what you did there.

1330
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

1331
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But first, Loki.

1332
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Alright, so Project Scorpio, there's been a lot of confusion with their messaging, I guess I would say, with that.

1333
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
So, you know, out of E3, you know, they were saying,

1334
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:28,000
oh hey, Project Scorpio is not gonna have any exclusive games, it's just gonna play the games that are already out there,

1335
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
slightly better, and in 4K and stuff.

1336
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Well now they've kind of backpedaled out of that saying, well, it's not gonna have console exclusive games, Project Scorpio,

1337
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
but we consider the VR experience almost like a separate console, so yeah, it'll have those.

1338
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
So basically, yes, it will be getting, you know, VR games that are exclusive to it,

1339
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but they're not really considering that the same as Xbox One games.

1340
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Which, to be honest, that is fucking confusing, but whatever.

1341
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I guess if you only launch your VR platform for Project Scorpio, that makes it pretty, you know, that makes sense, I guess.

1342
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I'm worried about all this VR, it's just so spread out.

1343
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah, I'm with you, I mean, cause like, you have these companies just saying one thing,

1344
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and they're like, oh well, it's a technicality, we just didn't consider that the same platform, ha ha ha.

1345
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:30,000
You know, it's, I don't know. I don't want to be doing this close to the launch of that VR platform.

1346
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I do want to get it just at the very least so that I can play games on the second screen without having to pull my wife away from Grey's Anatomy on the TV.

1347
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I actually forgot I had my Playstation TV, so I'm actually thinking about hooking that up now to my USB,

1348
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
You're still trying to convince Dan to buy one?

1349
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Or my USB HD screen I have, so we'll see if I can do that.

1350
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I don't have one, I kind of want one.

1351
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Rob, lend me one of your Vita's.

1352
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yeah, I guess, if you really want one.

1353
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Cause I'm gonna start Ultra Despair Girls.

1354
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Alright, sure, why not?

1355
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I own a game for a system I don't have.

1356
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
You kind of have to after this week's Future Arc for Danganronpa.

1357
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Yeah, I saw what happened. I need to finish, I need to play through Ultra Despair Girls.

1358
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about Overwatch, which is, I don't know, a game that would probably make me very sick in VR.

1359
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
But it's something you play on PC or Playstation or Xbox One right now.

1360
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And the Public Test Realm got an update.

1361
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
There's some balancing patches and so forth going on, they're prepping for Season 2.

1362
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
But another awesome thing that they're doing in this Overwatch patch is they are trolling trolls.

1363
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So sometimes at the end of the match, people will type GG EZ at the end of the match.

1364
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Which means Good Game, Easy.

1365
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Which is a very like kind of, it's kind of a like crappy thing to say to your opponent because you're basically saying you suck.

1366
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Good game cause you were easy to steamroll type of thing, right?

1367
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So it's a very condescending thing to say at the end of the match.

1368
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Well now what Blizzard did is whenever you type GG EZ, it gets auto filtered when you press enter.

1369
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,000
To say things like, come on mom, one more game before you tuck me in, oops miss tell.

1370
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Or, I'm trying to be a nicer person, it's hard but I'm trying guys.

1371
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Or, I'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life, but thank you all for playing with me.

1372
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That's fucking awesome.

1373
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
So Blizzard is trolling trolls, I would be surprised if this actually makes the final release.

1374
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I think it should, I think that's fantastic.

1375
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I love it, it's great.

1376
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I wish they would add that to more games.

1377
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
They do some things though, cause Blizzard even has these.

1378
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Your battle net count has been banned, please consult your registered email for details.

1379
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I think that one might be a bit much, they need to get rid of the ones that look like fake ban messages.

1380
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But I love the ones that, mommy says people my age shouldn't suck their thumbs.

1381
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I think some of these other ones will definitely, aw shucks you guys are the best.

1382
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
That one's funny, it's gonna be great.

1383
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Interesting other change in Overwatch too, because you know they have limited time cosmetic gear.

1384
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
They have a summer games event, don't say Olympics, but it's Olympics.

1385
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
They have a summer games event going on right now where you can get limited time cosmetic things.

1386
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And some people are buying loot boxes because they want to get that cosmetic gear.

1387
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Well, the old verbiage for buying loot said, loot boxes have a chance to contain credits you can use to acquire any specific cosmetics you want.

1388
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And a lot of people commented with Blizzard, well with the summer games stuff being limited time,

1389
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,000
we're not really gonna be able to get anything we want if we don't get the summer games stuff we want during this event.

1390
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So Blizzard actually changed it this week to say, loot boxes have a chance to contain credits that you can use to acquire many customization options.

1391
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,000
As opposed to anything you want. So these cosmetics are going away after the summer games.

1392
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So you better buy them right now, because that's what they want, ching ching.

1393
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Going going gone, get them now. I could give a shit about loot boxes.

1394
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I mean they're okay and exciting to get when you level up, but I'm not dropping money on them. Sorry about it.

1395
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I don't think I ever bought the Mass Effect multiplayer stuff either. I'm trying to think if I ever did. I don't think I ever did.

1396
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Speaking of which, let's go on a little side tangent here real fast.

1397
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Oh fuck, what?

1398
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
No, it's not bad. I just wanted to...

1399
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So the Wii U version of Minecraft apparently had the DLC stuff from like the Xbox version Minecraft and stuff.

1400
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And that includes all like the Skyrim level, the Mass Effect level, and all that stuff.

1401
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And I was unaware of that. I thought you had to pay for that DLC and stuff.

1402
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So my son's playing and he's like, yeah I picked one of these skins and there was like this weird hand thing.

1403
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
And like I was trying to get up to the spaceship and stuff.

1404
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And I'm like, you're talking about, that was the Mass Effect level that you played.

1405
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And he's like, oh yeah.

1406
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I see, I see.

1407
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
He had lots of questions about Mass Effect because he's like, what is that?

1408
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Well I hope you educated him properly or Uncle Rob's gonna have to come over to set him straight.

1409
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Well I didn't know, like I couldn't answer some of his questions.

1410
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Like, what's the creeper in that? I'm like, I don't know.

1411
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I don't know what the creeper is in the Mass Effect skin one.

1412
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Something that's still a creeper?

1413
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I don't know what a turian is.

1414
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Isn't that like a level in Metroid? No, that's Torian.

1415
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Isn't that like a, it's a 16-bit side scroller shooter game? No, that's Turrican, I'm sorry.

1416
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Isn't it that lady monster in Undertale? No, that's Toriel.

1417
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
What's a turian? We'll ask Aunt Jamie to come over because she's in love with one.

1418
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Alright.

1419
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Maybe she can read some fanfic before bed. Alright, I'm teasing.

1420
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1421
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Let's go back into a time when Minecraft didn't even exist, believe it or not.

1422
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:12,000
A much simpler time where Dark Soccer's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, listen here.

1423
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Put down your freakin' Minecraft. That game is garbage. Play this instead.

1424
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week? Ten years or older.

1425
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Zaxxon. Zaxxon.

1426
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Came out in 1982. This is like almost 35 years. It's older than me. Yeah, right?

1427
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Developed and released by Sega.

1428
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I like how you, right when you said that, the little laser sound effects when the arcade came on.

1429
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I think they tried remaking this, but let's find out.

1430
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It was Zaxxon's Mother Base 2000 sequel. Anyway, it's an isometric shooter game, like I said, by Sega.

1431
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:03,000
There are sources out there that say that the electrics company, Ikegami Tsushinki, I'm gonna mispronounce this.

1432
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Tsushinki worked on the development of it too. It is a game that lets you basically fly a craft through a fortress while shooting things down.

1433
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Just a fun little shooter, but it was really innovative for its time.

1434
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:30,000
It was the first game to use axonometric projection, which basically was what led to the name the axon to Zaxxon.

1435
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Basically, it really is just isometric projection. It simulated a three-dimensional third-person viewpoint and had an altimeter so you could see how high or low that you were.

1436
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It had all kinds of different things going on for it, and on top of that, it was the first arcade game to be advertised on TV.

1437
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Paramount Pictures produced the commercial.

1438
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:10,000
It also has a high score set by somebody in Hawaii, according to Twin Galaxies, and it had its own bootleg named Jackson in 1982.

1439
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:25,000
As far as other versions of it that have come out, we have an MS-DOS version, Amiga 1000, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Atari 2600, 5200, which I have,

1440
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:36,000
MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, ColecoVision, which I have that too, Intellivision, I think I have that one too, Sega SG-1000, and a TRS-80 colored computer.

1441
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That was actually the first home console I played Zaxxon on.

1442
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Today I learned that there is a boss at the end of the levels at Zaxxon, because apparently I never passed the first level, right?

1443
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I was like, hey, there's a boss there.

1444
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
The Atari 2600 and Intellivision versions were different because they used a third person behind the ship perspective instead of the isometric version.

1445
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And the ColecoVision version was the first home version that used the isometric graphics.

1446
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Also, Coleco in 1983 did a tabletop version of Zaxxon with a double panel VFD screen, and Bondi released two Zaxxon handhelds,

1447
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:28,000
and a VFD tabletop for the European and Japanese market, and an LCD card game that was sold worldwide.

1448
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:36,000
It's also 2006, Zaxxon was a bonus on the Sega Genesis collection for PS2 and PSP.

1449
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
The original Zaxxon is included on PS2, and Super Zaxxon is on the PSP.

1450
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Zaxxon is also an unlockable arcade game in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

1451
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:55,000
And it was released on Wii Virtual Console in Japan, Europe, and North America.

1452
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
There are clones, of course.

1453
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,000
For the TI-99 4A, it came out as Arcturus.

1454
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
On the Amstrad CPC, it was Zax.

1455
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
BBC Micro is Fortress.

1456
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And the TRS-80 Color Computer is Zaxxon.

1457
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:22,000
There's also Hostile All Terrain Encounter, also known as HATE, which was a clone made by Vortex Software for 8-bit and 16-bit computers and published by Gremlin Graphics.

1458
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Zaxxon was really, it was one of those games that actually was really good for Colecovision,

1459
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:40,000
because it kind of put it on the map as having the, as close to arcade perfect version of Zaxxon as you could get at home.

1460
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:48,000
And then, it was just really a game changer, literally a game changer, because it was the first of its kind.

1461
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:57,000
And so, as far as other ones, its arcade sequel was Super Zaxxon, where it had a different color theme and a faster ship, making it more difficult.

1462
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And the robot at the end of the second fortress was replaced by a dragon. It didn't do so good.

1463
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Milton Bradley made a Zaxxon board game. 1987 led to Zaxxon 3D for the Sega Master System that used 3D glasses.

1464
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Have you guys ever played that one?

1465
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
No, I have not.

1466
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It's headache-inducing.

1467
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yeah.

1468
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
And it was forward scrolling rather than being isometric.

1469
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And then, Zaxxon's Mother Base 2000 for the Sega 32X in 1995.

1470
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And it was the first Zaxxon game that had polygon graphics.

1471
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And, however, it was only Zaxxon in the U.S. The Japanese version was called Para Squad, and the European version was called Mother Base.

1472
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And people in the U.S. were like, it's not Zaxxon enough. Why do you call it Zaxxon?

1473
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Also, Zaxxon was shown at the Art of Video Games exhibition at the Smithsonian Institute.

1474
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:59,000
There's also a direct sequel, Zaxxon Escape, that came out October 4, 2012 on Apple and Android devices, but it's not very Zaxxon-y.

1475
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Also, a home version of Zaxxon was featured in the music video for Blue Monday by New Order.

1476
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1477
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Yep.

1478
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It's awesome.

1479
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
And it's been in Friday the 13th, the final chapter, where one of the characters is playing Zaxxon.

1480
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Is that character Jason? Because that would be awesome.

1481
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
No.

1482
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But he was like, oh, wait, I'm going to kill you, except I have to stop and play some Zaxxon right now.

1483
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Then I would murder the machine, because this game was hard as hell.

1484
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I have played the original arcade machine. Of course, I played the Commodore 64 version.

1485
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But I am like Alan Alchemy in chat at live.bognetwork.com.

1486
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I hated it because my depth perception did not like the game. I didn't hate it, but I was just terrible at it, and I had the same problem.

1487
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:52,000
You have to keep firing. You have to keep firing, because it's the only way to find the holes in the wall and the right level to be at for all that stuff.

1488
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And there's an NPR podcast called Pop Culture Happy Hour that has what's called the Zaxxon rule, where people are forbidden to bring up topics that are unrelatable to the audience.

1489
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
We break that all the fucking time.

1490
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Oops.

1491
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
For other similar games, there's Future Spy by Sega in 1984. It uses the same hardware as Zaxxon.

1492
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:21,000
But it's a military theme and viewpoint by Sammy for the Neo Geo that has the same perspective and similar gameplay to Zaxxon.

1493
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
So, that's your game.

1494
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1495
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

1496
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Yeah, that's all you can really hear in this little video, because you have to keep shooting.

1497
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
That's the only way to find exactly where the holes in the wall are and all this stuff.

1498
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Anyway, as noisy as that game is, that is definitely a classic if I've ever heard one. I love Zaxxon.

1499
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I can't believe some podcast made a rule banning it. How dare they? How very dare they?

1500
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It was that you can't bring up anything that the audience won't get.

1501
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I see.

1502
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Like our digression into everything.

1503
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Oh, well, we can do that. You know why? Because it's our show and not yours.

1504
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
But you know what? Just because they don't get it at first doesn't mean they won't get it later on.

1505
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
That's right.

1506
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
How else are they supposed to get anything?

1507
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,000
We try our best to explain the end jokes. That's why I explained what pop music was for the 15th time this week.

1508
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So, you know, we'll do our best. Anyway, Zaxxon, check it out on a classic system.

1509
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Because, as Jamie mentioned, it was on literally everything in the 80s. So check it out.

1510
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
All right. We're going to take a break, though. We got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news, some e-mails this week.

1511
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:31,000
The FUs of the Week and our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1512
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode 655 for August the 21st of 2016 and our show already in progress.

1513
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Talking a little bit about a little adventure we took, or I took, to Pokémon Worlds on Saturday.

1514
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
No, sadly, didn't get to go watch the event because it was still closed off to the public.

1515
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:07,000
But did get to go shopping, at least a little bit, and then got subjected to listening to a lot of the commentary while Shane was playing it on our car ride.

1516
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Shane did leave, though. He was here in studio joining us for the first half of the show.

1517
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But he decided there was something better to do, so he left, as sometimes happens.

1518
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news with some rapid fire news right now. Loki.

1519
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
All right. Let's do this. So talk about Call of Duty. Yes, Call of Duty.

1520
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
They've been doing a lot of different iterations on zombies. This time it's going to be a little bit different.

1521
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,000
It's kind of in the 80s, you know, because everybody likes throwing back to the 80s.

1522
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So now you take place in zombies in Spaceland, which is almost like a Disneyland type place.

1523
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And then, of course, they've got, you know, a celebrity cast of people playing the actual characters.

1524
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So we've got Seth Green, Ike Barenholtz, and J. Farrow, and Sasheer Zamata.

1525
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:04,000
But on top of that, there's also two other people that are having major roles in it.

1526
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Paul Reubens is going to be playing, like, this washed up film director that has made a deal with the devil.

1527
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:18,000
So he's kind of the villain in there. And you're going to have a DJ played by none other than David Hasselhoff.

1528
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Sounds pretty awesome. This just sounds, I guess they just want to indulge it so bad it's good type of thing.

1529
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:34,000
They've done a lot of, like, really big celebrity things. Like, I remember one year they had, oh God, who do they have?

1530
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,000
They've had a lot of big celebrities in this before.

1531
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Kevin Spacey.

1532
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
No, not talking about, like, in the main game. I'm talking about the actual zombie stuff.

1533
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,000
So they've had, like, a lot of big celebrities in there as well in the different zombie iterations.

1534
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
But it looks fun. Definitely neat. I mean, a lot of people like the zombie stuff.

1535
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So we're checking out, especially Paul Reubens. So, I'm down.

1536
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Now this is kind of cool. So Microsoft, you remember one of the things that they were doing is this Xbox game preview.

1537
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And now that was more online of, like, an early access type program. Something similar to, you know, what they do on Steam and other places.

1538
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
So now they're going to be bringing that Xbox game preview to Windows 10.

1539
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So those titles that are going to be on Windows 10 will, you know, could be possibly part of that program.

1540
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So one of the games that's going to be on there is Rockfish Games' Everspace.

1541
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
It's going to be the first title as part of that Xbox games preview program.

1542
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:40,000
It basically lets you buy, you know, of course the titles that are in progress and not finished yet.

1543
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Which is all of them, if you really think about it.

1544
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Very cool. Let's talk about Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10.

1545
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Because, you know, they don't exist on PlayStation 4.

1546
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yeah, I bought those on Xbox 360 and I have never played them.

1547
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And they're not backwards compatible, so you won't be able to play them on Xbox 360.

1548
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
That's alright, I have an Xbox 360.

1549
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
And PlayStation 4 doesn't play PlayStation 3 games, so there, you know, isn't a way to play them on current consoles.

1550
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So, yeah, they're not really around.

1551
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So, apparently though, speaking to the creator, or excuse me, the co-developers, obviously, you know, Capcom is huge behind this.

1552
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:25,000
But the co-developer of both those games, 9 and 10, Inti Creates, a website called Rockman Corner, which obviously is dedicated to Mega Man stuff,

1553
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
actually asked about, hey, would Mega Man 9 or 10 actually come out on current platforms?

1554
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And Inti Creates said they are open to the idea, but Capcom ultimately does have the say and has to let that happen.

1555
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
So, you know, they're saying make some noise, basically, let Capcom know it's something you're interested in.

1556
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And hopefully, Mega Man 9 and 10 can get a release for this generation, or at least the backwards compatibility thing you would think would be something they could get on.

1557
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I don't know.

1558
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Anyway, speaking of like the Steam Early Access stuff, or in this case, actual Steam Early Access, I think this is interesting because the company that's doing this is Game Freak.

1559
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
You know, they make a little game called Pokemon that some people are really into.

1560
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah, they have a Steam Early Access game that they've just released.

1561
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It's called Giga Wrecker.

1562
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
It's going to launch in January of next year.

1563
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
That's when the full version launches, but the Early Access is up now.

1564
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You can buy the current version that's about an hour and a half for $15.

1565
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Don't expect a Pokemon-style game, especially if you look at the trailer for this.

1566
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It looks more like a Metroidvania type.

1567
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I know that word is overused in gaming, but that's really what it looks like, where I guess you actually reconstruct debris and scraps into weapons and things that you use.

1568
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
So it's almost like her weapon is like this Katamari ball that gets bigger and bigger, but she fires it out of her hand.

1569
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It's not like an actual Katamari she rolls around.

1570
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Although, no, I kind of want that game.

1571
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Oh well.

1572
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So this game does look interesting, but it's very different.

1573
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
If I told you the people who made Pokemon made this game, you'd be like, what?

1574
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
So it's just interesting that it's on the Steam Early Access.

1575
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:04,000
What about an Attack on Titan type game where you're just ordinary citizens fighting off the prince and rolling his giant countryside Katamari?

1576
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It's kind of like a reversal type of thing.

1577
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Yeah, exactly. It's like, you know, no, you're not going to roll per planet into the star.

1578
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
That's like the video game where the goal is to kidnap the princess.

1579
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Is there a video game out there that you actually play as the bad guy trying to kidnap the princess?

1580
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Oh, I like that.

1581
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Does that not exist?

1582
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Is there a game out there that, well, Bobby Blackwell says Braid. That's the twist.

1583
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Spoiler.

1584
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
You know what I want?

1585
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Is there any game where the princess breaks herself out?

1586
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Well, I just-

1587
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And says, fuck you. I don't need a man to save me.

1588
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But I just kind of like spinning the trope around and having you be the bad guy, you know, in your total stereotypical game, you know, from the 80s type of thing.

1589
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You just need to be the princess who busts out by herself and kicks the shit out of the bad guy.

1590
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Fat Princess was the plot for the whole, but Bond's 006's Fat Princess got boring.

1591
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
So, I'm just thinking like a straight up Mario game where you're Bowser.

1592
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Does that not exist?

1593
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I guess that seems like such a stupid simple concept.

1594
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Really? Nobody's thought of that?

1595
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I get that it was a plot twist in Braid. I'm talking just like a straight up platformer type of game.

1596
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
That's weird.

1597
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Alright.

1598
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Raginator says, there's a Where's Waldo book where Waldo finds himself.

1599
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Bob Coffee in chat says, that princess game with the princess kicking ass needs to be made by Platinum Games.

1600
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Well, there was Super Princess Peach, but that was not really the same way.

1601
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
That's not quite what I'm looking for.

1602
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Where she had a power of her emotions too.

1603
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Yeah, that's not really what I'm looking for.

1604
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Alright, moving on. Some other rapid fire stories. Dark Sakura.

1605
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Pokemon Snap is on Wii U Virtual Console coming out in the UK as announced by Nintendo of UK.

1606
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And it is seriously one of the best games in the entire Pokemon franchise.

1607
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It would only be worth it if they actually, you know, did motion controls with that game tablet.

1608
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Hey, you want an excuse for that tablet? There's a perfect one right there.

1609
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But how much you want to bet they're not going to do jack dilly squat with that thing?

1610
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
They're just going to basically port it over and you have to use the analog stick still.

1611
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And in other news, another Metroid 2 remake actually has an update even though Nintendo gave them a C&D.

1612
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:44,000
They have it out there that fixes issues with the gravity suit not being rendered, translation issues, and transportation pipe to the final area.

1613
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,000
You can actually edit the English.ini file to help with the translation efforts.

1614
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Dan's save file deleted itself when he was at the end of the game.

1615
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Oh no.

1616
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
So he just watched it finished up on YouTube.

1617
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:22,000
He's like, I'm not going to do that again. He was showing me the like all because they put in some of the tricks like, you know, in Metroid Fusion how you had a trick to basically dash all the way through the shine spark through the whole level until you get to this one hidden room.

1618
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Well, a room you're not supposed to access yet, but you actually get a little hint about what's being done to you in the game.

1619
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So it's kind of interesting.

1620
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
By the way, I see some folks in chat, you know, kind of going, oh, snap, I love Pokemon snap.

1621
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I wish it was coming out for Wii U and so forth.

1622
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I think I might be wrong, but I feel like I think it's on Wii Virtual Console, which you can access.

1623
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Remember, your Wii U is a Wii and you can get into the Wii and do the Wii shopping.

1624
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Because I'm almost positive I do have Pokemon Snap on my Wii U, but it's through the backwards compatibility thing where you have to actually go into Wii mode and get the game from there.

1625
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I'm going to disagree with Act Deft that Pokemon Go, but he says Pokemon Go is the new Pokemon Snap.

1626
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:15,000
No, because the fun with Pokemon Snap is that you work to unlock events in the game and take those special pictures that were triggered by doing all the little tricks in the game right.

1627
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Like getting Lapras to show up or, you know, having different, you know, Pokemon peek out of different things.

1628
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I would say Pokemon Go feels more inspired by Snap than the mainline series, but yeah, they're absolutely different games.

1629
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I'm surprised they haven't made another Pokemon Snap game.

1630
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That would be just stupid easy.

1631
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It's just like, oh, look, I found a Pikachu. Let me change it to AR mode and he's on my cereal.

1632
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:47,000
It seems like the obvious cell phone game to make, but then again, not that I need to tell the Pokemon company how to make mobile phone games because they're doing OK.

1633
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Or the ultimate VR game to make.

1634
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
You know, why not?

1635
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Not VR. No.

1636
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:04,000
If they wanted to go that route, but I would like to see maybe the rez approach where it's both.

1637
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Right. I mean, it doesn't have to be, but like, or at least, you know, you can use your phone just to kind of move it around and stuff like you're taking a picture.

1638
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
If it was going to be like on the Wii U or something, I'd want it to be the U.

1639
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And this is where I would want like a motion control in the tablet that you can move it around.

1640
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:29,000
And that was your window into it, but not like a VR headset. That's awful.

1641
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I'm with it being an option, but I also understand that we don't necessarily need to shoehorn everything into VR.

1642
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
VR can come up with its own experiences.

1643
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:45,000
All right. Let's see. Moving on. Let's talk about Mass Effect Andromeda, shall we?

1644
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Sadly, I don't have a lot of new information because there wasn't anything at Gamescom, but they said it wasn't going to be there.

1645
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
So that's not news that it's not there. What's that?

1646
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
We forgot to talk about something.

1647
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Oh, what's that? I'm sorry to hear something.

1648
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
They're going to talk about a very important event.

1649
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I totally did skip something. Yes. We need to talk about this in the news.

1650
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I mean, the story of the century of how a company that was so on top and faltered so poorly is coming back to regain your trust by bringing back one of the most beloved franchises of all time.

1651
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
This is way more important than some silly Mass Effect game.

1652
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Yes, this is seriously. But guess what? Metal Gear is back. That's right. Metal Gear is back. Don't worry that Kojima is not there. It's fine. Trust us. It'll be good.

1653
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Metal Gear Survive. Now, you're thinking, how the hell are they going to make another Metal Gear game? That's just weird.

1654
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I get it. It's because Konami is surviving all this mean people on the internet that are just saying these things that just have no basis.

1655
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
But Konami and their series, they are surviving through all of that. Am I right, Loki?

1656
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:16,000
They're right. So, what exactly is Metal Gear Survive? Well, it follows... Well, not Snake. Because Snake isn't in here, unfortunately. Or Big Boss. I'm sorry.

1657
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
He's done. He's done.

1658
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
No, no, no. That's not important. We can start another character. It'll be fine.

1659
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Fuck him.

1660
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
It's fine. You know what? He's done. He's done. Whatever. He's yesterday's news.

1661
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Hater's too expensive. Kiefer Sutherland's too expensive. Forget them.

1662
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
It's basically following the...

1663
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Loki, the players don't want Snake anymore.

1664
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
They don't. They don't.

1665
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
The players have told us they are sick of Solid Snake.

1666
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So, did you hear about them going to be doing Mass Effect HD re-releases later? That's better news.

1667
01:50:50,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So anyways, this game takes place at the end of Ground Zeroes, where apparently, you know, it's not... there's some just soldiers.

1668
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Not really saying who. Just soldiers. You know, left at Mother Base that were attacked at the end of Ground Zeroes.

1669
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And they get sucked through a wormhole to an alternate dimension. Wow, that sounds really different.

1670
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Oh, with zombies. And they're unicorn zombies. They're zombiecorns, if you will, because they have stupid crystals sticking out of their fucking heads. Zombiecorns.

1671
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
But I love unicorns, and I love zombies. This is the perfect way to experience home.

1672
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:34,000
So yes, it's basically a four-player co-op stealth action game with zombies in it that has none of the mainline Metal Gear Solid people.

1673
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But why is it a Metal Gear game, you may ask? Well, I'm glad you asked that question. Because there is a Metal Gear in there.

1674
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
And that's literally the only fucking thing that ties this to Metal Gear in any fucking way.

1675
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Well, that, and if they put the Metal Gear name on it... Well, that is true. That is true.

1676
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:56,000
And as you can imagine, people are so fucking excited.

1677
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:02,000
To be fair, okay, to be fair, if they named the game Zombiecorns...

1678
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I would play Zombiecorns. Right? Like, why not just call it Zombiecorns?

1679
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:17,000
And everybody would sit here and go, Konami got so fucking high, you guys. This is great. This is the future.

1680
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:24,000
If Konami's just going to embrace themselves as the shit show they're becoming, let's just fucking roll around in it like a pig in poop.

1681
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
This is great. Zombiecorns for the win.

1682
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
If you're just looking to piss off the fans, which obviously that seems to be the angle that you're going with in this,

1683
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:40,000
how about I just recommend a new title change for it? We'll just call it Metal Gear Silent Hills.

1684
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Survive. With Zombiecorns or something like that. I don't know. Just piss off everybody at the same time.

1685
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Because people obviously hate this. There's a 6.5 to 1 dislike ratio on the trailer that was posted.

1686
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Of course there, a representative from Konami is basically saying, hey, this is going to be not a full price game.

1687
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Just letting you know.

1688
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Why did Jamie say this in chat and not on a microphone?

1689
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Because look, he was talking.

1690
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
The truck have started to move-icorns.

1691
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:15,000
It was actually a response to IkumaJP. Just put a cardboard box on it. Equals MGS.

1692
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Beautiful.

1693
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I don't know what to say. I just know when I saw the trailer, I was like, God, that looks fucking terrible.

1694
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Okay, here's the trailer. If you know nothing about the game, it's shooting zombies through a chain link fence simulator.

1695
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Because there was no actual threat of zombies attacking them. They were on the other side of the fence going rrrr trying to get through it.

1696
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And they were shooting them through a fence. That was the whole fucking trailer.

1697
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
That's it. It looked fucking terrible.

1698
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Maybe Konami should apply for a name change. They should just become HFM Games for hot fucking mess games.

1699
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Just embrace. Embrace the bad, Konami. Just embrace it.

1700
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:02,000
They're just... I guess they're trying to make money. Good for them, I guess.

1701
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:09,000
But, I mean, shit man. This is just like fucking... This is a rock revolution all over again.

1702
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It's like they don't know what makes their own fucking franchises good. And they're just gonna release it.

1703
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Let's start a petition.

1704
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
People like zombies.

1705
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Called, Dear Konami, Could You Please Not?

1706
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Just go to change.org with the petition. The undersigned would like to tell Konami the following, Could You Please Not?

1707
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
So, does this game have like...

1708
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I literally can't even. I need you to not.

1709
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,000
So does it have like Raiden in it? No. Does it have Solid Snake? No.

1710
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It has his windy cousin, Fujin.

1711
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Revolver Ocelot? No. It has Soldier. Soldier 2.

1712
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Wasn't Soldier in Final Fantasy 8?

1713
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Well, surely... No, that was, um, 7 had Soldier.

1714
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Surely... 8 with seed.

1715
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
We are just the cynical, rude gamers out there on the internet, and the internet as a whole has embraced this.

1716
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And Konami has come out to kiss their adoring fans, correct?

1717
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,000
No. No? What do you mean? What do you mean the internet hasn't embraced Zombicorns?

1718
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
No, they hate it. Absolutely hate it. No one likes it. It looks stupid.

1719
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Has Konami said anything about it?

1720
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
They just said, hey, yeah, it's not going to be a full-price game.

1721
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
But there is going to be this co-op play and stealth and a variety of weapons and devices.

1722
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And... yeah.

1723
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Alright, well, you know...

1724
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Making the petition right now.

1725
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Are you making a change.org petition?

1726
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Because you know that's the most effective place to do things, is change.org.

1727
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
So, I like the quote here. Let's just quote him.

1728
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So, as you can see from the trailer, Survive is set after the events of Ground Zeroes.

1729
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,000
The Mother Base that has been built up during Peace Walker's storyline gets sabotaged from within and destroyed.

1730
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And it all collapses into the sea. And Boston Miller manages to escape.

1731
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
But at least...

1732
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And they go off and have a few adventures, which obviously we all know of in The Phantom Pains.

1733
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Unfortunately, not all Mother Base staff gets off alive, and some of them are stranded.

1734
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And it's about what happens to them, basically.

1735
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Well, I even don't want to really talk about this anymore in light of Zombicorns.

1736
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
But I should finish my thoughts that I was starting on Mass Effect a little bit ago, which did not show up at Gamescom.

1737
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
And of course, this is because EA is focusing on the holiday slate.

1738
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And I believe they've even said, more information on Andromeda on N7 Day.

1739
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I think that's the next day we're going to get some information, which is, of course, November 7th.

1740
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
So, there'll be more on Mass Effect at that time.

1741
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:48,000
But also, what I thought was interesting is that in that same interview, which the interview was with EA Studios boss, Patrick Soderlund,

1742
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:55,000
actually said that maybe they're changing their mind on a Mass Effect trilogy remaster.

1743
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
He has said that the market has demonstrated demand for remasters in the interim.

1744
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Although, that doesn't mean we're necessarily getting one, and I don't even think we would necessarily get that this year.

1745
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
It's no longer off the table.

1746
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Although, how fast would they have to put that together in order to beat Andromeda out or get it out for the holiday?

1747
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I mean, I suppose they could announce maybe like a download only thing.

1748
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:26,000
They could announce it on N7 Day, but I wouldn't expect it to be very fully featured or fully remastered if that's the case.

1749
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
But we'll see. We'll see.

1750
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Regardless, no news on Andromeda at Gamescom, but that's going to come a little later in the year.

1751
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
All right, Dark Soccer.

1752
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Wait.

1753
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
What?

1754
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Do I have one? Oh, yeah, I do. But I have something else to add.

1755
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
What's that?

1756
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
That at Gamescom, they did say it was likely for a remaster of the Silent Hill.

1757
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I'm trying to write this stupid petition.

1758
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Yeah.

1759
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Of the Mass Effect games.

1760
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yeah, I'd mention that.

1761
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Okay, I was trying to make the thing.

1762
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I know you're busy working on change.org. It's fine.

1763
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I know.

1764
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So the final update came out for Fez. Final update.

1765
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And it's pretty crazy, actually. It's for Mac and PC.

1766
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
And some of the areas have been described as Virtual Boy Red and Black.

1767
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
There is new aspects of the soundtrack.

1768
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And it is pretty, pretty big.

1769
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:33,000
It has switched to FNA slash SDL2 from Monogame.

1770
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,000
It has basically switched music decoders.

1771
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Music is in RAM instead of streamed.

1772
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
All kinds of stuff.

1773
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Different game controller mapping.

1774
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Native support for any refresh rate.

1775
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Full aspect pixel perfect or super sampling from nearest multiple of 720p.

1776
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
So full scale options.

1777
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
And no more letterboxing or pillarboxing.

1778
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
All kinds of different stuff.

1779
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:12,000
There's speedrun mode by typing in dash dash gada dash gomez dash fast.

1780
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I like that.

1781
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
All kinds of stuff added to it.

1782
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Clouds fading.

1783
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Just different kinds of things thrown in there.

1784
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
And a lot of bug fixes.

1785
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Well, that's a cool little update for a game that's several years old at this point.

1786
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And I'm looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and Bobby Blackwolf is kind of clarifying.

1787
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Because he says, note that Phil Fish had nothing to do with this update.

1788
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
And that did surprise me when I heard that this game got an update.

1789
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I was like, I kind of thought Phil Fish was kind of like done.

1790
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,000
But he goes on to say, this was the programmer who now works for a AAA developer.

1791
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Some of this was porting the Linux version to the Mac and the PC.

1792
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
And yeah, so that's what surprised me about this game getting an update.

1793
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Is I thought Phil Fish was kind of like done with games.

1794
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Because he got caught up in a lot of that ugliness that happened last year.

1795
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
And so I kind of think he went on a siesta.

1796
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Or maybe, you know, if he is working on a game, he's probably not telling anybody about it.

1797
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Which, you know, I would completely understand.

1798
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
So we'll see.

1799
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
But as far as Fez goes, that's still cool that at least this game was able to get another update.

1800
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
And it sounds like there's just a lot more in the bug fixes from what Jamie's mentioning there.

1801
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Some little graphical updates and things like that. So that's cool.

1802
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And Bobby Blackwolf says, it was a couple years ago, it was 2013.

1803
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Oh good lord, was it? I guess it was. Oh boy, oh boy.

1804
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Alright. Yeah, we're not getting any younger.

1805
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

1806
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Alright, so there's yet another Skylanders game coming out this year.

1807
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:45,000
The new gimmick of this game is going to be that you get to create your own Skylanders.

1808
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
And while that sounds pretty cool, there's some caveats with that.

1809
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So first off, when you start the game, you pick one of ten different classes that you want to play as.

1810
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
And when you do that, you basically have this item that's a crystal that it gets locked into.

1811
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
And so those crystals can only have one element each.

1812
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
So you have to buy more of them if you want to play as the other classes in the game.

1813
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
And each of those crystals costs $10.

1814
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And then on top of that, if you want to get the full use out of it, you have to buy one of the senseis for the actual class.

1815
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Which costs $15 as well for each one of those.

1816
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:34,000
And then that unlocks another level cap and also it adds a unique talent for each character.

1817
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So they want to have you purchase all these different things.

1818
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:47,000
On top of that, I guess they're basically saying that if you accidentally duplicate a class,

1819
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:53,000
say you wanted to choose a different one and you picked the wrong one, nope, you're stuck with that class again.

1820
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
So you have to yet purchase another crystal.

1821
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:01,000
So basically they're charging you up the ass for all this shit that really they shouldn't be.

1822
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
But it's kind of Activision, you know, you think about it.

1823
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I kind of thought the ship had sailed with Skylanders.

1824
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Right.

1825
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I guess I know it's still a thing.

1826
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
We only have Crash this year, so that's something for somebody that remembers Crash.

1827
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Honestly, it's Activision being Activision.

1828
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
After a while, these franchises, they get greedy and they just decide,

1829
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
here's how we're going to get the most money out of this.

1830
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
And it's what tanks it.

1831
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Have with the Guitar Hero and it'll happen again with Skylanders.

1832
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Although ironically, the new Guitar Hero game was actually kind of good.

1833
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Oh, you're talking about the old Guitar Hero game.

1834
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
No, I'm not talking about the new launch of Guitar Hero.

1835
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I'm talking about Guitar Hero, Band Hero, Guitar Hero.

1836
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Guitar Hero 80s, Guitar Hero best hits, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero this, Aerosmith.

1837
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:51,000
That's what I'm talking about is that they get greedy and then they, I don't know,

1838
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
they expect people to buy all this shit.

1839
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
A quick follow-up before our next story here from our chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

1840
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
MXC in chat talking about Phil Fish because I said, you know,

1841
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I kind of think he's just on a siesta.

1842
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
MXC says Fish is working on a game called Super Hypercube, which is,

1843
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
you can check that out, superhypercube.com.

1844
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
So I was not aware.

1845
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
So thank you for letting me know.

1846
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
It better be based on the movie.

1847
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Right, the actual cube trilogy.

1848
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
It's not.

1849
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
It is not.

1850
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It was a joke.

1851
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I know it was a joke.

1852
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
It would be cool though.

1853
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
It would be cool.

1854
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Somebody should make a movie based on this.

1855
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
This hypercube was awesome.

1856
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
All right.

1857
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Anyhow, let's talk about a little piece of history,

1858
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
something that was floating around Twitter this week and got picked up by various gaming blogs.

1859
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,000
But this guy, Frank Caffaldi, who is the head of restoration at Digital Eclipse,

1860
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
who made like the Mega Man collection that was out on PlayStation recently.

1861
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
You know what's funny?

1862
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
We were both on a podcast together the same week, but not at the same time.

1863
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
So I actually didn't talk to him myself, but he was on the show like right after I was.

1864
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
It was kind of funny because I recognize this guy, his name and what he does and all that.

1865
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:00,000
So obviously this guy has a great interest in collecting video game history and nostalgia and things like that.

1866
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Well, he actually put out some tweets that he got some circuit boards for the Famicom

1867
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:09,000
and these actual cartridges that aren't even in a shell.

1868
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
They're just like the chip boards.

1869
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
They're prototypes essentially.

1870
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I'm kind of simplifying what these things really are because they could be things that were dumped to these.

1871
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
They may not be the original.

1872
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,000
There's no way to tell if the physical artifacts themselves are authentic.

1873
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,000
But certainly the code is there to be looked at and poured around in.

1874
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:33,000
And in the tweets, this is the interesting part and what I'm getting to here is Frank Caffaldi actually tweets a few things here saying,

1875
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
I just acquired and preserved an incredible piece of video game history.

1876
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:44,000
And moves on to say there are boards for the Famicom and I don't know if the boards are authentic, but the EPROMs are definitely old.

1877
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
They were kind of fishy looking, but I picked them up anyway.

1878
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
They are Hyper Olympic, Stargate, Soccer and Joust.

1879
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
And there's some screenshots here from Joust.

1880
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I dumped the ROMs.

1881
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
All but Soccer are definitely earlier than Retail Code.

1882
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Here's some clear differences in Joust.

1883
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Going on to say Joust has an interesting history.

1884
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:09,000
It was programmed by Satoru Iwata in 1983 as part of a Nintendo and Atari deal that never happened.

1885
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Nintendo did not release it in 83 or 84 as planned, but HAL eventually did in 1987.

1886
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
They self-published the game years later.

1887
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:27,000
But this would mean that Joust is the first thing that Satoru Iwata, the eventual president of Nintendo, ever coded for a Nintendo system.

1888
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Which I also find kind of interesting because then one of the games he's most well known for is Balloon Fight.

1889
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Which has a lot of similarities to Joust, but then introduces that endless mode.

1890
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Which is a little bit different.

1891
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Kind of expands on that Joust concept there.

1892
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
So I just think that's kind of cool that Iwata was working on Joust.

1893
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Then made a game that some may even consider better than Joust, Balloon Fighter.

1894
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
At least kind of mixed up the formula a little bit while still being very similar.

1895
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,000
But that's very cool that especially, I don't know where he finds these things.

1896
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
If it was some type of liquidation or I don't know if it would be a flea market or something.

1897
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Or an auction type of site or wherever he found this.

1898
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
But that's just very cool that that's a little piece of video gaming history that's preserved.

1899
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Because that would be the first game that he actually coded that would be out there.

1900
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
So it's very cool.

1901
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Even if it didn't actually release at that time, it ended up releasing way later.

1902
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Especially considering with his passing last year, more people are very interested in his legacy and so forth.

1903
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
So this being a very important part of that.

1904
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
So very cool little story. Love that.

1905
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out,

1906
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
You never know, I know these protos sometimes wind up on eBay or Yahoo Japan auctions.

1907
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So yeah, the tweets didn't say, well at least the ones that got pulled that are all over the internet.

1908
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Don't say where it came from, but it's still pretty cool that it's out there nonetheless.

1909
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1910
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Every week you guys email us.

1911
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us emails.

1912
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
The petition's up by the way.

1913
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Oh is it? Did you put it in chat?

1914
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I'm about to, I just have to post it on Facebook.

1915
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Okay, I gotta see this. Where's the post?

1916
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Alright, we will get to the emails here momentarily.

1917
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Because I'm just dying to see what she wrote in the petition.

1918
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Okay, it should be up now. I'm gonna tweet it.

1919
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Okay.

1920
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
On my own twatter.

1921
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Wait, I'll just copy the link.

1922
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Alright, while you're getting that up, I will just remind the listeners you can always email us.

1923
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag head first

1924
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
and find some mails that she thinks are worth reading here on the show.

1925
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And in the meantime, here's the change.org petition.

1926
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Fans of Silent Hill, Metal Gear, and other Konami franchises are tired of them ruining said franchises.

1927
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Where's our Silent Hills? Why did they chase off Kojima?

1928
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Why all the Pochi slot machines?

1929
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Dear Konami, can you please not, sincerely, everyone?

1930
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I think I said it right.

1931
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I can't believe you put the show's name on there. Alright.

1932
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
I hope you don't mind. It's good publicity.

1933
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Ah, whatever. I don't care. Whatever.

1934
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Okay.

1935
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Alright, let's get to the e-house.

1936
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
It had my last name on it and it wouldn't let me remove it, so.

1937
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Oh, yeah, that's kind of gross.

1938
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
So.

1939
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Alright.

1940
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Still loving the show. Here's a few thoughts I had while listening. Sorry I can't include the time codes.

1941
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
A typical 20 ounce bottle of Mountain Dew has 290 calories.

1942
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
So 250 or so isn't unusual for Crystal Pepsi.

1943
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I have yet to see it in the Midwest. Is diet available? Probably not.

1944
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
And I haven't seen a diet yet.

1945
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I doubt there's a Diet Crystal Pepsi and if there was it would probably be the worst thing in the world.

1946
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I think sugar is kind of what makes that drink.

1947
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I noticed the switcher slash best friends play YouTube channel uses the DOA beach volleyball music for their creepy anime bullshit series.

1948
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Because of course they do.

1949
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
It's the current trailer video that auto plays on their channel homepage.

1950
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Along the same line, I get the feeling Mike, in referring to male bounce, might be thinking of the infamous Xbox arcade title Mount Your Friends.

1951
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Also Saints Row?

1952
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Oh, that wasn't Saints Row, wasn't it? Isn't there some male bounce in Saints Row a little bit? Just a little bit over the top.

1953
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Yeah, they have where you can increase the size of your package and it's your sexiness thing.

1954
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
We want the wiggle jiggle.

1955
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Am I particularly mistaken or is Major Minor of Majestic March fame already considered to be one of Parappa's shitty friends?

1956
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
At least as a spiritual successor.

1957
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
A lot of people don't know that game. I never thought of that, so maybe.

1958
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Not as well received as the PS1 games, but still. It comes from Robert M.

1959
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Good call.

1960
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Okay, moving on to the next.

1961
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
The next email.

1962
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Hello, LR. Martin the Belgian here.

1963
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Hello, Martin the Belgian.

1964
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I just called to say I love you and a pat on the ass and a job well done. Wink!

1965
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Thank you!

1966
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Because last week I said I love getting those emails that just say a pat on the ass and a job well done. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

1967
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Also you guys mentioned Dragon Con on last week's show since I live in Atlanta.

1968
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I'm contemplating attending for at least a day. Last year I just went downtown and checked out the parade.

1969
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I'm not really into events with big crowds, long lines and such, but I was wondering do you have any tips for a first time attendee?

1970
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I know you guys are true con veterans, so maybe you could give me some tips, dos and don'ts.

1971
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I will tell you one thing. There are sometimes quiet rooms for people who have anxiety slash autism slash things like that.

1972
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:45,000
You can also find little restaurants where they'll go and let you have coffee, like inside of a convention center or a hotel attached to it.

1973
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Bathrooms are great for hiding in. I say this from experience. I would always find the most out of the way bathroom at E3 and then hide there when the people were too much for me.

1974
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:05,000
And also just hanging out in certain booths can actually be really isolating if you need it to happen.

1975
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Sometimes I just take the elevator up to a higher floor. Even the elevator game can be a giant pain in the ass at Dragon Con.

1976
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:21,000
But usually the higher you go, especially the floor that has all the LARPing events at Dragon Con, because it's up on the third floor, I think it's usually quieter up there.

1977
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Because only the LARPing people really seem to go up there if you need a quiet place to get away.

1978
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:34,000
But the reality is Dragon Con is so many people. I'm not going to lie to you. There's going to be a lot of people around.

1979
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:43,000
You'll see a lot of neat costumes. But just keep in mind there's a lot of people there dealing with the same issues you are.

1980
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:50,000
And I think as long as you show everybody respect, you're going to get that back virtually all the time.

1981
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
You know, obviously there's always going to be a jerk out there. But Dragon Con is a really cool crowd.

1982
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I can't think of all the issues I've run into at conventions. I don't think I've run into any at Dragon Con really.

1983
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:06,000
So, yeah. And come say hi at the Parsec Awards on Saturday. That will be definitely a place where we're all assembled.

1984
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:11,000
And I guess we're actually going to be presenting an award again this year for the fourth year in a row.

1985
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,000
So that would be a good place to see us. And that's not a super crowded event either.

1986
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:23,000
So it's not, you know, you have to be into podcasting. It's not going to be the most showy event in the world.

1987
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:32,000
So I don't want to set the expectations too high. But I can say it is a nice little like it's not like trying to go to the Patrick Stewart panel or something that's just going to be wall to wall people.

1988
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I would say set a rough agenda of the things you want to do the most. But don't be disappointed if you don't get to them all.

1989
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Because you're going to have that whole, ooh, shiny type of thing where you're going to get distracted.

1990
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
You're going to go look at something else. And you just have to remember that that's okay.

1991
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:54,000
And that some panels, you know, especially the bigger the celebrity in the panel, the harder it's going to be to get in there and the more crowded it's going to be.

1992
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:00,000
So just, you know, plan on getting there early if you want it, if you really want to get into a panel with a big celebrity in it.

1993
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,000
But if that's not really what you're there for, which I don't really go to the celebrity panels.

1994
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Because all the big ones are on that Dragon Con TV anyway, which they're streaming this year.

1995
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I was going to say in those panels, though, with the celebrities and stuff, they allow you to stay in the room through multiple panels.

1996
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Because I remember that was one of the strategies I used back when I used to go to anime conventions to watch certain movies and get a good seat.

1997
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I would go to a movie prior to that that wasn't as popular and get a good seat and then just stay.

1998
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I believe Dragon Con does sweep rooms between panels, but it depends.

1999
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Like, for example, the podcast track, they don't really do that because they don't need to.

2000
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
You know, at least none of the panels that I ever attended are that popular.

2001
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Plus, usually if it is going to be a more popular panel, they move it to another room.

2002
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
So you have to move and then they'll line up for that.

2003
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
But I think some of the more popular tracks, they do do room sweeps, especially in larger rooms.

2004
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
There's more.

2005
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Oh, sure.

2006
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
If I am attending only one day, which day would you recommend? Saturday or Sunday?

2007
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Which is typically the best or most fun day?

2008
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I will tell you most cons. Saturday is going to be the biggest, craziest day.

2009
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,000
But the Labor Day angle makes Sunday still a big day.

2010
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Isn't it the last day?

2011
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
No, Monday is the last day.

2012
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Monday is the last day.

2013
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Monday is a really quiet day too.

2014
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Monday is definitely the hangover day.

2015
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,000
In my experience, most of the things I want to do end up on Saturday.

2016
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
But Saturday will also be the most crowded day.

2017
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,000
So it's kind of a, you kind of have to pick between the two.

2018
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Martin's in chat right now.

2019
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Oh, awesome. Hello.

2020
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
We'll come say, I would say go Saturday.

2021
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And sign the petition.

2022
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Go Saturday and come say hi at the parsecs.

2023
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Or hopefully, I'm still waiting to hear, we may actually have another panel.

2024
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
We don't know, nobody knows the programming yet.

2025
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
So I'm hoping our friends from Critical Myth might have something.

2026
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I know Brian from British Invaders I think is there again this year.

2027
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
He's likely on Brit track somewhere.

2028
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I'm just not sure where yet.

2029
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
So there will be VOG presence somewhere.

2030
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I remember Anime Expo, I think it was 2000, it was at the Disneyland Hotel.

2031
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
When we had a DDR third mix.

2032
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,000
And everyone who either didn't have a room, or didn't want to go back to their room,

2033
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
camped out in the arcade room in a ballroom.

2034
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
We had people sleeping on the floor.

2035
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
This is going to be a huge new dynamic for Dragon Con.

2036
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
This is the first year that Dragon Con is going to have a full-fledged arcade.

2037
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:26,000
They have a classic arcade and a Japanese arcade, the same people I believe that do Magfest.

2038
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Although I don't think it will be as much, but it will still be some.

2039
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
That's going to be new for Dragon Con.

2040
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Usually it's just the old battle tech machines that got converted, that whole thing.

2041
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Which is a cool thing to see, but that was really it.

2042
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Heck yeah!

2043
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Yeah, I mean that was really it.

2044
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
That's what Dan misses about Dave and Busters.

2045
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,000
And I'm sure they are still there too, don't get me wrong.

2046
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
No, the ones at Dave and Busters are gone.

2047
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
No, no, no, I mean these guys that do the newer one.

2048
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So yeah, because all the gaming has moved this year.

2049
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Because in years past, Dark Soccer, if you don't want to go to bed,

2050
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
you go down to the gaming room where there is no windows.

2051
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
So you don't know what time of day it is, ever.

2052
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
And you just play the wolf game until god knows when.

2053
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
And that's what would happen.

2054
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And I'm sure that will still be a thing this year as well.

2055
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
That was like me playing Vampire at Mobicon.

2056
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Assuming they didn't finally just ban the wolf game straight up.

2057
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Because they were starting to last year.

2058
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Or at least some of the places you could do it.

2059
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Alright, so what's the wolf game?

2060
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Is that like the white wolf?

2061
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
The werewolf game.

2062
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
The werewolf game, okay.

2063
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Like Mafia, that type of thing.

2064
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Like you're a wolf.

2065
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I accuse you of being the wolf and that whole thing.

2066
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And then you've got the seer.

2067
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
You still play that on DDR Freak in the chat.

2068
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Yes, yes.

2069
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
On the forums.

2070
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
It's a big forum game to play too.

2071
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So it's fun, but you know.

2072
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,000
How can we only have two signatures?

2073
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I'm sorry, four.

2074
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Sign it.

2075
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Because that's how many listeners we have, don't you know?

2076
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Sign it.

2077
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,000
How could you not please do so?

2078
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Konami, please do not.

2079
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat does point out they don't let people sleep in the gaming rooms.

2080
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
People try, but they always wake them up and make them leave.

2081
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Yeah, you do have to have a hotel.

2082
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:06,000
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here to sleep.

2083
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
So.

2084
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Alright.

2085
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Let's move on.

2086
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
You said one more.

2087
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
There's more.

2088
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Oh, I'm sorry, there's more.

2089
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I wasn't even done with the email.

2090
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

2091
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Way to assume, Rob.

2092
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Hey, I was answering questions.

2093
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Thanks and keep up the great show.

2094
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Cheers, Martin.

2095
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
There's more.

2096
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
P.S.

2097
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Okay.

2098
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Dr. Sakurai mentioned on a past show using a Microsoft thumb trackball, which they don't

2099
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
make anymore.

2100
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Logitech actually makes a new wireless thumb trackball called the M570, which is really

2101
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
good.

2102
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I have heard of that one.

2103
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I just can't use a wireless one at work.

2104
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I use it every day, myself every day.

2105
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
It saves my hands and wrists.

2106
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I highly recommend it for any fans of thumb trackballs.

2107
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
There's also one more email.

2108
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Rob.

2109
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Okay, yes, I know.

2110
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I know there was another email.

2111
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Rob.

2112
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
All right.

2113
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
The day after my previous message, I did, in fact, find Crystal Pepsi in my local convenience

2114
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
store.

2115
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,000
It's okay, but after a fair cola taste, it seems somewhat artificial.

2116
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Not really for me, I'm afraid, and it comes from Robert M.

2117
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Well, Final Fantasy Victory fanfare that you actually found this stuff, and not everybody

2118
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
likes it.

2119
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
It does not taste like pee pee.

2120
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:24,000
It was one of those drinks that definitely tasted better when I was a kid, but I like

2121
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
it, but it's just so sugary.

2122
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
You know when it tasted good?

2123
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I can't drink it all the time.

2124
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,000
After marching in Mardi Gras parades and they brought out a case of that shit, I was like,

2125
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I don't care what it tastes like.

2126
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Plus, it's better in a can.

2127
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
It's better in those light blue cans that it used to come in than a bottle.

2128
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Yes, you're dead.

2129
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
You're dead because we killed you.

2130
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Hi, participate at orangeloungeradoo.com is the place to send an email and your observations

2131
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
on Crystal Pepsi and going to conventions.

2132
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2133
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
It's time to get angsty because we do.

2134
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:18,000
FU to my brain damaged dad.

2135
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I'm done.

2136
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
That was short.

2137
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Loki.

2138
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
FU to my headache right now.

2139
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I still have that.

2140
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:38,000
And then FU to Asus for really terrible thermal design for their laptops because my laptop

2141
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:43,000
right now, I'm not doing anything on it, is idling at 90 degrees Celsius, which is not

2142
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
supposed to be happening.

2143
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Oh, and hey, that would be cool if I could go into my BIOS and say up the fan speed to

2144
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
kind of help out with that.

2145
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,000
But nope, that fucking option's not there because for I don't know what reason they

2146
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
just blocked that shit.

2147
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Sorry, you can't control the fan.

2148
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
We're the fan control, so whatever.

2149
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
We are your fan.

2150
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,000
So that sucks.

2151
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:10,000
And I took it apart like, okay, it's got to be cat hair because it was cat hair last time.

2152
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Nope, that thing is clean.

2153
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It is clean as whistles.

2154
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
So I don't know.

2155
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And finally, fuck you to a local mom and pop drive-in place called the Sunflower Drive-In.

2156
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:27,000
It is a vegan, vegetarian burger place that...

2157
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Oh, God, I've seen that place.

2158
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Yeah, it's over in Old Fair Oaks, right?

2159
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Old Fair Oaks, yes.

2160
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
It's over there.

2161
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,000
My wife wanted me to go get her a nut burger, which I have no problem doing going down there.

2162
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Hey, honey, I brought you D's nuts.

2163
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
And to be honest, it smells pretty good cooking.

2164
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I'm not going to eat it, but it smells pretty good cooking.

2165
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
That's not the problem.

2166
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
The problem is how fucking slow they are.

2167
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Okay, now my wife complains about going to Red Robin because I think they're fantastic

2168
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:02,000
and how long it takes to get food from them, and it takes about like 20 minutes.

2169
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I waited.

2170
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I literally, from the time I ordered to the time I got the burger,

2171
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I waited over 45 fucking minutes for a fucking burger.

2172
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Loki slow-roasting those nuts takes time.

2173
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Like, do you harvest those off the tree?

2174
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Were they growing while I was waiting?

2175
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I mean, like, what?

2176
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:28,000
There should be no reason if you're cooking a burger made out of meat, made out of nuts, whatever.

2177
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
It should not take 45 fucking minutes to make a hamburger.

2178
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I can fucking figure out...

2179
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Maybe they're part of the slow food movement.

2180
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Maybe they lost your nuts.

2181
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:41,000
It's just like everybody's just standing around while they're just like, I don't know.

2182
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
And then the guy, like, it's bad enough.

2183
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,000
It just attracts the vegan hippie crowd.

2184
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
I don't like them.

2185
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I just don't.

2186
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

2187
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:54,000
It's just, you know, maybe I'm sort of, I don't know if that's racist or whatever,

2188
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,000
but they're not a race, so I'm not really sure what that's considered.

2189
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Lifist, I guess.

2190
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Get off my lawn.

2191
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Whatever.

2192
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
You're a hipsterist.

2193
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Hipsterist, yes.

2194
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Fine.

2195
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I'll take that.

2196
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I'll take that.

2197
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
But like, it's just, even then, they were like getting pissed off.

2198
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,000
They're like, so like, how long is my burger gonna take?

2199
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I ordered this like 30 minutes ago.

2200
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:19,000
It might be another five, ten minutes.

2201
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
I mean, the guy just...

2202
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I was just so fucking pissed off.

2203
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Because it was also, because they're a drive-in, they don't really have a lobby.

2204
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
It's outdoors.

2205
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
At lunchtime.

2206
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
In the 95 fucking degree weather.

2207
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I'm not happy.

2208
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Alright.

2209
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
My a few of the week is pretty simple.

2210
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I was reminded about it in chat because I went to 7-Eleven down the street the other day

2211
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
to get the birthday cake Slurpee.

2212
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
And I was really excited to see that they still had it.

2213
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
And I filled up my Slurpee cup and I left and I came home and I started drinking the Slurpee.

2214
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Some fucking asshole switched out mango for the birthday cake.

2215
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
And I couldn't tell because it was kind of dark, I guess, so the color wasn't quite right.

2216
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:05,000
So I ended up with one of those sour mango flavored Slurpees.

2217
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Which, mango's okay.

2218
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
But it's not birthday cake.

2219
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:15,000
And it's like, you know, when you've prepared your taste buds for one thing and then you get another.

2220
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
It's just not, you know...

2221
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Loki, imagine if you prepare your taste buds for the nut burger.

2222
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,000
And then you ended up with, I don't know...

2223
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
A hamburger? Oh, that sounds fantastic, actually.

2224
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,000
And of course everybody in chat is like, that sounds even better.

2225
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Well, it's not what I wanted. I wanted the birthday cake Slurpee.

2226
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:37,000
If I wanted a mango Slurpee, I would have fucking ordered it.

2227
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Alright. Serious business.

2228
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,000
A couple more stories for you guys and then we'll get to the Skype line.

2229
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,000
At Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

2230
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Alright.

2231
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:50,000
And so let's talk a little bit about Final Fantasy XV.

2232
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Yes, unfortunately, even though we heard the rumors that it was going to be delayed.

2233
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,000
It's been delayed. It's been delayed to November.

2234
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:01,000
And yeah, it's just, they need more time to polish the game.

2235
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,000
So that's good, I guess.

2236
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Was there something about trying to avoid a day one patch too?

2237
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Yeah, basically people don't like day one patches.

2238
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
So, you know, they're gonna, you know, they're trying to avoid that.

2239
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
So they're just polishing it and doing quality testing and stuff like that.

2240
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,000
On a different note, though, I'm not sure if you're aware.

2241
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:26,000
But Kingsglaive, the animated movie, they actually have the first 12 minutes of it online on YouTube.

2242
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,000
If you haven't gotten a chance to watch that. So I didn't watch that and I thought that was pretty badass.

2243
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
You know, the screenings happened at different theaters a couple days ago.

2244
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And some people I know went, but they didn't have any here.

2245
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Because, you know, we're only one of the 20 biggest, you know, metro markets in the nation.

2246
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:43,000
But we don't get any of that stuff because we're not San Francisco or LA.

2247
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
So, you know, whatever.

2248
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
But yeah, we, I didn't get to see that in the theater.

2249
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
But I want to see it at some point.

2250
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Yeah, they're saying that the digital releases of Kingsglaive is not going to be affected by this.

2251
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:01,000
But they've decided to hold the physical release of it until November 29th, which is the game's release date.

2252
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
So, oh well. That's fine. I'm willing to wait.

2253
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
If it means it's going to be a better game. We've waited this long.

2254
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Mm-hmm. Agree.

2255
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
All right, let's see. One more story for you guys.

2256
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,000
And this is about a retro console. It's called the Retro-Bit Generations.

2257
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
And it is something that's going to be coming out, I guess, over the holiday.

2258
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:29,000
It's got over 100 8-bit and 16-bit games from companies like Data East, Capcom, and more.

2259
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Some of the titles were actually posted over on our forums.

2260
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Dark Tetsuya actually posted the list.

2261
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
And I got to be honest, there was a lot of stuff on there I kind of didn't recognize.

2262
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:43,000
It was a lot of obscure stuff, which I get is part of the cool factor for people that, you know,

2263
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:50,000
it's not like you get a game like Kickle Cubicle on other plug-and-play NES-type devices.

2264
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
So this is really for people that are really into the kind of niche stuff.

2265
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
And there is a lot of games included with that, so that's pretty cool.

2266
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Also of interest here is that this is something that's being shipped through the ShopReadRetro.com store,

2267
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:12,000
which is the whole retro magazine, which a couple months ago we got into some of the issues

2268
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
that were going on with the whole Coleco thing, Chameleon and all that.

2269
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
So it's just interesting that this is something that they're involved with now,

2270
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:25,000
since that whole doing their own console didn't work out, let's just say.

2271
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
They're shipping somebody else's.

2272
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,000
But hey, there's going to be some collectors that are into that and some of those old titles.

2273
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
So very cool.

2274
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
And then there's also like some Japanese games that never came out here and stuff.

2275
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
So I mean, it is over 100 games.

2276
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
It's a pretty solid list.

2277
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
So, you know, check that out.

2278
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I think it was only what, like 60 bucks, I think, for that.

2279
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
So pretty cool.

2280
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Anyway, that is going to do it.

2281
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Let's get to the Skype line.

2282
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2283
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:56,000
If you want to give us a call and talk about whatever we might have missed or what have you.

2284
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?

2285
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Yeah, I got this thing in my email and I liked it.

2286
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
I was following this for a while and I just like forgot about it.

2287
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
But apparently it's still a thing.

2288
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
So it's this console that they've been trying to start up for this company called NGeniX.

2289
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:19,000
It's called the OtonX, which was supposed to be a console that would have procedurally generated games.

2290
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:26,000
So basically you would give it like an idea for you to pick a genre or something and it would spit out a game,

2291
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:31,000
which sounds really terrible, but that was a thing that they're running with.

2292
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But their Kickstarter campaign apparently is starting on Monday.

2293
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:41,000
And they've already secured 95% of the system software development funding,

2294
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:48,000
but now they're trying to raise $25,000 to add or improve current features with minor software enhancements.

2295
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
I don't know, the whole thing seems very...

2296
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
So like randomly generated games?

2297
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
It's supposed to be like, yeah, it's supposed to be an autonomy.

2298
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:01,000
They say it'll be the first autonomous game console ever, meaning it will self-produce games without a developer or human input.

2299
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
So No Man's Sky the game console?

2300
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Sort of, yeah. No Man's Console.

2301
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
No Man's Console. All right, we got a call coming in. Let's get to it.

2302
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLawn's Radio. Who's this?

2303
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Hey, this is Def.

2304
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Yeah, Def. How you doing, buddy?

2305
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Pretty good, pretty good.

2306
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
What's on your mind?

2307
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Well, I want to talk about Metal Gear Survive.

2308
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Yeah.

2309
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:26,000
And it's something, well, I'm going to plug my podcast a little.

2310
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Please?

2311
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
We recorded our fifth episode today.

2312
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:41,000
And we were talking about that game specifically and what it meant for Konami and the gaming community in general.

2313
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:51,000
And one point that I think Loki talked about is that who is left in Konami that we know about?

2314
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Like, who are the important people right now in Konami that we can recognize?

2315
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Because we don't have Kojima, we don't have Igarashi, we don't have even Naoki Maeda.

2316
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
So, who's left?

2317
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,000
People that worked with them. That's the honest-to-god answer.

2318
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Soldier. Soldier is left. Soldier number one and number two.

2319
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
And yeah, that's the problem with Konami right now.

2320
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:29,000
They only have the names, but they don't have any recognition beyond that.

2321
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:35,000
And it's sad. It's kind of sad that Konami has pretty much gone to that.

2322
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:41,000
That, oh, we have Metal Gear, we have Pro Evolution Soccer, we have the money.

2323
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Even though, well, they pretty much didn't promote it for quite years here.

2324
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Yeah, they let it go for a long time.

2325
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:59,000
And granted, to be fair with all the crap that we give them, I feel like I'm more interested in the music stuff coming out of Konami than I have been for a very long time.

2326
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
So, I'll give them that.

2327
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Yeah, and that's surprising, too, that they're promoting now what is the Bemani series, even in the United States.

2328
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
If they just want to stick with that, that's totally fine.

2329
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Like, they can just stick with the music game series and maybe get some more stuff here in America.

2330
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I mean, this whole round one partnership's been pretty awesome, but home releases again of 2DX would be fucking fantastic.

2331
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Although, I'm not going to hold my breath, because obviously the controllers are holding that back, but whatever.

2332
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Home release of any Bemani game, it would be awesome.

2333
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Yeah, it would be.

2334
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Really.

2335
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Hey, this whole Pokemon Worlds thing, were you watching it at all?

2336
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,000
I actually missed it, because I was watching the Olympics.

2337
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Oh, you're not going to go back and watch the archive or anything like that?

2338
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I probably watched the Pokken tournament stuff, because I'm really interested in that.

2339
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Maybe the video game Alpha Fire stuff, I'll watch the finals, too.

2340
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:08,000
But yeah, I'm probably going to watch Pokken, because that's my game, so.

2341
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Yeah, I gotcha.

2342
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I didn't see any of the competition stuff, but it looks like some good stuff.

2343
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I got the SensacDeft on Twitter, there was a little jealousy of the Pokkicenter trip that we took.

2344
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Oh, yeah.

2345
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Why is that?

2346
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:30,000
The Pokemon World stuff, every year is really, really hard to get.

2347
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I have some from 2014, but that's pretty much it.

2348
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Last year, well, in 2014, the stuff from there is really hard to get and really expensive, too.

2349
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:54,000
The plushies, the Pikachu plushies, can go for really, really expensive top dollar.

2350
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:58,000
God, the guys that buy and sell those things are fucking assholes, huh?

2351
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Kind of, but some do it because, well, there's the Pokemon Collectors Community in LiveJournal,

2352
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:11,000
and they do trades and group buys and all that stuff, so there's that.

2353
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,000
But yeah, there's other people that do it for profit, so yeah.

2354
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,000
What did you think of that limited edition one they had this year?

2355
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,000
This cute little Pikachu that has a little trolley with it to represent San Francisco.

2356
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
What did you think of that one?

2357
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,000
It's really cute.

2358
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:34,000
It doesn't top the 2014 one because 2014 is kind of like a wrestling Pikachu.

2359
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:37,000
It has the belt and it has a cape.

2360
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
It's really awesome.

2361
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:45,000
But this one, it's probably my second favorite because it looks pretty cute and it's a good design.

2362
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Yeah, and I'm not going to lie, ActDeaf, I did pick one up and they are super cute as hell.

2363
02:32:52,000 --> 02:33:00,000
And I also have to say, I saw your tweets that you were a little bit jealous of the whole fact that we were there at the Poki Center

2364
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:07,000
and got these little plushie dolls, and I thought, you know, ActDeaf's been a big supporter of OLR for a very long time

2365
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
and always calls in the show and has great things to say.

2366
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:15,000
So my point is, ActDeaf, I went back to the Poki Center and I bought another plushie for you.

2367
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
So I'll get your address off air and I'll send that to you.

2368
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Oh my god, awesome. Thank you so much.

2369
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,000
You're welcome. So you don't have to deal with those third-party reseller bullshit because those guys suck.

2370
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,000
So I got one for you and just as a thank you for everything you've done over the years.

2371
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
So we'll connect off air.

2372
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Oh my god, that's pretty awesome. Like, really, thank you.

2373
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:45,000
You're welcome very much. I don't mind. I will let you know, at the time you sent the tweet, I was eating America's finest version of Mexican food, Chipotle.

2374
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
That probably helped.

2375
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:58,000
And yeah, I got up. It wasn't that we were only like a block away. The whole thing was across the street from the Metreon, believe it or not.

2376
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Hopefully, since next year's in Anaheim, if I can get my travel visa and all that, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

2377
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
So maybe I can go next year, but we'll see.

2378
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:17,000
There you go. And you might get to see Shane compete.

2379
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Yeah.

2380
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:23,000
The way things are going. All right. Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy. I'm glad you called in so I can let you know that.

2381
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Thank you so much.

2382
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
You're welcome. Bye-bye.

2383
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I just linked the petition to Kojima.

2384
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Oh my god. How many signatures are we up to? Six?

2385
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Eight.

2386
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,000
I haven't signed it yet, so maybe we'll get double digits by the end of the night.

2387
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:47,000
All right. We've got more calls coming in, so let's get to it. Oren Sanz Radio on Skype. Hi, Oren Sanz Radio. Who's this?

2388
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Hey, this is Ragingator.

2389
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Hey, Ragingator. How's this going? I like the bald look you've got going.

2390
02:34:51,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Oh, thanks. You know, I more or less had to grant it. Buffalo doesn't get quite as high as it does out in California, but still, it's been not too pleasant here.

2391
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I hate Hawaii, so that being said, you know, I've been sitting around doing nothing and still breaking out on the mop side with a full hill here, so this was kind of necessary.

2392
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I hear you. What's on your mind?

2393
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Well, it's kind of a well-known factoid that Orange Lounge Radio owns its existence to arcades, and the three of you have professed your love of arcades God knows how many times.

2394
02:35:37,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Now, that being said, assuming that money was no object and that the three of you had the space in your homes to do so, if each of you could go out right now and buy five arcade machines yourselves and put them in your homes, which ones would that be?

2395
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Ooh, five. You're generous. Gosh. Okay. So, I don't know if you guys heard Ragingator's question, but again, if money and space were not a concern, what five arcade games would you go and get right now?

2396
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Essentially, I'm summarizing it there. Dark Soccer, you already have arcade games in your house.

2397
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I just linked it to Del Toro.

2398
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I don't know if this is the best question for you, Dark Soccer, because you already have games in your house. I mean, it's just JIRUS is the only arcade game, so to speak, and the rest are pinball games, but let's say-

2399
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
No, we have a Blastroids.

2400
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Oh, do you? Oh, that's right, you do. That's right. Okay, well, hell, if money was not a concern or space, what would be the five games you would get?

2401
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I'd have a 2DX, so I can just put whatever I want in it.

2402
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Yep.

2403
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,000
I'd have my own DDR, so that I could have dedicated exercise.

2404
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Yep.

2405
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I would have a sit-down space Harrier.

2406
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Ooh, okay.

2407
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I would have a Fantasy Zone, and since the Guardian Legend didn't come out in arcades, probably...

2408
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Ooh, that's hard. I think I'd have a Neo Geo AVS 6, uh, 8-cart, 8-cart, uh, 6-player system.

2409
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Wait, I thought the AVS was, uh, the whole console-

2410
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Sorry, MVS.

2411
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Yep.

2412
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I have an AVS already.

2413
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Good picks. Uh, for me-

2414
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Because then that means I could have, like, eight games in one machine.

2415
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Um, I'm gonna blur the line a little bit, but I always talk about wanting this machine, and goddamn it, I'm gonna have one someday.

2416
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
A baby Pac-Man machine. I mean, that's kind of hybrid, and I realize the game is not that great, but I still want it.

2417
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Um, a hybrid, uh, video game pinball table. That would be my number one.

2418
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Uh, I want a Dance Maniacs machine, because one of my friends has one, and I'm a jealous hoe, so I really want one of those in my house.

2419
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
And that would be my exercise as well.

2420
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I would also have to get the Beat Mania 2DX machine, because if space is no concern, then great.

2421
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Apparently I have this door that leads to Narnia, where I'm gonna store all this stuff.

2422
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Uh, so I definitely want one of those.

2423
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I want a Burger Time machine, because I'm regretful.

2424
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I had the opportunity to get one, and I didn't do it, and it-

2425
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:30,000
If I- If that place had still been there even a month later, I probably could have afforded it and brought it home, and it would have been my first arcade machine.

2426
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:34,000
And, you know, that game's kind of like this long-running inside joke.

2427
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:38,000
So yeah, I'm just- I'm really upset that I don't have one, so that would be it.

2428
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
And then for the fifth machine, um...

2429
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Actually, I'm gonna go- I'm gonna go a little crazy, and I'm just gonna go for something from my childhood.

2430
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,000
I would want a cocktail cabinet.

2431
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Or, you know, it's not a cabinet, but it's a cocktail machine.

2432
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,000
It's the one that you can sit down, and it's like the table is the game.

2433
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Uh, most expos that celebrate classic gaming, you'll see one of these pulled out there, but you don't really see them out in the wild so much anymore.

2434
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:12,000
I would love a cocktail machine. Probably Ms. Pac-Man, or if I could find it, it would be a pain in the ass, I could find it, Time Pilot.

2435
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I found- For a moment, I thought I had found you a baby Pac-Man. Actually, I did, but they want way too much money for it. They want, like, two grand.

2436
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
And then you gotta ship it out here, too, unless it's in Northern California somewhere.

2437
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Uh... I'll find out.

2438
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Yeah.

2439
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:28,000
So those are my five. Uh, Loki, what about you?

2440
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Um... I'd have to get a DDR machine, for sure. Just, I don't know which one. A newer one?

2441
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Um...

2442
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Let's see... Uh, I guess? It's gotta have, like, a racing game of some sort, so, you know...

2443
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,000
I don't know, what's the most expensive racing game I could think of?

2444
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Probably one of those new Mario Kart games.

2445
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Eh, fuck Mario Kart. That's stupid.

2446
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Initial D8 stage. We saw that at round one this weekend.

2447
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Okay, fine. We'll go with Initial D. I am not an Initial D fan, but whatever.

2448
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Um... I think it'd be fun to, uh, have a Derby Owners Club, so we'll get the full set up.

2449
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Yes! I will be at your house.

2450
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
If space is not a concern, fuck yeah, let's do it.

2451
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:15,000
It's not a concern. So let's do Derby Owners Club, and then, um...

2452
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Oh, what's that space game that's really large, too, that has a theater and laser dicks?

2453
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Galaxian 3?

2454
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Galaxian 3, yes. That's- Thank you. I was trying to think of the name.

2455
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:27,000
I think, uh, Galaxian 3. How many is that so far? That's three? Okay.

2456
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
No, that's four. You have four.

2457
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Um... I would do also a...

2458
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:37,000
How about one of those giant X-Men machines?

2459
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Eh...

2460
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Okay, with the three TVs. I'm just thinking big, because clearly...

2461
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:42,000
It was two.

2462
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Was it two? I thought it was three.

2463
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
It was two.

2464
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Yeah, I'm not really big on that. Um, how about, like, a...

2465
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Oh, gosh. Um...

2466
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
I don't even know. Um...

2467
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
How about a Ridiculous Ticket Redemption game?

2468
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
A Ridiculous Ticket Redemption game?

2469
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Spider Stomp.

2470
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Oh, God, no. Spider Stomp.

2471
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Uh, let's do, like, a, um...

2472
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I don't know what this...

2473
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
The most ridiculous skeeball machine we can think of.

2474
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Oh, okay. Like an ultra skeeball machine. I like it. I love it.

2475
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Uh, JD in chat says keyboard mania. I can't believe that didn't make my list.

2476
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I guess because it was so short run in arcades. They only had the three mixes.

2477
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,000
But, shoot. I guess, you know, for my dance maniacs machine, you know...

2478
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I want that, because that's going to be good exercise, but I would love a keyboard mania machine.

2479
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
But, you know, the home version of keyboard mania was really playful.

2480
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:39,000
If you want to get the full exercise thing, you've got to have a DDR, and then you've got to have a prop cycle.

2481
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Oh, I want one of those prop cycle Addams Family pinball games.

2482
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
That was, like, a single custom that someone made.

2483
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
It was a prop cycle pinball game.

2484
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
How do you even do that?

2485
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Somebody custom made it.

2486
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
It worked.

2487
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
It's ridiculous.

2488
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Oh, I know, I know with Arcadia, you could have what Scandia has, that gigantic shooting range.

2489
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Oh, that's stupid, but yes, totally going to get that.

2490
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:05,000
But you could, like, custom make it so that the shooting range, you're shooting different things instead of Wild West.

2491
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
You're shooting, I don't know, celebrities or something.

2492
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Medieval stuff, because that makes no sense.

2493
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Alright, anyway.

2494
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Alright, Raginator, there you go.

2495
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,000
We indulged your question.

2496
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I hope you like the answers.

2497
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Alright, I'm flipping it on you.

2498
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
What's going on in your arcade?

2499
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
What five machines would you buy?

2500
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Alright, well, some of them were, you know, kind of, like, no doubt answers.

2501
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,000
The 1989 TMNT game.

2502
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Oh, good one.

2503
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Smash TV.

2504
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Oh, great.

2505
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Then Final Fight.

2506
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Okay, good.

2507
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I'm going to steal one of Dark Soccer's answers.

2508
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
The Neo Geo MVS.

2509
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Although, granted, I never, ever saw an eight-slot one.

2510
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:54,000
If only once all you ever saw was a two-slot and a four-slot.

2511
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,000
So, that being said, I'll take the four-slot.

2512
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:05,000
You are one super Iron Man, Ivan Stewart, off-road machine from being every pizza joint in the 90s.

2513
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:09,000
That needs a Last Action Hero pinball, too.

2514
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
And I'll probably go with Killer Instinct.

2515
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Oh, okay, good pick.

2516
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
I like that.

2517
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
I like that. That's great.

2518
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Oh, by the way, s2100matt has an idea for how you can retrofit the shooting range, Loki.

2519
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Vegans and hipsters.

2520
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
No, that's stupid.

2521
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
We wouldn't want to be surrounded by vegans and hipsters.

2522
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
That'd just be creepy.

2523
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Let's do Silent Hill, though.

2524
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,000
That'd be less creepy.

2525
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I was just thinking about the little game room that I managed at the University of South Alabama.

2526
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:44,000
We had in there a World Cup soccer pinball, which I own, a Killer Instinct.

2527
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,000
We had a Dark Stalkers 3.

2528
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:56,000
We had Street Fighter Alpha 2, Cyber Sled, and King of Fighters 94.

2529
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Nice.

2530
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Or do they count multi-cabinets as one cabinet?

2531
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Because I would have to get a Daytona set up with 16 cabinets long.

2532
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
So ridiculous that I'll never use.

2533
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Just so I walk in the room, flip on the switches.

2534
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Daytona na na na na na na na.

2535
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Just invite Jamie over.

2536
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:17,000
I have to show you something in my room.

2537
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
And then you open the door.

2538
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Do do do do do do do do.

2539
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:24,000
You're like, excuse me, and then come back with a sledgehammer.

2540
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Oops.

2541
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Does insurance cover this?

2542
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:33,000
No, I should probably point out something that J.D. mentioned in chat.

2543
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:37,000
He does mention, bring up a valid point.

2544
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
He, let me screw up real quick.

2545
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:43,000
He says, what about Cruis'n World?

2546
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:47,000
And that's definitely a contender.

2547
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:53,000
That would be like honorable mention for me, like a sixth option.

2548
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I know.

2549
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
It's only five machines.

2550
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Because now I'm thinking like, oh, I'd want a Spy Hunter machine.

2551
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:03,000
And now I want, now that I brought up Iron Man, Stewart, Off-Road, I actually kind of want one of those.

2552
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
It's like, yeah.

2553
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Oh, my arcade's getting busy.

2554
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,000
All right.

2555
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Rage Nader, I gotta let you go, though.

2556
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,000
But that was a great question.

2557
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Thank you.

2558
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
That was fun.

2559
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
All right.

2560
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Have a nice night.

2561
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
All right.

2562
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
You too.

2563
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Bye.

2564
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Bye.

2565
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,000
All right.

2566
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
That's fine.

2567
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
It's fun to spend money that I don't have.

2568
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,000
We'll try to fit in one more call if somebody else wants to get in.

2569
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2570
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
And yeah, they'll see if anybody else wants to call in.

2571
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Do you have any other last minute stories, Logie?

2572
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,000
No, that was it.

2573
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:27,000
That was it.

2574
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Any gaming accomplishments you guys are going to try to do in the next week?

2575
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Anything you guys are going to try to do?

2576
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
I'm going to try to get a pet owl.

2577
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah.

2578
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
When are we playing WoW together?

2579
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Do you want to tomorrow night after work?

2580
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Possibly.

2581
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this on air, but I'll give you a preview.

2582
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,000
We are taping the new reading is fundamental is finally coming back.

2583
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,000
We're taping our first episode tomorrow.

2584
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
So I have that.

2585
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,000
But I mean, that's only going to be like an hour.

2586
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
We could do Tuesday.

2587
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,000
It's episode zero.

2588
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
It's where it's where we dish on what we hope will happen.

2589
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Oh, my God.

2590
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
I already know what I want to happen.

2591
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,000
What's that?

2592
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Katya, all the things I want.

2593
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I want Alyssa to rip off Coco's wig at one point.

2594
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
And I want Katya to win.

2595
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,000
We're going to have to invite Dark Sakura on reading is fundamental, which you can follow

2596
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
that on Twitter at RF podcast.

2597
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,000
But I know not everybody who listens to the show is into Drag Race, which is unfortunate.

2598
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:25,000
So I guess no other calls are coming in.

2599
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
So I'm going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line.

2600
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:30,000
But if you think of something after the fact, you can always email us.

2601
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or you can always tweet us as well.

Tweet us as well at OLR.

2603
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:38,000
But in the meantime, I think it's time to shut the show down for the night.

2604
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I want to thank all you guys for listening to the show.

We don't we don't really ask for your money here.

2615
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,000
So all we ask is help us spread the word.

2616
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Help us get out there and get into some more ears out there and bring some more diverse voices in

2617

our show by spreading the word.

2618
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:31,000
You can tell a friend or two or again, a nice review goes a long way.

2619
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Let's get to final thoughts.

2620
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Dark Sakura next week, going to be the last week for a little while.

2621
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:41,000
I'm going to be sad, but same time we're going to we're going to keep it trucking to make you proud.

2622
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
OK.

2623
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
You're like, I don't care. All right.

2624
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Just kidding.

2625
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,000
All right. Your final thought tonight, Dark Sakura.

2626
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Fucking people, I swear.

2627
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:59,000
My final thought for tonight is I really need to clean the living room and get my amiibo collection up to date,

2628
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
because I still have amiibo in the package.

2629
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:05,000
I got to get up and I haven't I but I've been I haven't bought any new amiibo in a while.

2630
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
I was new amiibo.

2631
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,000
I need to get the Marie and the Splatoon girls.

2632
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I need to get them.

2633
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
The target by my house is plenty of the Splatoon packs.

2634
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Yeah.

2635
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
And they're honestly they're not amiibo aren't exactly hard to find like they were now.

2636
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
So I'll get them at some point.

2637
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I have I picked up another set for the ones I wanted.

2638
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:31,000
And I got the Kirby ones for the game that I don't even have.

2639
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Well, why not?

2640
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
They're things. They're shiny things.

2641
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
I wanted Waddle Dee.

2642
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Because I want them all.

2643
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:43,000
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2644
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I don't know. I'm tired.

2645
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Go.

2646
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,000
All right.

2647
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,000
We're tired.

2648
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
