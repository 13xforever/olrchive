Who's the hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week we're showing our roots with this headline. The next version of DDR DDR Ace is coming to America this spring and summer to about half of all Dave and Buster's locations. There's plenty more video game news in store and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 637 for this April the 10th of 2016.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome back. We were off last week but we're back here this week to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Assembled here in lovely Sacramento, California in our studio N7 with myself, Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And by my side, my lovely co-host over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hi.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi, how are you Jamie Summers?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm well, how are you?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good. I'm tired. I was like really, really, really tired because I've had a very busy weekend but I took a 20 minute nap before the show and I swear a 20 minute nap makes all the difference. I feel a lot better.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I went to bed at 3 and woke up at 2.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
3 in the morning?

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh my gosh.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because I had the smart idea to make coffee to make up for the awful horrid coffee at Dad's Kitchen.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Uh-huh.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
By the way, the food at Dad's Kitchen in Folsom, amazing. Their coffee, crap.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just saying.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Just a tip for you locals.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I made coffee.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We probably did get more local listeners thanks to yesterday so it's relevant.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dan and I, we did stay up a little bit late just, you know, hanging out.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Doing stuff.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Cool.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Playing with Kat.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Alright.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I'm still trying to get him on Miitomo.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I thought he was on Miitomo. I thought everybody was on Miitomo. We'll talk about that in a little bit.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's resistant.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We'll talk about that in a little bit. But first, of course, I always have to introduce him as well here in studio by our side, our other co-host, Techmaster Loki.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, he's one of the resistant ones.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you not on Miitomo? I thought you were. I thought I added you.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's a me out there. Okay, here's the thing. Here's the crazy thing about Miitomo.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I get, like, this is going to sound so, like, cocky. I hate it. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I have so many friend requests in Miitomo that, you know, I'm just approving.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like, if we're linked on Facebook or Twitter, I'm like, whatever, approve, approve, approve.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And one came through and I thought it was Twitter and it said, Matt, and I swear the icon looked just like you.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I was like, oh, it's Loki.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And, like, it even tells you who it is once you go in it, but I didn't even look because I'm going through it so fast.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I thought you were, oh, I thought you were on it.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, well, shoot. Why the hatin'? Why the resisting?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's not why the hatin', just not interested in doing it.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah?

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have a feeling it's going to be one of those things that I'm going to get a million goddamn updates on.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I'm like, no, I am not doing that shit.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, I had to turn it off on my phone because that first day, especially, I mean, the friend request thing has really died down.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But the first day, especially, like, I had the alerts on and I'm not even joking.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like, every five minutes since I downloaded the app, like, it kept going off.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, finally, I was able to figure out how to turn off all the little switches and now it doesn't annoy me.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Because, yeah, if you let it, it will be like, DarkSakura answered a question.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
DarkSakura hearted one of your questions, you know, or some of that.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's bad enough that, like, my Facebook and Twitter apps are starting to do that.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You know, there's been an update or what was it like?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I remember I used to get Facebook updates that I had, like, unread messages or something that are like unread notifications.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And the unread notification was another notification saying that I had unread notifications.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It was like notification ception or something like that.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like, I really didn't have any unread notifications.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It just sent me one of those and they kept sending me another one and another one and another one.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Did you hear about all that crazy stuff, though, where I guess Facebook has yet another, like, hidden inbox or something of messages?

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, I know about that.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's existed for, like, years.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think they moved. I think at one point it was, like, unknown.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But then they, like, moved it or something.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Like, it's another place.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, because that's the one where if you don't know, you're not a friend to somebody, that's where it will go.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Or you pay the dollar and they get it in their inbox or whatever.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The hilarious thing is because I have my Rob Roberts name on Facebook, right?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So all my other inbox is is other people named Rob Roberts, I think, trying to figure out who has the account.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because it's like, hello? And their name is Rob Roberts as well.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, yeah, I had that before.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Which is funny because that's not my real name, but it might as well be.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I had someone, yeah, with my same name and they, like, tried to give me a joint group with the same people with the same name.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I did for a while and I'm like, wow, all these people are losers. No thanks.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come hang out with us. We all have the same name.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
One of them was, like, extremely racist, like, somewhere in Ohio or something.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm like, nope.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's like when your profile picture is, you know.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I love it.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's, what's it, the Confederate flag that's...

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Woop woop. Red alert, red alert.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Aside from all the other posts that they made, yeah.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room and we can get your comments and feedback on the air.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
In fact, Alan Alka will be talking about the Facebook hidden inbox saying,

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I knew about the Facebook thing years ago.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I had three members of my estranged family trying to say hi to me that I didn't see until literally two to three years after the fact.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, hmm.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's see, also some comments on Miitomo.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SHU100Matt saying, I'm not on Miitomo. I'm just so preoccupied with other things.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Also, I wonder how much it will be supported and if people will get tired of it.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
VxChaseNextV agreeing that Miitomo's notification sound is pretty rough.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can tell you if you can get tired of it or not.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Answer me one question.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So how are your Nintendogs doing?

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Exactly, that's how this is going to go.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's quite different than that though.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, it is different than Nintendogs.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I gotta say, okay, here's my thoughts on Miitomo.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All that stuff aside, and I guess admittedly I set the bar pretty low on Miitomo,

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but I honestly think Miitomo is like ten times more interesting than Tomodachi Life was on the 3DS.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Remember all the hoop and holler about that game, especially because there was controversy and all that stuff?

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think Miitomo is a more interesting game.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ten times zero is still zero, so...

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Shut up.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But yeah, I think Miitomo is interesting from a social network perspective,

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and it's kind of blowing my mind because I would not have expected Nintendo to create a somewhat interesting social network.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not going to replace Facebook, it's not going to replace Twitter, any of that,

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
but I will say this, tease all you want about the longevity of Miitomo.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What happened to Peach, y'all?

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Remember Peach?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What happened to Peach?

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That was a thing, right?

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Peach was replaced by Petch.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What about Ello?

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When was the last time y'all logged?

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Remember when we were all going to quit Facebook?

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I still get email from Ello.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, I get email from them too.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, I get email this whole time.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Stop sending me email because they're like, please don't forget us, we're dying.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Remember when you hated Facebook and you made an account here?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Come back!

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, delete.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So, yeah, I think Miitomo has more legs than Peach and Ello.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll give it that.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I realize Loki's probably sitting there going, well, when you set the bar at half an inch off the ground, you got a lot of room to go.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But I think there is that at least.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know if it's going to last months and months and months.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Probably not.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think it's interesting that you have this whole like platinum coins thing and you can earn them in Miitomo

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and you can earn them every day and they are going to turn into things where you can get like discounts on Nintendo games and stuff,

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which is kind of neat.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like it's the whole like achievement points.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or unheard of because they don't discount their games.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, they do now.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can get what, 50% off Holy World or whatever?

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, I like though that it starts conversations and that they've actually led to some really interesting discussion.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So I've learned, I've actually met new people on there.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I've learned a lot about different things.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I found out that, like for example, that children have stronger taste sensitivity to bitter foods.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And that's why they don't like broccoli.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Was that like one of those like name an interesting fact that you learned today?

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No, it was like name a food that you used to hate that you like now and I said Brussels sprouts.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But there's a scientific explanation.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What if I still don't like Brussels sprouts though?

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Then you're not, then you're just sensitive.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't hate them as much as I used to as a kid.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But like Alan will say, we're going to have Brussels sprouts tonight and I'll still make that face that's scrunchie like.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's because you're overly sensitive to bitterness.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Maybe because I am bad when you're made of bitterness.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's left?

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Going to chat over at live.vog network.com.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Act Def says me photo.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's the app seller.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, that's the little thing where you can actually put your me's in crazy situations.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But you can actually import pictures from your phone.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Which you can imagine has led to all sorts of hilarity and x-ratedness.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or the me just covering up the x-ratedness enough.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I've been taking screenshots in other games.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So like I have my me hanging out in like the Kingdom Hearts game.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The Kingdom Hearts X Unchained whatever.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, that's the other big cell phone release everybody's playing.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I tried to play that but it's like I want to download an update five minutes later.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
4% done. I'm just like forget it.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's kind of boring.

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I got a million other things to do right now.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Jamie review. Kind of boring.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Kind of boring?

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Kind of boring.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Alright.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The music's good.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Kind of boring, the music's good. There it is.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Dark Soccer, any other final thoughts on Miitomo?

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I feel like it's one of those things like almost everybody played it this week.

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Obviously there's going to be folks like Loki that are like no I resist.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not resisting I just don't care.

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I think there's a ton.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry but like I have never seen a social network or a game explode that much in the first two days as much as I've seen Miitomo.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Just based on the frame requests I'm getting.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I like dressing up.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And I have Midna on my back.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I got the little black cat.

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I like the little mini games. Those are fun.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah the mini games are kind of...

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Especially dropping your friends on their head and watching them go blah blah blah.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And it makes excite bike noises. Did you notice that?

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
When they bounce around it's all excite bike stuff.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So I will be curious to see and I think Loki that is a valid thing and I think it's something we're all wondering.

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How are they going to keep Miitomo interesting?

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like what's going to cause us to load it a week from now?

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh I remembered something else interesting.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Listening to all the Miis say fuck.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes. Your Miis will say fuck.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Like Nintendo doesn't censor that which I've got to give them a little bit of credit for.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But if you have friends who just aren't, you know, offended by that then whatever.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Whatever.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And I've seen all sorts of states of undress and people looking interesting.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What I don't understand is how you're able to send friend requests to each other without exchanging some sort of numeric code.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I have a serious answer for that. There's three ways to do it.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You can link your Facebook account. You can link your Twitter account.

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And then once you do that it'll show you here's all your friends on Facebook on Miitomo.

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Here's all your mutual Twitter followers on Miitomo as well.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And you can add people that way. I think that's the way most people did it.

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wow that's pretty cool. Why can't they do that on their stupid consoles?

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well.

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I wish they did have friend codes though.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Maybe this is the thing that's going to happen for NX. Maybe.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Just give them a little credit.

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Alan is asking about the QR code. That is just to import someone's Mii to use in photos.

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Correct.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So that doesn't do the friend sharing. I wish that you could do friend sharing via QR or a friend code because I have people who actually are not on social media who play Miitomo.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The only other way you can do it. There's a thing called I think Bump. But you have to be in the same room.

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because it uses the GPS to figure out who's near each other.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So if you're near each other and then you tap the same symbol. It's like clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades. Like from a deck of cards.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You both tap the same symbol. Like syncing a Bluetooth or something.

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then it'll say okay here's all the people that have the same symbol and range.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It'll say nasties have been bumped. You're welcome.

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's that?

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It'll say nasties have been bumped. You're welcome.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Nasties have been bumped.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh lord. Alright. Yeah so there you go. That's Miitomo.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So again the bar was low but I enjoy it more than I thought I would. I really do.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So I paid actual money for Tomodachi Life and now I'm kind of pissed off.

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Like if Miitomo made me angry at anything it made me angry I spent money on Tomodachi Life.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well that's something you're just going to live with.

236
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah that is. That's the consequence I'm going to have to live with. I'm just going to have to sit here and think about what I've done.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Perhaps you'll learn your lesson this time.

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Never. Never. How many games are in your Steam library?

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Plenty.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Have you stopped buying Steam games?

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I haven't bought Steam games in a while.

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I still have to finish Danganronpa.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Not to say they haven't shopped for them.

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I've been so busy.

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Like they're in there telling me I should play Project Egg Zone 2.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm like I don't have time. I still have to finish Danganronpa and I have stuff I'm being paid to do.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Speaking of Steam. So we've got two weeks to catch up on right?

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I wasn't. We weren't here last week because I wasn't here last week so the Studio OLR was locked.

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So Dark Soccer's at the front door. Let me in.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Actually I think she has a key but I digress.

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't think I have a key anymore.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I was not here because Alan and I went to Tucson to visit some friends of ours that live there.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And we thought well there's also this Ingress event going on in Tucson.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's do a twofer. We'll do both. We'll get the most bang for our buck. We'll do the Ingress thing.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Which I'm not going to get into all the details about that because I know a lot of you don't play and that's fine.

256
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But that was intense with so many people in one place playing the same game and yelling out like audibles from team to team.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Recharge! Recharge! Drop it! Drop it! They took it! They took it! Deploy! Deploy! Shield! Shield! Axle! Ultra!

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
People are just like what the fuck is going on?

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh you should see the people that have no idea what they walked into.

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay here's one funny story I'll tell that everybody can appreciate.

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So one of the nodes that ended up being called a volatile node which means it was worth double points.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
One of them was at a federal building.

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Keep in mind which node did my team get assigned to? The federal building.

264
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So we're all there on a Saturday. Now you don't have to go inside the building.

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But it was right outside the building.

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it was a hot day so we were like we're just going to go stand under in the shade.

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So we did. We all went and went and stand under in the shade.

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And so we're all doing our thing. Deploy! Deploy!

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We're being very careful not to use the words blow it up.

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Because in the game that's what you fire little lasers you blow.

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But we were very careful. Do not say the words blow it up.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Do the opposite of recharging.

273
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes do the opposite of recharging.

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So we were very very careful with the words that we used.

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
However there was still a security guard on Saturday.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And the security guard actually came up and said.

277
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You know actually they were super nice about it.

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Like they weren't like a douchebag security guard.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think they were like hey I know you guys are doing like some weird game thing here.

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I can see all the people around town.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But got to have you 50 feet away from the building or whatever.

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know so they were really cool about it.

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But like okay. Niantic.

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Maybe in the future don't fucking put volatiles at federal buildings.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
On a Saturday.

286
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So yeah I didn't but I didn't think about that.

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It was just funny.

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So that was Ingress in a nutshell.

289
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But we went to Tucson.

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And I will say a quick little aside about Tucson.

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't know if we have any listeners there.

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Besides you know my friends that live there.

293
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But one of the days we were there we were walking around the street fair.

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The 4th Avenue Street Fair.

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Which you know had a ton of vendors.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But right in that same area there was actually a pinball arcade.

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It was nothing but pinball.

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well maybe like two maim type machines.

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But most of it was pinball games.

300
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And I was pretty impressed.

301
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
In fact I was like Dark Sakura needs to see this.

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sure she's probably seen all these machines at some point in her life.

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But still to see them all in one place outside of a convention or something is still pretty impressive.

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Did you happen to see the picture I put on Instagram Dark Sakura?

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There was like a ton of pinball games in this place.

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It was pretty nice.

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I didn't find.

308
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah I didn't see it.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It was cool.

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There was a lot of different games there.

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So what did I play?

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh I played a Star Trek machine.

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Not the next generation but the original Star Trek.

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But not the movie Star Trek.

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So I played that machine.

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I know that one.

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Because I'm a nerd.

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's not a Gottlieb is it?

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't remember.

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It has the transporter animation.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah I know what you're talking about.

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's like from like 83 or something.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah it's definitely an 80's machine.

325
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But it was fun.

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So I played that and watched my friends play some other games.

327
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So I was pretty impressed by that little pinball museum they had there.

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So that is my gaming thing there.

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But also my friends in Tucson owned a Steam Link.

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And I'd never seen one before.

331
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But my friend was playing.

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh now I can't remember.

333
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What's that game?

334
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It was a Kickstarter game and it like just came out in the past couple weeks.

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Pixel art style.

336
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Zelda-esque but really really hard.

337
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Somebody in chat will know what I'm talking about.

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
By the way it's Bally.

339
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay thank you.

340
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's Red something I think is in the title.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So somebody in chat will know over at live.com.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You mean Hyperlight Drifter?

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is that it?

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hyperlight Drifter.

345
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes that is it.

346
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hyperlight Drifter.

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That is the game.

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So I was watching him play that through Steam Link on the TV.

349
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Because I guess he was running it on the computer upstairs.

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And playing it on the big screen downstairs.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I was kind of like huh this is kind of neat.

352
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I'm like so these things are only like 50 bucks?

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah.

354
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Alright shit I'm going to get one.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So we bought a Steam Link.

356
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So when I was teasing you about your Steam Library.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We were actually we bought a Steam Link and we were using that a little bit.

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And yeah I was going through the library going wow.

359
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I have all these games I don't think I've ever even touched.

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But now I can play them on the Steam Link.

361
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So that's pretty cool.

362
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay I'm stupid it was Data East.

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Hmm.

364
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The pinball.

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh I think.

366
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No because Bally had the license and Data East had the license and Data East did I think the later one.

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah.

368
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So sorry I didn't mean to.

369
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I should know my pinball better.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Bobby Blackwolf says also got a Steam Controller.

372
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I considered getting the controller I just didn't end up.

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I was like nah I knew the Xbox One controllers worked.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So I was like eh that'll be good enough.

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We had a Steam Link and we returned it.

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah I know you guys I remember because before we bought it you said you guys didn't care for it.

377
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What was the negative?

378
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well I thought it was neat and Dan's the one who really played it more than I did.

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I really didn't get a chance to.

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But some of the games there was like way too much lag between our computers and because he was actually playing it off of my Steam Library.

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And I wouldn't say that my computer is like well at least my gaming rig is probably the best that ever existed.

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But when he tried to play like I think more advanced games there was definitely some lag.

383
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And so he's just like yeah this.

384
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He returned it didn't consult me but.

385
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Well you can borrow ours someday maybe.

386
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But well I.

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Were you wired on that.

388
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Or wireless.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't remember I think he did it wirelessly.

390
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
See we're wired on ours because we thought that might be a problem.

391
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But since the rooms are next to each other we knew we could run a long cord around the wall and that's what we did.

392
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And so it's wired.

393
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And so I think that does make a huge difference because I can imagine if it's wireless you're going to get the stop and go and the things that come with wireless networking.

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So yeah.

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But wired is great.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So I've already made a decision though that I'm going to get a controller for my Apple TV.

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because you can get the DuckTales game on Apple TV.

398
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh that's right.

399
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's actually getting a lot more games.

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah the whole like there there's just a ton of stuff that will broadcast to TV now I always get these pop ups on my computers.

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Get the Nvidia Shield it will do because you know because I have the driver.

402
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No I'm just like well yeah I know I'm like what do I need it for I have a steam link now like that literally I did I didn't even really need it.

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I just was like well it might be fun and it's neat.

404
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But yeah that's it.

405
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So yeah that's why we didn't have a show last week I was out of town.

406
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So we've been without a show for a couple weeks or just two weeks we've been one week without a show.

407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But we are back today and we'll continue to be throughout the next few weeks on Sundays.

408
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No no shows off that we see in the future until like Labor Day weekend when I'm out of town in Atlanta Dragon Con.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So we have plenty of shows coming up for you guys over the coming weeks.

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Which an interesting kind of aside you might remember a few weeks ago I was talking about that we were having issues on Stitcher.

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And like Stitcher hadn't updated our show since like what like February or something.

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well all of a sudden I guess the backlog got caught up.

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And I think what happened is I think enough people because somebody actually contacted us on Facebook going.

414
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hey I'm trying to get your show on Stitcher and I can't.

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's just like I'm kind of like in this place where it's like I'm so frustrated not obviously the feedback.

416
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm not frustrated the feedback is completely valid I'm frustrated there's like nothing I can do.

417
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I've pinged Stitcher I've tried to update our URL and all this stuff.

418
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I was like hey can you email Stitcher and tell them you miss us because it's kind of out of our control.

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Well I guess that person did that and maybe enough people did that where finally it got updated so yay to that.

420
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But yeah so at least there's that.

421
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The people that thought our show just ended because they were listening on Stitcher at least got like eight more episodes.

422
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So hopefully they didn't miss us as bad last week when we really didn't have a show this last week.

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But I will remind everybody please please consider following us on Twitter.

424
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook.

425
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio especially the Twitter because when we don't have a show we'll let you know.

426
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Like you know and if this show heaven forbid were to ever end or stop.

427
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We'll let you know on social media that hey the last episode is happening come show up and say goodbye.

428
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You know we'll give you some advance we will do everything we can to give you advance notice.

429
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And not just surprise you one week like gotcha we're gone forever.

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So anyway Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the last episode of OLR is happening.

431
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What some day some day but just not today.

432
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I hope I hope you know this is the last episode for this week.

433
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes it is.

434
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
This is the very last episode of OLR for this week.

435
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Alright Dr. Suyin in chat says I won't know what to do with my Sunday nights at 6.

436
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh God neither would I.

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
After doing this for what we're almost on 14 years.

438
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
There was a few months ago remember when I was sick.

439
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We missed a show because I was like really sick.

440
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Like I'm sitting here Sunday night going I have nothing to do.

441
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Like I guess I'll play a video game or something.

442
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Like I'm sick and there's no show and my life sucks right now.

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Like what am I going to do on my Sunday night.

444
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So believe me I understand how you feel.

445
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
One other thing I definitely want to talk about at the top of the show here.

446
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And then we'll get into our gaming weeks and we have plenty of news and all that stuff.

447
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But absolutely we have to talk about the event we were at yesterday.

448
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So even though you didn't get an OLR last week.

449
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We were broadcasting all day long yesterday from the SAC Indie Arcade Gaming Expo in West Sacramento.

450
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And of course if you heard the last episode of Orange Andreo.

451
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We already talked about the event at length because Gabe and Bree were here in studio during our last episode.

452
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So we talked a lot about it and so the event actually happened on Saturday.

453
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So we were broadcasting all day.

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Although admittedly we didn't really have a lot to do.

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But that's a good thing because the speakers were pretty much non-stop throughout the day.

456
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So you were pretty much getting the speakers and we would chime in once in a while.

457
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But there was just so much other talent there.

458
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
There wasn't a lot for us to do but kind of just make sure things were still moving.

459
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But it just also is a testament to how smoothly run that show is.

460
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And I got to say and I told this to Gabe and Bree and anybody I could.

461
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Like the growth of the event from last year to this year was so noticeable.

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Not just the venue. I mean and nothing against the space last year.

463
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Because the Cafe Colonial they have been so supportive for the whole thing.

464
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But the reality is it just outgrew that space.

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And so they had to find a new space.

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
There would have been no way it would have fit in the old space.

467
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But now they're in that West Sacramento Community Center.

468
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Which was an interesting layout because we were joking on Bobby's show.

469
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's like, oh there's a room over here.

470
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's like the game board of Clue.

471
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
There's a room over here and there's a secret passage from the conservatory to the dining room.

472
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Like there's just all this crazy stuff.

473
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I was mentioning to Loki that walking backstage was like, it's like a secret passage.

474
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It was.

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And like I was sneaking out through doors and whatnot and yeah it was great.

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So yeah and a big testament too to the West Sacramento, the community and the city that was putting that on.

477
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Because I got to say you know we had dedicated help to making sure that OLR would get up and running.

478
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And I got to be honest I'm not often used to that.

479
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Not that I do these events every day.

480
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But like somebody was dedicated to making sure, do we have everything we need?

481
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Do we have the wired internet? Is our sound okay? Is all that stuff?

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So the reason why when we went up at 10.15 and everything sounded great is because we had help from the venue right there.

483
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Any questions we had they worked out.

484
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They were like yeah run the wire through here.

485
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The router's back over here and we can use your sound.

486
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It was just awesome.

487
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But anyway the event of course they had lots of indie games from developers here in the Sacramento area.

488
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
As well as some in the Bay Area and even I think somebody from San Diego was there.

489
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And so there were all these local folks showing off their games.

490
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And there was everything from tablet games to Wii U games to VR.

491
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The Vive was there.

492
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
To someone creating their own system.

493
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yes. I think that was that 3D conceptual thing right? With the tic-tac-toe.

494
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah there was that.

495
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And did you see what was right next to that?

496
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The big like they would put the key.

497
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know what that was.

498
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay so what that was, I think they were wearing a VR thing.

499
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And they had gloves and boots strapped to them.

500
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And it was like a, no they didn't have a VR headset on.

501
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No they didn't have a VR headset on.

502
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They were just dressed up like it and they would knock over like cardboard.

503
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah the game was You Are Godzilla.

504
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And there was actual cardboard boxes that were set up on the ground.

505
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And as you, like there were sensors in the boxes and as you would knock shit over.

506
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Like it was doing stuff in the game.

507
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Like it would be like combo and like all this stuff.

508
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I was like, okay I don't know what practical use something like that has.

509
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Like that's not something you're really ever going to have in a house.

510
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But boy is it a fucking great party game.

511
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Like that was a lot of fun to watch.

512
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And the kids were really into it.

513
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But yeah they got suited up in this whole thing.

514
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And were tearing down virtual buildings.

515
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And I thought that was awesome.

516
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So there was just so much creativity there.

517
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But we were up in a theater room that was called the black box.

518
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Because that's what it was.

519
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It was a theater that's like the box type theater.

520
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And the room was black.

521
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
In fact we joked during the day.

522
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I know this doesn't come out very well on radio.

523
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But we kept joking about mood lighting.

524
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That's because since it was a theater room.

525
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
For a lot of the day it was pitch black in there.

526
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Except you'd have that lone spotlight shining from the ceiling.

527
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's supposed to light actors that are on the stage.

528
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Which makes a lot of sense for the play.

529
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But for the speakers it was a little like we were like sitting in the dark.

530
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And I think even Loki was kind of like I'm falling asleep over here.

531
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's too dark.

532
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So it wasn't good for me to like with as little sleep as I get in a very dark room.

533
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Right?

534
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
With somebody giving a very soothing talk.

535
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like I had two Red Bulls and it still was not enough to keep me awake.

536
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Like I gotta go downstairs or something.

537
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Look the talks were awesome.

538
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And props to all the speakers.

539
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And this is nothing I didn't joke with Gabe and Bree about beforehand.

540
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But I was like okay guys.

541
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
When you announced the list of speakers.

542
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I was like okay this sounds cool.

543
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But I don't know any of these people.

544
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I was like can I get bio cards.

545
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Because I don't know any of these people to introduce or whatever.

546
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So I was like okay.

547
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But they all gave great talks.

548
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
All of them gave great talks.

549
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And I learned a lot myself.

550
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And so I said at the end of the day.

551
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I said okay.

552
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You know what.

553
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Not that I ever doubted you guys.

554
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But considering I did not know those people.

555
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
A. I got to network and meet all those people.

556
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And you know that was great networking opportunities and so forth.

557
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Just to meet awesome people that do different things in the game industry and mingle with them.

558
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But B.

559
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Like all of them were prepared.

560
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
All of them had a great concept behind their talk.

561
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And I felt like I even learned a thing or two.

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I was really honored that we could bring that to a larger audience at VOG Network.

563
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm just sorry that probably more people didn't realize it was going on.

564
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Because we only have so big of an audience here at OLR.

565
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But I think gamers on a wider scale everywhere.

566
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Could really benefit from hearing a publisher talk about what a publisher really does.

567
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And why devs may want a publisher.

568
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And what a publisher can do for them.

569
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Because I think so many people pass opinions on companies like EA.

570
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Konami and so forth that are publishers.

571
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Without necessarily really knowing what a publisher is.

572
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know what I mean.

573
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And we may or may not have been guilty of something like that.

574
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I still argue that perception is.

575
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I have a decent idea what publishers do.

576
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah but still.

577
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Regardless of how educated or not you are on that.

578
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It was still neat to hear it from somebody's mouth like that.

579
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And it wasn't just some guy from EA or some big big publisher.

580
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But it was I'm an indie publisher essentially.

581
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So that was one talk in particular I thought was good.

582
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
There was another gentleman that talked a lot about biases that you have in developing games.

583
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And it's not that you're a jerk or that you're intentionally out to be biased.

584
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But it's just that your backgrounds lend to your perceptions.

585
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
There's that word again.

586
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The way you may perceive certain things and what you might end up putting in your game.

587
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So you have to be more aware.

588
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So I thought it was just so much interesting stuff throughout the day.

589
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So big big props to everybody involved with Sac Indie Arcade.

590
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We are going to look at putting that out there as a podcast.

591
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Getting those audio files out there for you guys so you can download that and listen to it later.

592
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Because again I really would love to see more people be able to check this stuff out.

593
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
My brain just put two words together.

594
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Audio files for audio files.

595
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes. It's something like that.

596
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Absolutely.

597
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I tried to do the Periscope thing.

598
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I actually did a Periscope.

599
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Did that work well in a pitch black room like that?

600
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Believe it or not yes because the slides came through.

601
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Here's where it didn't work well because I never had a Periscope on the OLR account.

602
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I couldn't get the name OLR even though that's our Twitter name.

603
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So I got Orange Lounge Radio and I just assumed it cross posted to the OLR account but it didn't.

604
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So I was wondering why like maybe one or two people were watching the whole time.

605
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But it's because unless you were like our friend on Periscope right off the bat you had no idea that we were doing the Periscope.

606
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So I did learn some little things like that.

607
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I remember friending you on Periscope but for some reason I still got the notification on that.

608
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Well I did it from the OLR account not my Rob Roberts account.

609
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well that's a mess.

610
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Anyway.

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So there's that.

612
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So but anyway we had a great time and massive props to everybody involved.

613
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And I look forward to working with the IGDA here locally on more things.

614
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You know Gabe and Bree and we've all talked about we need to do this more than once a year.

615
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And absolutely so stay tuned.

616
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We'll do that more often.

617
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But a big hello and thanks for checking us out to anybody who may have found us at the Sac&D Arcade Gaming Expo.

618
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hope you enjoy what you hear here at the Voice Geeks Network.

619
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
There's plenty of other podcasts and great shows out there that talk about all sorts of different topics.

620
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Not just video games. We have shows on anime, shows on Power Rangers, shows on British television,

621
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
geek culture, trying new foods from crazy places and eating them.

622
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Like there's just there's all sorts of shows on the network.

623
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So you can check out the complete lineup at vognetwork.com.

624
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But if you're new to Orange Lounge Radio just briefly the concept.

625
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Loki Dark Soccer and myself we all met like 15 years ago.

626
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Let that sink in for a minute.

627
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We all met like 15 years ago playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade here.

628
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And we used to play DDR on what Wednesday nights.

629
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I think it was like the big DDR night.

630
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And then we would go to the diner that was in the parking lot and we would talk about video games.

631
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Because it was the one thing we all shared the one thing we all had in common.

632
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
We would talk about video games for a couple hours.

633
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
At one point we just had the idea.

634
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Hey what if we like took the diner conversation and put them on the internet so we could have them with all the diners.

635
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And that was pretty much what OLR ended up being.

636
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So welcome to the show and hope you enjoy it.

637
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase PICKLE.

638
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Alright well we talked about a lot there in the opening.

639
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But we do like to kick off all of our shows with a little check in on how was your gaming week.

640
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And what types of video games have you been playing this week.

641
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So Dark Soccer starting with you.

642
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
How was your gaming week?

643
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It was alright.

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I mean apart from having the expo yesterday which I played Mo & Go and a few other games.

645
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I also played a little Danganronpa just a little bit.

646
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What else did I play?

647
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

648
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And a lot of Ingress.

649
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
A lot of Miitomo.

650
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Dragon Age.

651
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Heroes of Dragon Age whatever that is.

652
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And that Kingdom Hearts game that was boring but okay.

653
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What is it?

654
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What are you doing it?

655
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You just run around killing things and going on these quests.

656
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
How do you control it?

657
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Is it like a platformer?

658
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah well not really a platformer.

659
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
More like you just direct them where they need to go.

660
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You swipe the screen to kill stuff.

661
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It was just really boring.

662
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh.

663
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's cute.

664
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I really don't like the style.

665
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I like the scenes and everything but I don't like the player characters.

666
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because the style doesn't look like Kingdom Hearts.

667
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It looks like we asked some developer in Singapore to make this.

668
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The game.

669
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So don't waste your money.

670
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Don't waste your time.

671
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I mean it's free.

672
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think it's free.

673
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's free to download but I'm sure there's plenty of energy refills.

674
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah it's boring as fuck.

675
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Don't worry about it.

676
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Alright.

677
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Act F points out it's a Theatrhythm style.

678
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I knew it did kind of have a familiar look to it.

679
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So it's like the Theatrhythm style.

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
See Theatrhythm though is actually a good game.

681
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
This.

682
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Boring.

683
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Alright.

684
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Fair enough.

685
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Everybody's entitled to their opinion.

686
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I haven't played it yet so I have none.

687
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

688
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I played quite a bit in the last few weeks.

689
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Let's see.

690
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I played.

691
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They had new DLC come out for Lego Avengers.

692
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So I played all three DLC levels that they had.

693
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
They had like the.

694
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm trying to think who it was here.

695
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
They had the Ant-Man stuff so that was kind of cool.

696
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And then.

697
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The Masters of Evil.

698
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So they had their group with Baron Zemo.

699
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And then classic like Captain Marvel.

700
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And so I played through those.

701
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And they were okay.

702
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't know.

703
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's kind of.

704
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They had a level with like you know trophies and stuff you could get but.

705
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It was kind of odd though like I still didn't unlock the trophies even though I got everything.

706
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I think you had to get everything and finish the level at the same time.

707
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Cause I was like oh okay well I got everything I'm gonna quit the level cause you still get credit for it.

708
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But you know.

709
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I guess that was the issue there.

710
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And then I played.

711
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You know cause shame on me.

712
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I played Amplitude.

713
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
There was.

714
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Some issue with how it was on the.

715
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Sony online store.

716
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And I may have exploited that to get it for free so I did play it.

717
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's alright.

718
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I don't know.

719
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Probably would have been pissed off if I had actually paid for that.

720
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But it's alright.

721
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's a decent music game.

722
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Then.

723
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Let's see what else did I buy.

724
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I just recently picked up cause I had watched.

725
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I've been looking at all the stuff that they have like their.

726
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The Sony store stuff with the different games that they're releasing.

727
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Still thinking about purchasing Day of the Tentacle cause that looks awesome.

728
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It is awesome cause I've played it before but.

729
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I was like eh I just really want to buy it again just to play through it again.

730
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Maybe still will.

731
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But I saw Enter the Gungeon on there and I was like okay well what the hell is this.

732
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Something that.

733
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's kind of a funny name.

734
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
They've got a pun in the name.

735
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So I checked out the trailer.

736
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I was like eh this is alright.

737
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You know kind of cool.

738
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But I kept reading reviews on it and like everybody was really.

739
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Liking it.

740
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So I said okay fine I'll go ahead and pick it up and.

741
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Download it.

742
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So I downloaded it last night and.

743
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh my god it's a fucking awesome game.

744
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's just this like rogue-lite.

745
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You know kind of Binding of Isaac type of game.

746
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's basically bullet hell but you're kind of running around like Smash TV and stuff.

747
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And it's got awesome music and the art style and it's like really.

748
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's like cutesy and like strange I guess.

749
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't know like.

750
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
All the.

751
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The whole game is basically gun themed.

752
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Gun themed.

753
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So like you know you're entering the Gungeon which is this giant bullet.

754
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And all the enemies are bullets and they're shooting guns.

755
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That are like associated with their bullets and stuff.

756
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And just.

757
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I don't know.

758
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And the weapons are ridiculous.

759
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What was the name of this again?

760
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Enter the Gungeon.

761
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Enter the Gungeon.

762
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And.

763
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's just it's really fucking hard though.

764
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Like because it's bullet hell.

765
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I mean there's like bullets all over the goddamn screen.

766
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And you know where it takes good timing to be able to do well in the game.

767
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I've only played it a little bit.

768
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I got to play to see two of the bosses so far.

769
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
One was like this pigeon type character with this minigun.

770
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And then the Bullet King.

771
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Which was pretty cool.

772
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Because I was showing my son.

773
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I was trying to explain the game to him.

774
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So I just showed him that.

775
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then.

776
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
What else?

777
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I played actual Minecraft last night on the Playstation 4 because it's been a while.

778
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Nice.

779
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And my son's played it a little bit.

780
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So I was like okay I want to check out and see what's different.

781
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I'm like holy crap.

782
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
There's a lot of shit that's different on this.

783
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So I played a little bit of that.

784
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And what else?

785
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
A little bit of Ingress but not really that much because I've been trying to cut back on that.

786
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Just playing on my way to and from work.

787
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And that's about it.

788
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I think that's everything.

789
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
God I don't know.

790
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm sure I've played Fallout 4 somewhere.

791
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah.

792
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think that's everything.

793
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Alright.

794
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If that's it for your gaming week I'll talk a little bit about mine.

795
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Although honestly I pretty much.

796
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I talked about all the big stuff I wanted to talk about already.

797
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You know with Miitomo and all that other stuff.

798
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But there is still one big game I played this week that I have to talk about here in my gaming week.

799
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And that is.

800
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Quantum Break came out on the Xbox One.

801
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Finally right?

802
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The successor in many ways to Alan Wake from Remedy came out on Xbox One this week.

803
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And I was looking forward to the game even though admittedly I didn't really know a lot about it.

804
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Because they didn't really tell us a lot about the game.

805
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Except for some of the motion capture and all this stuff.

806
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So I played through at least the first little chapter and I think I'm about halfway through the second.

807
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I should be a lot further but it's just been such a busy weekend and everything else going on.

808
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That's really all I've had time to play.

809
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But I gotta say.

810
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I think it's awesome.

811
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I think Quantum Break is so cool.

812
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's basically in the story it has to do with time travel.

813
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And you kind of get stuck in a time thing where you can now manipulate time.

814
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm overly stupidly simplifying it for the sake of time.

815
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But you actually can.

816
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The game itself is kind of like a shooter in a way.

817
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Because you know you're bang bang.

818
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You aim and you fire.

819
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It reminds me a little bit of Mass Effect.

820
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Kind of in that regard.

821
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Like the way it controls.

822
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But you can use cool little time bendy things to either protect yourself like with a time shield.

823
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You can do a force time bubble on the enemies.

824
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So you can shoot them with a ton of bullets.

825
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And then when the force time bubble wears off all the bullets go through at once.

826
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So you hit them all at once. That's kind of fun.

827
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And you do all these force dashes and all these things.

828
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So you got all these weird powers that are just explained through the magic of time.

829
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But then the game also has this element where, and I'm sure some of you guys have heard about this.

830
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Where there's actually a TV show that occurs.

831
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So once you beat the first chapter you have to make a tell tale style decision.

832
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That's all I'll say is that you have to make a decision.

833
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Do you want to do A or do you want to do B?

834
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And it's a big decision that's going to impact the game.

835
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And once you make the decision it shows you.

836
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Here's all your friends that chose to do the same thing as you and you're in this percentage of the users or whatever.

837
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But that decision is going to impact the TV show that you're going to see.

838
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And then you watch like a 20 minute Netflix style show that ties into the game that you're playing.

839
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's just this is somebody else's perspective instead of the main characters that you're playing for most of the time.

840
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The TV show is here's somebody else.

841
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But then that big decision is not the only thing that plays into the TV show.

842
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There's other elements that will change the TV show.

843
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,000
For example in the very first level and since the very first level I don't consider this a spoiler and it's not really a huge element of the story anyway.

844
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I found like a formula on the wall that my character finished basically writing out.

845
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And it gave the little icon in a butterfly effect for those of you that have played Until Dawn.

846
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
A butterfly effectish kind of way where it says that's going to come back later.

847
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So I finished the formula and it's like that's going to be remembered.

848
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And then when I was watching the TV show there's this conversation that's happening between two characters where they go.

849
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah I found out when I came into work this morning that somebody had finished the formula.

850
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Was that you? No.

851
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So they're actually talking about something that happened in the game but it's happening in this seamless TV show.

852
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So I have to admit okay that's kind of rad.

853
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't remember seeing things like that until like way back in the day when it was like CD-ROMs.

854
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And the movie files from the CD-ROMs that would play would change maybe depending on what you did in the game.

855
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But this uses, get this, streaming. That's how it does it.

856
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Is it streaming it all from online so that way the branching is all seamless for those types of decisions.

857
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's streaming like Netflix would.

858
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Disclaimer though, if you have a shitty connection you can download the entire set of the movie files.

859
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You ready for this? 72 gigabytes if you want to download the movies.

860
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
72 gigabytes. Maybe it was more. 72's the number that jumps in my head was at least 70.

861
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So you can download the movies if you're worried about the streaming thing or you're worried about the loss of quality or something.

862
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But I don't know how you're going to download 70 gigs worth of show if you can't stream it.

863
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So just something to consider.

864
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That's going to turn some people off I think what I just said.

865
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But if you're using your Xbox One for Netflix, you're fine.

866
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And I think a lot of you are using your Xbox One or your PlayStation 4 for Netflix.

867
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So what I just said shouldn't concern you because it's essentially doing the same thing.

868
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But I really like how the one plays into the other and I just think the game itself is a lot of fun to play.

869
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
What's interesting is that I've been reading reviews on it online and I really shouldn't do that.

870
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But I can't help it sometimes because I want to know if other people are as enthusiastic about the game as I am.

871
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And it turns out, no. The game is actually getting mixed reviews.

872
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And some people are saying that the shooter is an okay shooter and the movie segment is an okay movie.

873
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Well let me tell you from my perspective, I don't play a lot of shooter games.

874
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Admittedly, it's not usually my genre.

875
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I think that actually plays in my favor on why I like Quantum Break more.

876
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And yes, you can set the difficulty in Quantum Break. I'm playing on easy mode. No shame in that.

877
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
No shame in playing in Bobby Black Wolf mode. I'm still enjoying the story. That's what I'm there for.

878
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And I have not been super challenged in the game.

879
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I've come close, I've had scary moments, but I feel like using the powers and everything, I still feel like I'm not just pressing A to advance the story.

880
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I am playing a game here, even on easy mode.

881
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So I enjoy the shooter well enough and I like all those time-based elements.

882
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And I think the show, I don't know if I get all the reads on the show being a bad show.

883
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I think if you're into the story, I think the show is good.

884
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Is it a little low budget? Yeah, but it's way more than what we've ever had for a video game that I can recall.

885
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's on par with a Netflix or Amazon series, in my opinion.

886
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's fine. The budget stuff doesn't really worry me so much.

887
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I don't get the reads on the whole fact that the budget looks really, really low budget.

888
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Because I'm like, do you play video games? Because a lot of times movies look low budget.

889
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Is it at the level of SimCity Action News?

890
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Nothing will ever be at the level of SimCity Action News, unfortunately.

891
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
For those that have ever played the SimCity CD-ROM game, that is the best movie acting.

892
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
No, nothing. You can't attain the unachievable, Loki. It's just not going to happen.

893
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But it's pretty darn good. It's pretty darn good.

894
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I would actually say the acting is a little bit better than it is in the SimCity CD-ROM game.

895
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So there's that.

896
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Alright. Go into a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

897
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Kaijuto says, this game sounds like it's a ripoff of Timeshift.

898
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Just get Timeshift for super cheap and you'll see it's the better game.

899
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I would actually say it's more of a ripoff of Alan Wake and Max Payne.

900
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But they can do that. Because those were Remedy's other games.

901
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I really feel like the TV show element, you saw some of that in Alan Wake.

902
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But they really took that to the next level with Quantum Break.

903
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So that's why I think in some ways this game really is a successor to Alan Wake.

904
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And it's important because TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.

905
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yes. Which is what the Xbox One was all about originally.

906
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Now I'm starting to see that vision.

907
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I have to admit, I think it's a pretty cool thing to watch.

908
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And I'm very curious what happens in the show if I picked the other option.

909
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Because I'll tell you what, again, I don't want to spoil anything.

910
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But it's very obvious if I had gone the other way, a character would not be alive if I'd gone the other way.

911
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That character is in the TV show.

912
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So, what would have been different?

913
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So it makes me curious enough to kind of want to go back and play again.

914
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So, alright.

915
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Let's see.

916
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Over at, oh and this is interesting.

917
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Kaizhudo continues over at Live.Vognor.com.

918
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
No, I would never buy an Xbox One. I said, it sounds like.

919
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I would actually say, Quantum Break is an Xbox One exclusive worthy of your attention.

920
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
If you're on the fence, like, what exclusives does Xbox have that I can't get on PlayStation 4?

921
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I think Quantum Break is one you ought to consider.

922
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's not going to be for everybody. It's probably not a game for Kaizhudo.

923
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The Windows 10 version, right?

924
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah, but we'll get into that later in the show.

925
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Because the Windows 10 version, there might be a couple problems there.

926
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But, as far as the Xbox One is, between Rise of the Tomb Raider, Halo 5, if you're into that.

927
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I really think Quantum Break is an exclusive that you need to consider.

928
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Like, Quantum Break is a much bigger deal than Knack on the PlayStation 4.

929
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And look, I love my PlayStation 4 and they've got a ton of great games over there.

930
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But I'm just saying, some exclusives are no big deal.

931
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Rise on the Xbox One, also not really something to scream and shout about, right?

932
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
To be fair, I'll name one of those.

933
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Quantum Break is one worthy of your attention.

934
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
On Xbox One, I'm just saying. I believe it.

935
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Alright, anyhow.

936
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I was going to mention real quick, one thing I forgot to mention in my gaming week.

937
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
What was that?

938
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So, PlayStation 3.5 came out, which means that you can stream to your PC.

939
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah.

940
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I was super excited about that, because I was like, I'm all sweet, I'm going to stream to my laptop, it's going to be awesome.

941
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It fucking sucks ass!

942
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Does it really?

943
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
To be honest, though, it's probably not the PlayStation's fault, it's my fucking laptop's fault.

944
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But it does not fucking work at all.

945
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So you have to have a-

946
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It is laggy as shit.

947
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't have a wired connection on my PlayStation.

948
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh, you're even- oh, that was the next thing I was going to ask. Are you running wired?

949
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I mean, my laptop's not wired, so I guess there could be bottleneck there, but it was-

950
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, especially if your laptop is not beefy enough, that's probably the bottom line.

951
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I mean, I may try it again to wire it, because my router is just across the room.

952
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I could do that, but I don't feel like I should need to.

953
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Well, with something that intensive, wired is always going to be better.

954
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But like, I don't know, I thought it would work just fine, because I thought I did that before the Vita, and it worked fine.

955
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Maybe I was doing PlayStation 3, I don't know.

956
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But yeah, it didn't work for me. I was disappointed.

957
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I have not done- admittedly, I have not done that PlayStation 4 streaming thing yet.

958
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I was going to try it, but honestly, I've just been super into Quantum Break.

959
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
When I do have time to sit on the couch and play a game, I want to play Quantum Break until I finish it, because I'm into the story.

960
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But I'm curious about the whole PlayStation 4 streaming thing.

961
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But I've done the Xbox One streaming thing to Windows 10, and I thought that worked really well.

962
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I was playing, of all things, Dungeon Siege 3 a few weeks ago.

963
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Because that was like the games for gold thing on 360 backwards compatibility.

964
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So I was playing that on my computer, because I wanted to chat with Alan or something, so I didn't want to be on the couch.

965
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So I was playing over the stream, and it was great.

966
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, I'd be totally down with that, because I had a lot of games on Xbox 360.

967
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'd love to have them backwards compatible, but I don't have an Xbox One.

968
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Apparently not a laptop strong enough to stream at, I guess.

969
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Alright. Well anyway, we've got to move on and get into some news.

970
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Some housekeeping tonight. I think I've pretty much already thrown everything out there.

971
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'll just reiterate. Please follow us on Twitter.

975
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
We need to get into some news, however. It's that time, so let's do it.

976
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Getting into this week in news, because we missed a busy week last week, I'll tell you that much.

977
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And then there's more going on this week, so we're going to try to at least cover what happened this week. Loki.

978
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I do apologize in advance. I have some chest cold thing that is really making me very- it's difficult to breathe and not cough.

979
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That's okay, these things happen. Oh, I should say this.

980
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You remember everybody was saying a couple weeks ago that one of the- well, actually, you weren't here.

981
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You've been gone for like a month, Loki.

982
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah, unfortunately. I had to put a door in last week.

983
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Welcome back!

984
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And then at Easter, and like-

985
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Okay, so during the show last week, my mic was cutting out bad. Like, it was shorting, basically, the whole thing.

986
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So, some people were like noticeably saying like, Rob, that mic is fucked.

987
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So, I will say this. Hopefully, you all notice, I have a new microphone.

988
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I did get a brand new microphone.

989
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
The guest mic has been replaced as well, because we have four mics in the studio.

990
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Dark Soccer and Loki were fine, so I didn't replace theirs.

991
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Plus, I felt a little better buying two at a time, as opposed to four.

992
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So, I'll replace those two next.

993
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
But yeah, I am on a new microphone.

994
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We actually used them for the first time yesterday, which was a really kind of crazy thing to do, because what if it was crappy?

995
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But I just- I had the old mics just in case, but yeah, it ended up working out great.

996
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So yeah, I'm on a new mic tonight, and hopefully sound better than I did a couple weeks ago.

997
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So anyway, now we can get into some news. Loki.

998
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Alright, so let's talk about rumors!

999
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Everybody likes rumors. Well, this is apparently rumor regarding the new Zelda game.

1000
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Guess what? I know this is going to be shocking to you, but it's rumored to be coming out on the Wii U and NX.

1001
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Really? Because I didn't totally see this coming out on the NX, because it's been pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.

1002
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But this is- I guess the source of this is from Emily Rogers, who leaked I guess the existence of a new Paper Mario game on Wii U before they announced Color Splash.

1003
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And some of the things that go along with that.

1004
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Apparently not only is it going to be on both systems, but you may have the choice to play as either a male or female character in the game.

1005
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And that they're going to have voice acting for the other characters in the game as well.

1006
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Except for Link, who I guess is not going to talk.

1007
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So, neat I guess? I don't know, most modern games have that.

1008
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm sitting at this going, it's not a big deal, but some people on the internet, being the internet, want to make it a big deal.

1009
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:42,000
But when I say it's not a big deal, I completely understand if you are the girl who wants to see more representation of yourself in games, and you want to be a female Link.

1010
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm not saying it's not a big deal there, I'm just saying that this option, this is Mass Effect to me, it's not a big deal.

1011
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And in fact, considering how well the internet responded to Linkle, if I'm the guy designing- I'm not saying that female Link is going to be Linkle, but if I'm the person designing the Zelda and going, wow, everybody loves Linkle.

1012
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Let's be honest, though, about Linkle, okay? I thought the character looked cool, but the way that she's treated in the game, it's ridiculous. She's a goddamn idiot.

1013
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I mean, seriously, the character's thing is she has a map and a giant compass, and her victory thing is that she fucking doesn't know her way around. She's getting lost all the time.

1014
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And she's like a bumbling buffoon.

1015
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, but I know men and women that get lost all the time.

1016
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I understand that, but like, you don't see the male Link, you know, just, I'm fucking lost. It's just like, ah, it's a stupid girl, ha!

1017
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So she has ditzy traits that male Link doesn't have in his world.

1018
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, I mean, she has badass crossbows too, but you know, it's just, it's not the same. Whatever, I mean, that's fine, but it's just, I think it's stupid.

1019
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I mean, I think Linkle, the way they portrayed her, is stupid. She could be badass, that's cool. Why can't she be badass? Link is badass.

1020
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
When you see the pictures of Linkle with the crossbows, I'm like, okay, I'm here for that.

1021
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Yeah, exactly, I'm down, that's cool. But like, it's like, why put that last part in?

1022
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's not, haha, she's bad at navigation? I mean, I don't get it.

1023
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Dark Sakura, as a, you know, person that's been following video games for a long time, from the original Legend of Zelda, and our female on the panel, I have to ask you what you think about this whole addition.

1024
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm the token girl.

1025
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't want to say token girl, but you are the girl on our panel, so yes, I need to ask your opinion.

1026
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I, I'm happy with the option to play a female character. I just wish that they would have been, yeah, a complete swap, the way that Fem Shop was, and then again, she was also designed first.

1027
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But, I would rather not have them be two entirely different people, or, I really don't like the, oh, the girl is lost and needs help trope, I hate that.

1028
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It should just be...

1029
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But we should be clear, just to make sure it's clear, with Zelda NX, this is all rumors anyway, and we don't know the portrayal is going to be the same as it was in Hyrule Warriors, so...

1030
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But I certainly would like to see a capable, if it's going to happen, I would like to see a capable gender swap.

1031
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Or just the same thing with lady acting.

1032
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I know Nintendo's will down this, because that means they're going to make one more amiibo for this shit.

1033
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh, that's what it's really about, Lo-fi.

1034
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
This has nothing to do with representation, this is about, hey, how could we sell a female Link figure and a male Link, this is an extra amiibo figure for yourself.

1035
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
What about Link, I mean, what about the color of his skin, I mean, you can have multiple colored Links as well.

1036
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
There you go.

1037
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I mean, there is a potential for like 32 amiibos or something for this.

1038
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, well we don't know yet how they'll handle her if she's in Zelda U, so who knows, maybe she'll be on par with Link.

1039
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And why can't we just have the gender of Link be determined, can I have Ganondorf be a different gender, can I have Ganondorf be a sexy woman, is that an option on there?

1040
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I mean, does he have to be some evil dark elf troll thing?

1041
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Who knows, who knows. I believe, do any other genders, like when you pick a femshep versus an mshep, do any other genders of characters change in Mass Effect? I don't think so.

1042
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
No.

1043
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
No, but your love options change.

1044
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah.

1045
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Which is a whole other issue, but anyway.

1046
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Well, there's some, I'm trying to find the artwork, someone did a very good gender swap Link, not a Linkle, but a gender swap Link, and I'm hoping to find that picture, so I'm going to put it in the chatroom.

1047
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's see, AkumaJP in chat says, bingo, at Loki, regarding the amiibo thing, and actf says, if they haven't announced a Linkle amiibo, I don't think they'll do it now.

1048
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, come on, please, we're not going to do it now. No, they will.

1049
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Maybe not for Hyrule Warriors, but for wherever Linkle's next appearance is, perhaps.

1050
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Alright. Oh, you're pasting a picture in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com? Sounds good.

1051
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Alright, it's pasted.

1052
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Alright, well let's move on. Let's talk about another game that a lot of people want to know more about, and that is Final Fantasy VII, the remake.

1053
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And do you remember the controversy a few months ago when it was revealed that Final Fantasy VII's remake is going to be episodic?

1054
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And everybody was like, fuck that shit, because I'm not paying one disc at a time and all this other stuff, right? People were not very happy about that.

1055
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But there was some other folks that were thinking, well, wait a minute, with as much as they're going to have to redo in Final Fantasy VII,

1056
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
there's probably going to be a lot more than there was in the PlayStation version versus what will be in the PlayStation 4 version.

1057
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And it turns out that is what essentially is being confirmed this week, is that Final Fantasy VII's remake, the episodic strategy, it's not going to necessarily be a one-to-one ratio.

1058
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:24,000
In the new issue of Game Informer, each episode is a full-scale game on par with installments of the Final Fantasy XIII sub-series.

1059
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Interesting comparison there, and also a controversial one in some ways, because some would say that the Final Fantasy XIII series was unnecessary.

1060
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Some would say I would not be one of those people, although I would say XIII-2 was better than Lightning Returns, but that's, you know, whatever.

1061
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:53,000
But anyway, so yeah, that's what they're going for, is that yes, it's episodic, but we're talking about like three full games, like Final Fantasy XIII was three full games.

1062
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So again, that and the latest Game Informer magazine, who I guess have talked to the folks behind it and have played a little more than the rest of us have there.

1063
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So I am still very curious to see what this looks like. I, come on, I practically, I don't want to say I grew up with this game, but this game like defined like my college years.

1064
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm going to buy this game pretty much no matter what. So, and maybe that just makes me the sucker, but I have a pretty good feeling that it'll be worth it.

1065
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It'll be worth it. Yeah, I think it'll be worth it. We'll give it a chance. We'll see how episode one plays out, and if it ends up being like Sonic 4 episode one, then maybe I just won't get the others.

1066
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But I have a pretty good feeling it'll be fine.

1067
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think you go and play the whole Advent Children stuff too. I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.

1068
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah. Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1069
01:01:44,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Well, I just had to laugh at this because someone had actually linked me the ad before, but Drumpf, because I refuse to say the idiot's name, the Republican presidential candidate, did, he tweeted a video that has footage and audio of him in the Mass Effect 2 trailer.

1070
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Now, his campaign didn't have anything to do with actually making the trailer, but I guess one of his fans did, but EA didn't like it and issued a DMCA takedown.

1071
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It's funny because some people think that this is an issue of fair use. However, EA's whole thing is that, and I'm going to read the quote,

1072
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So I wonder if this is something that's going to be listed as a true fan mashup or a parody, or if it's something that truly does negatively affect the image of the company.

1073
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I mean, if that jerk face was associated with anything I did, I wouldn't want his name on it.

1074
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:19,000
You know what this really reminds me of, and regardless of how you feel about him, this just reminds me, and you see this all the time, this reminds me of the musicians where the politicians will use their song.

1075
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Like, didn't that actually happen with that same candidate? And I think it was Twisted Sister, of all people, who, man, Twisted Sister was awesome.

1076
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Born in the USA and Reagan was using it? And told him not to?

1077
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
We're not gonna take it, right? And then Twisted Sister was like, please stop, or I'm going to sue you.

1078
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So really, it's like the same thing, except now instead of music, it's a video game, which I think says a lot about how far games have come.

1079
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Don't make me feel dirty playing Mass Effect 2.

1080
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Well, you know, you can't, you know what, some people are gonna make pornography out of Mass Effect 2, and, well, then again.

1081
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'd watch that.

1082
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
But maybe it's not the characters you want shipped, Dark Sakura. Maybe it's like, maybe Ashley gets with Garrus.

1083
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
No.

1084
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Are you gonna let that happen, Dark Sakura?

1085
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It should be Garrus the Ride.

1086
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That's what they should call it.

1087
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Speaking of Garrus the Ride, no really, don't turn off, don't tune out, don't tune out.

1088
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Right.

1089
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
That ride at Great America opens, like, in the next couple months.

1090
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I know, I need to go.

1091
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I can't believe I'm sitting here on the show saying this. We need to go to Great America.

1092
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I know, right? Well, you know, it's the same room that the seventh portal was in, which was literally the last time I'd been to Great America, was when we saw Margaret Cho, and I got flirted with by a cute lesbian in the bathroom.

1093
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Oh my god, how many, that was pre-OLR. That was a long time ago.

1094
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And I played Planet Harriers. And you saw, you remember how excited I was to find a Planet Harriers?

1095
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yes.

1096
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And I don't even think it's there anymore, which is sad.

1097
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I remember that day very well. I was with one of my exes, the same person I was with when OLR first started, which was a long time ago.

1098
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And I wanna say that, I know Jessica was there.

1099
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And I remember that was the day when you said, you know, I love Dan, and I don't ever wanna, you know, be apart from Dan.

1100
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But if Dan and I do ever break up, I'm gonna marry Margaret Cho.

1101
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1102
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That was like the day you made that decision.

1103
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That was the day.

1104
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You put a ring on it that day.

1105
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I put a ring on it.

1106
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
A backup ring.

1107
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
That Margaret Cho would be my backup wife.

1108
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Anyway, good times, good times.

1109
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't know, though. I've got, like, new backup wives.

1110
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Kaijito in chat says, is Mass Effect still a thing?

1111
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
The week we were off, actually, some gameplay from Andromeda leaked.

1112
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Just a little bit, and I think it was like a pre-alpha build, so you probably shouldn't read too much into it.

1113
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But I think you'll hear a lot more about Andromeda out of E3 this year.

1114
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And I fully expect that it's gonna be one of the games that EA is pushing at their little satellite show.

1115
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Since I can't say that they're pushing at E3, because they're not there, but that EA is gonna push at their satellite show.

1116
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So, yes, I think there is still, I mean, who's to say if the new Mass Effect is gonna be any good or not?

1117
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But we're hoping. Here's hoping. Fingers crossed. Toes crossed.

1118
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
All right.

1119
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
SSJ-100 Matt in chat.

1120
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
But would Margaret Cho pull over for coffee in our saga?

1121
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It doesn't matter, because I have Dan, and Dan is wonderful.

1122
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And Dan does pull over for coffee.

1123
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Dan does pull over for coffee.

1124
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
After a lot of reminders.

1125
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Dan!

1126
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Dan, I need caffeine!

1127
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Dan!

1128
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I was so angry that day.

1129
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That day?

1130
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Oh, girl. Okay.

1131
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So you know how some people get hangry?

1132
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Hangry? Oh, that's me.

1133
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I get hangry.

1134
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I get caffeine angry.

1135
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Ask Allen. Ask Allen what happens if I don't go, or if I go without eating for like six hours.

1136
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I get caffeine angry.

1137
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Caffeine angry.

1138
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Hangry. I gotta use that more often.

1139
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm hangry!

1140
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Oh, goodness.

1141
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Let's see.

1142
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

1143
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Bonds006 says, Rob, don't read too much into it.

1144
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Hello, Rob. We gamers read far into anything game-related.

1145
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And from Lord Gabe.

1146
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, that is true.

1147
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
You know, today is

1148
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
April 10th.

1149
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And April is the fourth month.

1150
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And if you take four and you subtract one and then you subtract zero,

1151
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
you get three. Half-Life 3 confirmed.

1152
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Hmm?

1153
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, we definitely need to go to our next story.

1154
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Loki.

1155
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So, there's a brand new game being made by the

1156
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
creators of Rust.

1157
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It looks very similar to Minecraft.

1158
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Like, a little too similar if you ask me.

1159
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But, it is a VR version of, like, a Minecraft type game.

1160
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Called Chunks.

1161
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And what's kind of cool about it, though,

1162
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
is not only can you use, like, the Vive controllers sexually,

1163
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
you know, build stuff in there,

1164
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
but it has a roller coaster tool as well.

1165
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So you can actually, instead of just your typical mine carts and stuff like that,

1166
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
you can pretty much just draw your own roller coaster.

1167
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Which is awesome.

1168
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Because we like, you know, roller coasters in VR.

1169
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Roller coasters in VR.

1170
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So, it's going to be coming out very soon.

1171
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I want to say on the 12th of April.

1172
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And they're going to be charging $19.99.

1173
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And it's going to be on early access for about two to four months.

1174
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Same $4.80.

1175
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Steam proper.

1176
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
So the game is called Chunks?

1177
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Chunks.

1178
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I can't hope it has Chunk from the Goonies in it.

1179
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I'm afraid it does not.

1180
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
No truffle shuffle?

1181
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
No truffle shuffle.

1182
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Fuck this game. No, I'm just kidding.

1183
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It sounds awesome.

1184
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It looks pretty cool. I mean,

1185
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I'd pick it up if I had, you know,

1186
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
a computer that could run VR in the Vive,

1187
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
and all the things that would be essential.

1188
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Or if you actually had a Vive.

1189
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Because I don't know if you've been following Bobby Blackwolf on Twitter,

1190
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
but apparently getting a Vive is a challenge in itself.

1191
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Or giving money to the Vive people is not a problem.

1192
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Getting that object to actually be delivered to your house

1193
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
is apparently a bit of a challenge.

1194
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Well, I understand that. I mean, anything is a challenge with Valve.

1195
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I mean, how long we've been trying to get them to make Half-Life 3.

1196
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
It's a challenge.

1197
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
At least they're not shipping on, you know, Valve time.

1198
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Because you'd be fucked.

1199
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
They've only sent out three Vives.

1200
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And you know what that means.

1201
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
They're really far behind from their estimated delivery schedule.

1202
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Apparently. Apparently.

1203
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well, let's talk more about Rust,

1204
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
because Rust is another game from that same creator.

1205
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And I've got to admit, I've heard a little bit about this game,

1206
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
but not a lot. But I know it's one of those open world survival games.

1207
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But I'm hearing that, like,

1208
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
you get a lot of people that get really powerful,

1209
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and all they do is they pick on the lower people,

1210
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and it kind of takes some of the fun out of it,

1211
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
is what I'm hearing about this game, Rust.

1212
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I don't know. I haven't played it myself.

1213
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That's just my perception based on other people I've talked to.

1214
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
But I still think the concept sounds really interesting.

1215
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So I'm kind of wondering if you can have, like,

1216
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
a more closed off world that's just you and your friends,

1217
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and you all agree to, like, not be dicks.

1218
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I don't know. If any of you guys have played Rust, you need to let me know.

1219
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But I thought this was very interesting about Rust,

1220
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
is that earlier we had talked about Rust.

1221
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Actually, I don't know if we had talked about it here on the show.

1222
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But I know the news had come up previously that

1223
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
the size of your penis in Rust

1224
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
was directly tied to your Steam ID.

1225
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,000
In other words, you had no control over the size of your penis in Rust.

1226
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I think it should be really connected to your Steam library

1227
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and the amount of games you have.

1228
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
That's going to get people to buy more games.

1229
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I'm telling you.

1230
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
A literal e-penis. A literal e-penis.

1231
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Well, but here's the thing now.

1232
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Here's the thing, is that although the talk was all about peni,

1233
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
previously, here's the thing, now in the latest update,

1234
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Rust has also tied gender assignment to your Steam ID.

1235
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You will not have a choice if you are male or female.

1236
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And I am assuming, if you're going to ask that question about boobs,

1237
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
because that's where you're going to go the minute you hear females,

1238
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
right DarkSakura?

1239
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
She's nodding.

1240
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
That is probably also determined on your Steam ID.

1241
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I'm just going to take a lucky guess.

1242
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
You probably do not get to really control any of those factors.

1243
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Well, I mean, what about the penis size on them too, though?

1244
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I don't know.

1245
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I have not played Rust myself to know how that all works yet.

1246
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
But this is the interesting thing.

1247
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I read the letter from the developer about why they did things the way they did.

1248
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And it was very, very, like, I don't want to say it was shady,

1249
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
because it definitely wasn't shady, but it was just very much like,

1250
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I don't give a flying fuck if you don't like this type of thing

1251
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
in the way that it was described.

1252
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I kind of loved it.

1253
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I wholeheartedly agree with that opinion.

1254
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
That really should be the developer's opinions.

1255
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Most developers out there should have that opinion.

1256
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Like, when people ask them to make changes to a game,

1257
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
just like, I don't give a flying fuck what you want.

1258
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I made the game this way.

1259
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
But conversely, if the developer wants to go,

1260
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I didn't think of that.

1261
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I have decided, based on that, I am making the decision to do this,

1262
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
then that's fine.

1263
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You know what I mean?

1264
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But the buck stops with the developer.

1265
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Anyway, but here's the thing.

1266
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Gary Newman, the developer, actually said,

1267
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
we're not taking the choice away from you.

1268
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
You never had a choice.

1269
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
A man's voice coming out of a woman's body is no more weird

1270
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
than an eight-year-old boy's voice coming out of a man's body.

1271
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And then it goes on that the developer's blog,

1272
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
oh, I've got to find, there was the best shade in here.

1273
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Where is it here in this dev blog?

1274
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Sorry, I know this is like terrible radio here.

1275
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Let's see.

1276
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
We understand this is a sore subject for a lot of people.

1277
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
We understand that you may now be a gender

1278
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
that you don't identify with in real life.

1279
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We understand this causes you distress

1280
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and makes you not want to play the game anymore.

1281
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Technically, nothing has changed since half the population

1282
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
was already living with those feelings.

1283
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And I was like, he does not give a fuck

1284
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
if you do not like this change.

1285
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I got to give him props for that.

1286
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And that's a brilliant way to put it is that, you know what?

1287
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Other people, so it was great.

1288
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It was great.

1289
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And, you know, there's plenty of games that we play

1290
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
where they happen to have a female lead like Tomb Raider

1291
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
or Final Fantasy 13 or plenty of games out there,

1292
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
but there could stand to be more, but there's plenty.

1293
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And it's not like, does that make you not want to play Tomb Raider?

1294
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Because you're missing out if you don't want to play Tomb Raider.

1295
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So anyway.

1296
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's like all of those, you know, to quote Wil Wheaton,

1297
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
the best word ever, whiny man babies who are complaining about Rogue One's lead.

1298
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Oh, yeah, that whole thing.

1299
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I still haven't watched that trailer. Am I on cool?

1300
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I haven't watched it either.

1301
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I'm interested in it though, but that's the best description,

1302
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
whiny man babies.

1303
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Alright.

1304
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Moving on.

1305
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

1306
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, did you hear about the crap going on with Siege of Dragonspear?

1307
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Oh, that's the Baldur's Gate thing, isn't it?

1308
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yeah, it is.

1309
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I have a Twitter account. Believe me, I've heard.

1310
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Well, to go ahead and tell, you know, explain to people what was happening,

1311
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
there was a character named Mizana who is transgender.

1312
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And people were just flipping their shit about having a transgender character.

1313
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And then some people were going, oh, well, it has to do with the exposition in it

1314
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
and that, you know, what NPC is going to give you their life story

1315
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1316
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Just going to throw that out there for these people.

1317
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
There's probably a transgender character in your life somewhere

1318
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
and you just don't know.

1319
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Just saying.

1320
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
And I'll be honest, I think that it was a little bit shoving it in your face,

1321
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
but I am happy there's a transgender character.

1322
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I mean, good.

1323
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
It's more of one of those things that, and this is, I think, how it should be.

1324
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
If there is a character that is not, you know, cisgendered hetero,

1325
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
it should still be, so what?

1326
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
That's what people are like.

1327
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It should be accepted as normal.

1328
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Go, huh, and moved on.

1329
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Because that is equality.

1330
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Giving, making a big deal out of it for the sake of making a big deal out of it,

1331
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
that is not equality.

1332
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's just how I feel about it.

1333
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
However.

1334
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And just to be fair, for the trans people who happen to play this game,

1335
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
that probably feels awesome to see, like, a representation in the game.

1336
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It does.

1337
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
We heard a lot about that yesterday.

1338
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I know as a gay guy, when I see a gay romance plot in a video game like Mass Effect,

1339
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I'm like, I can't tell you how fucking happy it makes me that you and Kaiden,

1340
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
as male Shep, can bang.

1341
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
It makes me so happy, like, that that is an option that's available to you.

1342
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's an option.

1343
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
O-P-T-I-O-N. Option.

1344
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The thing about it is that, the way it was handled, it is, like, no big deal.

1345
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Because it's no big deal.

1346
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's a choice that, I'm not even a choice.

1347
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's, it's just how people are.

1348
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Yep.

1349
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And I like how that was handled.

1350
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You know, but I'm also like that with, you know, women's issues with,

1351
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I'll just won't go into that anymore.

1352
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So, but anyway, there was a lot of just online harassment going on toward Amber Scott,

1353
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,000
who was the writer for, one of the writers for this series.

1354
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And, so Trent.

1355
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm just going to take a lucky guess and assume that Amber is not being harassed because they didn't write enough on this character.

1356
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I'm going to guess that's probably not where the harassment is. Am I right?

1357
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Well, Trent Oster, the CEO of Beamdog, the developer, basically went and said that bullying isn't going to work.

1358
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And that being abusive isn't going to do anything.

1359
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And I'm going to read the quote.

1360
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
So, and he said that, you know, he admits that the inclusion could be better.

1361
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:05,000
In retrospect, we am reading the article, in retrospect, it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development.

1362
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,000
This is a lesson that we will be carrying forward in our development as creators, and we will be improving this character in a future update.

1363
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Great. So, we talked about just a minute ago, developers should be able to do whatever they want.

1364
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And so, the dev says, okay, you know what, you gave us that feedback, and you know what, we're keeping the character the way that they are.

1365
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
But, you know, maybe it was a little, like Darcy said, maybe it was a little too like blatant, so we need to develop it better.

1366
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So, we're going to give it a better story. Cool.

1367
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I'm just going to, I'm just super looking forward to the day where, and I'm not trying to make it sound like it's not an important issue.

1368
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But I'm looking forward to the day where it's not an important issue. Does that make sense?

1369
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:11,000
When everything is taken in stride, when there is an acceptance to the point that it is just as accepted as a cisgendered hetero couple or person, that we have that same level of acceptance and equality for everybody.

1370
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I am anti-censorship. I demand you remove this offensive content from your game. Do not censor me.

1371
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
It's a little parody there. Alright.

1372
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And I hope the way that I said that makes sense.

1373
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:35,000
It does. It does. Anyway, let's move on. However, there's much more to talk about. In fact, we got to talk about what is actually going to be on the shelves in the gaming stores near you this week.

1374
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So, let's check out release dates, starting with Loki.

1375
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Well, on PlayStation 4, we have Ratchet and Clank. So, that's going to be coming out.

1376
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Dark Souls 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as PC.

1377
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And last but not least, Bravely Second and Lair on 3DS.

1378
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I have a feeling that's the one that a lot of people I know are going to be getting.

1379
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I still haven't played the demo for Bravely Second. I need to get on that.

1380
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So, alright. If that's it, let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out this week in Japan.

1381
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
In Japan, on the 14th, we have Republique on the PlayStation 4.

1382
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Skullgirls Second Encore also makes its way to the PlayStation 4.

1383
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And Divinity Original Sin, excuse me, Enhanced Edition also on the PlayStation 4.

1384
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:30,000
On the Wii U, nothing because Star Fox Zero isn't until the 21st, but at least you have that to look forward to.

1385
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
On the Vita in the meantime, Skullgirls Second Encore is really the only release on the Vita this week.

1386
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It's a slower week on the Vita.

1387
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
But on the 3DS, nothing. I'm kind of surprised to see that. There's nothing on the 3DS.

1388
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Terraria is the next release on the 3DS in Japan, and that is not until the 21st.

1389
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
So, not as busy of a week in Japan, it appears.

1390
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

1391
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Very few things. We just have Dark Souls 3 on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and that's really about it until the following week.

1392
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Alright. We have just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1393
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
But first, Loki.

1394
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Alright, so this is kind of disappointing.

1395
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:27,000
The Studio Gaijin Games, which is, I guess, choice provisions in North America, has closed its San Francisco office.

1396
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Over the past few years, the game industry has changed so dramatically that a mid-sized studio operating as we have for the past several years just simply can't continue the same way.

1397
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And so, you know, they've unfortunately had to close their office. I didn't really see how many people were affected by that, but that still sucks.

1398
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Yeah, I didn't see the number of people either, and that sucks because that's a fun series of games.

1399
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
But I guess things have kind of slowed down. Like, I don't know, what was the last bit game they put out?

1400
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I know there was Bit.Trip Runner 2, which was on, like, every platform.

1401
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And then they had that collection on PlayStation 4, because I know that was a big thing that came out of the PlayStation Expo that they had at the end of last year.

1402
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Well, their latest project was a game called Tharsis, and I guess it had some issues with that game, although they're saying that's not why the studio closed.

1403
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:35,000
That's too bad. We never like to hear about layoffs in the industry, but hopefully the folks affected will be able to find work somewhere else relatively quickly.

1404
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Let's talk about another game. Oh, this is a game that's, like, on my Steam link thing, like, ready to play, and I really want to check this out, because so many people have told me I need to play Life is Strange.

1405
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And I really do want to get around to that, just, you know, time. But the folks that have played Life is Strange, there's a lot of hardcore fans.

1406
01:22:52,000 --> 01:23:01,000
In fact, some fans are going so far as to demand a sequel. Oh, by the way, they're not just demanding a sequel. Some fans went and made a Kickstarter for it.

1407
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:12,000
That's right, there's a Life is Strange 2 Kickstarter, or was, I'll get to that in a minute. There was a Life is Strange 2 Kickstarter out there with the aim to raise $20,000.

1408
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:24,000
This is, I guess, in an attempt to get the developer to notice that the fans are eager for the sequel, and they want to give the studio the funds that are needed for the project.

1409
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So, interesting, but it didn't last very long. The Kickstarter was shut down within minutes. No hours, but still, it was, like, not even a day, and the Kickstarter was taken down.

1410
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And you can probably imagine why. You can't really raise money for a game that's not yours, but regardless, it sounds like a lot of people want that Life is Strange sequel to happen.

1411
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Alright, and DungeonBuster in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, Life is Strange is so good!

1412
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:11,000
AkumaJP, trying to explain why there's not a busy release schedule in Japan this week, saying everybody is still busy with Yokai Watch, oh, I forgot that came out in Japan, and DQM.

1413
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So, there you go. Meanwhile, we gotta get busy with a classic video game, Dark Sakura.

1414
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Going old school.

1415
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Alright, we're gonna go old school. We're gonna step into the gaming vault, where Dark Sakura finds the game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this out this week.

1416
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Between your indie games and your randomly generated penis sizes, you need to check this out. This was back in the day when you didn't have any of that online garbage and Kickstarter.

1417
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
This is a classic. What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?

1418
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Fantasy Zone The Maze. In Japan, it was just known as Oppa Oppa, which is, of course, the main ship character with cute feet and wings from the Fantasy Zone series.

1419
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It was originally an arcade game, and made it onto the Sega Master System as a home console release. Some people like to call it Fantasy Zone 3, but it really is kind of its own different game.

1420
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:20,000
While the other Fantasy Zone games are called, quote, cute-em-ups, Fantasy Zone The Maze is a maze puzzler.

1421
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:30,000
So, basically, it's kind of Pac-Man-like, but you collect coins as you go, and you spend them on weapons in different places in the stage.

1422
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And then you have to shoot down enemies. And the dot's going to turn red over time, and when it turns red, an enemy will spawn.

1423
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
The only way you stop it is by passing through the dot, and then when you do, the process starts over.

1424
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And when you finish the stage, you get a certain amount of points at the end, depending on how long it took to complete the level.

1425
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
There are also bonus stages where you collect coins in a limited time.

1426
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So you play as, um, two ships. Player 1 is the Oppa Oppa, and Player 2 is the Oppa Oppa.

1427
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So, um...

1428
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
But Player 3 is the Oompa Loompa.

1429
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
No.

1430
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:16,000
The Sega Master System port and the original arcade version were in the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection for PS2.

1431
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Um, there's not really much else to say about that one. It's cute, it's novel, and it's Fantasy Zone, which means that makes it automatically a winner to me.

1432
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
That's it. It came out in 1987. You're welcome.

1433
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
So, that's it.

1434
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:41,000
There it is. Fantasy Zone. The maze. It's Pac-Man-esque, but that would be way oversimplifying it. There's obviously more going on here.

1435
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oppa Oppa.

1436
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And, uh, actually in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says, I recognize this song. It's on Taiko no Tatujin Vita!

1437
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Um, also, wasn't that just kind of a remix?

1438
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Well, it's just the remix of the Oppa Oppa music.

1439
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah, which is...

1440
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Ah, guys, yeah. The main theme, right?

1441
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Yep.

1442
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
A little remix there.

1443
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Uh, alright, so, uh, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, we've got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news tonight.

1444
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Uh, some news on a Mega Man cartoon. One of Dark Soccer's favorite websites closing their doors. That's kind of sad, so we'll talk about that in the next segment.

1445
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I am pissed.

1446
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And then we're gonna talk about, uh, your calls as well. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.

1447
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Uh, we're gonna take a quick break. We'll be right back after this with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.

1448
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio. Live toni- Excuse me. Boy, coughs suck when you're doing live radio. Sorry about that.

1449
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Uh, we are live tonight with episode number 637 of our show for this April the 10th of 2016. Our show already in progress.

1450
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Back after the awesome Sack Indie Arcade event yesterday. Looking forward to hopefully attending more events, um, throughout the year.

1451
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Uh, I can mention that, uh, Dark Soccer and I, at least, we will certainly be back at GamerX this year.

1452
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Um, that has all been filed away and taken care of, so at least there's that.

1453
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Um, I'm- I know Bobby Blackwolf, myself, and I'm sure plenty of other people from VOG Network. I just don't know all who yet.

1454
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
We'll also be in attendance at DragonCon, for those of you in the Atlanta area or really anywhere in the south.

1455
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Uh, cause everybody converges on Atlanta, uh, over Labor Day weekends, there's that as well.

1456
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Hopefully some more, uh, cons and things of that nature as well, um, to look forward.

1457
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I know there's one- another one that I'm gonna try and work on, uh, so we'll talk hopefully about that in the future.

1458
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But anyway, for now, we want to get back into some gaming news. We're gonna do some rapid fire news, starting with Loki.

1459
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Alright, so this is kind of a cool story, um, apparently this guy, uh, Peter Bryan reached out to Sony because he had problems with his DualShock 4 due to, um, his illness.

1460
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,000
He has cerebral palsy, and because of that he had some issues when he would hit the touchpad, um, with his hand.

1461
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It's very sensitive, it would pause the game. So, Sony actually, um, created a custom controller that had, like, some tweaks to it.

1462
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Including dis- uh, dislabeling the touchpad and adding a new button to act as a touchpad.

1463
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I think that's pretty awesome that they went that far to take care of him. So, bravo Sony.

1464
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Um, if you actually played some of the Minecraft story mode, um, you'll be happy to know that the skins from the characters from that series, uh, from Telltale are actually available for free, temporarily.

1465
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:52,000
So if you have the Pocket Edition of Minecraft, uh, for iOS or Google Play, or Windows Phone, or the Windows 10 Beta for those.

1466
01:29:52,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Or the Console Editions for Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, it is free for the first week. After that it's $3.

1467
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I did not see Wii U on there, so I'm not sure why they don't get the free version of that, so, that's kind of lame.

1468
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Because that's what my son plays it on. But hey, I'll download it for free. Because it's free. I like free.

1469
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Finally, uh, Bethesda, they have some more, um, details on their E3 2016 showcase. It's going to be on June 12th.

1470
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And on top of that they're going to have some, uh, extra things that are going to be part of that. Including a band that will be taking the stage at 9.

1471
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:53,000
And then they're also going to have, uh, some other, some announcements and they're going to be showing, you know, um, some more stuff for Fallout 4 and, I don't know.

1472
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:03,000
But, uh, yeah. And then I guess they're saying that the stream will be starting at 6.15 Pacific Time.

1473
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So much for OLR. Thanks Bethesda. Appreciate that. It's alright. E3 week always tends to ruin everything.

1474
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:25,000
But we'll, we'll figure something out. I have some clever ideas for how we might accommodate this unfortunate situation. So stay tuned. That's all I have to say.

1475
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I'm just saying, I mean, I'm actually pretty excited because this week also, one of the things I forgot to mention, is this week they also do have the, um, the next piece of DLC that's coming out for Fallout 4.

1476
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And I'm pretty excited about that because the last piece wasn't that bad. This one you can add more stuff for, um, you know, building your settlements and everything. You can create traps.

1477
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:52,000
You know that's all Alan, like, plays these days, right? He's played so much. I think he finally beat it, but he said there's still a bunch of side stuff he has to do.

1478
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Oh god, yeah. Because it's, you know, like Skyrim. I mean, I've been playing more of the story, you know, actual storyline in the game because I was doing all the side stuff.

1479
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I just kind of want to finish it. And I was going to start a new gameplay, or playthrough, but they've gotten rid of all my exploits and I'm not too happy about that.

1480
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Maybe when the mods come out and they can cheat again. Because that's half the fun. I mean, you spend all this time building yourself up, you know, I don't want to have to play through the whole thing again, grind for all that stuff. You know, that's not fun.

1481
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Well, let's move on and talk about Quantum Break on PC. You know, when I was doing my review earlier, I was talking about Quantum Break on the Xbox One, but I made an illusion of the fact that, you know, because some people said,

1482
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well, Rob, when you say it's an exclusive, it's also on the PC. And I said, yeah, well, because there's some news this week that the Windows 10 version, it's a little rough. Apparently it has some frame rate issues. There's no quit game button.

1483
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
That's ridiculous.

1484
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:01,000
You know what it reminds me of? Do you remember when Final Fantasy 13 first came out for the PC? This really reminds me of a lot of the same complaints.

1485
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
No, it's the fact that it doesn't have a quit button. Is that because, like, Windows 10 apps, you kind of drag and dump to the bottom of the screen?

1486
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I have no idea why it does not have a quit game button. But, yeah, apparently Nvidia hardware will also crash the game often.

1487
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:24,000
The game will not run 60 frames a second on a 60 hertz monitor, even using an Nvidia Titan X. A frame rate matching the refresh rate on a user's monitor isn't possible.

1488
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Yeah, so, you might want to think about that before getting Quantum Break. This is probably just part of the growing pains with DirectX 12 API.

1489
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:40,000
A lot of people also blaming with the Universal Windows platform, saying this is a disaster for UWP and it's already dead.

1490
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
It's like games for Windows Live all over again.

1491
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
History is repeating itself a little bit. Well, we'll see.

1492
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Hey, Loki was talking about Bethesda a minute ago. How about Doom? Doom is out in five weeks. Did you know that? The new Doom.

1493
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Obviously, if you want to go play classic Doom, go have a ball. But, new Doom is out in five weeks.

1494
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And, already, $45 worth of post-launch content is planned for Doom, because that's the day and age that we live in.

1495
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:16,000
But, you can get a deal for 40 bucks. You can get a season pass. How about that? So, a little money off that.

1496
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Or, you can wait a year and play $40 for the whole thing.

1497
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Game of the Year edition. That's right. Or, even by the holiday on a Steam sale. You can probably get the Game of the Year edition.

1498
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Three premium multiplayer packs are planned for the months following launch.

1499
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:41,000
The first one is scheduled for summer. It will have three new maps, one weapon, one playable demon, one armor set, a piece of equipment, new hack modules and taunts, customization colors and patterns.

1500
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
So, this is for multiplayer online?

1501
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Yeah. So, if you don't have it, you don't get to use it. I'm assuming you'll see other people with those taunts and things, but, hmm.

1502
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Anyhow, yeah, $40 for the season pass if you want that.

1503
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Moving on, how about a story about Hideo Kojima? Because, you know, even though Kojima hasn't really done anything in a little bit since, you know, Metal Gear Solid 5 has been done and out there, and we all know what happened with P.T.,

1504
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,000
it doesn't mean we don't stop showering love on the man who was done so wrong by Konami.

1505
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Hideo Kojima is going to be hosting a keynote presentation at the Develop Conference in Brighton, that's in the UK, and that will be later this year.

1506
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Joined by Mark Cerny from Sony, they're going to present a session called Industry Legends Discuss the Future, a conversation with Hideo Kojima.

1507
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:41,000
That will be on July 13th, and Kojima getting an award, the 2016 Industry Legendary Award.

1508
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Well, they're letting him accept it now because he's not with Konami.

1509
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yeah, he's allowed to make appearances at award shows now. So, congrats for Kojima.

1510
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Moving on, Dar Sakura.

1511
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Well, there is not going to be any more Rock Band 4, at least on PC. The crowdfunding campaign failed to meet its goal. It made only barely above 50%, so no, sorry.

1512
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Well, to be fair, they may find another way outside crowdfunding, but I still say there's a lot they need to conquer on consoles first, but we'll see.

1513
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Well, this face here, this is the bitch face of not caring. It's resting right now.

1514
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I'm kind of with you. Like, I just, I can't care about Rock Band 4 PC when I still feel, still feel like the Rock Band 4 we have on console is not what we were promised, but anyway.

1515
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Anyway, though this is better news, so guess what? We have new DDR! DDR ACE, and it's coming to Dave and Buster's. Some Dave and Buster's locations.

1516
01:36:51,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It's also going to be definitely running with the E-Amusement Network, and we don't know if they're going to be selling the passes or not, but hey, if they do, that will be awesome.

1517
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:17,000
So it will be out Summer 2016. And then, David Hayter, speaking of being slightly bitter with Kojima and Konami.

1518
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So, he re-voiced Snake for a Ford commercial. This was part of this overdub video series, and this one is for the Ford Fusion SE.

1519
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And then, um, yeah. Sad. Why can't we have him back? He did have some kind of nasty things to say about Kojima.

1520
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Yeah, unfortunately, it was a messy divorce, unfortunately, but hopefully they can both find long, happy lives together just separately.

1521
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Alright, um, this is the part of the show where I would usually do the Foogle Question of the Week.

1522
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:20,000
But I failed in asking a question, so we actually did not have a question posted to our Facebook and Google Plus communities this week. I apologize, that's on me.

1523
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Just because, again, I can't stress how busy I've been this weekend between the Sac Indie event yesterday. I actually went to a wedding this morning, and I certainly don't regret that whatsoever.

1524
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:40,000
It was a beautiful wedding, and the cool thing about the wedding, I will say this, because this is the question I was thinking of doing. I was intending to ask this question, but then I had to turn around to show roll in like 45 minutes.

1525
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:52,000
But, the question I was going to ask, my friends got married today, and they had a Star Wars themed wedding. And it was super fucking nerdy, and I mean that in the best possible way.

1526
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:03,000
So congratulations, Amanda and Dan, even though I don't think you guys listen to the show, but your pals that I met you through probably do, because they are the hosts of GameBui.org, so I got to see them today for a little bit.

1527
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:15,000
But I digress. So I went to a Star Wars themed wedding, and it was super cute. All the people in the wedding party had lightsabers, and they played the Star Wars music, and they encouraged people to dress up, and da da da.

1528
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:21,000
So I was going to ask, because it also kind of made me think the Blu-ray was released this week as well for the new movie.

1529
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Our coffee arrived today.

1530
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Yeah. And I was worried. I asked this question already back in December, but I guess I didn't. I went back and looked at December's questions, but I didn't.

1531
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Because I would have thought I would have asked this when the movie came out, but I think we had an interview around the same week, so I didn't ask about it.

1532
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:47,000
But I was going to ask, what is your favorite Star Wars video game? Because there's been a lot of Star Wars in video games. There's been a lot of really good Star Wars video games, and there's been other Star Wars video games.

1533
01:39:48,000 --> 01:40:02,000
But my question is, what is a favorite Star Wars moment in video games? So although I apologize to our Facebook and Google communities, maybe I can read at least a couple quick answers from chat if people want to let me know a favorite moment or game from Star Wars video games.

1534
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
What about you guys here in studio? Sorry to spring this on you, but y'all are creative. DarkSagra?

1535
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I really liked the old school Star Wars arcade. I mean, I liked the newer one that they did in the early 2000s. I thought that one was pretty fun.

1536
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:26,000
But I have to say though, one that came out not too long ago were the battle pods. And yeah, while those games usually make me motion sick, I have to say it was really fun.

1537
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:37,000
So I would also like to give a big fuck you to all of the Super Star Wars, Super Empire Strikes Back, and Super Return of the Jedi for being hard as balls.

1538
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Those games are assholes.

1539
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
They're assholes.

1540
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
But they're awesome games.

1541
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Oh yeah, they're great, but they're hard as fuck. But I love the debug code, and you can just like speed through the level and see all the stuff that's funny.

1542
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I'll piggyback on that since I was also going to say the original OG Star Wars arcade game, the vector graphics.

1543
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I remember playing that shit when I was like seven years old in the sit-down cabinets at the Tilt Arcade at Sunrise Mall, which, shit, that hasn't been open since the mid-80s just to date myself a little bit.

1544
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
But that game was the shit.

1545
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And when I go to California Extreme, which I think I'll actually get to go to this year finally. I haven't been in like five years. I'm so excited.

1546
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,000
But when I go to California Extreme, I get so excited when I see that cabinet.

1547
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And the Empire Strikes Back too, but there's something very special about the original OG vector Star Wars game.

1548
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Which, by the way, some folks in chat are agreeing with that same answer.

1549
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Over in chat, over at live.vognetware.com, Dark Tetsuya says,

1550
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Gotta go with the Atari vector Star Wars game, arcade game too.

1551
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Brad from Pod Culture, our buddy over there on Monday nights, says,

1552
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Hands down the original arcade game.

1553
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, Star Wars Galaxies spent way, way too much time in there right when it launched.

1554
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I think sometimes we forget, Star Wars has lent itself very well to a couple of large MMOs.

1555
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Some other people play The Old Republic as well. That's still going on.

1556
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Loki, what about you? I don't want to forget you. Star Wars game that you love?

1557
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I didn't really play that many of them.

1558
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
The one that I love talking about connects Star Wars.

1559
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Because what the fuck were they thinking with that stupid dancing game?

1560
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I mean, come on. That is just fucking stupid.

1561
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
But, yeah, I don't know. I didn't really play that many Star Wars games.

1562
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I played some of the Super Nintendo ones, and I don't know.

1563
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Do you want to hear about what an old grandpa gamer I am?

1564
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,000
We were somewhere. Where were we? We were at a club or something. I don't remember what it was.

1565
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Oh, I think this was when we were in Tucson, actually, because I think my friends were there to overhear my old-ass grandpa gamer moment.

1566
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
And this song came on, and I'm like, why are they playing this? Why are we at a place that's playing this?

1567
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
They're playing the Han Solo song from Star Wars Connect, the I'm Han Solo, like that whole song.

1568
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And my friends are like, no, Rob, no, no. This is the original song. That was a parody of another song.

1569
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And this is the real song, Rob. I'm like, I have become that old man that's like,

1570
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I don't watch MTV. It's nothing but noise.

1571
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And apparently two new clips from Suicide Squad and Captain America Civil War.

1572
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Oh, boy.

1573
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Speaking of which, finally caught myself up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1574
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Did you? I'm still behind.

1575
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Yeah, I watched all the movies I missed.

1576
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I still want to see Superman versus Batman. I don't want to hear it. Look, I fully expect it's probably going to be bad.

1577
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,000
But I sat through Batman and Robin. I can fucking tolerate a bad Batman movie.

1578
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I can do it this way. It could have been a whole lot worse.

1579
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Yeah.

1580
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It could have been a Joel Schumacher movie.

1581
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Right.

1582
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Can you imagine a Joel Schumacher Batman versus Superman?

1583
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Fuck off.

1584
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Oh, man, that'd be amazing.

1585
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Kaijuto in chat says, best Star Wars game was Jedi Academy, hands down.

1586
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Alan Alchemy agreeing. I really love Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy.

1587
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Dungeon Buster saying Dark Forces 2 is also up there. Huge love for TIE Fighter.

1588
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Bob Coffey says rogue leader on GameCube.

1589
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, I was a big fan of the Jedi Knight series, mostly Jedi Outcast.

1590
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Act F says, Star Wars Battlefront 2.

1591
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
So a variety of answers there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1592
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Sorry I didn't get all the answers there, but there's a lot of chat going on.

1593
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
So, great. Thank you.

1594
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
So thank you for filling in for my lack of asking the question on FUGL.

1595
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But in the future, our Facebook and Google Plus communities will have a question every week.

1596
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Don't forget to answer it.

1597
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Honestly, you know, I haven't played them yet, but I thought about purchasing them.

1598
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Probably the Lego Star Wars games would be pretty good as well.

1599
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Those are pretty good.

1600
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Yeah, I've heard pretty good things about those. I'm not seeing a lot of that in chat, but...

1601
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
That and the Force Unleashed, those games look kind of interesting.

1602
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
But I never got around to playing those.

1603
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
All right. Well, let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

1604
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
All right. Let's see.

1605
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So, I don't know how excited I am about this.

1606
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But apparently, and I swear I didn't know they were even considering making this, but...

1607
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Hey, you know, we haven't gotten a new Mega Man game in a while.

1608
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
But hey, let's make a cartoon series for it.

1609
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Why not?

1610
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
So that's what they're going to do.

1611
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
They're making a new Mega Man cartoon.

1612
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Apparently it was announced last year.

1613
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And it's being done with the creators of the Ben 10 cartoon.

1614
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And it's supposed to be coming out in 2017.

1615
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
To coincide with the 30th anniversary of Mega Man.

1616
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Please don't suck.

1617
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
And can we get a new Mega Man game that doesn't suck?

1618
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Yeah, I was going to say.

1619
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
You know what would be awesome for the 30th anniversary of Mega Man?

1620
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
A fucking game. That would be great.

1621
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Don't get me wrong. Anime has the potential to be cool.

1622
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
You know, there's a lot of awesome tie-in anime out there.

1623
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
But a game would be the bee's knees.

1624
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
But with that.

1625
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Bee Man.

1626
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Just because something gets a series and then they go to make a game based off that series

1627
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
doesn't mean it's going to be a good thing.

1628
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Especially off of an existing IP that people loved.

1629
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Like Sonic Boom.

1630
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And it just like was fucking stupid.

1631
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Please don't give Mega Man more friends.

1632
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
He doesn't need more friends.

1633
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:37,000
He needs more robots that have weird names associated with, I don't know, some gimmick that they have.

1634
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
That he can absorb their powers from.

1635
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
And that's it. That's really all you need.

1636
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Dartitsuyu in chat says, isn't there a Bee Man in one of the recent games, 9 or 10?

1637
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Actually now you say.

1638
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Like after the words left my mouth, I'm like, actually I seem to remember like a honeycomb level.

1639
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I would totally take though an Elmer Fudd Dr. Light again.

1640
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Because I'm going to kill Dr. Wiby.

1641
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I mean, it was so terrible.

1642
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Thank you, McManic.

1643
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Hey, did you guys play that Legend of Zelda browser game that was out for a hot minute?

1644
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I did.

1645
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
You could play it in a browser, but it was like a 3D Legend of Zelda.

1646
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Dan played the crap out of that.

1647
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Yeah, not like Oculus Rift 3D, but like 3D pixel style Legend of Zelda.

1648
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And yeah, it was up and you could play it in a browser and guess what happened?

1649
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,000
These things tend to do, we all know the punchline, Nintendo shut it down.

1650
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Although, you know, the creators took it in good spirit.

1651
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
You know, they said, they said their quote, Nintendo has every right to protect their IP.

1652
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
And they knew this result could potentially happen.

1653
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
So they have no complaints and they even made some friends along the way.

1654
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
So maybe some folks noticed what they did and might want to use, not saying it was necessarily Nintendo,

1655
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
but anybody out there could have seen what they did and maybe want to put their skills to use somewhere else.

1656
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And to which after, you know, seeing all that, they're like, what's on the internet?

1657
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It's always on the fucking internet, bitches.

1658
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And that is also true. Once on the internet, always on the internet.

1659
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Because you know, there's that person who found it even faster than Nintendo that saw it and said,

1660
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
you know, I bet Nintendo is going to take this down.

1661
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Right click, save as.

1662
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
See you indeed. Bye-bye.

1663
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Yeah. So somebody's got a copy of it somewhere.

1664
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

1665
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Well, this is what makes me mad and sad and other negative things that end in ad.

1666
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Game politics is one of my absolute favorite sites.

1667
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I get probably the majority of my news from it.

1668
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It goes into a lot of the video game stuff that I really look more into, which is the social, legal, ethical side of gaming culture.

1669
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I mean, pretty much.

1670
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:56,000
These are all the things that affect life other than this game's crappy, this game's good, you know.

1671
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
So they are closing.

1672
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And this is, this is the personal insult.

1673
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Not personal, but still, I'm taking it that way.

1674
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
It's going down the day before my birthday.

1675
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Well, they're going to stop doing updates on April 18th.

1676
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And the contents will still be up for a while before it is taken down for good.

1677
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And the ECA, the Entertainment Consumers Association that owns the domain and the brand, this is their decision.

1678
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:36,000
So if you want game politics to not die, if you want to see this stay alive, everyone should write in.

1679
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Well, Jamie, at least they didn't do it on your birthday.

1680
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Girl.

1681
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:48,000
What do you, Bobby talked about this at length on his show tonight, and he pointed out that game politics changed hands a few years ago.

1682
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:57,000
The guy that started it, and I remember the individual that started game politics was actually very prolific on the emerging podcast scene.

1683
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Because I don't know if we ended up in an article.

1684
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Like, I feel like in the early days of game politics, like we were quoted, like one of our shows was in an article or something.

1685
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Don't you remember that?

1686
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I feel like something happened along the, it was a long fucking time ago, okay?

1687
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
But I, or he emailed us or something, I don't know.

1688
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
But anyway, the guy who started it is not the same guy who's been doing it.

1689
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Like that, it changed hands quite some time ago, but that didn't bother you, Dark Soccer.

1690
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:30,000
You were still, you weren't necessarily about who was behind it, but you were about like, this is the angle of the news and this is why.

1691
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know, I think that we need stuff like this out there instead of just the more flashy stuff, does that make sense?

1692
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Yeah.

1693
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:58,000
You know, like the drama of, you know, whatever Sony's doing right now, or, you know, this game has too much boob in it or something.

1694
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I think we need to see what goes on a little bit behind the scenes and the effect that games being such a big part of society now have as an effect in society.

1695
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:18,000
We need to have exposure to this stuff because, you know, especially for adult gamers, this is what affects our day to day life.

1696
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:39,000
What about the argument, just not that I necessarily agree with this, but just devil's advocate, what about the argument that Jack Voldemort's been disbarred, Leelanese in jail, the Brown vs. ESA, the Schwarzenegger ESA thing got thrown out of court, or sorry, it got, you know, Scalia actually was the one that wrote the report on that, that shut that one down.

1697
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:45,000
What about the argument that we don't need it anymore because games are no longer the underdog that they were?

1698
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Except that I don't think that's quite the situation.

1699
01:51:50,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Is that I think that we do still have, maybe not necessarily the underdog angle, but there's still plenty of things that go on.

1700
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
You know, for example, the whole, you know, bean dog thing with Baldur's Gate.

1701
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:13,000
You know, clearly we do have still instances of harassment and social issues that need to be addressed.

1702
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I think it goes far beyond the, oh, video games are evil.

1703
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:29,000
It goes into more of, I guess, more of an everyday angle, things that are going to have to reflect on the state of the world.

1704
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Like the other one about there about the Congressman Duncan Hunter, who...

1705
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Oh, yo, I didn't even put that on the show tonight, but, oh my God, Alan and I were talking about this in the car and having a laugh about it.

1706
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Because what, isn't he the big vaping Congressman that actually, what, he blamed his kid for $1,300 worth of Steam games in the library and all this stuff?

1707
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:01,000
The 68 Steam transactions were put as, quote, personal expense to be paid back.

1708
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Yeah, the House Ethics Committee smacked him. He's under an investigation by the FEC right now.

1709
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:17,000
So, but I mean, would you have known that? Would most gamers know that? Just reading EGM.

1710
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
EGM came back, right?

1711
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Would they know this reading Game Pro or Nintendo Power?

1712
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
They may have learned it on Twitter.

1713
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Pro tip, study.

1714
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Depending on who they follow. But anyway, no, I get your point because from, and the way I really feel, as much as, you know, I have to play devil's advocate on the show sometimes.

1715
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:43,000
The way I really feel is that, okay, well, these things may not be an issue now, but it seems like whenever something goes wrong in society, video games will ultimately get blamed.

1716
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So the next time there's a shooting or something, we're going to be right back to where we were, blame the games. It always happens.

1717
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Well, I mean, and like, just to go over some of the important things. I mean, the issues that were brought up just in the very first page.

1718
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:03,000
We have the Dragon Spear thing. We've got the Steam games that we just mentioned.

1719
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:09,000
There's also IGDA criticizing Nintendo for firing Allison Rapp.

1720
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:18,000
There's another one. There was the DMCA takedown of, you know, the Mass Effect Trump thing.

1721
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Lots of other stuff on here. I mean, that's just the first page and it's already a handful of really important information.

1722
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Things that are affecting, you know, everyday things, things that are, you know, speaking about not just the legal side of things, but how, and I'm not going to say ethics and reporting, but I'm going to say just general ethics in relation to how they apply to gaming and the gaming industry and the way people behave.

1723
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
So it's lots of.

1724
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Well, Jamie, is it time to maybe start game politics to Electric Boogaloo led by Dark Sakura?

1725
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Is that, is that what, is that what America needs?

1726
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
You know what?

1727
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
What?

1728
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I just think that if I did my own version of, uh, and you know what I'm talking about?

1729
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Okay. If you have no idea what Dark Sakura is talking about, and I'm sure most of our audience probably doesn't give a shit, but I need you to try.

1730
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Go to YouTube. I need you to try. For Rob Roberts, I need you to try and embrace drag queens for a minute.

1731
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:36,000
You need to go to YouTube and look up Katya and Trixie Mattel because they do a web series called, and I laughed so hard on the last episode.

1732
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I may have piddled.

1733
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I love it.

1734
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I have to explain Dark Sakura's in-jokes because it's just not fair otherwise.

1735
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
So there you go. It's just referencing drag queens, everybody.

1736
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I know. And well, Dan blames you.

1737
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Good.

1738
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Good.

1739
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Good.

1740
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
You're coming over tomorrow to see who's eliminated, right?

1741
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

1742
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Because I have it all on my Apple TV now.

1743
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Yes, I have. I have a season pass for season eight of RuPaul's Drag Race.

1744
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:14,000
So anyway, if I did my own version of, uh, it would basically just be me bitching about people's behavior in video games in the industry.

1745
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:22,000
How, I mean, I would have to dedicate like a part of the shit that I want to talk about to just how all of this relates to everyday life.

1746
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:30,000
And then, you know, probably stuff about cosplay and bitches and, you know, and people that I don't like, I guess.

1747
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, why is it always going to come back to RuPaul's Drag Race?

1748
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I swear this is like the third week in a row.

1749
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

1750
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I don't see a problem anywhere.

1751
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:46,000
You know why it has to keep coming back to Drag Race and why we're doing it because of you, really.

1752
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Because we know that you're going to bitch about it.

1753
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Yes. Dark Tetsuya, I'm actually just specifically for you, knowing that you are going to make that comment.

1754
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
That is why we're going to mention Drag Race next week as well.

1755
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And probably the week after that.

1756
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And you know what?

1757
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And when I do it, I'm going to say, everybody take a shot in Dark Tetsuya's honor.

1758
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
You know what, Dark Tetsuya?

1759
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Dark Tetsuya, I'll tell you when we're going to do it.

1760
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
When we're going to leave off discussing it for one whole episode is when we get you in drag.

1761
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And I mean, shave the brows, shave the pits, get some padding, and we're going to Sephora.

1762
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
That is when we will go an entire episode of not talking about it.

1763
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
When we get you in drag.

1764
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
William Murderface in chat says, Dark Tetsuya, you better sashay away now.

1765
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Look, we're picking on the guy who supported us for like 14 years, so come on.

1766
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
So we're allowed.

1767
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Yeah, we're allowed.

1768
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, Sky is narrowcasting at Dark Tetsuya.

1769
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Look, anybody who spent 14 years with this show, I'm going to narrowcast once in a while.

1770
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
He just says, I can't.

1771
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I hope that's a can't even and not a traumatized I can't.

1772
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
You're learning from this.

1773
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,000
If you have learned the ability to can't, then you are getting somewhere.

1774
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
All right, no.

1775
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
It says that I dept.

1776
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
We can't have RuPaul's Drag Radio because Rob already has reading as fundamental.

1777
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Yeah, that's true.

1778
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
And who knows, maybe I will do my own version of...

1779
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:21,000
All right, Loki, save us from this whirlpool, this pit of despair of Drag Race talk with another game story, Loki.

1780
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Yeah, let's talk about more rumors.

1781
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Woo.

1782
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Yay.

1783
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
It's another NX rumor.

1784
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
The only thing better.

1785
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And this is coming from a verified Reddit user.

1786
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
That's right.

1787
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
They've been verified as to what...

1788
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I don't know, but apparently here is the rumors that they have.

1789
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
They have sources, trusted sources that have been verified.

1790
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So, it's supposed to be x86 architecture.

1791
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
They're going to have some way to back up your data to Nintendo's servers,

1792
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
like some sort of cloud saves or something.

1793
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Support for additional screens.

1794
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
It can handle ports of current gen games.

1795
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
And we'll be able to interact with smartphone apps or smart device apps.

1796
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And also using NX software will unlock my Nintendo reward points.

1797
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
So, yeah.

1798
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
And looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

1799
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Actf says, I trust the verified user, actually.

1800
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
The moderator in the NX subreddit also runs the Amiibo subreddit.

1801
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
SJ100Matt says, verified Reddit user is like a credible post on Neogaf.

1802
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
You know what?

1803
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Here's the thing.

1804
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
As much as we make fun of rumors, some are going to be true and some aren't.

1805
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
That's what rumors are.

1806
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I think a whole shit ton, a lot of us,

1807
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,000
fell for the whole mock-up of the controller thingy thing.

1808
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Okay, so we've all seen rumors gone wrong.

1809
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
So if we're going to be a little skeptical of everything,

1810
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I think you all can understand why.

1811
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Right?

1812
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Are they rumors or trimmers?

1813
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And it doesn't really tell me anything about this.

1814
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
About, like, what this device does.

1815
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Who gives a shit if I can unlock my Nintendo reward points?

1816
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
If I don't want to buy this system, that's going to be completely irrelevant.

1817
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
What exactly is this system?

1818
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
But I guess we'll find out.

1819
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Yeah, thank God.

1820
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Thank God.

1821
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Two more months and we'll have these fucking answers

1822
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
and no more of these goddamn NX rumors.

1823
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And I hope it's not like,

1824
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Huh. Okay.

1825
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
That's different.

1826
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Dark Sakura, as far as this NX rumor goes,

1827
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
are you going to toot it or boot it?

1828
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I don't know.

1829
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
How much glitter is it wearing and does it have ankle straps?

1830
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Alright, moving on.

1831
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Let's talk about e-gaming.

1832
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
And, you know, there's a lot of e-games.

1833
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
There's a bunch of, like,

1834
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Heroes of the Storm stuff going on this weekend.

1835
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I see a ton of stuff on my feed.

1836
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I know. I've had friends that are there.

1837
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Aren't they doing stuff on ESPN2 again?

1838
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Yeah, they are.

1839
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Well, get this.

1840
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:06,000
The British government is talking about an e-sports version of the Olympics.

1841
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
The British government announced the very first e-games.

1842
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
And, by the way, this is coming from the International Business Times,

1843
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
which is a UK press source.

1844
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
The British government has announced that the very first e-games

1845
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
will be taking place every four years

1846
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
and will act as the e-sports equivalent of the Olympic games

1847
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
and take place in the host countries of every Olympiad.

1848
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So, meaning, this year will be in Rio de Janeiro,

1849
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
which is where the Olympics are going to be, if you were not aware.

1850
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
E-games is a non-profit organization.

1851
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
There will be no prize money.

1852
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
But, like the Olympics, it will use national pride and competition

1853
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,000
to generate interest and draw in competitors.

1854
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
And they're actually going to get the help of the International Olympic Committee.

1855
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So, although games are not becoming part of the Olympics,

1856
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:53,000
games are now potentially running side-by-side-ish with the Olympics.

1857
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
This is kind of a big fucking deal.

1858
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Like, I had to look at it.

1859
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I'm like, am I being punked right now?

1860
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Like, is this for real?

1861
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Because this is kind of a big deal.

1862
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
So far, Brazil, Britain, the USA, and Canada have signed up for this.

1863
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
They will have their own e-teams.

1864
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Each nation will be advised by the Olympic Committee

1865
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:17,000
and the UKIE, the UK's video game trade body, to oversee the e-teams.

1866
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So, this is a huge step, I think.

1867
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It will be very interesting to see what comes of it this year.

1868
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I imagine it's not going to be as prolific and as out there as the Olympics,

1869
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
but perhaps if you are running in the same circles now

1870
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
that sees a lot of talk about Heroes of the Storm this weekend

1871
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
on Facebook and Twitter and stuff with the competition that's going on now,

1872
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
perhaps you are going to see a lot about this come summer or fall

1873
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
or whenever they decide to do that.

1874
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I can't imagine they're going to do it at the same time as the Olympics.

1875
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
That's just asking for trouble, but maybe a couple months after or what have you.

1876
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
So, I think it's very exciting.

1877
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
We will see.

1878
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I would love to go to one of these competitions.

1879
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Rio de Janeiro may be a little far for me, but where are they hosting?

1880
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Have they announced for 2020?

1881
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Isn't 2020 in Tokyo?

1882
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Am I crazy?

1883
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Where is 2020 in Japan?

1884
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Tokyo is in Japan, Rob.

1885
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I know that, but the Olympics.

1886
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Aren't the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo?

1887
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Hold on, I'll find out.

1888
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Okay.

1889
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Somebody in chat will probably find it faster than a Wikipedia.

1890
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Yep, 2020 is in Tokyo.

1891
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
There's actdeft.

1892
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Now, that would be a lot of fun.

1893
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Akuma JP, make room on your couch in 2020.

1894
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
All right.

1895
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Let's get to the mailbag.

1896
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Every week we read your emails, which you guys send to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1897
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:47,000
And we will open up the mailbag and find that there are no emails this week.

1898
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Well, I will say this.

1899
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
There was an anonymous email that was sent that had a bunch of stuff that was like, read me, read me, read me.

1900
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
And with all my running around ragged this weekend and not get around to actually reading it yet.

1901
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
And it also said, don't read this on air.

1902
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
So, I won't.

1903
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:07,000
But I'm just going to acknowledge I saw it and I'm ready to move on.

1904
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I am just ready to move on.

1905
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
But you can send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1906
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Yeah.

1907
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
But I will, I will give the benefit of the doubt and all that stuff.

1908
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I'm just saying.

1909
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
There were very good points made in it.

1910
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
And I would actually like to have a discussion with that individual just to discuss.

1911
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
So don't, so don't be anonymous.

1912
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
We're not going to bite your head off.

1913
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
We want to know who you are.

1914
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
We're not going to bite your head off because you have a different opinion.

1915
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
And we're glad that you've listened to us for as long as you have.

1916
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I have a feeling it's somebody who already participates with the show.

1917
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Okay.

1918
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Just, I don't know, it's a wild fucking guess.

1919
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
But if someone says that they want to, you know, not have their name right on air, that's fine.

1920
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yeah.

1921
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
We're good with that.

1922
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:50,000
We're nice people, contrary to what you've read on Twitter or wherever.

1923
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Dark Sakura is like, eh.

1924
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
All right.

1925
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1926
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
So you guys have to send us some more emails for next week.

1927
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1928
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
So let's get to the FUs of the week.

1929
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:32,000
A few to the headache returning and not going away until like now.

1930
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
So, yeah, headaches the worst.

1931
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So, Loki.

1932
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:50,000
FU2, whatever chess cold thing I have right now that's annoying because it's just like uncontrollable coughing and hard to breathe.

1933
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
And I got to go to the doctor probably eventually.

1934
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
But I don't know.

1935
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I don't know what it is.

1936
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I hope it ain't contagious.

1937
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I don't think so.

1938
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
But I also hope you're okay.

1939
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
None of my kids got it.

1940
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
So usually that's, you know.

1941
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
That's a good sign.

1942
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
My FU of the week goes to my back.

1943
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,000
When I was, God, here I go, grandpa gamer again.

1944
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:15,000
But when I was moving, you know, I had to move the OLR computer and all that stuff out of here myself yesterday.

1945
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Which is fine.

1946
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I'm not, you know, being a baby.

1947
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
But I packed the sound board and the monitor in one of the suitcases.

1948
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And I guess I just picked it up wrong.

1949
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I wasn't using my knees enough or something.

1950
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I hurt my back.

1951
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
And it hurt so bad yesterday.

1952
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
But I had to push through for the event, right?

1953
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Because I didn't get time to get my show face on.

1954
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:38,000
So, by the time last night rolled around, I was invited to go somewhere else last night.

1955
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
And it was just like, I can't.

1956
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Because I just have to lie here and feel sorry for myself.

1957
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I need to lie here and feel like hot garbage for a while.

1958
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Is that the line?

1959
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Is that the character in Undertale?

1960
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
He needs to lie there and feel like hot garbage.

1961
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
That was me last night.

1962
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
And my back.

1963
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
So FU to my back.

1964
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Alright.

1965
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Moving on.

1966
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
We just have a couple more stories for you guys.

1967
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,000
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.

1968
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1969
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Thank you, ActDeaf.

1970
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
It's Napstablook.

1971
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Because he naps.

1972
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Napstablook.

1973
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Alright.

1974
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Loki.

1975
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So, this is kind of a neat little thing that's been found.

1976
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
So PunchOut.

1977
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Apparently the original PunchOut, or Mike Tyson's PunchOut.

1978
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
It's been out for 29 years.

1979
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,000
And apparently a Reddit user, Midwestern Housewives.

1980
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
That's the name.

1981
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Discovered a little cue that's in the background.

1982
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:45,000
A visual cue that tells you on when to be able to punch certain fighters in the game to knock them out.

1983
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And so, apparently there's this guy that's kind of like bearded in the background.

1984
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,000
If you see him duck, that's the exact moment that you're supposed to punch them.

1985
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
And then they'll be knocked out with one punch.

1986
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And I guess no one has ever noticed that until this time.

1987
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
It's kind of like an Easter egg.

1988
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I thought that you could one-hit.

1989
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I remember being able to one-hit punch KnockOut Pissed Honda.

1990
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Well, yeah.

1991
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Yeah, you can do that.

1992
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:19,000
But the thing is, to know when you're supposed to do that, that cue happens before he goes in to do whatever he has to do in order to do that.

1993
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I just remember as a kid, you look for the move he does, and you just kind of pray that you hit it at the right time.

1994
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Right, yeah. So before he does that move, that guy ducks in the crowd, and that's when you know it's done.

1995
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Yeah, I saw the video where you could actually see, because it was an 8-bit game.

1996
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,000
So when we say, the guy ducks, it changes from one sprite to another, basically.

1997
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
It's not the most fluid animation.

1998
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
But yeah, it's still neat to find.

1999
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I mean, all this stuff aside, it's still neat to discover tricks and tips from a game that is so old, you know what I mean?

2000
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Exactly.

2001
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

2002
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,000
ActDef says, didn't this cue be discovered by speedrunners already?

2003
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
DarkTetsuya says, this was neat. You really have to work for that.

2004
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Well, lastly tonight in our main news, I want to talk about Mario Maker.

2005
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Because a few weeks ago, there was talk that Mario Maker was mysteriously deleting levels.

2006
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:30,000
And apparently, on the support page of Nintendo, there's now a bit of an explanation as to why levels are disappearing.

2007
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And the explanation goes like this.

2008
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
We sometimes have to delete courses from Course World.

2009
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Below are cases where courses can be removed from the server.

2010
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And believe it or not, they do list low stars and plays.

2011
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:49,000
After a fixed period of time, courses with low stars and plays will be automatically deleted from the server.

2012
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
They don't say how many, they don't say what the threshold is, they just say low.

2013
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Which I'm assuming is sort of a CYA thing where they can just delete whatever and say, oh, it was low.

2014
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:05,000
But I just, I still, I don't want to beat a dead horse because we talked about this already a month ago.

2015
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I'm not sure I understand when you have the power of the internet and a vast space where you can put all the Mario levels your heart desires in the cloud.

2016
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
It's up in the cloud.

2017
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I don't understand why you need to delete something just because it's low.

2018
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Maybe if it's like, literally nobody has played it but the user that created it, maybe I could see that.

2019
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
But since they won't tell me what the threshold is, I don't know what to do.

2020
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Well, whose fault is that? That only the creators played it because you have no goddamn way to share levels easily aside from that stupid code.

2021
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Oh, but you can go on the website and you put in a code on the website and add it to your queue and you go to the queue on Mario Maker and then you can look in the queue for the level you want to play and then play that level.

2022
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
So fucking stupid.

2023
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
It makes no goddamn sense.

2024
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Please, my god, it is the year 2016. Can you fucking do internet already?

2025
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I mean, seriously, we have another console coming out possibly later this year or next year.

2026
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Fix that shit right the fuck now.

2027
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I'm just gonna put that on a shirt. Can you fucking do internet already, Loki?

2028
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Comcast, too.

2029
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Can I put that as a bumper sticker on my car? Can you fucking do internet already?

2030
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Uh, the chat room. The chat room is diving for cover. It's a Loki rants on the alarm.

2031
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Also, now not just the low stars thing, bugs.

2032
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Courses that include bugs that were unintended by either the course creator or the developers will be deleted.

2033
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:50,000
It's important that we remove levels with bugs quickly because letting these levels remain in course world can lead to negative outcomes for many players,

2034
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:57,000
such as players experiencing levels in unfair ways that the original course creator did not intend or rewriting world record times.

2035
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,000
And then lastly, requesting stars from other users.

2036
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Oh, sorry, one more after this, but courses that are explicitly asking for stars from other players will be deleted.

2037
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
For example, using words like like, yeah, and the star symbol in their course names.

2038
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Please change the course name when saving a course that includes these words.

2039
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And lastly, of course, inappropriate content, offensive behavior, that whole type of thing.

2040
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:26,000
You can't spell out, you know, cunt in blocks and expect that that level is going to stay up because that's inappropriate.

2041
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
So don't do that.

2042
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Alright, so, uh, there you go. Those are Nintendo's official explanation of why they take down levels.

2043
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Which is interesting that they explain some of them so well, except for the low, which is the one that everybody's focusing on.

2044
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Like, okay, yes, bugs. We get the bugs. Yes, don't put fuck in your level. We understand.

2045
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
But the low one is the one that, like, their explanation kind of sucks.

2046
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
And I would like to know more about the thought process behind that.

2047
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
But we'll take what we can get.

2048
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
In the meantime, Skype line is open. If you'd like to give us a call to talk about anything we've talked about tonight,

2049
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
anything we haven't yet talked about tonight that you'd like to bring up or whatever's on your mind, give us a call.

2050
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:14,000
In fact, Skype really is the preferred method in the year 2016. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2051
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:19,000
That same cell phone you used to call us could probably be used to use Skype, just saying.

2052
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,000
In the meantime, I always like to check in with Loki at this point and say, hey, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2053
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I don't know.

2054
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Um...

2055
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Yeah, we kind of used a lot tonight, right?

2056
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Yeah, I don't really have anything.

2057
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Yeah.

2058
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I didn't forget to mention that I attempted the Blade DDR a couple weeks ago. That didn't go well.

2059
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Oh, because you're old? Because I've had that moment, too.

2060
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Yes.

2061
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Yes.

2062
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Alright, let's get to the phones, because the line is ringing. Let's do it.

2063
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2064
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:56,000
It's the one and only Ranma. How is everybody out there in Sacramento today?

2065
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Fabulous. Thanks for asking.

2066
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Except for this whole business where when we were talking about OLR going off the air earlier,

2067
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
you were the first one to say, I get the time slot.

2068
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Well, have you forgotten the part where Anime Jam Session is the baby brother of OLR?

2069
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
So, of course, we're going to call dibs.

2070
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Yeah, I know, I know, but we are going to continue to pick on you as well as siblings do.

2071
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
And we will continue to blackmail y'all in return.

2072
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Alright, fair enough. What's up? What's on your mind?

2073
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:31,000
I'm going to talk about this whole FF7 thing where people are, I guess, they're kind of losing their proverbial shit because it's going to be a trilogy.

2074
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Yeah, the whole episodic nature of the remake. What's your take on it?

2075
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Look, we know the story of FF7. We know that when they did the game, they didn't cover every aspect of it.

2076
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:51,000
So, we know that's what they're going to do. They're going to try to go into detail on the entire FF7 lore.

2077
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:57,000
And if we're lucky, they'll throw a nod at some of the spinoff titles such as Dirge of Cerberus.

2078
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I was going to say, besides it was a trilogy, there's Dirge of Cerberus, FF7, and Advent Children.

2079
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Crisis Core as well.

2080
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Yeah, and also, they did say they wanted to go into detailing as possible.

2081
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:18,000
It's going to be more of an action RPG. Did they not say that?

2082
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:29,000
No, and I agree with you. You can see that in the gameplay. You know it's not going to be the same game, and you can see that based on the gameplay.

2083
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
But I think the other important thing with the whole FF7 thing, and let's get one thing clear.

2084
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:44,000
If you're expecting a shot-for-shot remake, except it's going to be in high definition, if you're expecting the voice acting to be word-for-word the script that you remember from when you were younger,

2085
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
you need to stop and prepare yourself for something different.

2086
02:15:50,000 --> 02:16:00,000
This is akin to them remaking a movie. A classic movie in a new day and age. For better or for worse.

2087
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Yes, because if it was shot-for-shot and word-for-word, I think an hour in, I'd turn the game off and walk away.

2088
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:23,000
What I am looking forward to is the fact that it's going to be an action RPG, it's going to be more detailing, the voice acting is going to be amazing, and they're going to go probably into detail into the full lore of FF7.

2089
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Which I think is pretty cool. And they did say it was going to be multiple parts. I mean, not for nothing.

2090
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Yes, the game is going to be on a blu-ray disc that's 50 gigs. Can I tell you this shit right now? At least 40 of those gigs is going to be the graphical content anyway, and the rest is going to be the storyline, so they're not going to be able to fit everything in there, even after you install it onto the console.

2091
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I'm sorry, I love this zinger too much from our chat room. Bobby Blackwolf says, Final Fantasy 7 is going to be recast with all women confirmed.

2092
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Well, I mean, Takara Zuka is quite popular. I mean, look at the Sailor Moon musicals. I mean, come on.

2093
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:10,000
But on a related note, can we talk about the most overrated movie from my childhood, by the way?

2094
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
What is it?

2095
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Ghostbusters.

2096
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Okay, we're not going to go down that road. We're not going to go down that road. You're on my personal Facebook. You already know my opinion of what that is, and it's legitimate.

2097
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I'm sorry. I know I'm going to hurt some feelings. I know some panties are going to get bunched, but I just think...

2098
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I have Ghostbusters movies on laserdisc.

2099
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I kind of think it's an overrated movie. I'm sorry. I don't think it's that great. I think I could name 10 other movies from the 80s that I remember better.

2100
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
We can start with Gremlins. But anyway...

2101
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:55,000
If you're saying that Ghostbusters is overrated, I'm going to say that Legend of Zelda, the one for the N64...

2102
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Can I remember the name? Because I just bought it. Here we go. Overrated time.

2103
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Overrated time.

2104
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
And my first mask. Both of those games were overrated as fuck.

2105
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Exactly! They were the...

2106
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Guess what? I agree with you.

2107
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Try again, asshole.

2108
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
You're a dick.

2109
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Well, I will say... Wait, wait. Put that... Keyboard warriors, stop typing. Hold on, hold on. Here's the thing.

2110
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I've grown to understand more after time has passed why people feel so strongly about Ogreen of Time as they do.

2111
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Keep in mind... Walk a mile in my shoes for a minute.

2112
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I had to go from Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, to the Ogreen of Time.

2113
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,000
And that whole 2D to 3D thing did not sit well with me and a lot of gamers of mine.

2114
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
So anyway...

2115
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Okay, Brad from Pod Culture says Mass Effect is overrated. Now you're just trying to hurt.

2116
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I mean, not for nothing. I mean, he kinda has a point.

2117
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
No, now you're just trying to be mean. Now you're just trying to be mean.

2118
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Come on, Rob. You kinda opened the door on that.

2119
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Alright, look, look. I didn't even get to say this. As much as I said all that stuff about the movie, two things.

2120
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
The Stafe Puff Marshmallow Man is pretty rad. I'll give you that.

2121
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,000
And the video game kicked ass.

2122
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,000
And that's what I remember fondly.

2123
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:29,000
And maybe that's why I feel the way I do, is that for me, Ghostbusters was never about the movie, it was about the game. For me.

2124
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
But that's me.

2125
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Anyway, wow, we got from Final Fantasy 7 to Ghostbusters and it's all thanks to Bobby Black Wolf.

2126
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Somebody had to fire that shot.

2127
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I'm not the one that put the .357 in his hand. All I know is he had bullets.

2128
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Guns don't kill people, Rama. I kill people.

2129
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Oh, God. Now, now, now, now. You shoot like a stormtrooper, man. We're all gonna live. We're good.

2130
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Alright, I am now removing you from the program.

2131
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:07,000
No, did you have anything else? Oh, seriously, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we let you go?

2132
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Oh, no, no. I just want my thoughts on the whole FF7 thing. People just need to calm down, enjoy it.

2133
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:17,000
You're gonna get more of the lore and questions are going to be answered.

2134
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:21,000
And if that's not enough, go fuck yourself.

2135
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I mean, really. These companies are giving, they're doing what they can.

2136
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:31,000
If that's not enough, you can just go make your own opinion, have your own little fart circle, you know?

2137
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:37,000
And then be like, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah. And then they'll be like, you know what, you're wrong, here's a middle finger, have a nice day.

2138
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Hey, no, I'm right.

2139
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
And if you don't like it, go fuck yourself.

2140
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I'm gonna put that on my car, too.

2141
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,000
I'm gonna get pulled over by all the cops. Anyway.

2142
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I agree. Everybody needs to calm their tits. The game isn't even, like, we don't even have the first gameplay demo of the game.

2143
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Everybody needs to calm down until we actually get to play the game. And then we can start to make decisions.

2144
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I will say this, though, as a bit of an aside, because again, this is the week we were gone, but the Final Fantasy XV demo...

2145
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Yeah, that was pretty good.

2146
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I don't know how many of you guys checked that out, but...

2147
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I forgot the mention I played.

2148
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Wait, wait, wait, FFXV, you mean Bros in the Hood? Okay.

2149
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
No, this is more like, it's Kingdom Hearts, but it's not Kingdom Hearts.

2150
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Yeah, right? I was like, oh my god, I'm playing Kingdom Hearts 3, especially the level with the bricks and all that stuff.

2151
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:41,000
But when I saw that trailer, I cackled when I saw the theme song was Stand By Me for, like, the four dudes on the bro trip, right?

2152
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:46,000
But then I also had feels, because I'm like, oh my god, Florence and the Machine? Like, that woman is fucking perfect.

2153
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,000
They're gonna totally poke a dead dude.

2154
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Brofancy XV.

2155
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:59,000
That's gonna be one of the first battles, you know what, teaching you the battle system and everything?

2156
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
It's gonna be a dead dude, your weapon's gonna be a stick, you're gonna have poke. Or run.

2157
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:13,000
If you have not seen the gif of the dudes in the car, is Sephiroth trolling alongside them? I don't know. I don't know.

2158
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I'm willing to give the game a chance. Alan Alchemy in chat says, if the remake isn't up to snuff, they can just go write 500 more pages of fanfic, making it how they want it, like they've been doing since 1997.

2159
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Exactly! Alan Alchemy, he nailed it. That's exactly what it is. There you go.

2160
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
There's a reason why I keep that man close.

2161
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
As long as we can get some Haddaway in the car, and get them all head bobbing.

2162
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Has somebody done that YouTube yet?

2163
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I think, probably. Internet, don't let me down.

2164
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I'm pretty sure that's probably in existence already.

2165
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Rom, I gotta let you go to free up the line.

2166
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,000
If it's not a YouTube video, give it a year, it'll be an anime con.

2167
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Awesome. Can't wait. Front row seat. Alright, take care my friend.

2168
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
YouTube, bro. Bye. Bye.

2169
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:03,000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2170
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,000
We're getting another call, coming in right now. Let's get to it.

2171
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2172
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Hey, Rom!

2173
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
It's Marissa, isn't it?

2174
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Yes, it is. How you doing?

2175
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Good, these are my favorite phone calls. What's up, Marissa?

2176
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Marissa!

2177
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Hi, kids! How's it going?

2178
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Good. It would be better if you were here, but I understand.

2179
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Yeah, dammit. I have a nicer car, but now I only get 22 miles a gallon, so it's very painful to look at that drive.

2180
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Travel and six hour drive. Well, what's on your mind?

2181
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I'm sorry?

2182
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
What's on your mind?

2183
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I was calling to say hello. I guess you weren't able to make it to WonderCon this year, but that was a blast. That was a lot of fun.

2184
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Hopefully, you're gonna come down. I'm gonna just invent a convention for you guys to come down for.

2185
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I love that idea. And actually, a friend of mine, a really good friend of mine, Victoria, was that, for those of you that listen to guys on the show, she was on episode four.

2186
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I'm gonna call it fanfic, because I've actually written fanfic in my head where you and Victoria are friends, because you were both at WonderCon, and you probably even saw each other.

2187
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:16,000
She was dressed as some Disney princess every day. No, she was dressed as the-

2188
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
She was Lottie. She did Lottie.

2189
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:21,000
She did Lottie, she did the wench from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. And that's my favorite.

2190
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
The redhead.

2191
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
The redhead.

2192
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Marissa, if you come to Disneyland on my- I should say California Adventure on my birthday, or for my birthday, which is- I'm gonna be there on May 1st, so I won't be on the show, Rob, sorry.

2193
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Just tell all the listeners where to find you.

2194
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:39,000
But Victoria will be there, and you two can meet, and the world can explode.

2195
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I would love that.

2196
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:58,000
You know, actually, I do think I saw her, because I had another friend who was cosplaying as Ariel when she had legs, and there was, like, Disney princess or Disney-related people taking pictures, and the obligatory, you know, redheaded cosplay, so I dug out the Jessica Rabbit outfit, although I did not wear that on the subway. I brought a change of clothes.

2197
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,000
That would have made for some interesting stories, though.

2198
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Now, Victoria has done a Jessica Rabbit at Rocky Horror Picture Show, so you guys have, like, a thing. You have the Jessica Rabbit thing.

2199
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
If you have enough bust and red hair, like, you know, you have certain options of, you know-

2200
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Really? Because I haven't tried yet, but maybe I should.

2201
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I also thought of you two because I mentioned a certain program, I don't know if you're familiar with, I probably shouldn't, like, crap on them, but I was going to a comedy show, and I guess that they made the front room, which didn't used to be a room, at the place where all the stand-ups were going to see.

2202
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I know if anyone here knows Mike Polk, Jr., he does a lot of stuff on YouTube, I love him. All of a sudden we're sitting in the main room, and they're playing video games, and 40 minutes, like, into it, we realized, this isn't that the other show is running long, this is the show.

2203
02:25:51,000 --> 02:26:06,000
And I was like, oh my God! I thought of you guys, though, because although they have a large amount of success, it was not entertaining, and I wasn't being like, you know, like, Grandma, I don't understand these kids and their video game shows. No, it wasn't, you know, witty or entertaining.

2204
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:26,000
You know, like, your ability to project, you know, to play video games in a comedy club, that's funny, but I mean, that's a fun idea, but you still have to, you know, be entertaining. So, that was, I guess that's the new craze of entertainment right here, like, you have a successful enough channel, you know, you rent out the various venues.

2205
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:39,000
There's always gonna be that thing that so many people are into, like a TV show or a movie or something, and you're that asshole sitting in the back corner going, I don't get it. Like, literally the phone call we just took, Marissa.

2206
02:26:40,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Well, yeah, it's funny, because I'm not like one of those grandmas, because I know so many people that complain about Let's Plays and things like that, and I enjoy them, and I see why you like to share that experience. I see why when you have your friends together, and you're playing video game challenges together, you know, why that can be funny, but if you actually got, like, a bunch of really good comedians together, or even you guys, you're so funny, and did the same thing, it would be entertaining.

2207
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:16,000
But nowadays, it's just like if you have an impressive amount of metrics, you know, and followers, that, like, the actual part of being entertaining doesn't matter. It's like one of those things where people are there taking pictures of themselves at the event to impress their friends more than the event.

2208
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I personally believe this, and not everybody agrees with me, but I really feel like the best Let's Plays are where the video game is secondary.

2209
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Yeah, you still have to have an interesting perspective, yeah.

2210
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Yeah, the video game, it's like an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway, where the video game is just kind of the device, it's that prop, but it's really the funny people and the personalities that make it great.

2211
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Which actually makes me think, I would love nothing more than for, like, Ryan Stiles, Colin Mockery, Wayne Brady, and Greg Proops to, like, have a Let's Play channel.

2212
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Like, how is that not a thing?

2213
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Well, you know that somehow Patton Oswalt, given that he is so certifiably, you know, geeky himself, he somehow has to slip in there who's lying credit or not.

2214
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
It's true.

2215
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
His channel would be awesome, too.

2216
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
That would be awesome.

2217
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
That would be hilarious. I'm gonna go see him this week, too. Yay, we love Greg Proops.

2218
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Yeah, well, give him a big hug for me, because that man is awesome.

2219
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Marissa, I swear I'm gonna find a reason to come to LA soon. You know, a lot of people have been saying I should go to DragCon, because that is, like, the week after Dark Soccer's gonna be there.

2220
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
In fact, I'm kind of surprised she didn't push her whole trip back a week to go to DragCon.

2221
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
What? I didn't even know.

2222
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Yeah, RuPaul's DragCon is gonna be-

2223
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I can't take Dan to that, though.

2224
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Well, you could.

2225
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I want Dan to be there for my birthday thing.

2226
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
But anyway-

2227
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I'm glad you have to, and I was talking earlier about taking the subway and how I didn't want to wear my Jessica Rabbit outfit, you know, because you don't have to worry about parking.

2228
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,000
That is a day where I would want to just sit and watch people on the subway. That would be an interesting day.

2229
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:59,000
What I'm trying to do with the new job, I don't have as much time off, because it's a new job. Like, my last job I was at for 14 years, so I had a lot of time off available by the 14th year, right?

2230
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:07,000
So this new job, I don't have a lot of time off right now, but I'm trying to save pretty good, so that way in the coming years, I'll have a little extra time to do more,

2231
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Hey, let's go to Disneyland this weekend, type of trips, because right now I have to plan everything in advance.

2232
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Okay, well yay!

2233
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Alright, well Marissa, my dear, I'm gonna let you go so we can get one more call and then probably wrap up the show.

2234
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Okay, so maybe now I can actually eat and maybe bathe myself, since I've had this brief respite in between playing Stardew Valley, so that's good. Thank you.

2235
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Oh my god, are you obsessed with Stardew Valley?

2236
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Actually, I was, like, my boyfriend was wondering if he was gonna have to have an intervention until the latest update, my computer's a piece of crap. Made it too slow.

2237
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:52,000
For what it's worth, Marissa, you're not alone. Like, Stardew Valley is like the new Minecraft, Five Nights, it's the new indie darling that people are obsessed with.

2238
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
The first step is that you have a problem.

2239
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I get it.

2240
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Thank you so much.

2241
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Marissa, my dream is that we're gonna do a Let's Play someday for Stardew Valley. That's my dream.

2242
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Yes! We must make this happen.

2243
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Alright.

2244
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Alright, take care, my dear.

2245
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Alright, that is the lovely and talented Marissa calling us there on the Skype line, we'd love to hear from her.

2246
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:23,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, I'll give it just a minute there to see if any more calls creep in there.

2247
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:32,000
While we wait to see if any calls come in here at the last minute, I just want to express again my jealousy of Dar Sakura getting to go to Disneyland, or excuse me, California Adventure.

2248
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
But no, you know what, it's your birthday, you earned it.

2249
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Well, yeah, cause, you know, I grew.

2250
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,000
I'm a little sad about your party, but I understand, don't get me wrong.

2251
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Well, that and, like, only, like, eight people said they could make it, and then I had another, like, feud to say they couldn't.

2252
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Girl, it only takes one person to make a party, and he's sitting right here.

2253
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Well, but I'm still gonna...

2254
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I can't come. I'm sorry.

2255
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I figured we could maybe do something on the show next week instead.

2256
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
We could, we could look at doing something like that, we could get a cake, would Becky make a cake?

2257
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Becky, if you're listening, make me a cake!

2258
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Actually, that's super rude of me to volunteer her like that, but...

2259
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I volunteer Becky for stuff all the time.

2260
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,000
For what it's worth, when I think of yummy cakes, I think of Becky, so take it as a compliment.

2261
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:23,000
That's it. Becky, your nickname now forever and ever is gonna be Tasty Cakes.

2262
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Sorry, I do have a last minute story real quick.

2263
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Fine. We were gonna talk about cake, but we were gonna talk about a story.

2264
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Hey, I'm putting this train back on the rails, so...

2265
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Sorry, go ahead.

2266
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:42,000
So, there's a company called Precision Syndicate LLC, and they're a gun manufacturer, and yes, they made a handgun that resembles a Nintendo Zapper.

2267
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Okay, I don't like that you're bringing this up for Dark Sakura's birthday, because you know she'll be like, I want a gun.

2268
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
It's pretty awesome, actually.

2269
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
No, I don't want a gun.

2270
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
No, it does, I, as much as...

2271
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Maybe the Nintendo-themed Glock.

2272
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,000
That is a Nintendo thing, but yeah.

2273
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
But I don't want a gun.

2274
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
You all know how I feel about guns, but when I do look at that Nintendo gun, I'm like, okay.

2275
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:15,000
You know what surprised me, actually? Because we get advertisements for a gun store nearby, and they sell handguns and assault rifles.

2276
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:24,000
And I was like, dude, their guns are the same price as airsoft guns. Airsoft guns cost the same amount of money as a real gun.

2277
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
What the fuck?

2278
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
That's what I wanted to know.

2279
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Guns are accessible, what can we say?

2280
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I guess it's all the ammo that you have to pay for as well.

2281
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
BBs are a lot cheaper.

2282
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:41,000
That's true. Alright, well sadly the phone does not appear to be lighting up, so I'm going to go ahead and shut it down.

2283
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:46,000
But if you do have anything you want to tell us for consideration in a future episode, please feel free to email us.

2284
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to participate with the show.

2285
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Thanks again to all you guys who have listened to the show tonight. Thanks to everybody participating in our chat room.

2286
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Thanks to everybody listening to us on podcast land or streaming radio, wherever it is that you're listening to the show.

2287
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Thanks for supporting the show.

2288
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Thanks again. I can't say this enough, and I don't even know if they'll hear this, but I just want to say thanks again to Gabe and Brie for including us as part of the Sac Indie Gaming Expo.

2289
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Yesterday was a fantastic thing. It was really truly an honor to be a part of it, and who knows, we may have even got some new listeners from that whole thing.

2290
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Actually, I can say this. I think I'm okay to talk about this. We met another local podcast there.

2291
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,000
We met the guys from Video Game Bang, which, by the way, I still love that name.

2292
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And we are talking about Crossover Weekend. So, we're going to go there and they're going to come here. That's going to happen at some point.

2293
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:49,000
And it's going to be neat because, you know, they're very, and if you heard their panel, you know, they're kind of different gamers than we are.

2294
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:55,000
They play different stuff and they're into different things. When the Pokémon questions came up, they looked at us.

2295
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:02,000
But then there's certain things I'm sure that they're into that we would go, huh? So, we're going to have a fun weekend whenever we get that planned.

2296
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000
That'll be in the coming weeks, so that'll be fun.

2297
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Alright, but in the meantime, we've got to shut it down for this week. Thanks again, everybody, for listening.

2298
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, as I always say, tell a friend or two or twenty about the show.

2299
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Help us spread the word. This is a show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't get the voices out there if they're not out there listening to it.

2300
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:26,000
So, your word of mouth and your referrals, your reviews on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

2301
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Those five-star reviews go a long way and we really appreciate each and every one of them, so thank you.

2302
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:37,000
If you take thirty seconds right now to write a nice five-star review, it would go a long way and we'd really, really appreciate that.

2303
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Meantime, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Loki, good job after a month off.

2304
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2305
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I hope to work more on my game. It's just been really tired when we get home.

2306
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:58,000
So I sit there, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to totally work on it. And then I watch YouTube videos instead, so.

2307
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I'm trying not to do that. I'm trying. It's just not happening. Brain doesn't want to do what I want to do.

2308
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I have like a mental block right now. It's like I have, I'm rewriting, because I went back to my original project that I started, like the first, first project that I was starting.

2309
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:25,000
And I'm redoing everything on it. But I haven't worked on it so long, I don't know where to start, and I need to redo it all again.

2310
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:30,000
So I kind of have to figure out how I need to redo it so it actually works better. And that's taking time.

2311
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
You can do it. I believe in you.

2312
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Alright, Dar Sakura, your final thoughts tonight? Two things. Number one.

2313
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Number one, I regret that burrito.

2314
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
That was a big burrito.

2315
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,000
That was a fucking huge burrito.

2316
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,000
But it looked like a delicious burrito.

2317
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
It was the only thing I've had to eat today other than oatmeal.

2318
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:58,000
I had a burrito in Tucson. I just wanted to share. You know, I never eat burritos. I was so fucking hungry after that Ingress May.

2319
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
And you put something big, thick and meaty in your mouth.

2320
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
You know it, girl.

2321
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:14,000
After six hours in the sun, while I was hungover, after seeing, thank you very much, drag queens, the night before, playing Ingress for six hours in the sun, I was like,

2322
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Alan, I want a fucking burrito.

2323
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I'm proud of you.

2324
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Number two.

2325
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Uh.

2326
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I know you are not a big fan of the video thing, but I swear to God, we need to look at doing something like that.

2327
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
That's what, well, funny that you mention that.

2328
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I, the thing that I kept trying to talk to you about yesterday, that was it.

2329
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
So, we have to talk about it.

2330
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Alright, my final thought tonight is my back is being a jerk again.

2331
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
So, I think I'm gonna do what I did last night and vegetate to MMOs and feel sorry about my life.

2332
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Oh, and feel like garbage.

2333
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Are your lovely lady lumps too lumpy?

2334
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,000
My lovely lady back, apparently, are my humps in my back.

2335
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
You know what, I don't want to think about that.

2336
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
We're out of here. Goodnight everybody.

2337
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,000
We will see you in seven days. We'll do this all over again.

2338
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Have a great week. We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Goodnight.

2339
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
See you next week.

2340
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Thanks for watching!
