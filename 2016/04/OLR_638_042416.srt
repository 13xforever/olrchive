00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week Sony's plans for the first PS4 refresh, codename Neo, comes with a modest bump in power but will not cause any incompatibilities for existing console owners. We'll explain what this could mean along with the rest of the week's gaming news and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 638 of our show for this April the 24th of 2016.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California by my co-host, but not tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. DarkSakura is off.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:15,000
DarkSakura is actually going to be gone for this weekend next. Just the timing of some things really unfortunately didn't work out. DarkSakura is out tonight. She came down with laryngitis. She's got a doctor's note and everything y'all so she actually can't talk.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know if she's going to pop in to chat or if she's napping but she's not going to be here tonight and sadly next week, well not sadly actually, I'm actually jealous of next week but next week she has her pre-planned trip to Disneyland, a little bit of a belated birthday celebration with Mr. Dan.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So sadly we're not going to hear from DarkSakura for a couple weeks but she'll be back in a few weeks. Joining me in studio tonight, I am joined by the one and only Techmaster, Loki.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hello.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How are you doing, Loki?

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Almost 100%.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, I was like, you kind of have like a sick thing going on yourself.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, the stupid kids are always sick and then they get us sick. I swear to God, it's like we were talking about it like how we're getting someone to stay home with the sick kids and they're fucking sick every goddamn week.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like it's one thing or another, like our youngest son had like a fever for like five days and then my oldest son has a fever and I was like, God.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, I hope you're feeling better and more importantly, I hope you didn't give it to me.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not feeling that great. I mean, I'm okay but I don't know. It's just had cold stuff and it could be allergies because I had to chop down a tree limb and so as I was doing that, I was inhaling the sawdust.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh sure, oh sure. Yeah, that's healthy.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And it was like, oh, it was also going into my eyes so like...

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's why you have those little like flu mask things you can...

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, I didn't do that.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, whoops. That's probably a bad call. Maybe next time you want to do that.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I'm probably having like allergies or something. As you can tell, I sound congested.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He said I'm not coughing so that's good.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I swear, something out there is trying to keep us down over the past six months. It's like we kind of joked at one point, oh, we're on track to have episode 666 for Loki's birthday but now maybe it'll be on Christmas.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Like that's kind of where we're at at this point. We'll see.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We were not here last week so I just quickly want to address that because it was a bit of an unexpected week off.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Like I said, we don't like missing shows and I know I've talked about this before.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Y'all know how I feel about missing shows. I don't like to do it.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But the reality of the situation is I got a phone call Sunday morning and my last living grandparent had died.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So she passed away at the age of 99.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I know a lot of you write about that on Twitter and I just want to say thank you.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I had written that on Twitter and I got a lot of real great responses and everybody said take all the time you need and so forth.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I really deeply appreciate that. Especially as we have been a little spotty with shows just in the past few months, not intentionally.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just really appreciate that there's so many of you that have really stuck by our side and so forth throughout these circumstances that keep coming up.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I really can't thank you enough but I'm doing fine.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
To have found out that particular day and that morning, it takes a certain amount of extravertedness to be able to do this show for three hours every Sunday night.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And that wasn't going to happen last week. It just wasn't.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sure y'all can understand. There was that.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The funeral was Friday. It was a lovely service and everything.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My grandma, she was 99 years old so you can't exactly sit here and say, oh my god, it's a surprise! We're so shocked!

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wow! But still, it's never one of those things that you're necessarily prepared for.

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But I think we're all very fortunate that she got to live so long.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I just want to quickly say, I think a lot of the nerdy genes in my family probably come from my grandma and passed down to my dad.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Both of them, my grandma and my dad, are super nerdy when it comes to things like genealogy.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And they were always really on the cutting edge of tech for things like that.

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like using new PC applications and Family Tree Maker and things like that.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And getting scanners to scan in photographs and all that stuff.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They actually were part of a society in one of the local neighborhoods.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
All that stuff is really cool.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I remember growing up, I used to spend weekends at my grandma's house once in a while, once every few months.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And she was very enabling in a sense to me playing video games.

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Like I could hook up the Nintendo to the TV, Super Nintendo. She might take me out so we could rent a video game.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I remember the first time I ever rented an import game for my Super Nintendo was at my grandma's house.

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I want to say it was either Dragon Ball Z or Ranma.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was one of the two, because there was a fighting, there was a Ranma fighting game on Super Nintendo.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It might have been that. It was like one of those two.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And I remember playing that at my grandma's house. That was a lot of fun.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And she was always the type that would play board games with me, which I think is video game adjacent.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So yeah, just some memories there. Thank you for indulging me for a moment.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But that is why, in a surprise, there was no show last Sunday.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So again, thank you guys very much for the warm wishes and understanding as we've been dealing with a lot of crap this year.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I mean, all of us, you know, not just myself personally, but obviously Dark Sakura being sick.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Loki with the kids causing God knows what situation to go on.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know. But yeah, I really appreciate that, you guys.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Live.vognetwork.com. We are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And Tiger Claw in chat says, if Dark Sakura can talk, maybe she can use the device Stephen Hawking uses.

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe, but I think she's being told she has to sleep a lot, as sick people usually have to do.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I think that's why she's not stressing it out too much there.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then a lot of people saying very lovely things in chat, so I really appreciate that.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Dungeon Buster in chat saying, haha the Rama fighting game. I remember that.

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, I'm almost positive that was the game that actually played on Super Nintendo.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Spoiler alert, it wasn't very good. It kind of came at the, you remember when Street Fighter 2 came out?

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, maybe you don't remember this, but you maybe read about it.

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
When Street Fighter 2 came out on the Super Nintendo, it really kind of revolutionized things.

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Right? I mean, it was a true, authentic, arcade experience.

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And Street Fighter 2 was huge in the arcade, right?

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it was on consoles, you know, it was something.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And the Super Nintendo version was, I mean, for a 12 year old's eyes, arcade perfect.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now granted, you could nitpick it and find things that don't make that game arcade perfect,

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but for the time, it was a damn good translation.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I mean, you look at games of the past, you know, when they tried to put Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When they tried to put something like Crystal Castles on the 2600, blah.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know, you try to put Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game on the NES.

84
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They had to cut some corners of that too, remember that?

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It was still pretty good.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It was still pretty good, but it wasn't arcade perfect, right?

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But Street Fighter 2 was like, I think for a lot of us, was like that first big moment where it's like,

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
okay, shit, this is like arcade perfect.

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So then a lot of people really jumped on to kind of capitalize on that success, right?

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And, you know, I would even argue Mortal Kombat was a big part of what came of that, you know,

91
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but I think that's a great thing and had all that competition.

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But then there was the whole lawsuit because Data East came out with that game, Fighting Street,

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
that was very, very similar in a lot of ways.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That was a whole other mess.

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So anyway, just, you know, there was a lot of fighting games that came out around that era in the Super Nintendo,

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and unfortunately, a lot of them were kind of garbage.

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I would say the Rama game was probably one of those.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And Tigerclaw pointing out that, yeah, there was a Rama game on the PlayStation as well.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, very true, very true.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Anyhow, let us start off this week.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Usually we do a kickoff topic, but since we did miss last week's episode of Orange Launch Radio,

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I want to get into a little bit of the what you missed with last week's news set to Holik.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So last week in gaming, rumors, rumors, rumors galore.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is more NX rumors.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This one had to do with Wii U ports, that we were going to see ports of popular Wii U games on the NX,

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
including Splatoon and Super Smash Brothers, which I suppose isn't completely out of character for Nintendo.

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But also rumors that there is huge, plentiful first-party support for the NX, which, I mean...

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What? They're going to support their own console? You don't say.

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is the Pope Catholic, but I guess this is worthy of a headline somewhere.

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Star Fox Zero, which came out this week, was getting its kind of reviews and was leaking some information last week.

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And there was apparently a very lovely tribute to Satoru Iwata in the credits of Star Fox Zero.

112
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So very nice to see them paying tribute there.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Animal Crossing last week turned 15 years old.

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I remember very well when that game came out, so that just makes me feel a little bit older.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Microsoft confirming that their E3 press event is Monday of E3 week at 9.30 AM, the same time that it always is.

116
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Final Fantasy VII Remake Producer talks about the fact that Final Fantasy VII is going to be in three separate episodes,

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
saying each episode is a complete game.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They compared it to, like, 13, which I'm fine with that.

119
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm fine with that too, as long as, you know, they're all pretty good.

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I think a lot of people crap on 13 unnecessarily.

121
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I feel like I'm the one in the room that will defend 13 more than...

122
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I haven't finished 13, so I don't know.

123
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You know, 13 had a great ending.

124
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I understand where some people get a little bothered with the hallway.

125
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It was just hard to follow.

126
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The story was hard to follow for me.

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, it gets into... it's very... a lot of made-up words and a lot of, like, I need graphs and charts to help me understand this.

128
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Exactly, yeah. It's kind of like, uh, I don't know... wait, what? Falsy?

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, there's a lussy, a falsy, a pulslessy. Yeah, there's all this, right? There's all this crazy stuff.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then the sequel didn't help, because then they fucking brought time travel into it.

131
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then when you bring time travel into it, then you really have to have all these bars, charts, and graphs, right?

132
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then the third game, I have to admit, I'm not as familiar with the third game.

133
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I didn't play that one extensively, but I've spoiled the ending of 13.

134
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, it was spoiled for me on Twitter, so I went ahead and watched the video.

135
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the little, like, post-credit sequence they have that's very, very touching and kind of puts a bookend on everything.

136
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But the only thing that disappoints me, and this is funny, because this had come up in a conversation on Twitter I was having this week.

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I actually wouldn't mind if they did yet another Final Fantasy 13 game.

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I understand they really want to get past 13 and talk about, you know, 14 is the MMO, it's different.

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But they want to talk about 15, you know, that's the new era that's starting in September and so forth.

140
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I would be all for a fourth Final Fantasy 13 game, like maybe a prequel that has fang.

141
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's nothing but, like, fang, and I suppose you'd have to have Vanille in that as well if fang is in it.

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But I would be all about that.

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think that's another problem, speaking of Vanille, I think that's another problem 13 had.

144
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Was that if you didn't play enough of 13, Hope and Vanille were your very stereotypical, unlikeable, anime trope stereotype kids that, like, you just didn't like.

145
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But the more you play, especially in the first game, Vanille, as you start to peel back the layers, I think is a very complex character that's very interesting.

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hope has kind of a development arc in the first game, but I really think he starts to shine more in the second game.

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And he's actually kind of a badass in the second game, but most of you would never know that because you gave up on it by the time it took to get there.

148
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So I would say if 13 has any faults, it's that it didn't maybe ramp up quick enough in some ways, but I still think it's...

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh yeah, it dragged.

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It does drag a little bit in the beginning.

151
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's also very linear in the beginning.

152
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It is, it is.

153
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But I still think, in spite of all that, it's worth playing through.

154
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's kind of like, surely, aren't there shows on TV where, like, the first season...

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, I know one. 30 Rock.

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was okay in its first season.

157
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It was kind of funny, but it really didn't come into its own until, like, some of the later seasons, right?

158
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like, sometimes shows have a really rough first season and then they start to get better and better.

159
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But, and, like, people will forgive it and watch the first season and then watch the later seasons because the later seasons are the ones that are really good.

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I would say it's kind of like that, but you're going to have to invest a little bit of the time in it.

161
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Anyway.

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, bring back Saz.

164
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Totally.

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He was a very interesting character, too, and had a great storyline in that game as well.

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I do know he sort of had a cameo in 13, too, but yeah, it could have been a little more.

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Kaijuto says, no prequels, please.

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Hater.

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's see.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
RageNator wonders, if Final Fantasy 13 ends up having 13 sequels, would the 13th one be called Final Fantasy 1313?

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, it would.

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Dungeonbuster says, Vanille wasn't so bad.

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'd pick her over those two.

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And Brad from Pod Culture saying, Deep Space Nine.

175
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, thank you.

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That is a wonderful analogy.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Final Fantasy 13 is the Deep Space Nine of the Final Fantasy 13 saga.

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Because Deep Space Nine kind of gets a lot of weird complexities and shit in the later seasons.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So I would say, yeah, I think there's a really good parallel.

180
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In my opinion, anyway.

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So, there you go.

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Anyway, not to dominate our show with a talk of a game that's probably, what, pushing 10 years old at this point.

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What about the Final Fantasy 15?

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, since we've had kind of a spotty schedule the past couple months, we haven't been able to talk a lot about the Final Fantasy 15.

185
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm not all that hyped up about it, to be honest.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah.

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Did you check out the demo?

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I did play the demo.

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It was alright.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I just, it, you know, the demo felt more like Kingdom Hearts than it did Final Fantasy 15.

191
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was alright, though.

192
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I mean, I could get into it, I guess.

193
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I just have to see what the story is, because I don't really know much about it.

194
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It wasn't like, you know, it doesn't, to me, it doesn't seem like it has that Final Fantasy 7 start.

195
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Where you're like, you know, you watch the beginning and you're like, fuck yes.

196
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You know, it's just like that impact, like, let's do this shit.

197
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, that's true. I will say that is one thing Final Fantasy 7, maybe one reason people, like, remember that one so fondly is that that game just throws you right fucking into it.

198
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It throws you right fucking into it, and then like, just the music and everything, it's just like, yes.

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's true.

200
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's true. 13 did lack that a little bit, although, well, ironically, 13 also starts kind of with a big, like, type of war, but it's different.

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not like past.

202
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Like, 10 was pretty good. 10 kind of had that a little bit.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, that's true.

204
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We'll see. You know, I have to see what it looks like.

205
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll probably pick it up, because it looks interesting to just, I don't know.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm still getting used to the battle system as well, like, I'm kind of fumbling with that, but we'll see.

207
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What's so wrong with turn-based? I mean, seriously, I don't understand what the problem is with that. I like it.

208
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's the millennials' fault. That's the new, don't you know that's the new cool hip thing for people over a certain age to do?

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Blame the millennials.

210
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Blame the millennials. Yeah, millennials don't have a big, and we have plenty of millennials that listen to this show. Please realize this is very tongue-in-cheek, what I'm saying.

211
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But, you know, the millennials don't have the attention span for turn-based.

212
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They need something that's a lot more, they all have ADD.

213
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So they're not going to be able to stand the turn-based thing.

214
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They have to have something a little more fluid.

215
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's why they have to go back and change Final Fantasy VII.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's because of the millennials.

217
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know. Like, even the last Final Fantasy game I played, I didn't really get it.

218
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Was it Final Fantasy Type-0?

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Or, Type-0 HD, or whatever that was?

220
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I never really got into that. Like, I played it, and I was kind of bored with it.

221
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, but that was also not really a mainline game either. That was intended to be a different, you know, type of game that just...

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, originally it was supposed to be in the XIII canon, if I'm not mistaken.

223
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, which I don't see how that would have worked at all.

224
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But all the games in the XIII canon ended up becoming different things, because remember, Final Fantasy XV was supposed to be Final Fantasy XIII Versus.

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Which I don't even have, like, an idea of how that would tie into each other.

226
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, my thought, because this game's been tied up so fucking long, obviously at one point they moved it from the PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 4, and, you know, Microsoft equivalents.

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I think they went back and probably completely changed the battle system.

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I wouldn't wonder... Well, no, because I want to say in the early stuff, for Versus, it did have more of an action battle.

229
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like, people were kind of, even in their early days, were saying it looked more like a Kingdom Hearts game or something.

230
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So, I don't know what's been holding up that game, but I imagine it's just been going through a lot of different design changes and so forth.

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And maybe they realized the story really didn't have a lot to do with XIII, so they just made it a mainline game at some point.

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I will buy Final Fantasy XV. Well, I already have it pre-ordered. It's coming. I don't plan on canceling it.

233
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What's that supposed to be coming out?

234
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I always get Final Fantasy games the day they come out. September 30th. It's the big day.

235
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like, we actually have a date now. I don't know if you realize that.

236
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No, I didn't realize that.

237
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's happening! Although, you know it's not happening soon enough in Final Fantasy XV world.

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That Florence and the Machine single for Stand By Me, that is the song for Final Fantasy XV. Have you heard this at all?

239
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No.

240
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's the new song. It's Florence and the Machine, and it's a cover of Stand By Me, the old song from the 50s.

241
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I can't imagine how that would sound.

242
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But they incorporated the Final Fantasy theme into it.

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Huh.

244
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's really rad. I have to bring up a little clip of it so that you can hear that here.

245
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

246
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf saying, you want to know what game I think looks like a Kingdom Hearts game?

247
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Kingdom Hearts III. Well, yes, there is that. Although, we haven't really seen a lot of Kingdom Hearts III.

248
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
When do you think that one's coming out?

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Will we see Kingdom Hearts III next year?

250
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know. Maybe next year.

251
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's not going to be a PlayStation 5 game at this point.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know. Let's see.

253
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Uh...

254
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
SSG100Matt says, no hoverboards, no Wi-Fi, no dice, and attributes that to millennials.

255
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So there you go.

256
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm actually trying to bring this up so that Loki can hear this. If I can find a clip of this.

257
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay. Let me see if I can find this here.

258
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
A little clip of the Florence and the Machine during Stand By Me.

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Here you go.

260
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
See, it has the crystal theme in the background.

261
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Anyway, a little clip there. I kind of laughed when they unveiled that as a song.

262
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I laughed in a good way because I was like, with all the talk about what a bro trip game this is supposed to be and everything.

263
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The fact that it's that song and a lot of people instantly associate that song with the movie from the 80s.

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Which was about, you know, four boys going on an adventure to find a dead body.

265
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
When Stephen King did it, it wasn't even called Stand By Me. It was called The Body, I believe.

266
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It was like a short story in one of his collections.

267
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's very funny.

268
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, kind of funny how that worked out.

269
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Alright, anyway. So, lots of tangents.

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Talking about Final Fantasy stuff.

271
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's get into the types of video games that we have been playing this week and then we'll get into this week's news.

272
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We're going to do a little bit of how was your gaming week and starting off with Loki tonight.

273
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
How was your gaming week?

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So, I actually purchased another game for the Wii U. I have Mario Kart 8 now.

275
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, it took you long enough. That one's fun.

276
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, so I got that because, I don't know, I just thought it'd be cool.

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So, I played a little bit of that.

278
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And then, more Enter the Gungeon.

279
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And, surprisingly I haven't played any Fallout 4 this week even though they did release another update.

280
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You know, the other piece of DLC.

281
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So, I do have to check that out eventually, but I just haven't gotten to it yet.

282
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm on a new work schedule, so I get very tired at night instead of, like, actually playing a lot of games.

283
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What else? Ingress a little bit.

284
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Actually, last week I did play quite a bit of Ingress and walked around and everything.

285
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, I think that's about it.

286
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That Enter the Gungeon game.

287
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I saw that on PlayStation 4 and I was going to buy it and then I got distracted and didn't.

288
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But, I'm hearing a lot, a lot of great things about that game, like, everywhere around the internet.

289
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Now, you talked about that a little bit on the last show because you love the soundtrack.

290
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, and they have a trailer for, like, the game that's all animated and it's awesome.

291
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You gotta check that out. It goes with the music and everything.

292
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But, yeah, that game's pretty fun.

293
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Why do you think so many people are loving that game?

294
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The music's great. The art style's pretty awesome.

295
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I thought everybody was getting sick of the retro thing.

296
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's not really retro. I mean, it's retro, but it's, like, it's just all cohesive.

297
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So, it's all very gun-themed. You know, the bullets that, you know, have guns and everything.

298
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And it's just cutesy. I don't know. It's just, like, a pretty cool art style.

299
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's cute guns!

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, it's cute little bullets that are, like, you know, shooting things and there's, like, everything.

301
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
All sorts of gun-themed things.

302
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Hello Kitty guns, maybe?

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They have a gun. Well, they have all sorts of guns that are in the game.

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I haven't gotten a lot of them. A lot of them shoot weird things.

305
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like, they have a shark gun.

306
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You know, like, squirt guns and all sorts of weird stuff.

307
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Alright. I'm gonna have to check the game out.

308
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I just, you know, this week, this week kinda was crazy.

309
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So, my gaming week.

310
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Honestly, I didn't play a lot, a lot of new stuff. I'm gonna be honest.

311
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I've been spending a lot of my gaming time in Final Fantasy XIV, which is just kinda my,

312
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't wanna say brainless MMO time sync, but it's maybe like that,

313
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you just kinda hit that zen thing where it's like, alright, I have this goal in mind

314
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and my goal is to get my Dark Knight up to level 60,

315
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
so that way I have every single class from Heavensward 60.

316
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I don't have any other jobs level 60, but I have astrologian, machinist, and soon I'm gonna have,

317
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm level 58 on Dark Knight, so I will have all of those level 60s.

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's kinda like a thing I'm going for.

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So, it's like every day, it's like, okay, log in, do a random dungeon for XP, do dailies,

320
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and, you know, just kinda, kind of a zen thing.

321
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But because of that, I haven't been playing a lot, a lot of console games.

322
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I did end up, thanks to a nice listener, I did end up getting a beta key for the Mirror's Edge catalyst,

323
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
which has been going on this weekend, but I think there's still a couple more days left with it.

324
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So, I wanna definitely get in on that in the next couple days before it's down.

325
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Speaking of betas, though, that kinda came and went, I tried the Battleborn beta.

326
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Did you check that out on PlayStation 4 at all?

327
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No, I had no interest in that.

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I couldn't get into it, you know, but at the same time, it's just, I kinda also recognize it's just kinda like not my kinda game.

329
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So, like, don't listen to my review if you're on the fence about Battleborn, because I just couldn't get into it.

330
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But keep in mind, I maybe was not also in the best, like, you know, this week has been a lot of ups and downs, right?

331
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So, sometimes I might just kinda start a game and just be like, you know what, I'm not here for this right now.

332
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And unfortunately, with the beta, there's only so much time to do it and kinda base your decision off of that, yeah, I don't know.

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But I just don't think Battleborn was gonna be my type of game.

334
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Plus, Sony, after I've played the beta, I can't get that shit out of my fuckin' library, thank you very much.

335
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, not even going into your library and, like, deleting it from there? I thought you could do that.

336
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You can delete it, but the entry's still there.

337
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

338
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah, you can't actually remove it.

339
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I think, like, the Destiny alpha is still in my frickin' library somewhere, yeah.

340
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Well, I also played the beta for Doom.

341
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And I liked that a little more because it reminded me of the old school Doom games, but because, you know, again, it's a beta.

342
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And I realized I should not be making a judgment on if I'm gonna buy the game or not off of beta, but let's be real, it's what a lot of us do.

343
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:49,000
As far as Doom, I enjoyed it and I liked that it really felt like a throwback to the multiplayer in the older games with the nicer graphics and so on.

344
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I just wanted to be able to have more control to maybe just battle single player versus bots and things like that, but I get it.

345
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's a beta, they need to test the multiplayer, so I also had to find that out separately.

346
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I may still end up picking up Doom just to dink around in the single player modes and take things a little different pace than playing online with people who've probably spent all day playing online.

347
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Did you check out the sale this week on PlayStation Network? They have a lot of $8 games on there now.

348
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah, I wanted to pick up Beyond Two Souls, but I just didn't get around to buying it this weekend.

349
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They had Little Big Planet 3 for $8.

350
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I already have that.

351
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And I'm like, I don't have it yet, but I'm like, am I really gonna play this? Probably not.

352
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
$8? Yeah, I think it's worth a look for $8. Little Big Planet 3 is still a worthy platformer.

353
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It'll be down cheaper later.

354
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We'll see.

355
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And then betas. Just beta, beta, beta is all I've been playing.

356
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I also played Overwatch, had an open beta, because it's the only way I can seem to play it.

357
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because I don't get Blizzard's logic with the whole super special secret club people that they let in.

358
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because it just gets very frustrating to see all these people on your Twitter timeline that are playing the beta and have been for months.

359
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And then it's like, oh, but you're not, for whatever reason, you're not cool enough to be in it.

360
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And I don't know. It kind of makes you resent it a little bit and just be like, well, fuck this game.

361
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But I did try it.

362
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Why did you pick me? I support you all the time.

363
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Exactly. Like, I was rooting for you. I played Diablo day and all night.

364
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And actually, I played Diablo this week too, because the season finally ended.

365
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But anyway, so I played a little bit of Overwatch during the open beta.

366
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And I got to admit, it's a slick little game.

367
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And of all the betas I played this weekend, I probably had the most fun with Overwatch.

368
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And I played it before they had an open beta maybe two months ago that I also played in.

369
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And I was kind of like on the fence about it.

370
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But I just, I played some characters in this one.

371
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And man, the character design, Blizzard does such a good job with character design in the game.

372
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So, you know, they got just some really neat characters that you just, you want to play with and see their little catchphrases and see how they all kind of play a little differently.

373
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I was playing a character this time in the beta named Symmetra? Symmetria?

374
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Hopefully. Sorry, I'm totally butchering that if there's any Overwatch fans listening.

375
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But she's the one that has the turrets on the ground.

376
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And they actually divided the characters up into their, like, classes this time.

377
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So you can see, here's who the tanks are, here's who the support classes are.

378
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And I was like, oh, I like support classes because last time I played Mercy I really liked her, so I want to play Symmetra.

379
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because I remember playing her at BlizzCon the very first time they showed Overwatch that time.

380
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But I didn't really like her at that time.

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But this time, now that I played her during the beta, she was a lot of fun.

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I loved playing with the little turrets, and she does, like, shielding, which felt a lot like a Disc Priest in WoW or something.

383
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So I had a lot of fun playing with her.

384
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So I think I might actually pick up the full game for Overwatch.

385
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And then I get mad at myself because I'm like, but you're mad at Blizzard because they won't let you in the beta.

386
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You're not supposed to like them, rawr. But I can't help it.

387
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Like, Blizzard puts out stuff that has such good polish it's hard to ignore.

388
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's, like, really hard to ignore.

389
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Say I was confusing Battleboard with Overwatch since they're both free.

390
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, were you really?

391
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I was like, wait. I didn't play either.

392
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Let's see. William Murderface says, the Overwatch open beta starts in about 10 days.

393
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I thought, don't you have to actually pre-order the game to get into that?

394
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Because you know, you can pre-pay for the game and get, like, an extra skin for one of the characters.

395
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I'm like, fuck that. You could pay the full, like, 60 bucks right now.

396
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Give it to Blizzard and get the skin.

397
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm like, wait a minute. Wait a damn minute. I don't like that.

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I do worry a little bit, though, there may be some free-to-play.

399
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm almost positive there are some free-to-play elements in Overwatch, which is a little bit double-dipping.

400
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Which I don't know if I'm okay with that.

401
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Because they have these little boxes that you open that will contain different quotes for your characters, different costumes, different stickers.

402
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You know, things that don't really affect gameplay.

403
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So I think that's why they're trying to kind of balance on this fence.

404
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Because they don't affect gameplay, but they affect cosmetics left and right, right?

405
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But I noticed there was an option.

406
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You know, you get the little boxes free when you level up, but there's an option.

407
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Go to the store. Get money. Drop some Blizzard cash and get money.

408
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Just like you do in Heroes of the Storm, which is free-to-play.

409
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Get all this stuff.

410
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So I definitely think that's an element of it.

411
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Well, wasn't it supposed to be free-to-play originally, and then they decided to do a retail game on that?

412
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, it's hard to say. Nobody really knew.

413
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Everybody assumed it was going to be free-to-play.

414
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because it was a multi-hero game, like Heroes of the Storm, which was free-to-play.

415
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So I think everybody assumed it was going to be a Heroes of the Storm model.

416
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And maybe that's why that whole part of the game is built into it.

417
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Because maybe they were flirting with that model at one point.

418
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But they didn't go that way.

419
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Probably, I would assume the console releases are why they didn't do that.

420
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
When they made the decision to go console, they made the decision to no longer be free-to-play.

421
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I just, I have a weird feeling there's a correlation there.

422
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yes, I know free-to-play exists on console, but does any of it do really, really well?

423
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Like, I know there's DC Universe. I know there's another shooter.

424
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's on the tip of my tongue that I see advertised on PS4 all the time.

425
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But do any of these games do really, really well?

426
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because I don't know. I know there's a few people that play DC Universe.

427
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But it's not Heroes of the Storm-sized or anything like that, you know what I mean?

428
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com, William Murderface says,

429
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You get all the characters unlocked for free, so that sort of justifies the cost.

430
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I know Smite charges 30 for the same thing, which is less, but there is precedent for this sort of thing.

431
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Kaijuto in chat says, Hearthstone is magic for babies. Overwatch can't even touch Dota.

432
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Plus, Blizzard are dicks for banning the cheating in this game offline, and then told the kid they did it because they can.

433
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I have to see more about that.

434
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Overwatch and Dota are not the light games, though.

435
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Overwatch is more Team Fortress 2, and Dota is more akin to Heroes of the Storm.

436
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just for your future rants.

437
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Anyhow.

438
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.

439
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I played a lot of free betas.

440
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And then Final Fantasy XIV, which I actually pay money for.

441
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They do a lot of content updates in XIV.

442
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Keeps me busy, keeps me happy.

443
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So that's what it's all about, right?

444
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Someday, XI will go free to play.

445
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Someday. Keep on waiting.

446
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know XI is finally done.

447
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That happened while we were gone at some point.

448
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Final Fantasy XI finally sunsetted on Xbox 360 and Playstation 2.

449
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You can no longer play Final Fantasy XI on those consoles.

450
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It is a PC-only game now.

451
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I can't see that they're going to go back and suddenly do HD graphics and all this stuff.

452
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And they've ended story support and all this stuff.

453
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But I guess they are still working on it in some capacity.

454
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There is a group that is still working on Final Fantasy XI, but it's very small, infrequent type of updates at this point.

455
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So, I don't know. Don't expect any fancy graphics or anything like that.

456
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah, Alan Alchemy is saying, no more content or quality of life patches for PC.

457
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Well, maybe quality of life. But story-wise, it's done.

458
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
S2100mattagreen with Loki in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com saying,

459
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Still holding out for free to play Final Fantasy XI.

460
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, you know one thing they do a lot of, Loki, is they do a lot of welcome back campaigns.

461
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Like once every couple months, they do this thing where it's like, if you have ever had a Final Fantasy XI account, play for free.

462
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They do that all the time.

463
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

464
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Didn't you say you hopped on at one point recently in the past couple of years?

465
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah, I bought it again because it was like $7 for the game with all the expansions, so I played again.

466
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And it was different.

467
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I would even be fine playing on a modded server, like a private server or something like that.

468
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I don't know if that's something that's out there.

469
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I assume it is, but if it is, Square probably doesn't like it and would like to see that end.

470
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Just like Blizzard did this past week or two with one of the really popular, I guess, underground servers, so to speak.

471
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But the twist on this server that Blizzard finally shut down, well, they didn't go to the person's house and press the power button,

472
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
but they sent a cease and desist, which is pretty much, if you don't have the legal team to back it up,

473
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you're going to get shut down.

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But the big twist was that this server was a vanilla Warcraft server, meaning you didn't play any of the expansions on it.

475
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It was only for regular World of Warcraft.

476
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And there's people all the time that bitch and bellyache about,

477
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, I miss 40-man Molten Core. Those were the days when you couldn't get your mounts until level 40.

478
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That was World of Warcraft.

479
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
None of this cross-server raiding shit.

480
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But I kind of think a lot of that retro WoW stuff was through rose-colored glasses, in my opinion,

481
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
because they did bring a 40-man raid into the game for one of the anniversary events, and everybody was telling me it was a nightmare.

482
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So, I don't know.

483
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Some people out there crave it, so good for them, I guess, but unfortunately, they don't get to do it anymore because Blizzard shut it down.

484
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So, of course, they started this whole petition,

485
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Hey, Blizzard, if you're not going to support non-official vanilla servers, then you need to do your own vanilla server.

486
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But, of course, it's falling on deaf ears because Blizzard, in the meantime, is rolling around naked in piles of money from people pre-paying for Overwatch,

487
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and the additional money they're going to get from selling boxes with stickers and quotes from Overwatch.

488
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And the fact that BlizzCon sold out in, like, what, literally six seconds.

489
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And who cares if half the tickets went to scalpers through a cash exploit.

490
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Blizzard is rolling around naked in their money pits as we speak.

491
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's just like that scene in DuckTales where Uncle Scrooge died.

492
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's Blizzard right now.

493
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
They could give a rat's ass about vanilla WoW.

494
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Sorry, but if you really want Blizzard to make some changes, you have to stop pre-paying for their upcoming games.

495
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Just throwing that out there.

496
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

497
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Did you hear that Steam is going to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment?

498
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
No, I did not. I legit did not know.

499
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Do they accept Dogecoin? Because I had a few of those at one point during the week that everybody was in Dogecoin.

500
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I still have some of those in a Doge wallet somewhere.

501
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I have no idea how to get...

502
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I could be sitting on a fucking goldmine right now. I have no idea. I don't know how to log into it.

503
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So, can I trade Doge for Bitcoin and then spend the Bitcoin to get...

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What could I afford on Steam? Maybe I could get Shower with Your Dad Simulator for half off. Maybe.

505
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Super Hexagon? 33% off? Maybe.

506
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's about what I could afford with all my coin.

507
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
VxjasonXV in chat says,

508
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm sure you don't even have a cent of Bitcoin. Womp womp. Thanks. Appreciate that.

509
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey, maybe we could open up like a Patreon for OLR. Because it's not the thing everybody's doing now.

510
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We'll do a Patreon, but we'll accept Bitcoin.

511
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And then it's like, we're going to just have this money pit of Bitcoin to spend on...

512
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Nothing.

513
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Steam games. Enhance our library. I don't know.

514
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Wyland says, pay me tons. Is that a thing? It must be.

515
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Surely somebody has already invented the Patreon that is nothing but Bitcoin.

516
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Surely that is a thing out there. I'm just not well educated.

517
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Listen, we need lots of money to be able to talk on this show.

518
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Please fund Loki's fast food habit.

519
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Ugh. I'm on the KFC today. I swear. They're just not good.

520
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Alright. Wyland says, pay me tons goals. That was a thing? Alright, I'm going to look into that.

521
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm going to, just because Jason said, just because Jason said, I bet you don't even have a cent of Bitcoin.

522
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, Jason, I am motivated big time by spite.

523
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm going to raise one whole dollar of Bitcoin by the time this is done. You hear me?

524
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Dungeon Buster says, donate five dollars and watch Loki eat a burger. Could we have that happen?

525
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Alright, look. I'll do that without five dollars.

526
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't want to make people think that I'm making fun of the cryptocurrency stuff.

527
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I actually find that whole culture fascinating, for what it's worth.

528
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Just the fact that you can kind of invent this digital currency.

529
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And it does, I do actually really find it fascinating.

530
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And that's why I did get into Dogecoins for the short time that I did.

531
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But, yeah, it still seems like it's taken a while for it to become super mainstream. But we'll see.

532
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Alright, let's move on. We got to do some quick housekeeping and then we'll get into gaming news.

533
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
As far as housekeeping tonight, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

534
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Google Plus as well at Orange Lounge Radio.

535
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
As far as I know, no upcoming shows off for a while until we get to Dragon Con.

536
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But, God, the way things have been going lately.

537
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Who can tell?

538
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I know. Who can tell?

539
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But we are going to do our very best to be here with you every Sunday from here on out.

540
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I do want to give a quick shout out, by the way. This is a pretty big deal.

541
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If you're an Android user and you have the Google Play and the Google Music on your phone,

542
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
we are now in the Google Play Podcast.

543
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That started on Monday, actually, where Google Play has its own podcasting built in now.

544
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So you can actually look for Orange Lounge Radio. We are there.

545
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
There's several other VOG shows as well in the store.

546
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I am not an Android user myself, I must admit. I've been an iPhone user for years and years.

547
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So judge me if you want, but I don't care.

548
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But Alan is an Android user and he's been trying to show me what it looks like and so forth.

549
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I was looking around online and so forth.

550
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You can't really rate shows or anything like that, but you can at least subscribe and get the new shows in your library, which is great.

551
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Especially if you are still using a third-party thing on Google Plus that, for whatever reason, is not updating OLR in a timely fashion, like Stitcher Radio,

552
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:31,000
then maybe you want to consider switching to Google Play Podcasts because I checked and all our latest stuff is pushing out to Google Play Podcasts, so things look great.

553
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
If you do want to use third-party, though, TuneIn is pretty awesome as well.

554
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And the reason why I like TuneIn is that not only can you use that to listen to the OLR archive, but you can also use TuneIn to listen to VOG when we're live.

555
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So it's like one app kind of does both. So that's why I kind of like TuneIn and why I recommend that.

556
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Under 80 with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, push.

557
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Alright, and some comments on the Google Play thing from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

558
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Alan says, it's kind of buried. You need to click on there. We have podcast now banner to go straight to it.

559
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Otherwise, you need to click on my library under music and look for podcasts in the menu.

560
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm also told, and this is very important because I sometimes forget to remember, we have an audience that's bigger than just the US and Canada.

561
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
We're very fortunate for that. But the podcast thing is not worldwide yet, from what I understand.

562
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So you may have to wait a little longer for the podcast thing to hit your country, just so you know.

563
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Let's see, nss2100matt says, fastest way to listen to OLR is to listen live.

564
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But in all seriousness, the more platforms, the better.

565
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's what I say. As long as like a third party isn't profiting off our show without, you know, giving us a little kickback or whatever.

566
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Like I pretty much am all for getting our show out there wherever.

567
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So I don't even really care if people torrent this and put it out somewhere.

568
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because yeah, my thought is somebody might find it and decide, oh, hey, I want to listen to it live someday.

569
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And then our live audience grows, we get more participants, and it's awesome.

570
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So raginator says, I use iTunes to download podcasts as a stream vog.

571
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yep. For the iPhone people, you know, the iTunes podcast, it's kind of had some ups and downs.

572
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But it works enough to use Orange Launch Radio and stream your podcast there.

573
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But it's nice that Android has something that's kind of like built in now. It doesn't have to rely on third party.

574
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Loki, start us off tonight.

575
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So Microsoft has finally sunsetted the Xbox 360. They're not going to be manufacturing any more consoles.

576
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But they will be selling off their initial supply, whatever is currently left.

577
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Of course, along with that, they are going to be still continuing on with the Xbox Live service for those consoles.

578
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You know, games of gold and your party support, that's all going to stay, you know, working for the time being.

579
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm sure eventually they'll shut it off. But yeah, had a good run.

580
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's going to be weird when they shut off the Xbox 360. That's going to be very weird.

581
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And I wonder what kind of pushback the populace is going to have with that.

582
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Because I'm sure there's still games people will want to play online.

583
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Just like happens when the EA server shut down and all that stuff.

584
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
But you know, it'll be interesting when there's no more store on Xbox 360.

585
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That'll be the last plug they pull. But it's going to be interesting when there's no more store.

586
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Well, I mean, I would hope that they would keep those servers still online.

587
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I mean, they have all those Cloud Azure servers or whatever that they are going to be using for different things.

588
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Including on Xbox One, two, like, you know, for processing of different games and things.

589
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'd hope that they'd be able to utilize some of that for keeping those consoles online.

590
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Maybe that might be something that they'll do. I don't know.

591
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's all going to be whether it's cost effective for them. If there's people actually using it.

592
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Because they won't shut them off until there's really no one online for the Xbox 360.

593
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Well, and this news isn't too terribly shocking either.

594
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Especially as they try to get more and more of the backwards compatibility of at least the biggest selling games on the Xbox One.

595
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
At least they can say, hey, there's still a place where you can play 360 games.

596
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's on the Xbox One, but invalid to me until they get Lost Odyssey working, that's for sure.

597
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
They still need to get Mass Effect 2 and 3 working on there too.

598
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They got the first one, but not the better games.

599
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So, yeah, there's still a lot to be done on the 360 front, in my opinion.

600
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But, I mean, is anyone really shocked that this is happening?

601
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
No.

602
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Probably not, no.

603
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Are they still making PlayStation 3? They are still making those, right?

604
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Maybe.

605
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I imagine that, yeah, well, didn't PlayStation 2 just end support not that terribly long ago?

606
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So PlayStation 3, you know, will probably still be going for a couple more years.

607
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But, you know, there will come a day where Sony pulls the plug on that too.

608
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Because, you know, there's no more market for it.

609
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
There's no more price that it fits in as the current generation of consoles gets cheaper and cheaper and more affordable and so forth.

610
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

611
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Cajudo in chat says games like GTA 4 and Red Dead will still be playable since they use System Link.

612
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That's why System Link and LAN is always good.

613
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
GTA 4 is not System Link, unfortunately.

614
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh, is there no patch or anything shady to it?

615
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
There is. There's nothing for GTA 4. However, Red Dead is System Link, so that is awesome.

616
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Saints Row is System Link, though. One and two. But not Grand Theft Auto 4, unfortunately.

617
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That would have been nice.

618
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SSG100Matt pointing out an interesting kind of parallel here, saying they're shutting down the Xbox Live indie game servers in the next two years.

619
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I wonder if it'll be some time after that that they will shut it all down.

620
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And AkumaJP pointing out there's still new limited edition PlayStation 3s here in Japan.

621
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So PlayStation 3, not quite in the same boat right now.

622
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's just Xbox 360 is done for the now.

623
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It'll be interesting to see what Microsoft's vision is, because Microsoft is trying to do this whole PC, Xbox One Synergy thing in a way they didn't really do with 360.

624
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So it'll be interesting to see what Microsoft's going to look like.

625
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Well, they keep talking about it, but I don't see that yet.

626
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
How so?

627
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
What Synergy is there with the PC right now?

628
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well, there's the whole fact that you can play the Xbox One stuff on the PC.

629
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You can't really do streaming PC onto your Xbox One that I know of yet, but I think that's just an E3 away from something like that.

630
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
They're pretty cool.

631
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I mean, if the Xbox One could do kind of what the Steam Link does basically with PC games, and it's not a terribly complex procedure, I really think that's just an E3 away.

632
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
If it's not already doing something like that, I'm just completely not aware.

633
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because it does stream media, right? Because Xbox One would do that.

634
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Forgot to mention, I did try out the PlayStation 4 streaming.

635
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah, that doesn't work well with my laptop at all.

636
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh yeah, no, you didn't mention this on the last show. It was very, very slow and didn't work well.

637
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yeah, it's just unplayable.

638
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I haven't tried it yet, I must admit.

639
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Kaijuto pointing out, oh shit, I thought it was System Link, Grand Theft Auto 4.

640
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Fuck, well, there's the PC version.

641
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
That is true.

642
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
That is true.

643
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
All right, so rest in peace, I guess, Xbox 360.

644
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Although, you know, no great console dies forever.

645
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We still talk about Super Nintendo on this program.

646
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And we still talk about the Sega Genesis, NES, Atari 2600, just Xbox 360.

647
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What I'm hoping for, because they do have, you know, tunneling and everything with, you know, LAN stuff for those consoles.

648
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:22,000
But after they do shut it off, like some sort of independent Xbox Live that they could tie into or something like that, that'd be pretty awesome.

649
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah, it'd be interesting.

650
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It'd be interesting to see what they're going to do when that sort of endgame hits, but I think we're still a couple years away from that for sure.

651
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It will probably be to the point where we're looking at the Xbox One successor before they go that far and pulling the plug completely on the Xbox 360.

652
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I really do think we're going to have to go that far.

653
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But we'll see, we'll see.

654
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Any Xbox 360 memories, Loki? Is there a particular game, is there a particular thing about the 360 that you think, you know, it's kind of one of those,

655
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
this is where the Xbox 360 will be remembered for me as the great gaming accomplishment?

656
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Probably Grand Theft Auto IV.

657
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Mm-hmm.

658
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Because I play the crap out of it.

659
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And you were once a top 10 player, right?

660
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Top 60.

661
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Oh, I thought you were all the way in the top 10 at one point.

662
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It's hard to get beyond that because after a while, like when you play those really good people, if they're losing, they just quit.

663
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And there was no penalty for quitting, so it's hard to excel past that because you have to play the higher ranked players and if they're getting their ass kicked, they just quit.

664
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So, yeah.

665
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I was talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show, but I think one of the great, for better or for worse, I think one of the greatest things the Xbox 360 gave us was the Xbox Live Arcade.

666
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And the fact that, you know, you could download little games.

667
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
At the time, it was little games.

668
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Or, go ahead.

669
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Digital distribution.

670
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You downloaded it for what, five bucks?

671
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You'd get Joust or you'd get an original like Geometry Wars that in some ways, in some ways Geometry Wars was the system seller in the beginning for some people.

672
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well, Xbox in the games was pretty cool.

673
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And then also Xbox Minecraft because that really, you know, launched the whole console Minecraft.

674
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That's true.

675
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And it did incredibly well.

676
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
That's true. The Xbox 360 is the home.

677
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You can actually hear our voice in an Xbox 360 game on the Indie Marketplace in Bungie Ferret Tossing.

678
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We're in the opening credits there, so that's pretty cool.

679
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
This is something we can kind of tip our hat with the 360 too.

680
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But I do think Xbox Live Arcade, I think, certainly like changed gaming as we know it.

681
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You know, it was kind of the beginning of the digital distribution.

682
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And even though it was very much like a drip feed of games in the beginning and it was a lot of reimagining of older games,

683
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
because I'm such a retro gaming nerd, I loved that the early stuff was all retro games.

684
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I really loved that.

685
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And even discovered some games that I missed out on in the 80s through, you know, the reimaginings that came out on Xbox 360.

686
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So I'll kind of always remember it for that.

687
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Hopefully they get more and more and more backwards compatibility on Xbox One.

688
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Because I got to admit, I love turning on the Xbox One and looking at the games library and then all of a sudden,

689
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
shit, this arcade title I bought back in the day on 360 is suddenly like backwards compatible.

690
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Something random like Galaga to show up.

691
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm almost afraid to check out what my download list looks like for Xbox Arcade.

692
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I mean, I've over 100 titles, I know that.

693
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
S2100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

694
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Xbox Live and Xbox Live Arcade in a way hurt real life arcades.

695
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, you could really, I mean, when we talk about Xbox Live, I really attribute that to the original Xbox.

696
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But certainly, you know, the Xbox 360 kicked up that game a whole nother notch.

697
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
You know, and I think because it made living room gaming with your friends something more and more that you could do.

698
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Across a great distance. Yeah, I think it did have a huge impact on arcade culture and all that.

699
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Because people didn't need to go out to arcades anymore to drop a quarter to play with friends.

700
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So, you could do it across the internet.

701
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So, yeah, it was a huge impact on culture.

702
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Alright, let's move on. More gaming news.

703
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We talked about Blizzard earlier in the show and we talked about Overwatch.

704
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And Overwatch, you know, is what came after an MMO that Blizzard was working on.

705
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Not World of Warcraft, but an MMO called Titan.

706
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Titan was in the works for years and years and years over at Blizzard.

707
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And in a very interesting interview over at GameSpot that was done with the Blizzard designer Jeff Kaplan this week,

708
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,000
he had some very interesting words for Titan as it was an MMO saying that the development team failed horrifically.

709
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Now, he said, you know, he wasn't trying to like throw his team or whatever under the bus, but he said,

710
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
you had a really amazing group that was working on Titan.

711
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
They were really talented individuals, but we failed horrifically in every way.

712
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
In every way that a project can fail. It was devastating.

713
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You had these people who came from other companies or from within Blizzard

714
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and who were used to working on games that were very successful, like World of Warcraft, for example.

715
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
To go through such a complete and utter failure is very hard for people who are used to experiencing success.

716
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So, but what's weird is that there, he talks about it was a failure. We never really figured out why.

717
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I mean, we can kind of read it between the lines that the game wasn't fun, or maybe it was,

718
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I kind of read it between the lines that it might have been too ambitious.

719
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And so it might have been a spore like situation, if you remember the spore,

720
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
where like the whole game, the sum of the parts didn't add up to a whole game that was really fun to play.

721
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And that's the impression I'm getting from what Titan is, because my understanding,

722
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and again, this is just a bunch of rabble rabble and rumors and all that,

723
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
is that Overwatch was essentially one part of Titan.

724
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Now, it's been fleshed out and fully realized as an entire game,

725
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
but I guess you could say maybe like there was an away mission type of thing.

726
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Like I kind of think like Mass Effect, like you could do like the multiplayer was like an away mission type of thing

727
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
that was kind of like second to the rest of the game, but like this Overwatch was kind of born of that one element of it.

728
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And so here's the game that we have now. But, you know, Overwatch is very polished.

729
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
A lot of people saying very positive things about it, even though, yes, there's the similarities to Team Fortress 2 there.

730
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I think there's just much more diversity in the character, like the abilities and so forth,

731
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
that makes it feel like a whole different game, Overwatch.

732
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So, you know, hopefully they're feeling a little better, even though, you know, that was years and years and years of development

733
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
that ended up being, I guess, thrown away or just turned into Overwatch,

734
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
which hopefully will recoup a good chunk of that money and then some.

735
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But, yeah, it's just weird to hear that, that, you know, they spent all that time on this MMO and it just, it was not good.

736
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And Blizzard decided not to release it.

737
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That's too bad.

738
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You always got to wonder what other types of games companies make and they spend a long time on, only just not to release them.

739
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Well, I mean, we do get examples. We know there's big games that get cancelled all the time.

740
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
The Fable thing, we were just talking about a couple weeks ago, right?

741
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
There was a Fable game that was coming out on Xbox One and all of a sudden Microsoft was like, you know what, no.

742
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And then they scanned the whole studio. I was like, dang.

743
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You know, it's kind of, wow, you got to wonder.

744
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,000
At least, at least that game people got to play at 1E3. At least it showed up at some point.

745
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Titan never showed up.

746
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
We're just left to believe that Overwatch is kind of like a part of what Titan may have been.

747
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
But we don't really know.

748
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So, all right, let's move on. Loki.

749
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
So, there's been a lot of talks about an upgrade to the PlayStation 4.

750
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
You know, whether it be like a 4.5 or I guess they're referring to it as a PlayStation 4 Neo.

751
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So, the rumors regarding this, apparently the Neo is going to feature a higher clock speed than the original PlayStation 4,

752
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
improved GPU, and higher bandwidth on the memory.

753
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And they've had different documents received about the note that the hard drive in the Neo is the same as the original PlayStation 4.

754
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Basically, you know, they're talking spec-wise, it's just a little bit faster.

755
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:35,000
But what it's supposed to do is be able to support 4K image output and requires, you know, games be like a native 1080p.

756
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And I guess they upscaled those. And it's also supposed to have better performance on the VR games as well.

757
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And it's supposed to sell for $400? I don't know.

758
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And what they're going to say with this is they're not getting rid of the original PlayStation 4 as well,

759
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
but they're going to have like a base mode and Neo mode.

760
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So, any games that come out after like October-ish, they're going to have different modes for those.

761
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So, they're going to have like better visuals on this new system versus the current system.

762
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't know. We're getting a whole mess of trouble splitting the market up that way.

763
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I have a weird feeling too it's going to be a lot of first party games that have this,

764
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
but there might be some third parties that are like, we don't really have the resources for that shit, so no.

765
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You know what I mean?

766
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I just, I don't know. I think it's a really bad idea.

767
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I mean, you're segmenting your marketplace, basically.

768
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And eventually, I understand they're saying that all games will play on both systems, but they say that now.

769
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But eventually, what's the point in putting out a higher spec system if you're not going to take advantage of that?

770
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And is that going to mean that games that are going to come out are going to run like shit on the regular system

771
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
and then run okay on the other one?

772
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't know. I think it's a very terrible idea.

773
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And Microsoft is, they're rumored to be doing something similar, so I think it's just a terrible idea across the board.

774
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Just, if you're going to put out a better spec system, put that out as a new system.

775
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Don't just, you know, new 3DS it.

776
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Because, yeah, that's a perfect example right there.

777
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's like, Nintendo is really guilty for this type of thing, and they release higher spec systems for games that are,

778
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
like a handful of games that are going to run on them, like the new 3DS.

779
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And like, that system is kind of pointless if you think about it, because there's a handful of games that are going to run that system exclusively.

780
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And then, you know, some games that run better on it.

781
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And I really feel like there are no must-have games for new 3DS.

782
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Some Nintendo loyalists would really disagree with me.

783
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm sorry, I don't see a single must-have 3DS game.

784
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Exactly. And it's just, it's kind of like, oh yeah, we really should have done that, you know, when we originally were designing the system.

785
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
New 3DS game.

786
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah. You know, we should have really had that second analog number, whatever the hell they were supposed to be doing.

787
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You know, remember because they had that stupid, the add-on, super wide, you know, extra analog stick thing, which is dumb.

788
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't know. Especially since the specs aren't that much better.

789
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I mean, it's just slightly faster. I just don't know.

790
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It'd be interesting to see how they sell this.

791
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I'm really curious to see how they are going to advertise it, how they're going to sell it.

792
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
If they have some sort of program where I can trade up for it, I'm down with that. You know, that'd be kind of cool.

793
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh, I'm sure GameStop is already thinking of something.

794
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But yeah, I mean, it's just, it'd be interesting to see what exactly they're going to get out of it.

795
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah. I'm curious too. I mean, I don't have a 4K television.

796
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
No, I don't either.

797
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Is there anything in this for me?

798
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Slightly better looking games?

799
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Better VR? Faster frame rates, maybe?

800
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Why not just wait till the Neo 2, then? If this is going to set a precedent for Sony, you know, I'll deal with it like I deal with iPhones.

801
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I'll get every other one, but I don't have to get every one when they come out.

802
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And that's the thing too, is like, you just took pre-orders on your PlayStation VR, and you're telling me that these games aren't going to run well on the current system?

803
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
That you need this, like, you know, PlayStation 4 Neo for them to run better?

804
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
How are you selling that? I mean, seriously, that's just like,

805
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
yeah, hey, we just took pre-orders, but it's not going to run that great? Just letting you know?

806
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That's true. Do I need to cancel my pre-order or the VR? Now I'm starting to worry.

807
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah, it's just, it's ridiculous.

808
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
We'll have to wait until E3 to see how they sell it. That's what I want to know.

809
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetware.com. Dungeon Buster says,

810
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:45,000
psychologically, people are seeing new and upgraded Super PS4, and more than a few are upset on feeling that they have an old system.

811
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Well, to be fair, though, this isn't something that, like, if you've ever owned an Apple product, you haven't experienced at some point, right?

812
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And there's, you know, a lot of these upgrade things happen all the time.

813
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So in that regard, I kind of get it, but at the same time, I'm also not convinced I need one.

814
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And also too, you're looking at, like, you know, you're talking about apps that run differently and stuff.

815
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
We're not talking about $60 apps on the Apple systems, either.

816
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's just, that's a lot, you know, especially, like, if we're talking now that, like, a game's going to come out,

817
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and I've got to wait for the reviews to come out to see how it's going to run on my system,

818
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
because it may be designed for the PlayStation 4 Neo.

819
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It's like, oh, hey, you like that 60 frames per second frame rate?

820
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, I hope you have the new system, because it's not going to get that on the other one.

821
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I mean, I just, I don't know. We'll see.

822
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And from what I hear, you know, with developers and stuff, they're saying that they don't like it either,

823
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
because it's, they have to prepare for all this stuff.

824
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah, if the developers don't like it, that's going to be damning.

825
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That's why I say, like, maybe the first party games will have this whole regular mode in Neo mode,

826
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
but the third parties are going to be like, you know, we're just going to develop for the PlayStation 4

827
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
that you've already sold millions of units of, and kind of work with that.

828
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
That we can easily port over to Xbox One to get those as well.

829
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's also very interesting that they're doing this now, even though I think that they're pretty much like a lead platform.

830
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like, a lot of games run better on PlayStation 4. Is this in response to, like, the NX or something?

831
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
That is a thought, is that maybe they don't want Nintendo to have the most powerful console that's out there,

832
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
so maybe PlayStation feels the need to bump things up a little bit.

833
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I don't think that they will, though.

834
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I can't see Nintendo doing a high-cost system, remember?

835
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Because they're all trying to, you know, that's the problem we've had the last few generations with Nintendo,

836
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
is they've tried to keep it budget-friendly, and so they weren't putting out these really high-end systems.

837
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It would be a nice change, but I just don't know if I'm going to see that happening.

838
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
RageNator in chat says, to be honest, I don't see what the big deal is with 4K.

839
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I saw Star Wars The Force Awakens in 4K, and I couldn't tell the difference between 4K and 1080p.

840
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Hell, I still can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p.

841
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So, I think it would depend on, you know, how big is the TV, how many pixels are you really seeing there, but yeah.

842
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I mean, I get it, I get it. 4K is...

843
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Well, here's the thing.

844
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I can tell the difference, but it's not huge.

845
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
4K, I don't know if it's how well it's being adapted.

846
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I think right now there's not a lot of content for 4K TVs, so I think that's a problem.

847
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And it's almost like the whole 3D TVs thing all over again.

848
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Because remember when Sony really pushed 3D, and they're going to have all these games that supported 3D, and that went away.

849
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's like, is this going to be the same thing, or are we going to be pushing 4K, and it's just...

850
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
You know.

851
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
One, the games aren't necessarily going to be native 4K anyway, so it's upscaling, so...

852
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Is that really worth it? I mean, I don't know.

853
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And games are not going to be developed in 4K for a long time.

854
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I mean, a lot of developers hate HD as it is, because there's so much, you know, definition that has to go into the art and so forth.

855
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Can you imagine, you know, multiply that by 4?

856
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,000
They don't really do 4K on PC either. I mean, it's higher resolution, but it's not 4K, I don't think.

857
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I mean, I just don't see... I don't really see this being that popular.

858
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, what are you really gaining? I mean, is it going to be that much of a difference?

859
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
That's the problem, is each generation when we're doing this, the jump is less and less.

860
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I mean, there's more detail, but it's just not... you're not noticing it.

861
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It's not like you're going from VHS to DVD, and then DVD to Blu-ray, and now Blu-ray to Ultra Blu-ray or whatever.

862
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's not that your diminishing returns on that.

863
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Alright, well, moving on to a game that I doubt will be in 4K, but it's still probably going to be pretty good, and that is a new game called Pyre.

864
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Pyre was announced this past week from the makers of Bastion.

865
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
That's right, Supergiant Games, who also made the game Transistor, announced the game Pyre.

866
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Pyre is about three wanderers living in exile in a vast purgatory called the Downside, and they're fighting for a chance to rejoin their homeland.

867
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:28,000
It will be hitting PlayStation 4 and Steam in 2017. It's a party-based role-playing game, and it was at PAX East this week, so maybe some folks got to get their hands on that.

868
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I don't know if they'll have any callers tonight who are at PAX East, but we skipped out this year, and I know some of our other people who usually go didn't go.

869
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
However, I do know at the Voice of the Geeks Network, the gals from the Electric Sisterhood, they did go. It's in their backyard.

870
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I would be shocked if they didn't go. They are from Boston, so they went, and they will talk about PAX East, I'm sure, on their show this week, which airs Tuesdays here at the Voice of the Geeks Network.

871
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Hopefully they got to get their hands on Pyre, but I do know Supergiant Games, both those games, Bastion and Transistor, very stylistic sort of games, and almost a cultish type of following behind them.

872
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So I'm sure this Pyre is going to do very well for them as well, so looking forward to checking that out.

873
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that will be coming out a little bit sooner.

874
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Alright. I'm not even prepared at all for this.

875
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Good job, Loki. That's always the first thing you want to admit.

876
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Exactly. Hey, it's true. I mean, we were talking all about this bad idea that is multiple systems in a certain generation, and I got distracted.

877
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Anyways, we can talk a little bit while I'm looking this up about games I'm looking forward to.

878
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I can't believe we're only two months away from No Man's Sky.

879
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Finally!

880
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm just like, I'm totally down for that. I can't wait for that to come out.

881
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And it'd be kind of interesting to see what it actually is.

882
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And the more I watch about it, the more interesting it looks, which is a good sign, versus something like Elder Scrolls Online, where the more I'd see about it, the less interested I'd become.

883
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out. That's on my, you know, I haven't pre-ordered it yet, but it is my day one purchase type thing.

884
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It'll probably be a digital pre-order or something like that.

885
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:32,000
You know what else is coming soon that there was just a trailer for? I think it was this week or the week we were off. There was just a trailer for this, and this is coming spring of this year, apparently.

886
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And that is Mass Effect, the ride at California.

887
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Great America is, they say, spring this year. It's going to be open by summer.

889
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
But that's the thing, though. The ride, though, aren't they closing that park, though?

890
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:00,000
No, they are, and this was some huge news that came out this week as well. California's Great America, did I say Great Adventure? California Great America, which, for the longest time, everybody called Marriott's.

891
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Because it was Marriott's.

892
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Because Marriott owned it, and, you know, like the hotels or whatever. So, I don't know, maybe I'm just old or whatever, but I still call Marriott's.

893
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Well, yeah, it used to be Marriott's Great America.

894
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
That's when I was a kid, and then it was Paramount for a long time, and they actually had Star Trek characters that would walk around.

895
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
They had the Survivor ride, Top Gun, everything was based off Paramount stuff.

896
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But now it's the same people that own Knott's Berry Farm. So, it's Great America.

897
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But the big news that came out this week, not just about the Mass Effect thing, but they are going to be pouring, speaking of California Adventure, they're going to be pouring a ton of money into a major renovation of the park.

898
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Really? I thought they were closing it down to build more parking for the Niners' stadium.

899
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
No. No. They're doubling down on the theme park.

900
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Nice. Okay, well that's cool.

901
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah.

902
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I was like, yeah, ooh, Mass Effect ride. It will only be up for a few months because they're going to be closing down the park.

903
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
No.

904
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I thought that, yeah, okay.

905
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So anyways, so games that are actually coming out this week, we've got, let's see, Stranger of the Sword City on PlayStation Vita, including a limited edition before that as well.

906
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The season, or a complete set of Tales from the Borderland coming out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One and PC.

907
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
The Sega 3D Classics Collection on 3DS.

908
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And Pokemon Rumble World on 3DS as well.

909
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You know what was supposed to be coming out, but it's probably going to be delayed again. It's Mighty No. 9.

910
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I shouldn't laugh, but I can't help but laugh just because of how deadpan you said that and what a truth that is over there.

911
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan real quick and check out some of the releases over in Japan on the PlayStation 4 this week.

912
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,000
In the Ultimate Hits Collection now on the PlayStation 4, which means a price reduction for Dragon Quest Heroes.

913
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Gets a price reduction in Japan this week.

914
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Also, Jikuyu Powerful Pro Yakuu 2016 from Konami this week in Japan.

915
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's the baseball game that they have in Japan that I don't think they have.

916
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Wow, they're making games!

917
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I know, Konami is putting out a game, how about that?

918
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
That's surprising.

919
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Lego Marvel's Avengers gets its release on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.

920
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And then Punchline in regular and limited edition, which I believe is based on an anime, at least it certainly looks like it.

921
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That is also out in Japan this week. Again, regular and limited edition.

922
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Checking out the Wii U, you have Lego Marvel Avengers getting its Wii U release in Japan this week as well.

923
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You know what Punchline sounds like? It sounds like it should be a fighting game starring stand-up comedians.

924
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I know that the comedy club here in Sacramento is called the Punchline, so I can't help but, yeah, I make the same association.

925
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm like, oh, it's going to be a stand-up comic game. No, it's not like that at all.

926
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Coming out on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan, this is kind of a big deal.

927
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Hoshi no Kirby Roboble Planet is out this week in Japan.

928
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I kind of did one of those double takes, like, whoa, already? The new Kirby game is coming out already?

929
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But, yeah, they didn't announce it that long ago, and it's already on its way out in Japan, so check that out this week.

930
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Roboble Planet, the new Kirby game. Somewhere ACT-F is ordering a Japanese 3DS.

931
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
There is also a new 3DS bundle coming out this week that's a Monster Hunter cross-start pack,

932
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
as if, you know, there weren't already enough Monster Hunter packs.

933
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But you can also get Shovel Knight in an amiibo set this week in Japan.

934
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So you can get Shovel Knight on the 3DS and your amiibo right there with it.

935
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And, lastly, checking out the Vita this week in Japan because the Vita still gets, like, a lot of releases in Japan.

936
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
That same Jikuyu Powerful Play Pro Yakuu 2016 is out in Japan this week on the Vita.

937
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Eve Bust Error R in regular and limited edition.

938
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Punch Line, also on the Vita.

939
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And Roseto Saogare no Koju in regular and premium box from Nippon Ichi comes out this week.

940
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
This game looks kind of cool. It's, like, a stylistic kind of...

941
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It looks like it might be a horror game that's got a very stylized, like, black and white with splashes of red sort of look to it there.

942
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So those are your Japanese releases.

943
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Dark Sakura would usually do the UK releases, but she's not here.

944
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So I'm going to do my best to fill in and talk about the games that are coming out on the 26th of April in Europe.

945
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Alienation is out on the 26th, as well as Aliens vs Pinball on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Android, iPad, iPhone, 360, PS3, Mac and PC.

946
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And there you go.

947
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
That is it for your European releases this week.

948
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So just another story here and then we're going to get into our classic game of the week for the week.

949
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm taking it over this week. We'll let Loki do next week since we know Dark Sakura's gone next week too.

950
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But for the pick I'm doing this week, I am picking one of my favorite games of all time that somehow has never been a classic game of the week.

951
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So you guys try to figure out what it is while we hear this story from Loki.

952
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So GameStop, kind of getting into the publishing game, they published a game called Song of the Deep earlier this year from Insomniac.

953
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Or I should say they have a deal to publish that game.

954
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:17,000
They are going to be publishing games now also from Tequila Works, Ready at Dawn, and Frozenbite.

955
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
They haven't really announced which titles those are going to be yet, but some speculation.

956
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Frozenbite just announced that Shadwin would be coming to PlayStation 4.

957
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Tequila Works has been working on Rime and yeah, the other ones, who knows.

958
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But interesting to see that they're doing more publishing. I remember MadCats was kind of getting into that as well.

959
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I guess these are going to be GameStop exclusives then?

960
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Well, GameStop's going to have to keep people going in their stores.

961
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It's the whole digital thing we were talking about in the 360s. That becomes more and more and more.

962
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:03,000
We went there the other day actually on Friday and I was going to buy some more Disney figures, but we didn't because they didn't have any that we wanted.

963
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And they're still doing the buy two get three free so you can't beat that on the used ones.

964
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:24,000
We did end up getting though my son Josh a Minecraft cow that you can flip it inside out and it turns into a piece of raw beef from the game.

965
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
He thinks it's awesome. He's been sleeping with it now because it's a stuffed animal.

966
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Alright, well we are going to take a moment now to go back in time and step into the gaming vault as we visit our classic game of the week.

967
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Every week DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game ten years old or more that she says is a classic game of the week and says,

968
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Hey, you insufferable little brats, check out this game and worship it.

969
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But she's not here, so this is the week I can pick Halo just to piss her off. No, just kidding. I wouldn't do that.

970
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Because this week I am picking a game that I consider to be one of my all time favorites and probably part of the reason I'm such a big gamer as it is.

971
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It doesn't unfortunately have a lot of music to it, but I'll try to get what there is here playing in the background a little bit.

972
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So the classic game of the week produced by Microprose in 1991 and designed by Sid Meier.

973
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's right, the original Civilization is my pick for the week this week, which spawned sequel upon sequel upon sequel.

974
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But they're all pretty good. But the original Civilization honestly is one of my, like I said several times, is one of my very favorite games.

975
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I remember when a local PC store here in our area, they used to have like a little demo station set up where you could actually play games.

976
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
They had Civilization on it and I literally spent like two hours there.

977
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I was going to say, how does one demo Civilization?

978
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
You just have to kind of show it on a kiosk and kind of let people play it.

979
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And I got obsessed and I would like beg my mom and beg my dad, buy me the game, buy me, buy me, buy me, buy me, until it finally worked.

980
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And finally I got good grades or something and we finally got this game at home.

981
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So it was, Civilization was the game.

982
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And you can hear the rocking ad-lib soundtrack there in the background.

983
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Because again PCs in 91, sound blasters weren't exactly everywhere at that point.

984
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So you didn't have a lot of like voice to speech or the real like super harmonies and things that we have now.

985
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But Civilization was originally developed for DOS on a PC.

986
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And there have been revisions for other platforms.

987
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
So they did do a Windows version of Civilization.

988
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
They did a Mac version as well.

989
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Amiga, Atari ST, PlayStation had a version as well, which I must admit I've never played.

990
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
The N-Gage had one, which I really never played.

991
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And also the Super Nintendo had a version of Civilization.

992
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Super Nintendo also had like Sim Earth.

993
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
They had a lot of interesting stuff on the Super Nintendo.

994
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But anyway there was also CivNet, and I played that too.

995
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
That was a huge deal. That was released in 95.

996
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
That was the first time you could play Civilization with other people.

997
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Because the first release of Civilization, you know, 91, the multiplayer gaming thing hadn't caught on as much yet.

998
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So it was pretty much you versus the computer.

999
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
You didn't really play.

1000
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I think you could do round robin turns.

1001
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Like you could have a hot seat that you rotate people in and out.

1002
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But that's not the most exciting way to play a game.

1003
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So they did CivNet where you could play online.

1004
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
That came a lot later.

1005
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And of course Civilization, it is a mostly single player, but you could play multiplayer round robin strategy game.

1006
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
You are the ruler of a Civilization, and all you start with is a settler unit.

1007
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Sometimes if you start in a shitty part of the map, it'll give you two settler units as a bonus.

1008
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:05,000
But you get the settlers, and you are trying to build an empire in competition with anywhere from two to six other civilizations, depending on the game settings.

1009
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You do have to micromanage things, including what is your city building?

1010
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Where is your military going?

1011
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Where are you exploring?

1012
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Are you improving the land that your city is next to?

1013
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Are you researching the technologies you need?

1014
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Do you want technology that's going to get you better buildings that make people happy?

1015
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Or do you want technology that's going to get you better guns because you're going to overrun your enemies with guns?

1016
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And that was a big part of Civilization, which later games really kind of explored more was what kind of ruler are you going to be in?

1017
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
What is your path to victory?

1018
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
But even in the original Civilization, there were several different ways to win the game.

1019
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You could either just play the game out to the year 2100, in which case I guess whoever had the top score would win.

1020
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I never would win that way.

1021
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But there was also Space Age, where if you were the first civilization to build a spaceship and settle on Alpha Centauri, then you would also win the game there.

1022
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Or you could just kill everybody else.

1023
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
If you dominated and overruled every other civilization in the world, you could also win the game that way.

1024
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Also, another big part of Civilization was that you could build wonders of the world.

1025
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And as you built these wonders of the world, that could be the pyramids, to the Great Wall, to more modern things like the Manhattan Project that would allow you to use nuclear weapons.

1026
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:38,000
You would build these things and they would have some big benefit for your civilization that no other civilization would get.

1027
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
That might be just something like plus one happiness in every city.

1028
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That might be the ability to use a certain technology that nobody else can.

1029
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And I noticed a comment in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, Dungeon Buster says, I put the pyramids in Moscow because you could.

1030
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:05,000
A lot of folks remember the personalities that this game gave to the various leaders of civilizations.

1031
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Because you could play as a leader of a famous civilization.

1032
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Like you could be Abraham Lincoln was the representative they had from the Americans.

1033
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
But you could be, I think Queen Elizabeth was in there from the British Empire.

1034
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
You could play as Genghis Khan from the Mongolians.

1035
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Then Gandhi from the Indian civilization.

1036
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That one's kind of infamous, right?

1037
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Because Gandhi didn't exactly act like you would expect Gandhi to act because of a little bit of a bug in the way the game was coded.

1038
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Gandhi loved to use nuclear weapons more than anybody else.

1039
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And that was because originally the designers set him to be low.

1040
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Like he was the lowest of the nuclear weapons.

1041
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But there was some modifier that would in the game might cause it to go like a negative one on everybody in their chance to use nuclear weapons.

1042
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:02,000
But when that happened to Gandhi it was like you were rolling back the odometer and it set it back to 900,999.

1043
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So Gandhi would nuke your ass in a heartbeat.

1044
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And so everybody remembers playing against Gandhi.

1045
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And unfortunately for such an important historical figure, what an asshole this game made him.

1046
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But we are all able to separate game from real life I would hope.

1047
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Anyway, Sid Meier of course, a great genius in game design honestly who developed this game.

1048
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Who admitted that he borrowed a lot of the technology ideas from the board game Civilization which was published in the UK in 1980.

1049
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But otherwise unrelated.

1050
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,000
There was a board game of the computer game Haumetta that was published in 2002 however.

1051
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Apparently Meier was actually not the first designer to do a computer version of the board game Civilization.

1052
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
But he's the first that actually carried it out.

1053
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Danielle Berry was going to do it after M.U.L.E. and if you ever played that, that was a really in-depth game.

1054
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And also the Seven Cities of Gold was something that was worked on by Danielle.

1055
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
But then that just never came to fruition.

1056
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And then, yeah, but Meier's did Pirates and kind of ended up doing Civilization.

1057
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Civilization originally was going to be a real time game.

1058
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
But Sid Meier felt it was too similar to other strategy games like Sim City.

1059
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:36,000
So he decided to do something where each turn would take a predetermined amount of time and then would automatically execute.

1060
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:44,000
He went back to the game after Railroad Tycoon and made sure that there was an emphasis on entertainment so that the game was fun.

1061
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
He did not want to simulate a fall of Civilization despite the historical accuracy.

1062
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
He didn't want the game to regularly destroy the player's country.

1063
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Originally, multiplayer alliances were omitted because the computer was using them too effectively, causing players to think that the computer was cheating.

1064
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
But don't you know the computer always cheats? They always cheat.

1065
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Anyway, Civilization of course followed by several sequels.

1066
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Civ 2 in 96, Civ 3 in 2001, Civ 4 in 2005, Civ 5 in 2010, and then in 94 there was also Colonization which also got a remake in the Civilization 4 engine.

1067
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
If you've never played a Civilization game, Civilization 5 is really a fine place to start.

1068
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It's probably my favorite in the entire series next to the original.

1069
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:50,000
But I would not overlook, speaking of Xbox 360 and all that, Civilization Revolution, or Civ Rev for short, in 2008 that was on the 360 and I believe the Playstation 3 as well,

1070
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:57,000
is a great version that I think is more similar to the first game than anything else.

1071
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But it actually kind of works on a console in ways that the other games would never work so well on a console.

1072
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:13,000
There you go. There it is, your classic game of the week, Sid Meier's Civilization, and one of my absolute favorite games of all time.

1073
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Have you played the original Civilization, Logie? Are you a fan?

1074
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:24,000
No, and I've got Civ, like I have several versions of Civ and Steam, but I have not played it, including Civ 5.

1075
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Well the later games get even worse with the whole, just one more turn, that's all I wanted, just one more turn, then I'll be done, I promise.

1076
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And it never works out that way.

1077
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Alright, well there's your classic game of the week, but we've got plenty more show to come.

1078
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We're going to take a quick break and when we come back, rapid fire news, Fugu question of the week, and also your calls.

1079
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,000
We're going to take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1080
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
We're going to handle all that when we come back after a quick break with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.

1081
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Welcome back everybody to OrangeLoungeRadio, live tonight with the 638th episode of our show for this April 24th of 2016.

1082
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
If you're just joining us live at the Voice of the East Network, vog.network.com.

1083
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
You missed a fun part A, we were reminiscing about random Final Fantasy games, that's what happened,

1084
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
and then we were talking about some of the week's news, including the PlayStation 4 redesign rumors,

1085
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
as well as the sunsetting of the Xbox 360, where they're not going to be making any new consoles.

1086
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And I was getting into the classic game of the week, which I picked Civilization for this week with Dark Soccer,

1087
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
she's out sick this week recovering from laryngitis, which, you know, very hard to do a radio show when you have laryngitis.

1088
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
But that caused some folks in chat to be talking about, you know, some of the later Civ games,

1089
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
such as Civ IV and RageNator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1090
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
best part of Civilization IV, Leonard Nimoy. Yeah, that's right, he did a lot of the voiceovers.

1091
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The later Civilization games brought new stuff, like Civ II, I remember,

1092
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
which actually was probably one of my least favorite Civilization games in retrospect,

1093
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
which I know some people would raise me for, but that game had like the full motion videos

1094
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
when you would build the wonders of the world, and that was, you know,

1095
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
that was that era when those are really big, seeing the full motion videos.

1096
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
So, yeah, good stuff in those Civ games, lots of great memories.

1097
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:31,000
It makes me want to go and play Civ V, only I have to book like a 14 hour window somewhere on the weekend to be able to do that,

1098
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and I don't know, I don't know if I can game like that anymore.

1099
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So this was a weird week though, I wanted to make sure we brought this up on the show at some point,

1100
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
although not totally gaming related, we can kind of tie it to gaming.

1101
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
But, you know, I mentioned that we were off last week because of the passing of my grandma,

1102
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
it had happened, and I got the news the same day the show was supposed to be done,

1103
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:03,000
and, you know, it was kind of a rough week because there was just reminders of our mortality,

1104
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I suppose, just all week long as we heard about the passing of so many people throughout the week,

1105
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
including what Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond had passed away, the sassy,

1106
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
which by the way, no relation, bless their heart, somebody thought when they heard that my grandma passed away,

1107
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
thought it might have been that, because it actually was the same day.

1108
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And I mean, to be fair, my real, Roberts is just a radio name, it's not my real last name.

1109
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
There is a tie to gaming though, wasn't she in Grandma's Boy?

1110
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Oh, probably, that's totally, yeah, I think that was her, that's totally the type of character that she would play.

1111
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But I was totally flattered, somebody would think I would have her sense of humor,

1112
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
because she was one of those sassy old broads that we love, just like Betty White,

1113
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:55,000
who I hope to hell is in a protective bubble immediately, just saying, after this week.

1114
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And then we lost Chyna this week, which was, you know, that was a surprise,

1115
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
because Chyna was very young, but Chyna really paved the way.

1116
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And what's interesting, we had just had a conversation about wrestling on one of my other shows,

1117
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Guys on a Show, I had one of my lady friends on.

1118
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
So where did she die from?

1119
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I don't know if they said, I don't know if any of the autopsy stuffs have come out yet,

1120
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
and I don't want to speculate, so I don't know why she died, but she died.

1121
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And you know, she obviously broke down walls, she Hulk smashed down walls for women in wrestling,

1122
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:33,000
and you know, just so much that she did in showing that women can get in there and play with the boys

1123
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:39,000
when it comes to wrestling, and I'm sure Chyna had to be in one of those wrestling video games at some point, right?

1124
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
She had to have been, she had to have been. So there's that.

1125
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And then, of course, the one that everybody's talking about is Prince, with the shocking passing of Prince on Friday,

1126
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:56,000
which, you know, it was so similar to when Michael Jackson passed away a few years ago,

1127
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:05,000
in your 50s is not that old, that's still really young, a surprise, because nobody knew he was sick,

1128
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
although now people are reading into, did he know he was sick, because he said something in his last show,

1129
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
he played his last show in Atlanta, probably a week before he died, and he said something like,

1130
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,000
save your prayers, or something like that, because, I don't know, it was very cryptic stuff going on,

1131
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
but anyway, I don't want to tinfoil hat too much.

1132
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:29,000
But, I don't know if you know, but Prince actually had, like, a game, it was more of like a multimedia experience,

1133
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:35,000
it was kind of back in the day when CD-ROM, I remember, I never played it, but I remember seeing it on the shelf,

1134
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I remember seeing it at, like, Costco, or whatever that was called, I don't think it was called Costco back in 94,

1135
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I think they called it something else, or Costco Bottom, Costco Plus, was that a thing?

1136
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Oh, that's the import store.

1137
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
That's the import store. What do they call the club stores here? Price Club! That's what they were called here,

1138
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and then they got bought. Remember that? Yeah. So I think I remember seeing the Prince thing at Price Club,

1139
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
amongst other, you know, video games that were out at the time, and that was more of like a multimedia experience,

1140
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
because, you know, there were a lot of similarities, a lot of similarities being drawn between Prince and David Bowie,

1141
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:18,000
who obviously was also a huge, unanticipated loss this past year, but just what they both did for multimedia,

1142
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:25,000
and really kind of using these new experimental formats to push things forward, I mean, this was something Bowie did,

1143
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,000
this was something Prince did, and this was right at the height, I believe the game was just the love symbol,

1144
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:38,000
the experience, because that was in the years when he was going by the symbol, right, which everybody made fun of,

1145
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
tongue in cheek, but, you know, when you kind of listen to the reasons why he did it, it made a lot of sense.

1146
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:51,000
So anyway, just shocking stuff this week, and I just wanted to take a moment to tip my hat and, you know,

1147
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:59,000
say that I know Prince is, everybody knows at least one damn Prince song, everybody's probably fucked to at least one Prince song,

1148
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
let's just blow that out of there, everybody's probably fucked to a Prince song at some point in their life,

1149
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:11,000
or if you haven't, you will. You know, it's just like, that's just, his music is legend, and just, God,

1150
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,000
even if the stuff you remember most, like, you know, obviously for me, I remember when doves cry,

1151
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and I remember seeing that video on MTV back when MTV played videos, and I remember, I probably only would have been

1152
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:32,000
about five, six years old, but that was the first time I saw, like, a dude on TV that was, like, pretty like that,

1153
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and yes, I realize, again, people like Bowie and stuff were doing it, you know, as well, but, you know,

1154
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:46,000
with the age that I was, Prince was really the first time I remember seeing that on TV, and yet he could have the sparkles,

1155
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:53,000
and the purple tights, and the assless jeans, or, I'm sorry, the assless, whatever that thing was he wore at the MTV awards

1156
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
that one year, and yet he still oozed a lot of that, you know, masculinity, and he really, you know, Prince was straight

1157
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,000
as far as I know, and he really kind of, like, bended that line a lot of, you know, what's masculine, what's feminine,

1158
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:11,000
who fucking cares, that I thought was always really cool about something that he did, so, but I will say about Prince

1159
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
is that if you only know, like, his older stuff, like, go listen to some of his newer records on a whim,

1160
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
because, like, he puts out, like, I was just listening to the last album he did, as I'm sure a lot of you were

1161
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
when you heard he passed, I listened to some of the stuff from the last album he did, and it's still very good,

1162
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I don't know why the new stuff doesn't get played on the radio these days either, but I guess, you know,

1163
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:43,000
that's just radio for you, what can you do? Dungeon Buster in chat says, but David Bowie really embraced tech

1164
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
going so far as to write an original song for Omicron Nomad Soul. Yes, that might be true, but I don't want to

1165
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,000
turn it into a competition, I think they both pushed the envelopes in their own separate ways, as artists tend to do,

1166
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,000
and there were very few people, I mean, it was an exclusive club, this club of people that embraced the online,

1167
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,000
the CD-ROM, and all these technologies, it's a very, very, very small club that Prince and, you know, Bowie had both

1168
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:15,000
belonged to. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, please realize, Prince wrote a song about Batman that people could make

1169
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:28,000
love to. Accurate! That soundtrack is everything, it really is. Dungeon Buster says, Prince did everything, played

1170
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:35,000
everything, and literally wrote everything, he was an incredible artist, and was also hugely protective of his music.

1171
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That's true, when you wanted to go listen to Prince music because he passed away, you weren't going to find it on YouTube,

1172
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,000
you weren't going to find it on Spotify, you had to go to, you know, you had to buy it on iTunes, or you had to buy it,

1173
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I'm assuming it's on Tidal, or you know, some of those places, and sometimes Prince gets a lot of shit for that, but I read an

1174
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:00,000
article that talked about the reasons why Prince was so protective of his music, and it kind of dates back to, you guys

1175
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,000
know he had rocky relationships with his record companies early on, it kind of has traces in that, and when you kind of read

1176
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,000
about it, it makes a lot of sense. So, you know, love him or hate him for that. You know, it was Prince's music, he could do

1177
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
what he wants with it, for better or for worse, and if he wants to keep it protected and as locked down as he can, he has the

1178
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,000
right to do that. Tigerclaws says, my experience with Prince was during the beginning of MTV, they used to play a lot of his

1179
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,000
music videos, and those were my first exposure to Prince. I wasn't a huge Prince fan, but I remember hearing his music on it.

1180
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Let's see, Alan Alchemy says, the irony in homophobic idiots calling Prince fruity when the man literally couldn't turn his head

1181
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:54,000
without planting a part of his face into a vulva. Accurate, accurate. Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, according to a Kevin Smith

1182
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:02,000
talk, he has a huge catalog of unreleased tracks with music videos, so we may not have heard the last of Prince. Kevin Smith

1183
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:09,000
also did a whole documentary that Prince locked in the same vault. Dungeon Buster says, according to one of his former producers,

1184
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:15,000
there's literally enough unreleased music in there to release an album every year until the end of the century. You know, I wonder

1185
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
if we're going to find out it was one of those things where maybe Prince knew he was going to be passing away, and so he was starting

1186
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
to stockpile a lot of this. I mean, I kind of think he was always doing that anyway, but he especially started doing it with the

1187
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
documentary and everything. Because, you know, Bowie had cancer, tragically, and was doing something, I mean, he knew Black Star was

1188
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:39,000
probably going to be his last album, at least while he was still alive. And when you heard a song like Lazarus, like, those lyrics are

1189
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:47,000
fucking haunting. Because, what is it? Sorry if I misquote this on the spot in live radio, but he says something like, hello, I'm in heaven,

1190
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:55,000
you know, type of thing. It's like, ooh, scary. But it'll be interesting to see kind of what comes of the posthumous stuff from Prince

1191
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:03,000
and so forth, but what a tragedy. Anyway, I'm sorry, I know that's not completely video games, but I think it's just something we're all

1192
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,000
thinking about this week, so sometimes we're a little more than just video games here at OLR. But I do want to get back into video games.

1193
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Loki, you're going to start us off with some rapid-fire news, right?

1194
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Yeah. So, there was a stealth release for Mojang for a game called Crown and Council. It's on Steam.

1195
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I did play that this week. I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, because I knew you were going to bring this up, but it reminds me a lot

1196
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
of an early 90s PC strategy game, which is not that bad.

1197
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:38,000
It kind of looks like an early 90s PC strategy game. So, Crown and Council, you can go check that out. It's a pixelated, fast-paced strategy game

1198
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
about dominating lands as a monarch and trying to keep rivals from doing the same.

1199
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,000
It kind of plays like a board game, too. I don't know if you realize this looking at the pictures and so forth, but it plays a lot like a board game.

1200
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It reminds me of Risk or something, so check it out for sure.

1201
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Yep. And then, you know, we heard a lot about modding Smash Brothers on the Wii, but this is the first I've heard of something on the Wii U.

1202
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:12,000
They have modded Ryu's skin to change him into Goku.

1203
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So, you can play as Goku now in Smash Brothers. I'm assuming as some sort of modded version of the game.

1204
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Pretty cool. I wonder if we'll get into some more of the complex stuff that they did with the last Smash game.

1205
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And then finally, you know, we've been asking the question every time we hear something about Street Fighter.

1206
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So, whatever did happen to Tekken Cross Street Fighter? And apparently, we have an answer. It's on hold for the moment.

1207
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Uh-oh.

1208
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
And this is coming from Katsuhiro Harada.

1209
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:54,000
That wasn't what they said like six months ago, by the way. I remember bringing this up on the show not that long ago, and they talked about,

1210
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
yeah, it's still, you know, we've still got ideas. It was like a non-answer answer.

1211
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah, it basically said, you know, Street Fighter V just released. A lot of people are playing it feverly.

1212
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:15,000
There's a large crowd of them out there waiting, or Tekken 7. We don't split these communities, or we don't want to split these communities.

1213
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:21,000
A good window in which to release Tekken Cross Street Fighter is something that's becoming difficult recently.

1214
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So, it's on the hold for the moment.

1215
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That's weird. I just feel like they're going to have to go back and build it from the ground up because, you know, again, so much time has gone by.

1216
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
They have to catch it up for the current consoles, huh?

1217
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I don't know. I think they could build it up the Tekken 7 engine.

1218
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
All right.

1219
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Why not?

1220
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Well, some rapid-fire news over here. I know a lot of you guys get really excited about the Games Done Quick marathons, and the announcement for Summer Games Done Quick came out.

1221
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Summer Games Done Quick will be in Minneapolis. I didn't realize they moved it from place to place, but they must, because winter was in DC, right?

1222
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:04,000
So, summer is going to be in Minneapolis. It's going to be from July 3rd to July 10th, which, for a lot of people, that's good news because that means the 4th of July is right in that.

1223
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:14,000
So, a lot of y'all will be off work, so I know you're just going to get on the couch in your underwear in a big tub of popcorn and watch the Summer Games Done Quick.

1224
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Some of the games you will be seeing. Catherine, Demon's Souls, Mighty Switchforce Hyperdrive Edition, Fast Racing Neo, the Tetris is coming back this year.

1225
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
What do they call that? The Tetris...

1226
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Was it World Championship?

1227
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Yeah, it's the ones in Japan that aren't out here. The Grandmaster. Thank you, Darcy.

1228
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Grandmaster.

1229
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
That is going to be a part of it as well this time.

1230
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Sadly, what will not be a part of it this time, P.T. I believe Flacco submitted for P.T. because you know he has one of the top three speedruns, but unfortunately I'm not seeing it in the schedule.

1231
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,000
So, maybe for next winter. Maybe it's more appropriate as a Halloween choice. We'll see.

1232
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Some folks surprised when an extra $5 showed up in their Steam wallet, and good news, guys, that $5 credit that's showing up on Steam, that actually is not a scam or anything like that.

1233
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:17,000
What is up with that is if you bought Dark Souls 3 with the Steam Controller Bundle, you were supposed to get an extra discount that actually never posted to your account.

1234
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:23,000
So, Valve never really gave a big update as to why that happened, but that's what happened.

1235
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:35,000
The $5 that came from Valve's MasterCard or whatever, that was a legit thing that is brought to you by if you bought the Dark Souls 3 Steam Controller Bundle. So don't worry about that.

1236
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Also, apparently it's been leaked that there is a Batman Arkham HD collection. Now, it's from a GameStop employee memo, so, you know, here's your salt lick to go with it.

1237
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,000
But, I mean, it does make sense. It makes sense, exactly. It's kind of one of those, you know, when's this happening?

1238
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Remastered versions of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, along with the DLC, supposed to be remastered, but not in the collection, Batman Arkham Origins, but of course that was done by a different studio, so it makes sense.

1239
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:17,000
But the Arkham Knight, not in this collection, but that was on PS4 anyway, so it makes sense that these games are probably coming out for the holidays.

1240
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Apparently pre-orders are going live and the game will release on June 10th, so maybe that's, I don't know.

1241
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Raginator says, aren't the Arkham games already in HD? Yeah, I mean, because PlayStation 3 is HD.

1242
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's HD-er.

1243
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Yeah, it's more HD-er.

1244
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
It's just like, why do we need 4K? I don't know.

1245
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:51,000
They're going to run, it's going to be bigger, badder, and better on PlayStation 4, just like, what, God of War, or Journey, or, I mean, come on, it's not the first game to go from the PlayStation 3 up to the PlayStation 4.

1246
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
There you go.

1247
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1248
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, we slam those words together, we call it foogle.

1249
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And this week we asked, aren't these rumors about upgraded consoles mid-cycle interesting?

1250
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Haven't you read about the PS4 and Neo and the Xbox One upgrade rumors? What do you think of them?

1251
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Would you consider buying a PlayStation 4 and Neo, and that's what I'm calling it until we know a different name, if it was released this holiday.

1252
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Over on Google Plus, womp womp, nobody answered.

1253
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I hear Act Deft is at a tournament this evening, so that might be part of the reason why, so I don't know.

1254
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:40,000
But anyway, let's go over to Facebook and read some of the answers there, where Fifth Dream says,

1255
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I have very mixed feelings about this. While Sony is trying very hard to make sure the user base isn't split between the base console and an upgraded one,

1256
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I can't help thinking that an upgraded PlayStation 4 will be all but required to get the most out of games in the near future.

1257
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Having said that, I've already made tentative plans to sell my current PlayStation 4 to a friend who's been wanting one, so I can upgrade to a Neo cheap if the rumors are true.

1258
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Fat Cylon replied, which by the way, I love that name. I think that's a new name, I don't think I've seen that before, so welcome Fat Cylon.

1259
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Uh, yep, I'll be getting one, though I'm curious how obsolete it would make my current PS4.

1260
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I could definitely use two consoles, but I'm hoping the Neo isn't so superior it renders the older version useless.

1261
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm sure there will be trade-in deals, but we all know how lame those can be.

1262
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:32,000
End of the day, if I'm going to have a PlayStation 4 as my primary choice for gaming, it has to be the best available, so it might be a case of SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!

1263
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Uh, Rettertainment says, I've been following the rumors due to the fact that these rumors are reported as news.

1264
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
As far as buying one, like many things, it will depend on price, availability, and desire for the product.

1265
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Desire is the critical element. Remember, despite being available, I have yet to buy a 4K HDTV, due mostly to me not knowing of anybody who distributes content I want to watch in 4K resolution.

1266
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Um, I think Netflix does 4K, for certain things.

1267
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Well, that's the thing though, Netflix may do HD and everything, but I can tell you this much, I am not getting those types of streams through my stuff.

1268
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Yeah.

1269
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It's, I mean, even if it were to come over as 4K, I mean, it's just not gonna, you have to have the bandwidth for that, and it's gonna come in compressed, I mean, it's just gonna look not good.

1270
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I think a lot of it too is like documentaries and nature stuff, like, let's fly around Yellowstone in an airplane, or let's look at volcanoes erupting in Hawaii in 4K.

1271
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Like, and this, this is the same type of stuff whenever there's new technology, it always starts with the National Geographic stuff.

1272
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And here's the problem.

1273
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And I'll tell you why 4K is just not working out right now.

1274
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
It's cause there's no porn in 4K.

1275
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
There's not enough 4K porn.

1276
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
You say that jokingly, but, I don't know.

1277
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
That's probably a big part of it.

1278
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Even The Rift has porn.

1279
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Yes it does.

1280
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
That's why the time for VR is now.

1281
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
VX JasonXV, by the way, saying there is absolutely 4K porn.

1282
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
How do you know?

1283
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Well, there is, but it's not prevalent.

1284
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Alright, it's not mainstream. It's not mainstream is what you're saying.

1285
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Alright, VX JasonXV says, if you think there isn't any, you haven't looked.

1286
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
That is true.

1287
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And it is true.

1288
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
This is the internet looking.

1289
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I have not looked because I do not have anything that I could play back 4K porn on, cause it ain't gonna happen on my laptop.

1290
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
You can downsample it to really pretty 1080 porn.

1291
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Back to the question.

1292
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I apologize for the porn tangent.

1293
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Right in the middle of listener feedback.

1294
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Right before poor William Murderface's answer.

1295
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
We gotta porn up the show.

1296
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Jeez.

1297
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Anyway, back to William Murderface.

1298
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I own neither, and I will probably pick up a PS4 sooner or later because of Kingdom Hearts 3.

1299
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
So if I can get my first one and it has more power than the base, why not?

1300
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
On the other hand, the idea of games that are exclusive to these variants or run badly on the older variants sound like a very bad idea.

1301
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
This is interesting though as it shows that more and more consoles are becoming almost indistinguishable from PCs.

1302
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Hopefully that fact will encourage them to anticipate problems and learn from their PC forebears.

1303
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Andy Arz says, didn't like the idea of the new 3DS and don't like the idea of the Neo.

1304
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And this is coming from someone who uses their PlayStation 4 on a daily basis.

1305
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I'd rather have to not buy the same console more than once per gen.

1306
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And while I like pretty games, I'm not to the level of the PC mustard rice where I care enough to spend a ton of money for slightly better graphics.

1307
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I see what you did there.

1308
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,000
All that said, we'll see if Sony can change my mind when they officially announce it.

1309
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I will say I think the people who are getting too bent out of shape over this should wait and see how Sony announces it.

1310
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And that's the other thing too is like do we really need to push like cutting edge graphics?

1311
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Because look at some of the great games that are out now.

1312
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
The graphics are good enough.

1313
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
They're not pushing, you know, like Enter the Gungeon is like a 16-bit quality game.

1314
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I mean it's, you don't, that's not going to benefit from 4K.

1315
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:01,000
No, well, the sharper retro graphics, sharper.

1316
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Pixel so sharp it'll poke you in the eye.

1317
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,000
That's the new tagline for OLR by the way.

1318
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
If OLR ever does a gaming studio, or YYR, you want a tagline for your gaming studio, there you go.

1319
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Pixel so sharp they'll poke you in the eye.

1320
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Tigerclaw says, I currently own both consoles, but with the two getting upgrades this will be a problem if they start developing games that run poorly on current consoles.

1321
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Some games will probably only run at 30 frames per second, but at 60 frames per second on the new ones.

1322
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Think of what happened with the 3DS.

1323
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Nintendo has developed games that take advantage of the new 3DS features, but that poorly run on the old 3DS.

1324
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Yes, that's true.

1325
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:46,000
By the way, I'm just saying to Andy R, Chatroom is loving the mustard rice thing.

1326
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Kaijuto says, I love mustard rice, great way to slap those stuck up PC gamers in the face.

1327
01:48:52,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Actually, it might sound weird, but I like mustard and I like rice, so I don't know if I'd like them together, but maybe I wouldn't truly know until I've tried.

1328
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I can tell you this much though, Benihana's mustard sauce is fucking delicious.

1329
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Have you ever eaten that and then some rice?

1330
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And I have had it on their fried rice and it's fucking delicious, so yes, it would definitely work.

1331
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Benihana mustard rice.

1332
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Seriously, that mustard sauce, they have the recipe online at Benihanas.com or something like that.

1333
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
You make that shit, you can put it on anything. It's fucking delicious.

1334
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
That does sound pretty amazing.

1335
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Oh, now I'm craving the best thing in the world to put mustard on.

1336
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
A soft pretzel.

1337
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Like the kind you get at Costco or a baseball game.

1338
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Those are the best, in my opinion. Anyway.

1339
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Hey, one more answer over on Facebook.

1340
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
We keep getting derailed here at OLR. When does that happen?

1341
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Guillermo R. lastly on Facebook says, people spend much more money on annual phone upgrades.

1342
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And it's not that different from upgrading your video card on the PC every few years to get a performance boost on the newer games.

1343
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
My last video card cost more than any of the current consoles at launch.

1344
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I don't think it's such a big deal. If you can't afford the upgrade, stick with the current one.

1345
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
At least they're mandating software compatibility between the two versions.

1346
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And Sony is reportedly prohibiting Neo-exclusive games.

1347
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
If you want better performance, pay for it.

1348
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
What's the point then? If they're just... What's the point then? Seriously.

1349
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I kind of like half agree with the comment. I agree with the whole, thank gosh they're mandating that you can't do Neo-exclusive.

1350
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
So it's hard to get super bad.

1351
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
For now. That's not always going to be the case.

1352
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
That's true.

1353
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And we don't know anything. We're just speculating.

1354
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
That's true. We don't know. It's all tinfoil hats until E3.

1355
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I need E3.

1356
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Or I need the press conferences anyway.

1357
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Alright. There it is. Your rapid fire, excuse me, your Fugu question of the week and your rapid fire news for the week.

1358
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Be sure to friend us on Facebook and Google Plus to get more questions.

1359
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
In the meantime, let's get back to some more news. Loki, what do you have for us?

1360
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Alright. So we have something that really should have been enabled a long time ago.

1361
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
And that's two-factor authentication for the Playstation Network.

1362
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Finally getting it now five years later after the whole breach that happened.

1363
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
They're going to make it available to you.

1364
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Apparently you could use this via, it's a text message using a special smartphone or desktop application.

1365
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And basically, you know, it's something similar to what you see with a lot of other companies that do two-factor authentication.

1366
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
But yeah, I'm down with that.

1367
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Yeah. I will definitely enable this for PSN myself.

1368
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Yeah. I do that for Steam because I've been starting to see a lot of like, oh, hey, someone's tried to log into your Steam account.

1369
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Yep. Steam guard is awesome. And honestly, I really can't stress this enough to you guys out there.

1370
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:56,000
If you're not using two-factor authentication, you really should look into it.

1371
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
You really, really, I mean, it is, it's so important.

1372
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Especially if you have a smartphone that you like carry it with you or whatever, you really need to use it.

1373
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Especially if nothing else, use it on your email.

1374
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
If nothing else, use it on your email. I would say use it on your bank account too.

1375
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:22,000
But use it on your email so that way only you can access your email because, you know, it sends you a text message with the code or whatever.

1376
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And, you know, you have that wherever you go.

1377
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Steam guard is now required to use the Steam market.

1378
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I didn't realize that. I adopted Steam guard as soon as it was out.

1379
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I think they offered like a free trading card or a badge or something for enabling Steam guard.

1380
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I was like, oop, okay.

1381
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Badge, you say?

1382
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
But then also at the same time, two-factor authentication, and yeah, there's plenty of people in chat piping up.

1383
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Jason says use two-factor authentication everywhere. Everywhere.

1384
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Yeah, I use TFA as the hip kids call it.

1385
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I use that, I use it on Twitter, I use it on Facebook, I use it on mail, I use it everywhere that it's available.

1386
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:17,000
And it's, you know, at first, the Twitter one is the most annoying one because when Twitter, when you log in, it sends a ping to your phone.

1387
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And you have to log into the app on your phone and accept it.

1388
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But if the push message doesn't come through, like they have it buried in the app.

1389
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
If the push message comes through, you just swipe on the push message and it takes you right to the screen where you allow access.

1390
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:40,000
But if it, oh my God, if it doesn't push through, then like you have to go in, I have, you guys are going to laugh, you ready for this?

1391
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:49,000
On Twitter, I have, I want to say seven accounts that I manage or own.

1392
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:54,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, yeah, I have seven accounts on Twitter that I manage or own.

1393
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,000
So I have to go into my right account that I want to use first, then I have to go into the options for that account,

1394
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
and then I have to, like it's buried in menus.

1395
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
But you know what, I would rather be slightly inconvenienced than have my Twitter taken over.

1396
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I have a four letter name on Twitter that I think people want in other countries.

1397
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:22,000
So I will keep that two factor authentication on even if it does take me 30 more seconds to get logged in, I don't care.

1398
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, I'm glad to have the Microsoft one, I get people trying to social engineer my gamertag about twice a year.

1399
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:38,000
And I know this because the person on the phone sends me a code via all my devices to have the guy try to social engineer them, read back, and then I get the survey.

1400
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Sheesh.

1401
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Alright, and Raginator says, seven accounts, Sky?

1402
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Well, keep in mind, I'm, yeah, and actually ActDeft actually named them all. He named them all.

1403
01:54:51,000 --> 01:55:01,000
The only one he missed, I have a professional account that I don't cross over into my, it has to do with stuff I do for my day job, so I don't cross the stream, so to speak.

1404
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
So that's the seventh one you're missing from your list, ActDeft.

1405
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Good call, though. Wow, ActDeft knows all my Twitter accounts, I might be a little frightened.

1406
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Alright.

1407
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I think I have like four or five of them.

1408
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Yeah, I mean, you just, you know, you have, it's all the podcasts that I co-host. They're not all solely mine, but like, for example, Reading is Fundamental podcast.

1409
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Technically, John made that Twitter account, but I log into it because I do the Twitter portion of that show, so I have it on my phone.

1410
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
So, you know, I didn't create all seven of those accounts, but I did create maybe four of them.

1411
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
So, anyway.

1412
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about some Twitch changes.

1413
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You know, Twitch, more and more people watching Twitch, socializing on Twitch.

1414
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Pretty soon you're going to have friends on Twitch.

1415
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You know, I have to admit, maybe the chat room can help me out here because I'm having a hard time understanding how friends is different from the follows you have today.

1416
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I mean, you know, I guess right now on Twitch it's mutual following, but you aren't exactly saying, I'm friends with this person.

1417
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Like, I might follow somebody, but you could actually be friends with them now in this update that's going to be coming to Twitch, which means, excuse me, you'll be able to have 500 friends on a list, and it'll actually show you who is online, and you'll be able to whisper those friends with a click.

1418
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:31,000
So, I'm assuming that's one of the big differences, because I could just follow somebody to see, like, when they're going live, but I can't necessarily communicate to them privately unless they're actually my friend.

1419
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
So, that seems to be one of the big differences there.

1420
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:40,000
The friends beta starts on April 22nd, so it just started during PAX.

1421
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Selected community members, including anybody who was at that town hall that happened at PAX East, and I guess they allowed people to sign up at their booth as well.

1422
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Since I wasn't at PAX East, I'm not in this program, but that's okay, I'm not really a heavy Twitch user right now anyway.

1423
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I always say I'm going to get in on it, and then I end up starting another podcast instead.

1424
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,000
But anyway, Twitch director of programming, Marcus Graham, saying,

1425
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Friends is the latest social feature in Twitch's ongoing effort to help gamers connect with one another.

1426
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:16,000
While Twitch always has been a great platform for broadcasters to connect with viewers, now viewers will be able to connect with each other as well.

1427
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And Jason in our chat room, who I know is a big Twitch person, was the guy that got me to go to TwitchCon last year, says,

1428
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Follows is for live notifications, Friends is for conversation.

1429
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
That's a pretty good way to clarify it there, thank you.

1430
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So there you go, that's going to be coming to Twitch.

1431
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Maybe trying to take on Facebook messaging in a way, but with the gamer audience.

1432
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Because people, you know, they're logged into Twitch, they're right there, they've got their attention, very easy to send people messages.

1433
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
So, as long as they keep the spammers out, I'm good.

1434
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But I'm assuming the friending has to be mutual, so that'll help quite a bit.

1435
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Alright, let's move on, Loki.

1436
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Alright, so, I guess I'm not very surprised by this, but it's another Five Nights at Freddy's game being announced, or teased.

1437
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,000
There's a new series that's going to be starting at Sister Location.

1438
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:20,000
And that's just being teased on Scott Cawthorn's webpage there for Five Nights at Freddy's.

1439
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And, yeah.

1440
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:28,000
So I guess we'll see another Five Nights game coming, maybe with a different set of characters.

1441
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Yeah, maybe, because you know the whole Five Nights RPG was pretty bumpy, and he had some issues with that.

1442
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
And we kind of talked about that in a previous episode, I don't want to keep kicking dirt on it.

1443
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
But maybe he's like, alright, time to move on.

1444
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And the last Freddy game was supposed to be the last one anyway, the RPG thing was just kind of a side show, side project thing.

1445
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:56,000
So, you know, I'm not surprised at all, he'll probably want to tie it to Five Nights at Freddy's without it necessarily being a Five Nights at Freddy's game.

1446
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
It is a Five Nights at Freddy's game, though.

1447
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Hmm.

1448
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Because it says Sister Location, but very lightly above it says Five Nights at Freddy's.

1449
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Yeah, but if the last one was the last game, well, who knows.

1450
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Never say never.

1451
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Never say never.

1452
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It's like a horror movie spin-off thing.

1453
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I want to see the horror movie.

1454
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:24,000
They're supposed to be making a horror movie that's got life, practical effects and everything.

1455
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I want to totally see that.

1456
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I have no interest, I don't really play the games, but I think that'd be awesome.

1457
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Some folks in chat over at live.vognetware.com.

1458
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Akdev says, more Five Nights, but not at Freddy's.

1459
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Kaijuta says, Five Nights at Betty's.

1460
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
His sister.

1461
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I could see that, probably.

1462
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Five Nights at Betty's, why not?

1463
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Betty Boop becomes an evil killer in the middle of the night.

1464
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
She kind of looks evil, so.

1465
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Yeah, she stabs you in the throat and boop boop boop.

1466
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
It'll be based off the drawn together character.

1467
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Oh god, oh god.

1468
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
She was, she was a mess.

1469
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
What the hell would they call her on that show?

1470
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I love that show.

1471
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I don't, god, I don't even remember.

1472
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I don't remember that.

1473
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I know Xander was the role-playing and then the, um, the one that was the take on Josie and the pussycats.

1474
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
God, I can't remember any of their names.

1475
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Yeah.

1476
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
It was sad.

1477
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
For a show that was so funny.

1478
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
There was the princess, right?

1479
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1480
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Then there was the Adam Carolla guy that was really fucking annoying.

1481
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Right?

1482
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Was he the, was he the Pikachu guy at the time?

1483
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:38,000
No, the Pikachu one was like very, um, like was, like spoke Japanese or was supposed to be speaking Japanese.

1484
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I don't, I don't know who the Adam Carolla guy was.

1485
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Oh, he was the pig.

1486
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
There was a talking pig.

1487
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Oh, that's right, the pig.

1488
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Yeah.

1489
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Cause he actually was a pig.

1490
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I don't know who that was.

1491
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I don't know if that was supposed to be a riff on the, the Acres cartoons from Garfield.

1492
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I think it was supposed to be like, uh, Porky Pig maybe.

1493
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Oh, good lord.

1494
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Jason knows them all.

1495
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Woldor, Toot, the name of the character was Toot, uh, Ling Ling, Foxy, Xander, Clara, Spanky, and Captain Hero.

1496
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Thank you, Jason.

1497
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I can always count on you.

1498
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Yeah, Woldor was, wasn't that the SpongeBob character or something?

1499
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Yes, that's right.

1500
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
There was the creepy SpongeBob thing.

1501
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
All right.

1502
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I got it.

1503
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And VXJXV says, Spanky Ham is a parody of crass internet flash animation cartoons, according to the show's creator.

1504
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Dear God, if they ever bring up who wants, if they ever bring back who wants to be a millionaire and I'm on it, Jason's gonna be my phone-a-friend.

1505
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Jason would be the guy smart enough to have the Google search up and ready when I call him too.

1506
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
All right.

1507
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Uh, let's talk about esports.

1508
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Esports, it keeps growing.

1509
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:48,000
A report out this week saying that the esports industry is supposed to be making a cool $463 million in revenue in 2016.

1510
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
This is a report from PWC.

1511
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Uh, this is the financial services firm that was once known as PricewaterhouseCoopers.

1512
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
That is a 43% increase from 2015.

1513
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Um, according to the PWC report, uh, League of Legends is the most popular game by viewership.

1514
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:14,000
But 63% of viewers say that they're tuning in for first-person shooters, which is probably why you see Blizzard wanting to get in there with Overwatch and, you know, you see that grow.

1515
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Why Doom is suddenly coming back.

1516
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
You know, all this.

1517
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Um, the women that were surveyed in the poll were more likely to describe themselves as involved in esports than the guys.

1518
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Interesting.

1519
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Esports may be a less male-centric area than people tend to think.

1520
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Uh, major outlets, of course, getting into, uh, the streaming and the esports.

1521
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Uh, Yahoo has an esports division.

1522
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
There's gonna be that TBS Cable League.

1523
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Twitch, of course, trying to grow their own thing.

1524
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Uh, they are really trying to bring it up to a level where more traditional sports are at.

1525
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Uh, by the way, uh, NBA Commissioner David Stern has some words for people who, you know, do not agree with esports.

1526
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Of course it is a sport.

1527
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
It fills arenas and stadiums, has an OTT network built on it.

1528
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Twitch.

1529
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
And there is a robust market in team purchases that seems to be developing.

1530
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:20,000
So, um, you at least have one, uh, champion in there and, you know, the NBA Commissioner is, uh, nothing to, uh, you know, scoff at when it comes to, uh, who knows what they're talking about when it comes to sports.

1531
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
So.

1532
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Alright.

1533
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Um, let's move on.

1534
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Just, uh, I guess it's time for the mailbag, huh?

1535
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Shall we do the mailbag?

1536
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
We shall.

1537
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Let's do it.

1538
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Uh, every week you guys email us.

1539
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you send your emails.

1540
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And we pick our favorites and we read them live on air.

1541
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
And unfortunately I don't have the, uh, theme ready tonight.

1542
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Uh, I am multitasking too much without dark soccer right here.

1543
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I'm having to multitask too much so we'll have to do without the theme tonight as I, uh, dive into the mailbag here and read a couple of emails that we have.

1544
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Uh, again our email address.

1545
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.

1546
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Our first email tonight from Raginator.

1547
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
This was actually sent for last week's show.

1548
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Um, but that was obviously canceled at the last minute so hopefully Raginator doesn't mind that we're going to read it tonight.

1549
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Hi folks.

1550
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's your friendly neighborhood Raginator.

1551
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I just thought I'd write in just in case I'm unable to call in on Sunday for whatever reason or I forget what I want to talk about.

1552
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:22,000
A seeming important issue had just occurred to me and I'm kind of surprised no one else has thought about the following subject as well.

1553
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
It's the internet. Somebody probably has.

1554
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Um, as you three or four, if there's any guest presence this week, well, will you take two?

1555
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:38,000
As you two already know, Steam, a service that I've become a huge fan of thanks to Rob, primarily deals with selling miscellaneous software games in their related DLC.

1556
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Also, as Rob has mentioned several times in the past, if Valve should go out of business or choose to discontinue Steam, they have what amounts to a big old kill the DRM button.

1557
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Great. No issue there, right?

1558
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Kinda.

1559
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Well here's the thing.

1560
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Aside from software, games, and DLC, they do sell some movies, albeit with a limited selection, and they do have an even more limited quantity of freebies.

1561
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Now the thing is, and from what I've seen as well, aside from two movies, free to play and indie game the movie, you cannot download these movies.

1562
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
They're streaming only.

1563
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:17,000
The thing is, at least other services like iTunes and whatever Microsoft is calling their service nowadays give you the choice of either streaming or storing your videos locally.

1564
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Now, should Steam be discontinued for whatever reason, or if there's a massive outage akin to what happened in PSN back in Spring 2011, what will happen with the streaming only videos that people may have bought?

1565
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Valve never addressed this specifically.

1566
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:37,000
I know, I know, piracy's a concern, and I agree, but this seems more troublesome and restrictive than Sony's video DRM for PSN videos.

1567
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:41,000
And I'm sure you all remember my rants regarding that whole diarrhea fest.

1568
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Wow.

1569
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
But yes, I do remember the angrieness of the PlayStation stuff.

1570
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
What are your takes on this?

1571
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:52,000
This email was brought to you by my Steam account, home of 904 games and counting.

1572
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And it even included a couple Humble Bundle codes there at the end for us.

1573
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
So thank you.

1574
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I will, I need to see what these are.

1575
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I have no idea what they are, so I need to see if there are things in my library or not.

1576
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Maybe I'll take one and give one to Loki or something, or give mine to Dark Soccer.

1577
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't know.

1578
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
We'll figure it out.

1579
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:21,000
As far as the question and the movies, you know, I really think that we're at a point where it's so far out that Steam would ever need to use the kill switch.

1580
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:29,000
That I think the movies will be so dated by that point that I think most people probably aren't going to care, is the reality.

1581
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:45,000
For the people that do care, they will probably do, if I were to guess, they would probably do some type of redemption thing where you could go in, buy request, and get a code to get the movie on another site that's still up.

1582
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:52,000
A code to get it on Amazon, a code to get it on YouTube, or something to like convert your ownership to another site.

1583
02:06:52,000 --> 02:07:00,000
But I imagine they won't automatically give it to you. It'll be something that will be open for a 90 day window or something like that, and then it's done.

1584
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,000
That's my thought on how they do it.

1585
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Loki, what do you think Steam would do with the movie situation if they ever shut their doors?

1586
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I don't know, maybe change those from streaming to where you can download them?

1587
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Yeah, maybe it'll be a thing where you can download it for up to 90 days and then it's done.

1588
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Or maybe as part of the Switch thing they'll change it.

1589
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Or maybe something you should be prepared for.

1590
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Maybe Steam would be ready to take the negative press and say, you know, we never said anything about the movies, unfortunately the movies will no longer be there.

1591
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Because it is so limited, they could probably cut their losses.

1592
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Like with how many people will be pissed off that they lost Indie Game the movie, they can probably cut their losses.

1593
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Because can't you get Indie Game streaming free other places at this point? Or am I crazy?

1594
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Well Netflix isn't exactly free, but isn't Indie Game the movie at other places that you can get at this point?

1595
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I think they have it on Humble Bundle.

1596
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Yeah, I sort of think they would allow you to convert it for a limited time, but not forever.

1597
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I really think if Steam is going to do the right thing in that situation, that would be the way out of it.

1598
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Bobby Blackwolf saying, I saw it on Netflix.

1599
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Of course Netflix stuff tends to come and go lately, unless it's a Netflix original. It kind of tends to come and go.

1600
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
RageNator pointing out in chat as well that Indie Game the movie and free to play are on good old games.

1601
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:29,000
And SHG100Matt saying, most of these are free or will eventually be free.

1602
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I really have a feeling that by the time Steam inevitably pushes the kill switch, it'll just be on YouTube.

1603
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
For everybody.

1604
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:43,000
But Kaijuto saying, the kill switch is never too far away. There's no such thing as too big to fail.

1605
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:50,000
So maybe I shouldn't write it off so easily that the kill switch is still decades away. We'll see.

1606
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
We do have another email this week from YYR.

1607
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Hello LR. This is essentially a love letter about Drinkbox Studios. And who is that?

1608
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I had no idea until a few short months ago.

1609
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Over the past few years, Drinkbox has done work for hire on a number of titles for Activision, Vicarious Visions, EA and several others.

1610
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
But they've also released a few of their own games.

1611
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Guacamelee had been sitting on my Xbox One's hard drive for almost a year, acquired via games with gold.

1612
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:24,000
That reminds me. I need to fucking get my copy of Sunset Overdrive on games with gold. I need to do that after the show.

1613
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Thank you for the reminder. Anyway.

1614
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Where was I? Ah yes. I finally decided to click on it. Guacamelee.

1615
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
After finding out that it was a Metroidvania style game that I could play co-op with Amy.

1616
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
As it turns out, Guacamelee was way more than just that.

1617
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,000
It's one of the most well designed, perfectly executed games I've touched in my 30 plus years of gaming.

1618
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
It has as little or as much exploration as you want, depending on your preferred playing style.

1619
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:55,000
The combat system is a fun test of your skills and the enemy encounters are constantly switching things up so the combat doesn't get old.

1620
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,000
The platforming is just right, blending interesting layouts with perfect controls.

1621
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Bonuses and hidden items are dangled behind tricky and satisfying challenges.

1622
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
You discover a smorgasbord of abilities throughout the game, and zero of them are useless.

1623
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
The level design is clever and thoughtful enough that it requires the use of each and every one.

1624
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And as the icing on the cake, the graphics are pleasing, the audio is fantastic, and the jokes in the script are actually funny.

1625
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre, and if you also enjoy fighting games, it was pretty much made just for you.

1626
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
After playing through Guacamelee three full times, I decided to look at a Drinkbox's back catalog.

1627
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
They've also released a couple more conventional platformers.

1628
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Tales from Space, about a blob, which is a two player co-op platformer for PlayStation 3.

1629
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:45,000
And Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack, a one player platformer originally released for the Vita, but now available on several platforms.

1630
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I've started both, they feature simpler gameplay, but also ooze charm and feel pretty polished, especially the sequel.

1631
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:57,000
The action and presentation are at the same high level as Guacamelee's, and I'm looking forward to spending more time with them.

1632
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm bringing all this up now because this Tuesday, April 26th, Drinkbox is releasing their newest game.

1633
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:11,000
It's called Severed, and it follows the quest of a distraught one armed warrior wielding a living sword searching for her family in a world of nightmares.

1634
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:16,000
It is entirely touch controlled, and is being released exclusively on PlayStation Vita.

1635
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:24,000
This is the first time I've ever trusted a developer so much that I'm willing to buy their new game on day one without even a bit of gameplay footage.

1636
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And if you have a Vita, I'd encourage you to do that right along with me.

1637
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:35,000
That is quite the love letter there. Enjoy, Aaron Yyr.

1638
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Thank you very much for that email. I have no problem with love letters to smaller studios especially.

1639
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Guacamelee is a fantastic game. It's a fun Metroidvania style game. It kind of has the fighting style instead of the shooting style, but I love the in-jokes.

1640
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,000
There's so many memes that are referenced in the game. It's a very internet culture aware type of game.

1641
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,000
There's a lot of great Metroidvanias out there on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1642
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Xbox One, I believe you had told me about this too, although I know several other people had.

1643
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Ori and the Blind Forest, another excellent Metroidvania game on Xbox One at least, and PC that's worth your time if you haven't checked that out.

1644
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:24,000
So I know we joke that, like, boy, Metroidvania games, they're everywhere these days, but a lot of them are really, really good and worth your time.

1645
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,000
And, you know, don't write off the genre just because a lot of people are doing it.

1646
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Anyway, that's it for the emails this week. Again, you can send us emails.

1647
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com. But in the meantime, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.

1648
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,000
We get a little angsty here at Orange Lounge Radio sometimes, so we're going to blow off some steam right now.

1649
02:12:45,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I have to be tired just because I've been trying to work on my game, which, actually, the thing that's kind of preventing me from working on the game, besides being tired, is I don't know, I still have kind of undecided how I want to look.

1650
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:28,000
And because of that, I don't know where to begin. So I'm still deciding that. But I am incredibly tired, and, like, sometimes I'll actually sit down and start, you know, working on it, and I will literally pass out from being tired.

1651
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I will just fall asleep sitting down with my laptop. So it's just because I'm on a new work schedule starting this week.

1652
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:46,000
So I'm starting at seven in the morning instead of eight, which one hour makes a difference, especially when your kids wake you up seven times during the night. So, yeah.

1653
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I guess, just, you know, obviously, FU to a lot of the things that were putting me in a mood this week. I'm sure you all can figure it out.

1654
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:07,000
But, yeah, I just, you know, I have to snap out of it and move on, and I think I am for the most part, but it's just, I don't know, it hasn't been the best week.

1655
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
So just looking forward to moving on and on to bigger and better things.

1656
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Alright, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki, one more story.

1657
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Yes, so Tatsuya Manami has stepped down as president of Platinum Games, and they haven't really said exactly what the reasoning was for that, but, you know, he's worked on quite a bit of projects, you know, through them, especially more recently.

1658
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Star Fox Zero, Star Fox Guard, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, which actually I'm very kind of looking forward to, because I do need to play that.

1659
02:14:53,000 --> 02:15:04,000
And then, of course, you know, they worked on, you know, some major games like Bayonetta, Mad World, and Vanquish. I love Mad World, to be honest, and I really hope we get a new game from that.

1660
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I really like the art style in that game. Plus, they had Chainsaw, and that was awesome.

1661
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Yeah, unfortunately, you know, a lot of people get very excited about Platinum Games, but it really does seem like some of their games kind of, like, hit-miss, hit-miss, so I guess they're looking for leadership that will hopefully ensure more hits-hits-hits than anything else.

1662
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:36,000
You know, I could see them in a really awesome, like, Mega Man style game, because I know, like, Vanquish was really, their games are very fast-paced, and I think that would lend itself well to, like, a platforming action game.

1663
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:45,000
You know, some tinfoil hatters think this is because of Star Fox's low reviews, because, you know, Star Fox has not been getting great reviews out there.

1664
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:52,000
It just didn't look that interesting to begin with. I don't know, I'm kind of disappointed, but, yeah, I guess.

1665
02:15:52,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I know, I feel like the reception I'm reading on Twitter, which I tend to believe a little more than the critics, the reception on Twitter is a little warmer than I see the critics giving it, but I also have some serious Nintendo fanboys on my Twitter that will defend everything.

1666
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
And so I have to take some of that with a grain of salt, too. You know what I mean?

1667
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I think it just, I don't know, it just maybe was a letdown, it's a little bit, I hear it's a short game.

1668
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Yeah. That part kind of bothers me, too. But, at the same time, it's not that short games are necessarily bad, because there are some very short games that I've still defended that are worth your money.

1669
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Look at Platinum's style of games, though. It's, like, action-packed and fast. That's kind of what I see there. Games are, like, you know, fast-paced.

1670
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Star Fox, it's kind of slow, you know, it's, I don't know, it's a slow, like, shooter game.

1671
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Like, can you imagine, though, if they really amp that up? Like, you're just darting through super fast, you know, blowing up shit and just, like, dodging through everything.

1672
02:16:52,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I mean, that'd be really cool and action-packed. This, I just don't see, I don't know. I haven't played it, so I don't know what I'm really talking about, but it just doesn't look that interesting.

1673
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Like, a new Star Fox game, I would think, like, man, I need to pick that up. But I'm just not excited about it at all.

1674
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:16,000
You know, I, and maybe this is just me, and I know we're about to open up the phone line here after one more story. Maybe it's just me, and I even see people saying they want to talk about Star Fox Zero.

1675
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:26,000
But kind of a question I'm posing out there, is it possible that the Nintendo NX news and everything that's out there about the NX is kind of starting to kill your passion for Wii U a little bit?

1676
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Where it's kind of like, bring on, just bring it on, bring on the next console, bring on what's next, because this feels like these are just all fill-in-the-gap types of things until the next console.

1677
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:51,000
But, there's Zelda. That is worth mentioning. Yet, there is still this Zelda game that is hopefully going to be this tremendous swan song for the Wii U, yet a lot of people seem to think it's just going to end up being on both the Wii U and the NX at this point.

1678
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Yeah, I probably would see that. I don't know how a game of that scale could be on the Wii U, to be honest.

1679
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Let's see, going to some comments from chat from some people who have played Star Fox Zero. Wyland says, the controls aren't the great Satan that cry baby different, bad critics are making it out to be.

1680
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, Anarchy Reigns was interesting, but I wouldn't have bought it at full price.

1681
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Oh god, that game is terrible.

1682
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Dark Tetsuya says, the new controls take some adjusting, but once you get it dialed in, it's fun. TigerClaws noting, the reception of the game is more positive, most of the reviews just blame the controls.

1683
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Yeah, I did play Anarchy Reigns, did not like that game. That was probably the only Platinum game that was kind of a letdown.

1684
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Did Platinum do Wonderful 101 on Wii U?

1685
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
No.

1686
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
No, they did not. Just curious.

1687
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Alright, let's get into one more story here about a game that could have been. A game that was, oh no, chat is yelling yes, Platinum did.

1688
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
They did?

1689
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
They didn't do Wonderful 101. I thought they did.

1690
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I thought Wonderful 101 was not the game that people hyped it up to be. I was not as into it as other people were.

1691
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Which is fine, we're going to have video games, a serious business, we're going to have differing opinions sometimes, but that to me was not as fabulous as people made it out to be.

1692
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:31,000
However, Bayonetta 2 is not praised enough. Like, I have a really bad feeling that game has not been played by as many people that need to experience it because that game is tits, everybody needs to play it, it's so good.

1693
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Anyhow, let's talk about another game that could have been, but it didn't. And that was a Guitar Hero MMO.

1694
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:50,000
That's right, it was something that Activision was working on, but was apparently cancelled as all the hero games were stopped in 2011.

1695
02:19:51,000 --> 02:20:03,000
This was being brought to us by Unseen64, this is a website that likes to do these exposes on things hidden in games that weren't supposed to be there and dead games that never came to light.

1696
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:14,000
They ran a little story on this whole thing. Hero World was going to be a platform that would have been accessible by web browsers that would tie together all of Activision's hero games.

1697
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:24,000
It was conceived by Freestyle Games, who did DJ Hero, which makes me go, oh, then it was probably good. Because Freestyle Games always did the good ones in the series.

1698
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:33,000
But the work on the project was actually done by Virtual Fairgrounds in Amsterdam, who had done some free-to-play MMOs before, like Club Galactic.

1699
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:46,000
It was supposedly capable of rendering appealing visuals even on lower spec machines. The game would have automatically purchased extra servers during peak times and shut them off when not in use. Very interesting.

1700
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:57,000
In Hero World, you can import characters from Guitar Hero and DJ Hero, or make new ones, and go on a journey to musical stardom. There would have been battle in turn-based dance-offs.

1701
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:05,000
There was a complimentary Facebook app that was also in the works. You would build a venue in Hero World, hire console gamers to play shows there.

1702
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Hero World was supposed to be fully cross-platform on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii. The pitches to Activision went well. Hero World was planned for release, but then Hero got yanked. All of it.

1703
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Activision put the franchise on hiatus. Bummer. Unfortunately, it is mentioned that Freestyle also developed Guitar Hero Live, but they're saying that Activision is not totally pleased with the results. The game has failed to meet expectations.

1704
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Which is kind of a bummer, because Guitar Hero Live, I think, was the better music game that came out last Christmas. Bummer.

1705
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Anyway, Darktosuya in chat says, I guess they did have DJ Hero 3 in the works at one point.

1706
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Yeah, so disappointing.

1707
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Lame. Alright, anyhow, it's time to open up the Skype line. Let's get to it. 1877 GameOLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word. I got a feel for Freestyle games. I really hope they aren't closed or anything like that. I would be really devastated if that happened, to be honest.

1708
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Alright, our phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. Get to our first call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1709
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

1710
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Hey, Akdeft, buddy. How you doing?

1711
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Pretty great. Pretty great. Just a small tangent. Well, you said I participated in a tournament, a poking tournament. I got second again.

1712
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Hey, you know what? Second is still pretty good. That's nothing to scoff at. That's a very, very good placement. I would be very happy if OLR was the second podcast everybody listened to in a week.

1713
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:01,000
That's true. But anyways, I want to talk about that. I want to talk about Star Fox Zero.

1714
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Please. Did you pick it up?

1715
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Yeah, I picked it up. I got it from Amazon. Pretty cheap, too. My verdict on it is the complaints everyone has about it are pretty much legit.

1716
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:30,000
The complaints like the controls, the length of the game, and some other stuff. Yeah, I see it.

1717
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:36,000
As for the controls, I played it a little bit yesterday with some friends. We were doing co-op.

1718
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:47,000
And yeah, the motion controls are really awkward, though you can get accustomed to pretty quickly if you know what you're doing.

1719
02:23:47,000 --> 02:24:00,000
So it's not necessarily bad controls, but they have a really, really steep learning curve. So yeah, you have to get used to them before you can truly master the game.

1720
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:15,000
As for the length, we beat the game last night. We started playing around 10pm and we finished, I want to say, a little bit after 2am.

1721
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:32,000
So yeah, it's kind of a short game, but at the same time, I don't remember a Star Fox game being lengthy or being more than 5 hours long if you know what you're doing.

1722
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:56,000
So this one being a little bit resembling Star Fox, the original from Super Nintendo, and also Star Fox 64. I don't see why it's that bad because at least you have some replayability with challenges, arcade mode, and it has tons of collectibles, too.

1723
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Now, the original Star Fox game, you could kind of go down different paths, too. So is it one of those things where you can play different configurations?

1724
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Not really. You have the map, and it's like the one in Star Fox 64, though it has some changes. But pretty much you go on a straight line.

1725
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:34,000
It has some alternate routes, I will say. There's an asteroid field we didn't play, and there was another planet we couldn't access to either because you have to do certain stuff we couldn't do.

1726
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:49,000
So at least you have those alternate routes, too. Though mostly you go on a straight line, and you can pretty much replay any stage immediately, too.

1727
02:25:49,000 --> 02:26:08,000
So it's not like you have to finish the game and play it again, so you can just pretty much go to any stage and play it whenever you want. Which I find it good, but some people may find that, uh, no, no, bad.

1728
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Well, do you think it's worth 60 bucks for me to get, or eh?

1729
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:34,000
There's also Star Fox Guard. We just played like one game or two of that, and that game is also pretty fun. It's pretty much like Five Nights at Freddy's, but without the scariest parts.

1730
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Oh, well that's good, because the scary parts are, uh, yeah. You know how I feel about that.

1731
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Although you can get, frankly, because of so many robots that invade your map. But again, that's also a game that's being included with Star Fox Zero, at least on the physical side.

1732
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:15,000
If you want to only get Star Fox Zero, the digital version I think costs less. I'm not sure, because I know there's a discount you get for Star Fox Guard if you buy Star Fox Zero digitally.

1733
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:35,000
But, is it worth the 60 dollars for both games? Yes, it is. I'm pretty sure it is, and it's probably not really that innovative, per se.

1734
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:50,000
But the game is fun. We had lots of fun yesterday, last night, with my friends. For us to play a game non-stop like that, it has to be good.

1735
02:27:51,000 --> 02:28:01,000
So, at least there's that. I don't know if there's a demo, I think not, but I would say at least try it.

1736
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Yeah, you never know. In a couple months, they might do the whole thing where, like, with platinum points, you can get a 15 or 20% discount too, because that seems to be the thing they're doing now. So, who knows? Anything's possible, right?

1737
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Yeah, hopefully.

1738
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to get some more calls. But, congratulations on your tournament placement again, and thank you for letting us know your thoughts on Star Fox.

1739
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

1740
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,000
You're welcome. Anytime. Take care, my friend.

1741
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Alright, we got, boy, it's lighting up tonight. Let's get to our, excuse me, our next call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1742
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Ledger Zaku here.

1743
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Hey, my friend, how are you?

1744
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Just coming back from PAX East.

1745
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Hey, how was PAX East since you went?

1746
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Compared to previous years, I mean, it's kind of like half and half, just because of, like, obviously, the big thing that isn't PAX related is the security beefed up in the con this year. Like, literally, people have to go through metal detectors or metal wands.

1747
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Really?

1748
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Yeah, they were doing a lot of thorough backsurges.

1749
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Interesting.

1750
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Did you have to bend over and cough to get into PAX East?

1751
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:17,000
No, but I did have to, like, literally, you know, they didn't pat you down, but they did, you know, they either, you either went through a metal detector or you had the wand.

1752
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Huh.

1753
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
They wanted you.

1754
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I want to say I've seen the wand done somewhere else, though. I want to say BlizzCon had it. E3, I feel like, had it at one point. I don't know, but, but I wonder, I wonder if somebody made a threat. Again, maybe they had to step up security. Who knows?

1755
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Or it could be that the Boston Marathon, I believe, is tomorrow.

1756
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Ah, could be. You know, and I, I don't know, maybe I don't want to go there, so to speak, but there's been a lot of toxic bullshit in gaming culture in the past year, and maybe they felt that necessitated the extra security. I don't know, I'm just, I'm speculating, that's all. Anyway.

1757
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Remember, this, Anime Boston had this a few, you know, a few weeks prior to PAX East, so because, because the state of Massachusetts controls the convention centers, it's under their, it's their call, essentially.

1758
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Yeah. Alright, well, outside the security, I mean, once you got in there, how was it?

1759
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Ah, it was, it was still pretty good. I mean, they're not, well, in terms of panels, I mean, I only went to, like, a few ones that I'm trying to remember, more or less, the ones I went to, but they, I only went to, like, maybe three or, yeah, maybe four panels throughout the entire, you know, throughout the entire weekend.

1760
02:30:35,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Like, it was that, it was to the point where, you know, maybe there were some good ones, but all the others were, like, I mean, the only good one that I did, that did go to was the Harmonix one, and the, and the speed run, the speed run one on Friday, where they were doing, like, the, you know, the, you know, the organization that does speed runs for charity, awesome games done quick, they were, they were there.

1761
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:22,000
And they were basically teaching folks how to do, like, glitches for, you know, how to find glitches in games in order to do speed runs. But other than that, I guess the biggest draw for me was waiting in line to try the HTC Vive, which they had in the free play area. So, virtual reality was a big thing this year.

1762
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Did you get to try the Vive? Did you end up getting to do it?

1763
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Yes. It was, it was worth two and a half hours waiting in line, but I managed to do it. It was a lot more immersive than the first two Oculus riffs that I tried, you know, previously.

1764
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:59,000
And it, it does feel like a lot. It does feel clear, and it does feel that immersive. Like, you're pretty much in there, and there's no nausea whatsoever, because it's, like, it's consistent. The performance is consistent, even for, like, something that isn't Oculus, that's, you know, that Valve was able to build with, with HTC's help, obviously.

1765
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:15,000
But even then, it's like, I guess it's like, I guess both have their strengths, and I guess you still need a beefy computer anyways, just to, you know, just to jump on the VR bandwagon, which reminds me, I probably have to do upgrades very soon.

1766
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:35,000
After parties were, were, were somewhat alright. I mean, the only good, you know, the only good ones that I went to were the, the Asus one that they had in the, in a museum not far from the, from the con. And they were just giving out light-up cups, and people were trying to take on, like, professional gamers in Counter-Strike.

1767
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Hmm. Did they, did you get your hands on any other games besides the VR? Like, any indie games or anything?

1768
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
It was a lot of lines.

1769
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Of course, it's PAX!

1770
02:32:47,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Exactly, that's why it's so difficult, like, I barely bother with that at all, unless it's something I can grab my hands on that no one else has, it's almost, it's not even worth the effort, I mean, that's, I mean, the only thing I did play was, you know, classic, classic arcade area, obviously, can't leave, can't go without that.

1771
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:16,000
But it's, as I said, because it's PAX East, it's almost, you know, it's really hard to get your, you know, having to wait to play things.

1772
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Yeah.

1773
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:32,000
It's like, yeah, it's, it's not as convenient, like, you know, in prior years, and even then, the swag isn't as, you know, it's, it's not the same, like, as I remember it years ago when I came back with, like, full bags of swag.

1774
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
And now you can stay home and watch it on Twitch.

1775
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:41,000
It's even, yeah, it's even worse, like, like, you heard about what, you heard about what Twitch gave out at their booth, right?

1776
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Yeah, the beta stuff, right?

1777
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Um, BO stuff.

1778
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Oh, yeah, I heard about the whole deodorant giveaway thing, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did read about that.

1779
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I'm gonna snag, like, a couple of, I'm gonna snag a stick and some body wash.

1780
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Yes!

1781
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
That's tongue-in-cheek, I like that.

1782
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I know, it's, it's, like, awesome, but yeah.

1783
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I think the whole hygiene thing has become such a joke, though, that most people are aware of it.

1784
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I mean, there's always gonna be a couple of individuals who did not seem to get the memo, but for the most part, like, I feel like a lot of people have gotten the hint.

1785
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Oh, yeah, I mean, obviously, the idea is to basically, you know, it's something that's known, but not really, you know, I wouldn't say taboo, but it's something that, you know, at this point, it should be common sense.

1786
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Yeah, I know.

1787
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:32,000
It's common sense to bathe, and yet they're just rubbing it, you know, they're being savages by doing that.

1788
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
But it's a con, and when you're drinking 24-7, sometimes common sense goes out the window, what can you say?

1789
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Yeah, but even then, I, even I, even in my hotel, I was able to shower and, you know, adhere to hygiene.

1790
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Unlike certain other individuals, you know, who are out there with neckbeards and, you know, beast bodies.

1791
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Alright, alright.

1792
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
But yes.

1793
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Zaku, I'm going to let you go, because we're going to wrap up the show here pretty soon.

1794
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I do have one more thing. I manage to snag about 10 Rock Band 4 DLC vouchers.

1795
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Oh, nice.

1796
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:11,000
For both platforms. If you want some codes, let me know, and I'll start doling them out.

1797
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Send me an Xbox One code, and then see if some of our live chatters maybe want the codes.

1798
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Alright.

1799
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Awesome. Sweet, thanks, Zaku.

1800
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Yep.

1801
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
See, I didn't even have to go to PAX, and I'm getting free shit from PAX.

1802
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
You're the man.

1803
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Alright. Take care, my friend.

1804
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Have a good one.

1805
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You too, bye.

1806
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Heck yeah! Free stuff from PAX. They didn't even go.

1807
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Alright, one more call. Hi, you're on Ornishong's radio. What is this?

1808
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
It's the one and only Ranma.

1809
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Hey buddy, how you doing?

1810
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
My shoulder hurts. I'm just sitting here relaxing with a tall blue moon.

1811
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Ah, nice. I would be enjoying a glass of wine right now, but sometimes I have to go get Alan at work late. It just kind of depends on how things are going, so I try not to drink during the show if I know there's a chance.

1812
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
One sip won't hurt.

1813
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Yeah, but I'm not going to crack open the bottle just to have a sip, because Loki's not really a wine drinker.

1814
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Shane ain't here. Shane would drink the wine in a heartbeat. Jamie would have a little bit if she's here. I'm just going to have to save it for a couple weeks from now.

1815
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Let me tell you something. If Mako-chan lived on the west coast and was your next door neighbor, as soon as you pulled the cork, you two would be sipping winos right next to each other. You'd have someone to help you finish the bottle.

1816
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:30,000
If Mako-chan fucking lived next door to me, it would be a goddamn sitcom non-stop here at this house and you know it.

1817
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Yeah!

1818
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:41,000
It would be kind of similar to the Golden Girls or something. Or another one of those shows where the neighbor just shows up every episode. Like Married with Children.

1819
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I say Golden Girls meets Three's Company.

1820
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
What are you saying? Are you saying I'm Jack?

1821
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
I do not allude to anything, okay?

1822
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Are you saying that I'm faking the gay thing to get chicks?

1823
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,000
But if people assume you're Jack, I tell you what Rob, you are one hell of a fabulous Jack.

1824
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Well thank you very much. John Ritter was an amazing person so I would take that as a compliment.

1825
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about sitcom dreams, but what's on your mind?

1826
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Actually, I just came back from a two day convention locally out here in Jersey and I actually filmed the game room. I don't know if you saw the video, but you would have shed a tear. You would have been so proud of it.

1827
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I didn't see the video yet because I saw it come through while I was setting up for the show, but I did see you tagged me in something and I kind of laughed because I was like, oh well Boston's got PAX East going on right now and you know Jersey's got a game room.

1828
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Yeah, but if you think about it, a lot of anime conventions nowadays don't have as many b-money or dancing music arcade machines.

1829
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Which is a shame.

1830
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Yeah, it's true. Anime conventions, I was like, you didn't go to Magfest because I went to Arcade Infinity back in the day and I had never seen as many music games in one place as I saw at fucking Magfest.

1831
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,000
See, Magfest is his own little world because you know there's going to be those types of games everywhere.

1832
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Yeah, Magfest is just another category. But anyway, yes. Anime conventions, sometimes they have the b-money stuff. Like Faname does a pretty good job from what I remember out here on the West Coast.

1833
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:38,000
But yeah, in the middle of Jersey, all the b-money, probably not something you see every day. But that's still pretty cool.

1834
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Yeah, it was a place called Tokyo at Games Attack, I believe. They're the ones that brought the machines in. I walked in, I was just like, my god.

1835
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Almost positive that's the company that does it for a lot of the cons out there.

1836
02:38:52,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Probably so. I mean, let's see, if I remember correctly, there was a DDR machine, it was JuBeat, two Taika no Tatsujin machines.

1837
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:08,000
It's UBeat. We don't want to beat up friends in our Jewish community. It's UBeat.

1838
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,000
You know where I live?

1839
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Not JuBeat.

1840
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:23,000
God, I'm terrible tonight. There was a, I don't know, I can't call it Dance Masters, but it was like a dancing game that Konami put out.

1841
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:29,000
It started, the main title is Dance, but I forget.

1842
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Dance Maniacs? Dance Evolution?

1843
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:42,000
No. It was a newer dancing game, and it was sort of like playing Just Dance or Dance Central.

1844
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
I swear it's Dance Evolution.

1845
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
No, it's uh, yeah.

1846
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:48,000
It's Dance Masters on the Kinect.

1847
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Anyway.

1848
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:58,000
It might have been Evolution, but let's see, there was a pop music machine. Oddly enough, two Street Fighter V machines.

1849
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,000
There was a table flipping game, and there was a long line for that.

1850
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:11,000
That has become quite the thing at anime conventions now, that fucking table flipping game, which, don't get me wrong, it's fun, but...

1851
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:19,000
And there was this title arcade machine. I couldn't figure it out, but it looked like it was sort of like an electronic crane game.

1852
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:24,000
It was like three people, and you don't have time to hit the button for the crane to come down or something like that.

1853
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Interesting.

1854
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Well, so you had a good time at the convention. We'll hear more about it on an anime jam session this week.

1855
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Oh, yeah, definitely. I had a blast. It's like I said on Twitter, once a year, I get up at 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, grab my gear, and trek all the way up to Jersey for this convention, and spend 12 to 13 hours out there having a blast.

1856
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
That's awesome.

1857
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I'm thinking about New York again. There was a big Ingress thing that's supposed to happen in Brooklyn over Memorial Day weekend. I was really thinking about it, but it's just a little too soon financially for me to do it, but I do want to see if there's going to be a con out there or something I might want to time it with.

1858
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
But I'm trying to decide between that or Disney World.

1859
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Well, I might be able to get you to come out here. I mean, you do like Vegas, right?

1860
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Fuck yeah, I like Vegas.

1861
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Well, our local anime convention, Anime Next, is moved to Atlantic City.

1862
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Okay. Never been there. Never been there.

1863
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:41,000
So you could go to the con and have a good time, and since a lot of the youngins are not allowed to go because their parents will let them go to the conventions in Atlantic City, there's nightlife and there are tons of casinos.

1864
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Alright, I'll look into it, but Disney World is also kind of winning right now, but we'll see. We'll see.

1865
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Hey, that con will always be there. I mean, Disney World, Disney World is straight up Disney. I mean, come on now.

1866
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Yeah, but you know, life is short. I gotta go, so.

1867
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Play hard.

1868
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Alright. Take care, my friend. I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.

1869
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,000
You too, bro. Take care, man.

1870
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Alright. Bye bye. Always good to hear from Rama and all you guys that were calling in tonight. I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through. Our phone was lighting up solid all night.

1871
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:20,000
But if you do want to send us an email, that'd be fantastic. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or you could also tweet us. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Yeah, would love feedback in all sorts of ways.

1872
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:27,000
We'll try to get some more of you on the show next week. And yes, we will be back next week. I'm done taking shows off.

1873
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Pray there's no horrible crisis. Loki, you can't get sick, because if you and Jamie are sick, I swear to God, I'm doing a solo Orange Lounge radio.

1874
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:48,000
The Robbie Black Wolf show. And it won't be pretty. I'm not as talented as he is, flying solo. Alright, anyway.

1875
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,000
So that's it. I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to get out there?

1876
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Yeah, I was gonna say they announced Borderlands 3's developments can be starting here pretty soon. Also, as part of some special DLC, they're gonna have some of the Battleborn characters available for Rock Band 4.

1877
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:14,000
So be able to get those characters in there if you're playing Rock Band 4. That's it.

1878
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Alright. Well, that is gonna do it for this episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys again. I really can't thank you enough for being loyal to the show, sticking with the show through thick and thin.

1879
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:42,000
It means so much that you guys are here, whether it be live or in the podcast form. I really don't feel like I ever say thank you enough. Thank you so much for listening to the show and participating with us week in and week out.

1880
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:52,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show. Especially now that we're on the Google Play thing, it's even easier to get people, show them where it is.

1881
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Because whether they have an Android or an iPhone, you search for Orange Lounge Radio in one of the built-in stores and you'll find it. So all we ask, we don't ask for money, just spread the word. Help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show.

1882
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:13,000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices here at the table. So invite your friends to come on over and sit with us on a Sunday night or at least at some point during the week on the podcast feed. Appreciate it.

1883
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:23,000
A nice five-star review wherever you found this show would go a very long way in helping us out as well and sticking out amongst the pack of thousands and thousands of video game podcasts that are out there.

1884
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Loki, we'll start you. Your final thought.

1885
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I'm really going to try to work on my game this week. Hopefully I can catch up on sleep. I've been trying. I haven't been staying up that late.

1886
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Alright, good luck. I would love to see you make progress on that. That'd be awesome.

1887
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I would love to see my game make progress as well.

1888
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Alright, and my final thought for this week is I beat Miitomo this week. I didn't talk about it my gaming week, but I beat Miitomo.

1889
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
I just saw that tweet.

1890
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I hit level 20 in both the personality or what do they call it? Social or whatever circle and I hit 20 in style. And so I got the super sparkle crown.

1891
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:09,000
But yet I still feel the need to check it every day. Why? Because I read more interesting things on Miitomo than I do on Facebook. Sorry not sorry.

1892
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:19,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for being with us. We'll be back in seven days to talk about what happens next week in games with all of you guys.

1893
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,000
So come on back in seven days. We'll do it all again. Until then, have fun and play nice.
