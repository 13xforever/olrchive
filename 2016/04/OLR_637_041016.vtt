Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's the hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week we're showing our roots with this headline. The next version of DDR DDR Ace is coming to America this spring and summer to about half of all Dave and Buster's locations. There's plenty more video game news in store and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:43.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 637 for this April the 10th of 2016.

00:44.000 --> 00:56.000
Welcome back. We were off last week but we're back here this week to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Assembled here in lovely Sacramento, California in our studio N7 with myself, Rob Roberts.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
But you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And by my side, my lovely co-host over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hi.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hi, how are you Jamie Summers?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm well, how are you?

01:07.000 --> 01:18.000
Good. I'm tired. I was like really, really, really tired because I've had a very busy weekend but I took a 20 minute nap before the show and I swear a 20 minute nap makes all the difference. I feel a lot better.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I went to bed at 3 and woke up at 2.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
3 in the morning?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh my gosh.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Because I had the smart idea to make coffee to make up for the awful horrid coffee at Dad's Kitchen.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Uh-huh.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
By the way, the food at Dad's Kitchen in Folsom, amazing. Their coffee, crap.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Just saying.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Just a tip for you locals.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
So I made coffee.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
We probably did get more local listeners thanks to yesterday so it's relevant.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Dan and I, we did stay up a little bit late just, you know, hanging out.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Doing stuff.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Cool.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Playing with Kat.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Alright.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
And I'm still trying to get him on Miitomo.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I thought he was on Miitomo. I thought everybody was on Miitomo. We'll talk about that in a little bit.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
He's resistant.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
We'll talk about that in a little bit. But first, of course, I always have to introduce him as well here in studio by our side, our other co-host, Techmaster Loki.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Yes, he's one of the resistant ones.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Are you not on Miitomo? I thought you were. I thought I added you.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
There's a me out there. Okay, here's the thing. Here's the crazy thing about Miitomo.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
I get, like, this is going to sound so, like, cocky. I hate it. I'm sorry.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
But I have so many friend requests in Miitomo that, you know, I'm just approving.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Like, if we're linked on Facebook or Twitter, I'm like, whatever, approve, approve, approve.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And one came through and I thought it was Twitter and it said, Matt, and I swear the icon looked just like you.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And I was like, oh, it's Loki.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
And, like, it even tells you who it is once you go in it, but I didn't even look because I'm going through it so fast.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I thought you were, oh, I thought you were on it.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
No.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh, well, shoot. Why the hatin'? Why the resisting?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's not why the hatin', just not interested in doing it.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah?

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
I have a feeling it's going to be one of those things that I'm going to get a million goddamn updates on.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
And I'm like, no, I am not doing that shit.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, I had to turn it off on my phone because that first day, especially, I mean, the friend request thing has really died down.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
But the first day, especially, like, I had the alerts on and I'm not even joking.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
Like, every five minutes since I downloaded the app, like, it kept going off.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
So, finally, I was able to figure out how to turn off all the little switches and now it doesn't annoy me.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Because, yeah, if you let it, it will be like, DarkSakura answered a question.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
DarkSakura hearted one of your questions, you know, or some of that.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
It's bad enough that, like, my Facebook and Twitter apps are starting to do that.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
You know, there's been an update or what was it like?

03:31.000 --> 03:40.000
I remember I used to get Facebook updates that I had, like, unread messages or something that are like unread notifications.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
And the unread notification was another notification saying that I had unread notifications.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
It was like notification ception or something like that.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Like, I really didn't have any unread notifications.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
It just sent me one of those and they kept sending me another one and another one and another one.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
Did you hear about all that crazy stuff, though, where I guess Facebook has yet another, like, hidden inbox or something of messages?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh, I know about that.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That's existed for, like, years.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I think they moved. I think at one point it was, like, unknown.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
But then they, like, moved it or something.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Like, it's another place.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, because that's the one where if you don't know, you're not a friend to somebody, that's where it will go.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Or you pay the dollar and they get it in their inbox or whatever.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
The hilarious thing is because I have my Rob Roberts name on Facebook, right?

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
So all my other inbox is is other people named Rob Roberts, I think, trying to figure out who has the account.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Because it's like, hello? And their name is Rob Roberts as well.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh, yeah, I had that before.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Which is funny because that's not my real name, but it might as well be.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I had someone, yeah, with my same name and they, like, tried to give me a joint group with the same people with the same name.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
And I did for a while and I'm like, wow, all these people are losers. No thanks.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Come hang out with us. We all have the same name.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
One of them was, like, extremely racist, like, somewhere in Ohio or something.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm like, nope.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It's like when your profile picture is, you know.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I love it.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
It's, what's it, the Confederate flag that's...

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Woop woop. Red alert, red alert.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Aside from all the other posts that they made, yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:22.000 --> 05:31.000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
So if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room and we can get your comments and feedback on the air.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
In fact, Alan Alka will be talking about the Facebook hidden inbox saying,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I knew about the Facebook thing years ago.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
I had three members of my estranged family trying to say hi to me that I didn't see until literally two to three years after the fact.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
So, hmm.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Let's see, also some comments on Miitomo.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
SHU100Matt saying, I'm not on Miitomo. I'm just so preoccupied with other things.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Also, I wonder how much it will be supported and if people will get tired of it.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
VxChaseNextV agreeing that Miitomo's notification sound is pretty rough.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I can tell you if you can get tired of it or not.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Answer me one question.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
So how are your Nintendogs doing?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Exactly, that's how this is going to go.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
It's quite different than that though.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, it is different than Nintendogs.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I gotta say, okay, here's my thoughts on Miitomo.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
All that stuff aside, and I guess admittedly I set the bar pretty low on Miitomo,

06:30.000 --> 06:39.000
but I honestly think Miitomo is like ten times more interesting than Tomodachi Life was on the 3DS.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Remember all the hoop and holler about that game, especially because there was controversy and all that stuff?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I think Miitomo is a more interesting game.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Ten times zero is still zero, so...

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Shut up.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
But yeah, I think Miitomo is interesting from a social network perspective,

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
and it's kind of blowing my mind because I would not have expected Nintendo to create a somewhat interesting social network.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
It's not going to replace Facebook, it's not going to replace Twitter, any of that,

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
but I will say this, tease all you want about the longevity of Miitomo.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
What happened to Peach, y'all?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Remember Peach?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
What happened to Peach?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
That was a thing, right?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Peach was replaced by Petch.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
What about Ello?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
When was the last time y'all logged?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Remember when we were all going to quit Facebook?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I still get email from Ello.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, I get email from them too.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, I get email this whole time.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Stop sending me email because they're like, please don't forget us, we're dying.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Remember when you hated Facebook and you made an account here?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Come back!

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
No, delete.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
So, yeah, I think Miitomo has more legs than Peach and Ello.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I'll give it that.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
I realize Loki's probably sitting there going, well, when you set the bar at half an inch off the ground, you got a lot of room to go.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
But I think there is that at least.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't know if it's going to last months and months and months.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Probably not.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
I think it's interesting that you have this whole like platinum coins thing and you can earn them in Miitomo

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
and you can earn them every day and they are going to turn into things where you can get like discounts on Nintendo games and stuff,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
which is kind of neat.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Like it's the whole like achievement points.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Or unheard of because they don't discount their games.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, they do now.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You can get what, 50% off Holy World or whatever?

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, I like though that it starts conversations and that they've actually led to some really interesting discussion.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
So I've learned, I've actually met new people on there.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I've learned a lot about different things.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
I found out that, like for example, that children have stronger taste sensitivity to bitter foods.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And that's why they don't like broccoli.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Was that like one of those like name an interesting fact that you learned today?

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
No, it was like name a food that you used to hate that you like now and I said Brussels sprouts.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
But there's a scientific explanation.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
What if I still don't like Brussels sprouts though?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Then you're not, then you're just sensitive.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't hate them as much as I used to as a kid.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
But like Alan will say, we're going to have Brussels sprouts tonight and I'll still make that face that's scrunchie like.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
That's because you're overly sensitive to bitterness.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Maybe because I am bad when you're made of bitterness.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
What's left?

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Going to chat over at live.vog network.com.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Act Def says me photo.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
That's the app seller.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay, that's the little thing where you can actually put your me's in crazy situations.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
But you can actually import pictures from your phone.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Which you can imagine has led to all sorts of hilarity and x-ratedness.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Or the me just covering up the x-ratedness enough.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I've been taking screenshots in other games.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
So like I have my me hanging out in like the Kingdom Hearts game.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Okay.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
The Kingdom Hearts X Unchained whatever.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, that's the other big cell phone release everybody's playing.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
I tried to play that but it's like I want to download an update five minutes later.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
4% done. I'm just like forget it.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
It's kind of boring.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I got a million other things to do right now.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Jamie review. Kind of boring.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Kind of boring?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Kind of boring.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Alright.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
The music's good.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Kind of boring, the music's good. There it is.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Dark Soccer, any other final thoughts on Miitomo?

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I feel like it's one of those things like almost everybody played it this week.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Obviously there's going to be folks like Loki that are like no I resist.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm not resisting I just don't care.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I think there's a ton.

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm sorry but like I have never seen a social network or a game explode that much in the first two days as much as I've seen Miitomo.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Just based on the frame requests I'm getting.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I like dressing up.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And I have Midna on my back.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I got the little black cat.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I like the little mini games. Those are fun.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah the mini games are kind of...

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Especially dropping your friends on their head and watching them go blah blah blah.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And it makes excite bike noises. Did you notice that?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
When they bounce around it's all excite bike stuff.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
So I will be curious to see and I think Loki that is a valid thing and I think it's something we're all wondering.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
How are they going to keep Miitomo interesting?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Like what's going to cause us to load it a week from now?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Oh I remembered something else interesting.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Listening to all the Miis say fuck.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Yes. Your Miis will say fuck.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Like Nintendo doesn't censor that which I've got to give them a little bit of credit for.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
But if you have friends who just aren't, you know, offended by that then whatever.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Whatever.

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
And I've seen all sorts of states of undress and people looking interesting.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
What I don't understand is how you're able to send friend requests to each other without exchanging some sort of numeric code.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I have a serious answer for that. There's three ways to do it.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
You can link your Facebook account. You can link your Twitter account.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
And then once you do that it'll show you here's all your friends on Facebook on Miitomo.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Here's all your mutual Twitter followers on Miitomo as well.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And you can add people that way. I think that's the way most people did it.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Wow that's pretty cool. Why can't they do that on their stupid consoles?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Well.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I wish they did have friend codes though.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Maybe this is the thing that's going to happen for NX. Maybe.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Just give them a little credit.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
Alan is asking about the QR code. That is just to import someone's Mii to use in photos.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Correct.

12:17.000 --> 12:28.000
So that doesn't do the friend sharing. I wish that you could do friend sharing via QR or a friend code because I have people who actually are not on social media who play Miitomo.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
The only other way you can do it. There's a thing called I think Bump. But you have to be in the same room.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Because it uses the GPS to figure out who's near each other.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
So if you're near each other and then you tap the same symbol. It's like clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades. Like from a deck of cards.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
You both tap the same symbol. Like syncing a Bluetooth or something.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And then it'll say okay here's all the people that have the same symbol and range.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
It'll say nasties have been bumped. You're welcome.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
What's that?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It'll say nasties have been bumped. You're welcome.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Nasties have been bumped.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
Oh lord. Alright. Yeah so there you go. That's Miitomo.

13:05.000 --> 13:14.000
So again the bar was low but I enjoy it more than I thought I would. I really do.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
So I paid actual money for Tomodachi Life and now I'm kind of pissed off.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Like if Miitomo made me angry at anything it made me angry I spent money on Tomodachi Life.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Well that's something you're just going to live with.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah that is. That's the consequence I'm going to have to live with. I'm just going to have to sit here and think about what I've done.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Perhaps you'll learn your lesson this time.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Never. Never. How many games are in your Steam library?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Plenty.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Have you stopped buying Steam games?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I haven't bought Steam games in a while.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I still have to finish Danganronpa.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Not to say they haven't shopped for them.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I've been so busy.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Like they're in there telling me I should play Project Egg Zone 2.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm like I don't have time. I still have to finish Danganronpa and I have stuff I'm being paid to do.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Speaking of Steam. So we've got two weeks to catch up on right?

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
I wasn't. We weren't here last week because I wasn't here last week so the Studio OLR was locked.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
So Dark Soccer's at the front door. Let me in.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Actually I think she has a key but I digress.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't think I have a key anymore.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I was not here because Alan and I went to Tucson to visit some friends of ours that live there.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
And we thought well there's also this Ingress event going on in Tucson.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Let's do a twofer. We'll do both. We'll get the most bang for our buck. We'll do the Ingress thing.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
Which I'm not going to get into all the details about that because I know a lot of you don't play and that's fine.

14:31.000 --> 14:43.000
But that was intense with so many people in one place playing the same game and yelling out like audibles from team to team.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
Recharge! Recharge! Drop it! Drop it! They took it! They took it! Deploy! Deploy! Shield! Shield! Axle! Ultra!

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
People are just like what the fuck is going on?

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh you should see the people that have no idea what they walked into.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Okay here's one funny story I'll tell that everybody can appreciate.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
So one of the nodes that ended up being called a volatile node which means it was worth double points.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
One of them was at a federal building.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
Keep in mind which node did my team get assigned to? The federal building.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
So we're all there on a Saturday. Now you don't have to go inside the building.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
But it was right outside the building.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
And it was a hot day so we were like we're just going to go stand under in the shade.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So we did. We all went and went and stand under in the shade.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
And so we're all doing our thing. Deploy! Deploy!

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
We're being very careful not to use the words blow it up.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Because in the game that's what you fire little lasers you blow.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
But we were very careful. Do not say the words blow it up.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Do the opposite of recharging.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Yes do the opposite of recharging.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
So we were very very careful with the words that we used.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
However there was still a security guard on Saturday.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And the security guard actually came up and said.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
You know actually they were super nice about it.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Like they weren't like a douchebag security guard.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
I think they were like hey I know you guys are doing like some weird game thing here.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I can see all the people around town.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
But got to have you 50 feet away from the building or whatever.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You know so they were really cool about it.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
But like okay. Niantic.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
Maybe in the future don't fucking put volatiles at federal buildings.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
On a Saturday.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
So yeah I didn't but I didn't think about that.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
It was just funny.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
So that was Ingress in a nutshell.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But we went to Tucson.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
And I will say a quick little aside about Tucson.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I don't know if we have any listeners there.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Besides you know my friends that live there.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But one of the days we were there we were walking around the street fair.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
The 4th Avenue Street Fair.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Which you know had a ton of vendors.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
But right in that same area there was actually a pinball arcade.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
It was nothing but pinball.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Well maybe like two maim type machines.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
But most of it was pinball games.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
And I was pretty impressed.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
In fact I was like Dark Sakura needs to see this.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
I'm sure she's probably seen all these machines at some point in her life.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
But still to see them all in one place outside of a convention or something is still pretty impressive.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Did you happen to see the picture I put on Instagram Dark Sakura?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
There was like a ton of pinball games in this place.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
It was pretty nice.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I didn't find.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah I didn't see it.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
It was cool.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
There was a lot of different games there.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So what did I play?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh I played a Star Trek machine.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Not the next generation but the original Star Trek.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
But not the movie Star Trek.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
So I played that machine.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I know that one.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Because I'm a nerd.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It's not a Gottlieb is it?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't remember.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It has the transporter animation.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah I know what you're talking about.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It's like from like 83 or something.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah it's definitely an 80's machine.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
But it was fun.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
So I played that and watched my friends play some other games.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
So I was pretty impressed by that little pinball museum they had there.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
So that is my gaming thing there.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
But also my friends in Tucson owned a Steam Link.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And I'd never seen one before.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
But my friend was playing.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Oh now I can't remember.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
What's that game?

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
It was a Kickstarter game and it like just came out in the past couple weeks.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Pixel art style.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Zelda-esque but really really hard.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Somebody in chat will know what I'm talking about.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
By the way it's Bally.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Okay thank you.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
It's Red something I think is in the title.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
So somebody in chat will know over at live.com.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
You mean Hyperlight Drifter?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Is that it?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Hyperlight Drifter.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yes that is it.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Hyperlight Drifter.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
That is the game.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
So I was watching him play that through Steam Link on the TV.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Because I guess he was running it on the computer upstairs.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And playing it on the big screen downstairs.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
And I was kind of like huh this is kind of neat.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And I'm like so these things are only like 50 bucks?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Alright shit I'm going to get one.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
So we bought a Steam Link.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So when I was teasing you about your Steam Library.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
We were actually we bought a Steam Link and we were using that a little bit.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And yeah I was going through the library going wow.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I have all these games I don't think I've ever even touched.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
But now I can play them on the Steam Link.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
So that's pretty cool.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Okay I'm stupid it was Data East.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Hmm.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
The pinball.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Oh I think.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
No because Bally had the license and Data East had the license and Data East did I think the later one.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
So sorry I didn't mean to.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I should know my pinball better.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Bobby Blackwolf says also got a Steam Controller.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I considered getting the controller I just didn't end up.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I was like nah I knew the Xbox One controllers worked.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So I was like eh that'll be good enough.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
We had a Steam Link and we returned it.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah I know you guys I remember because before we bought it you said you guys didn't care for it.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
What was the negative?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Well I thought it was neat and Dan's the one who really played it more than I did.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I really didn't get a chance to.

19:19.000 --> 19:28.000
But some of the games there was like way too much lag between our computers and because he was actually playing it off of my Steam Library.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
And I wouldn't say that my computer is like well at least my gaming rig is probably the best that ever existed.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
But when he tried to play like I think more advanced games there was definitely some lag.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
And so he's just like yeah this.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
He returned it didn't consult me but.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Well you can borrow ours someday maybe.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
But well I.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Were you wired on that.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Or wireless.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I don't remember I think he did it wirelessly.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
See we're wired on ours because we thought that might be a problem.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
But since the rooms are next to each other we knew we could run a long cord around the wall and that's what we did.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
And so it's wired.

20:04.000 --> 20:13.000
And so I think that does make a huge difference because I can imagine if it's wireless you're going to get the stop and go and the things that come with wireless networking.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
So yeah.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
But wired is great.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
So I've already made a decision though that I'm going to get a controller for my Apple TV.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Because you can get the DuckTales game on Apple TV.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Oh that's right.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's actually getting a lot more games.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah the whole like there there's just a ton of stuff that will broadcast to TV now I always get these pop ups on my computers.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Get the Nvidia Shield it will do because you know because I have the driver.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
No I'm just like well yeah I know I'm like what do I need it for I have a steam link now like that literally I did I didn't even really need it.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I just was like well it might be fun and it's neat.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But yeah that's it.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
So yeah that's why we didn't have a show last week I was out of town.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
So we've been without a show for a couple weeks or just two weeks we've been one week without a show.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
But we are back today and we'll continue to be throughout the next few weeks on Sundays.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
No no shows off that we see in the future until like Labor Day weekend when I'm out of town in Atlanta Dragon Con.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
So we have plenty of shows coming up for you guys over the coming weeks.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
Which an interesting kind of aside you might remember a few weeks ago I was talking about that we were having issues on Stitcher.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
And like Stitcher hadn't updated our show since like what like February or something.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Well all of a sudden I guess the backlog got caught up.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
And I think what happened is I think enough people because somebody actually contacted us on Facebook going.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Hey I'm trying to get your show on Stitcher and I can't.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
It's just like I'm kind of like in this place where it's like I'm so frustrated not obviously the feedback.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
I'm not frustrated the feedback is completely valid I'm frustrated there's like nothing I can do.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I've pinged Stitcher I've tried to update our URL and all this stuff.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
So I was like hey can you email Stitcher and tell them you miss us because it's kind of out of our control.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
Well I guess that person did that and maybe enough people did that where finally it got updated so yay to that.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
But yeah so at least there's that.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.000
The people that thought our show just ended because they were listening on Stitcher at least got like eight more episodes.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
So hopefully they didn't miss us as bad last week when we really didn't have a show this last week.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
But I will remind everybody please please consider following us on Twitter.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio especially the Twitter because when we don't have a show we'll let you know.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
Like you know and if this show heaven forbid were to ever end or stop.

22:32.000 --> 22:40.000
We'll let you know on social media that hey the last episode is happening come show up and say goodbye.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
You know we'll give you some advance we will do everything we can to give you advance notice.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
And not just surprise you one week like gotcha we're gone forever.

22:49.000 --> 22:56.000
So anyway Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the last episode of OLR is happening.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
What some day some day but just not today.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
I hope I hope you know this is the last episode for this week.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Yes it is.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
This is the very last episode of OLR for this week.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Alright Dr. Suyin in chat says I won't know what to do with my Sunday nights at 6.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Oh God neither would I.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
After doing this for what we're almost on 14 years.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
There was a few months ago remember when I was sick.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We missed a show because I was like really sick.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Like I'm sitting here Sunday night going I have nothing to do.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Like I guess I'll play a video game or something.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Like I'm sick and there's no show and my life sucks right now.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Like what am I going to do on my Sunday night.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
So believe me I understand how you feel.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
One other thing I definitely want to talk about at the top of the show here.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
And then we'll get into our gaming weeks and we have plenty of news and all that stuff.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
But absolutely we have to talk about the event we were at yesterday.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
So even though you didn't get an OLR last week.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
We were broadcasting all day long yesterday from the SAC Indie Arcade Gaming Expo in West Sacramento.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
And of course if you heard the last episode of Orange Andreo.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
We already talked about the event at length because Gabe and Bree were here in studio during our last episode.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
So we talked a lot about it and so the event actually happened on Saturday.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
So we were broadcasting all day.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Although admittedly we didn't really have a lot to do.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
But that's a good thing because the speakers were pretty much non-stop throughout the day.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
So you were pretty much getting the speakers and we would chime in once in a while.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
But there was just so much other talent there.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
There wasn't a lot for us to do but kind of just make sure things were still moving.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
But it just also is a testament to how smoothly run that show is.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
And I got to say and I told this to Gabe and Bree and anybody I could.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
Like the growth of the event from last year to this year was so noticeable.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Not just the venue. I mean and nothing against the space last year.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Because the Cafe Colonial they have been so supportive for the whole thing.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
But the reality is it just outgrew that space.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And so they had to find a new space.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
There would have been no way it would have fit in the old space.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
But now they're in that West Sacramento Community Center.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Which was an interesting layout because we were joking on Bobby's show.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It's like, oh there's a room over here.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
It's like the game board of Clue.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
There's a room over here and there's a secret passage from the conservatory to the dining room.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Like there's just all this crazy stuff.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
I was mentioning to Loki that walking backstage was like, it's like a secret passage.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
It was.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
And like I was sneaking out through doors and whatnot and yeah it was great.

25:36.000 --> 25:43.000
So yeah and a big testament too to the West Sacramento, the community and the city that was putting that on.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
Because I got to say you know we had dedicated help to making sure that OLR would get up and running.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
And I got to be honest I'm not often used to that.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Not that I do these events every day.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
But like somebody was dedicated to making sure, do we have everything we need?

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Do we have the wired internet? Is our sound okay? Is all that stuff?

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
So the reason why when we went up at 10.15 and everything sounded great is because we had help from the venue right there.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Any questions we had they worked out.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
They were like yeah run the wire through here.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
The router's back over here and we can use your sound.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It was just awesome.

26:16.000 --> 26:24.000
But anyway the event of course they had lots of indie games from developers here in the Sacramento area.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
As well as some in the Bay Area and even I think somebody from San Diego was there.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And so there were all these local folks showing off their games.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
And there was everything from tablet games to Wii U games to VR.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
The Vive was there.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
To someone creating their own system.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Yes. I think that was that 3D conceptual thing right? With the tic-tac-toe.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Yeah there was that.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And did you see what was right next to that?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
The big like they would put the key.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't know what that was.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Okay so what that was, I think they were wearing a VR thing.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
And they had gloves and boots strapped to them.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
And it was like a, no they didn't have a VR headset on.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
No they didn't have a VR headset on.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
They were just dressed up like it and they would knock over like cardboard.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Yeah the game was You Are Godzilla.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
And there was actual cardboard boxes that were set up on the ground.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
And as you, like there were sensors in the boxes and as you would knock shit over.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Like it was doing stuff in the game.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Like it would be like combo and like all this stuff.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
And I was like, okay I don't know what practical use something like that has.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Like that's not something you're really ever going to have in a house.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
But boy is it a fucking great party game.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Like that was a lot of fun to watch.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And the kids were really into it.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
But yeah they got suited up in this whole thing.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And were tearing down virtual buildings.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And I thought that was awesome.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So there was just so much creativity there.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
But we were up in a theater room that was called the black box.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Because that's what it was.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
It was a theater that's like the box type theater.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
And the room was black.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
In fact we joked during the day.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
And I know this doesn't come out very well on radio.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
But we kept joking about mood lighting.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
That's because since it was a theater room.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
For a lot of the day it was pitch black in there.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Except you'd have that lone spotlight shining from the ceiling.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
That's supposed to light actors that are on the stage.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Which makes a lot of sense for the play.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
But for the speakers it was a little like we were like sitting in the dark.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
And I think even Loki was kind of like I'm falling asleep over here.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
It's too dark.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
So it wasn't good for me to like with as little sleep as I get in a very dark room.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Right?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
With somebody giving a very soothing talk.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Like I had two Red Bulls and it still was not enough to keep me awake.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Like I gotta go downstairs or something.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Look the talks were awesome.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And props to all the speakers.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
And this is nothing I didn't joke with Gabe and Bree about beforehand.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
But I was like okay guys.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
When you announced the list of speakers.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I was like okay this sounds cool.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
But I don't know any of these people.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I was like can I get bio cards.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Because I don't know any of these people to introduce or whatever.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So I was like okay.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But they all gave great talks.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
All of them gave great talks.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And I learned a lot myself.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And so I said at the end of the day.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I said okay.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
You know what.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Not that I ever doubted you guys.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
But considering I did not know those people.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
A. I got to network and meet all those people.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
And you know that was great networking opportunities and so forth.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
Just to meet awesome people that do different things in the game industry and mingle with them.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
But B.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Like all of them were prepared.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
All of them had a great concept behind their talk.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
And I felt like I even learned a thing or two.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
So I was really honored that we could bring that to a larger audience at VOG Network.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I'm just sorry that probably more people didn't realize it was going on.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
Because we only have so big of an audience here at OLR.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
But I think gamers on a wider scale everywhere.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
Could really benefit from hearing a publisher talk about what a publisher really does.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
And why devs may want a publisher.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
And what a publisher can do for them.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
Because I think so many people pass opinions on companies like EA.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Konami and so forth that are publishers.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Without necessarily really knowing what a publisher is.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
You know what I mean.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
And we may or may not have been guilty of something like that.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
I still argue that perception is.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I have a decent idea what publishers do.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah but still.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Regardless of how educated or not you are on that.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
It was still neat to hear it from somebody's mouth like that.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
And it wasn't just some guy from EA or some big big publisher.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
But it was I'm an indie publisher essentially.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
So that was one talk in particular I thought was good.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
There was another gentleman that talked a lot about biases that you have in developing games.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
And it's not that you're a jerk or that you're intentionally out to be biased.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
But it's just that your backgrounds lend to your perceptions.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
There's that word again.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
The way you may perceive certain things and what you might end up putting in your game.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So you have to be more aware.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
So I thought it was just so much interesting stuff throughout the day.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
So big big props to everybody involved with Sac Indie Arcade.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
We are going to look at putting that out there as a podcast.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Getting those audio files out there for you guys so you can download that and listen to it later.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Because again I really would love to see more people be able to check this stuff out.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
My brain just put two words together.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Audio files for audio files.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Yes. It's something like that.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Absolutely.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I tried to do the Periscope thing.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I actually did a Periscope.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Did that work well in a pitch black room like that?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Believe it or not yes because the slides came through.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
Here's where it didn't work well because I never had a Periscope on the OLR account.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
I couldn't get the name OLR even though that's our Twitter name.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
So I got Orange Lounge Radio and I just assumed it cross posted to the OLR account but it didn't.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
So I was wondering why like maybe one or two people were watching the whole time.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
But it's because unless you were like our friend on Periscope right off the bat you had no idea that we were doing the Periscope.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
So I did learn some little things like that.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
I remember friending you on Periscope but for some reason I still got the notification on that.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Well I did it from the OLR account not my Rob Roberts account.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Well that's a mess.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Anyway.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
So there's that.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
So but anyway we had a great time and massive props to everybody involved.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
And I look forward to working with the IGDA here locally on more things.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
You know Gabe and Bree and we've all talked about we need to do this more than once a year.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
And absolutely so stay tuned.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
We'll do that more often.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
But a big hello and thanks for checking us out to anybody who may have found us at the Sac&D Arcade Gaming Expo.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
Hope you enjoy what you hear here at the Voice Geeks Network.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
There's plenty of other podcasts and great shows out there that talk about all sorts of different topics.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
Not just video games. We have shows on anime, shows on Power Rangers, shows on British television,

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
geek culture, trying new foods from crazy places and eating them.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
Like there's just there's all sorts of shows on the network.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
So you can check out the complete lineup at vognetwork.com.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
But if you're new to Orange Lounge Radio just briefly the concept.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
Loki Dark Soccer and myself we all met like 15 years ago.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Let that sink in for a minute.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
We all met like 15 years ago playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade here.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
And we used to play DDR on what Wednesday nights.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I think it was like the big DDR night.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
And then we would go to the diner that was in the parking lot and we would talk about video games.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
Because it was the one thing we all shared the one thing we all had in common.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
We would talk about video games for a couple hours.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
At one point we just had the idea.

33:36.000 --> 33:44.000
Hey what if we like took the diner conversation and put them on the internet so we could have them with all the diners.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
And that was pretty much what OLR ended up being.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
So welcome to the show and hope you enjoy it.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase PICKLE.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Alright well we talked about a lot there in the opening.

34:02.000 --> 34:08.000
But we do like to kick off all of our shows with a little check in on how was your gaming week.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
And what types of video games have you been playing this week.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
So Dark Soccer starting with you.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
How was your gaming week?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
It was alright.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.000
I mean apart from having the expo yesterday which I played Mo & Go and a few other games.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
I also played a little Danganronpa just a little bit.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
What else did I play?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
And a lot of Ingress.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
A lot of Miitomo.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Dragon Age.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Heroes of Dragon Age whatever that is.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And that Kingdom Hearts game that was boring but okay.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
What is it?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
What are you doing it?

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
You just run around killing things and going on these quests.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
How do you control it?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Is it like a platformer?

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah well not really a platformer.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
More like you just direct them where they need to go.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
You swipe the screen to kill stuff.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
It was just really boring.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Oh.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
It's cute.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I really don't like the style.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
I like the scenes and everything but I don't like the player characters.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Because the style doesn't look like Kingdom Hearts.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
It looks like we asked some developer in Singapore to make this.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
The game.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
So don't waste your money.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Don't waste your time.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
I mean it's free.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
I think it's free.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
It's free to download but I'm sure there's plenty of energy refills.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah it's boring as fuck.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Don't worry about it.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Alright.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Act F points out it's a Theatrhythm style.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I knew it did kind of have a familiar look to it.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
So it's like the Theatrhythm style.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
See Theatrhythm though is actually a good game.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
This.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Boring.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Alright.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Fair enough.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Everybody's entitled to their opinion.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I haven't played it yet so I have none.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
I played quite a bit in the last few weeks.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Let's see.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
I played.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
They had new DLC come out for Lego Avengers.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
So I played all three DLC levels that they had.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
They had like the.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I'm trying to think who it was here.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
They had the Ant-Man stuff so that was kind of cool.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
And then.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
The Masters of Evil.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
So they had their group with Baron Zemo.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
And then classic like Captain Marvel.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
And so I played through those.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
And they were okay.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
I don't know.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
It's kind of.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
They had a level with like you know trophies and stuff you could get but.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
It was kind of odd though like I still didn't unlock the trophies even though I got everything.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
I think you had to get everything and finish the level at the same time.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
Cause I was like oh okay well I got everything I'm gonna quit the level cause you still get credit for it.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
But you know.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I guess that was the issue there.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And then I played.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
You know cause shame on me.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
I played Amplitude.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
There was.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Some issue with how it was on the.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Sony online store.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
And I may have exploited that to get it for free so I did play it.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
It's alright.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I don't know.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Probably would have been pissed off if I had actually paid for that.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
But it's alright.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It's a decent music game.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Then.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Let's see what else did I buy.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
I just recently picked up cause I had watched.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
I've been looking at all the stuff that they have like their.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
The Sony store stuff with the different games that they're releasing.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
Still thinking about purchasing Day of the Tentacle cause that looks awesome.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It is awesome cause I've played it before but.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I was like eh I just really want to buy it again just to play through it again.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Maybe still will.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
But I saw Enter the Gungeon on there and I was like okay well what the hell is this.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Something that.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
It's kind of a funny name.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
They've got a pun in the name.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
So I checked out the trailer.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I was like eh this is alright.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
You know kind of cool.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
But I kept reading reviews on it and like everybody was really.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Liking it.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
So I said okay fine I'll go ahead and pick it up and.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Download it.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
So I downloaded it last night and.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Oh my god it's a fucking awesome game.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It's just this like rogue-lite.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You know kind of Binding of Isaac type of game.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
It's basically bullet hell but you're kind of running around like Smash TV and stuff.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
And it's got awesome music and the art style and it's like really.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
It's like cutesy and like strange I guess.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I don't know like.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
All the.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The whole game is basically gun themed.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Gun themed.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
So like you know you're entering the Gungeon which is this giant bullet.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
And all the enemies are bullets and they're shooting guns.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
That are like associated with their bullets and stuff.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
And just.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I don't know.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
And the weapons are ridiculous.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
What was the name of this again?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Enter the Gungeon.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Enter the Gungeon.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
And.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
It's just it's really fucking hard though.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Like because it's bullet hell.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I mean there's like bullets all over the goddamn screen.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
And you know where it takes good timing to be able to do well in the game.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And I've only played it a little bit.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
I got to play to see two of the bosses so far.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
One was like this pigeon type character with this minigun.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
And then the Bullet King.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Which was pretty cool.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Because I was showing my son.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I was trying to explain the game to him.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
So I just showed him that.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
And then.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
What else?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
I played actual Minecraft last night on the Playstation 4 because it's been a while.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Nice.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
And my son's played it a little bit.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
So I was like okay I want to check out and see what's different.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
And I'm like holy crap.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
There's a lot of shit that's different on this.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
So I played a little bit of that.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And what else?

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
A little bit of Ingress but not really that much because I've been trying to cut back on that.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Just playing on my way to and from work.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
And that's about it.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
I think that's everything.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
God I don't know.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I'm sure I've played Fallout 4 somewhere.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I think that's everything.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Alright.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
If that's it for your gaming week I'll talk a little bit about mine.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Although honestly I pretty much.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
I talked about all the big stuff I wanted to talk about already.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
You know with Miitomo and all that other stuff.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
But there is still one big game I played this week that I have to talk about here in my gaming week.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
And that is.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Quantum Break came out on the Xbox One.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Finally right?

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
The successor in many ways to Alan Wake from Remedy came out on Xbox One this week.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
And I was looking forward to the game even though admittedly I didn't really know a lot about it.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Because they didn't really tell us a lot about the game.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Except for some of the motion capture and all this stuff.

40:35.000 --> 40:42.000
So I played through at least the first little chapter and I think I'm about halfway through the second.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
I should be a lot further but it's just been such a busy weekend and everything else going on.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
That's really all I've had time to play.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
But I gotta say.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I think it's awesome.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I think Quantum Break is so cool.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
It's basically in the story it has to do with time travel.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
And you kind of get stuck in a time thing where you can now manipulate time.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
I'm overly stupidly simplifying it for the sake of time.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
But you actually can.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
The game itself is kind of like a shooter in a way.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Because you know you're bang bang.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
You aim and you fire.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
It reminds me a little bit of Mass Effect.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Kind of in that regard.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Like the way it controls.

41:22.000 --> 41:30.000
But you can use cool little time bendy things to either protect yourself like with a time shield.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
You can do a force time bubble on the enemies.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So you can shoot them with a ton of bullets.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
And then when the force time bubble wears off all the bullets go through at once.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
So you hit them all at once. That's kind of fun.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
And you do all these force dashes and all these things.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
So you got all these weird powers that are just explained through the magic of time.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
But then the game also has this element where, and I'm sure some of you guys have heard about this.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
Where there's actually a TV show that occurs.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
So once you beat the first chapter you have to make a tell tale style decision.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
That's all I'll say is that you have to make a decision.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Do you want to do A or do you want to do B?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
And it's a big decision that's going to impact the game.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
And once you make the decision it shows you.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
Here's all your friends that chose to do the same thing as you and you're in this percentage of the users or whatever.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
But that decision is going to impact the TV show that you're going to see.

42:24.000 --> 42:31.000
And then you watch like a 20 minute Netflix style show that ties into the game that you're playing.

42:31.000 --> 42:37.000
It's just this is somebody else's perspective instead of the main characters that you're playing for most of the time.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
The TV show is here's somebody else.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
But then that big decision is not the only thing that plays into the TV show.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
There's other elements that will change the TV show.

42:46.000 --> 42:54.000
For example in the very first level and since the very first level I don't consider this a spoiler and it's not really a huge element of the story anyway.

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
I found like a formula on the wall that my character finished basically writing out.

43:00.000 --> 43:07.000
And it gave the little icon in a butterfly effect for those of you that have played Until Dawn.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
A butterfly effectish kind of way where it says that's going to come back later.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
So I finished the formula and it's like that's going to be remembered.

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
And then when I was watching the TV show there's this conversation that's happening between two characters where they go.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah I found out when I came into work this morning that somebody had finished the formula.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Was that you? No.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
So they're actually talking about something that happened in the game but it's happening in this seamless TV show.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
So I have to admit okay that's kind of rad.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't remember seeing things like that until like way back in the day when it was like CD-ROMs.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
And the movie files from the CD-ROMs that would play would change maybe depending on what you did in the game.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
But this uses, get this, streaming. That's how it does it.

43:49.000 --> 43:56.000
Is it streaming it all from online so that way the branching is all seamless for those types of decisions.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It's streaming like Netflix would.

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
Disclaimer though, if you have a shitty connection you can download the entire set of the movie files.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
You ready for this? 72 gigabytes if you want to download the movies.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
72 gigabytes. Maybe it was more. 72's the number that jumps in my head was at least 70.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
So you can download the movies if you're worried about the streaming thing or you're worried about the loss of quality or something.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
But I don't know how you're going to download 70 gigs worth of show if you can't stream it.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
So just something to consider.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
That's going to turn some people off I think what I just said.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
But if you're using your Xbox One for Netflix, you're fine.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
And I think a lot of you are using your Xbox One or your PlayStation 4 for Netflix.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
So what I just said shouldn't concern you because it's essentially doing the same thing.

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
But I really like how the one plays into the other and I just think the game itself is a lot of fun to play.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
What's interesting is that I've been reading reviews on it online and I really shouldn't do that.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
But I can't help it sometimes because I want to know if other people are as enthusiastic about the game as I am.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
And it turns out, no. The game is actually getting mixed reviews.

45:07.000 --> 45:14.000
And some people are saying that the shooter is an okay shooter and the movie segment is an okay movie.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Well let me tell you from my perspective, I don't play a lot of shooter games.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Admittedly, it's not usually my genre.

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
I think that actually plays in my favor on why I like Quantum Break more.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
And yes, you can set the difficulty in Quantum Break. I'm playing on easy mode. No shame in that.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
No shame in playing in Bobby Black Wolf mode. I'm still enjoying the story. That's what I'm there for.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
And I have not been super challenged in the game.

45:42.000 --> 45:51.000
I've come close, I've had scary moments, but I feel like using the powers and everything, I still feel like I'm not just pressing A to advance the story.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
I am playing a game here, even on easy mode.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
So I enjoy the shooter well enough and I like all those time-based elements.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
And I think the show, I don't know if I get all the reads on the show being a bad show.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
I think if you're into the story, I think the show is good.

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
Is it a little low budget? Yeah, but it's way more than what we've ever had for a video game that I can recall.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
It's on par with a Netflix or Amazon series, in my opinion.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
It's fine. The budget stuff doesn't really worry me so much.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
I don't get the reads on the whole fact that the budget looks really, really low budget.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
Because I'm like, do you play video games? Because a lot of times movies look low budget.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Is it at the level of SimCity Action News?

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Nothing will ever be at the level of SimCity Action News, unfortunately.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
For those that have ever played the SimCity CD-ROM game, that is the best movie acting.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
No, nothing. You can't attain the unachievable, Loki. It's just not going to happen.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
But it's pretty darn good. It's pretty darn good.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
I would actually say the acting is a little bit better than it is in the SimCity CD-ROM game.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
So there's that.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
Alright. Go into a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Kaijuto says, this game sounds like it's a ripoff of Timeshift.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Just get Timeshift for super cheap and you'll see it's the better game.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
I would actually say it's more of a ripoff of Alan Wake and Max Payne.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
But they can do that. Because those were Remedy's other games.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
I really feel like the TV show element, you saw some of that in Alan Wake.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
But they really took that to the next level with Quantum Break.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
So that's why I think in some ways this game really is a successor to Alan Wake.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
And it's important because TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
Yes. Which is what the Xbox One was all about originally.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Now I'm starting to see that vision.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
I have to admit, I think it's a pretty cool thing to watch.

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
And I'm very curious what happens in the show if I picked the other option.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Because I'll tell you what, again, I don't want to spoil anything.

47:55.000 --> 48:03.000
But it's very obvious if I had gone the other way, a character would not be alive if I'd gone the other way.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
That character is in the TV show.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
So, what would have been different?

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
So it makes me curious enough to kind of want to go back and play again.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
So, alright.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Let's see.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
Over at, oh and this is interesting.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Kaizhudo continues over at Live.Vognor.com.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
No, I would never buy an Xbox One. I said, it sounds like.

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
I would actually say, Quantum Break is an Xbox One exclusive worthy of your attention.

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
If you're on the fence, like, what exclusives does Xbox have that I can't get on PlayStation 4?

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
I think Quantum Break is one you ought to consider.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
It's not going to be for everybody. It's probably not a game for Kaizhudo.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
The Windows 10 version, right?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah, but we'll get into that later in the show.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
Because the Windows 10 version, there might be a couple problems there.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
But, as far as the Xbox One is, between Rise of the Tomb Raider, Halo 5, if you're into that.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
I really think Quantum Break is an exclusive that you need to consider.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
Like, Quantum Break is a much bigger deal than Knack on the PlayStation 4.

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
And look, I love my PlayStation 4 and they've got a ton of great games over there.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
But I'm just saying, some exclusives are no big deal.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
Rise on the Xbox One, also not really something to scream and shout about, right?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
To be fair, I'll name one of those.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Quantum Break is one worthy of your attention.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
On Xbox One, I'm just saying. I believe it.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Alright, anyhow.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I was going to mention real quick, one thing I forgot to mention in my gaming week.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
What was that?

49:36.000 --> 49:43.000
So, PlayStation 3.5 came out, which means that you can stream to your PC.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
I was super excited about that, because I was like, I'm all sweet, I'm going to stream to my laptop, it's going to be awesome.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
It fucking sucks ass!

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Does it really?

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
To be honest, though, it's probably not the PlayStation's fault, it's my fucking laptop's fault.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
But it does not fucking work at all.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
So you have to have a-

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
It is laggy as shit.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I don't have a wired connection on my PlayStation.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Oh, you're even- oh, that was the next thing I was going to ask. Are you running wired?

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
I mean, my laptop's not wired, so I guess there could be bottleneck there, but it was-

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
Yeah, especially if your laptop is not beefy enough, that's probably the bottom line.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
I mean, I may try it again to wire it, because my router is just across the room.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
I could do that, but I don't feel like I should need to.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
Well, with something that intensive, wired is always going to be better.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
But like, I don't know, I thought it would work just fine, because I thought I did that before the Vita, and it worked fine.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Maybe I was doing PlayStation 3, I don't know.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
But yeah, it didn't work for me. I was disappointed.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
I have not done- admittedly, I have not done that PlayStation 4 streaming thing yet.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
I was going to try it, but honestly, I've just been super into Quantum Break.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
When I do have time to sit on the couch and play a game, I want to play Quantum Break until I finish it, because I'm into the story.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
But I'm curious about the whole PlayStation 4 streaming thing.

50:54.000 --> 51:00.000
But I've done the Xbox One streaming thing to Windows 10, and I thought that worked really well.

51:01.000 --> 51:08.000
I was playing, of all things, Dungeon Siege 3 a few weeks ago.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
Because that was like the games for gold thing on 360 backwards compatibility.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
So I was playing that on my computer, because I wanted to chat with Alan or something, so I didn't want to be on the couch.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
So I was playing over the stream, and it was great.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah, I'd be totally down with that, because I had a lot of games on Xbox 360.

51:26.000 --> 51:32.000
I'd love to have them backwards compatible, but I don't have an Xbox One.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
Apparently not a laptop strong enough to stream at, I guess.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
Alright. Well anyway, we've got to move on and get into some news.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Some housekeeping tonight. I think I've pretty much already thrown everything out there.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I'll just reiterate. Please follow us on Twitter.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
Twitter.com slash orange lounge- excuse me, Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
And yes, Google Plus as well. Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
We need to get into some news, however. It's that time, so let's do it.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
Getting into this week in news, because we missed a busy week last week, I'll tell you that much.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
And then there's more going on this week, so we're going to try to at least cover what happened this week. Loki.

52:10.000 --> 52:18.000
I do apologize in advance. I have some chest cold thing that is really making me very- it's difficult to breathe and not cough.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
That's okay, these things happen. Oh, I should say this.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
You remember everybody was saying a couple weeks ago that one of the- well, actually, you weren't here.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
You've been gone for like a month, Loki.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah, unfortunately. I had to put a door in last week.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Welcome back!

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And then at Easter, and like-

52:33.000 --> 52:39.000
Okay, so during the show last week, my mic was cutting out bad. Like, it was shorting, basically, the whole thing.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
So, some people were like noticeably saying like, Rob, that mic is fucked.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
So, I will say this. Hopefully, you all notice, I have a new microphone.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I did get a brand new microphone.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
The guest mic has been replaced as well, because we have four mics in the studio.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
Dark Soccer and Loki were fine, so I didn't replace theirs.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
Plus, I felt a little better buying two at a time, as opposed to four.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
So, I'll replace those two next.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
But yeah, I am on a new microphone.

53:04.000 --> 53:13.000
We actually used them for the first time yesterday, which was a really kind of crazy thing to do, because what if it was crappy?

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
But I just- I had the old mics just in case, but yeah, it ended up working out great.

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
So yeah, I'm on a new mic tonight, and hopefully sound better than I did a couple weeks ago.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
So anyway, now we can get into some news. Loki.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Alright, so let's talk about rumors!

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
Everybody likes rumors. Well, this is apparently rumor regarding the new Zelda game.

53:33.000 --> 53:40.000
Guess what? I know this is going to be shocking to you, but it's rumored to be coming out on the Wii U and NX.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
Really? Because I didn't totally see this coming out on the NX, because it's been pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.

53:47.000 --> 53:56.000
But this is- I guess the source of this is from Emily Rogers, who leaked I guess the existence of a new Paper Mario game on Wii U before they announced Color Splash.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
And some of the things that go along with that.

54:00.000 --> 54:08.000
Apparently not only is it going to be on both systems, but you may have the choice to play as either a male or female character in the game.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
And that they're going to have voice acting for the other characters in the game as well.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
Except for Link, who I guess is not going to talk.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
So, neat I guess? I don't know, most modern games have that.

54:22.000 --> 54:31.000
Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm sitting at this going, it's not a big deal, but some people on the internet, being the internet, want to make it a big deal.

54:31.000 --> 54:42.000
But when I say it's not a big deal, I completely understand if you are the girl who wants to see more representation of yourself in games, and you want to be a female Link.

54:42.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm not saying it's not a big deal there, I'm just saying that this option, this is Mass Effect to me, it's not a big deal.

54:51.000 --> 55:07.000
And in fact, considering how well the internet responded to Linkle, if I'm the guy designing- I'm not saying that female Link is going to be Linkle, but if I'm the person designing the Zelda and going, wow, everybody loves Linkle.

55:07.000 --> 55:16.000
Let's be honest, though, about Linkle, okay? I thought the character looked cool, but the way that she's treated in the game, it's ridiculous. She's a goddamn idiot.

55:16.000 --> 55:30.000
I mean, seriously, the character's thing is she has a map and a giant compass, and her victory thing is that she fucking doesn't know her way around. She's getting lost all the time.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
And she's like a bumbling buffoon.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Yeah, but I know men and women that get lost all the time.

55:35.000 --> 55:43.000
I understand that, but like, you don't see the male Link, you know, just, I'm fucking lost. It's just like, ah, it's a stupid girl, ha!

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
So she has ditzy traits that male Link doesn't have in his world.

55:46.000 --> 55:56.000
Yeah, I mean, she has badass crossbows too, but you know, it's just, it's not the same. Whatever, I mean, that's fine, but it's just, I think it's stupid.

55:57.000 --> 56:04.000
I mean, I think Linkle, the way they portrayed her, is stupid. She could be badass, that's cool. Why can't she be badass? Link is badass.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
When you see the pictures of Linkle with the crossbows, I'm like, okay, I'm here for that.

56:07.000 --> 56:14.000
Yeah, exactly, I'm down, that's cool. But like, it's like, why put that last part in?

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
It's not, haha, she's bad at navigation? I mean, I don't get it.

56:21.000 --> 56:31.000
Dark Sakura, as a, you know, person that's been following video games for a long time, from the original Legend of Zelda, and our female on the panel, I have to ask you what you think about this whole addition.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I'm the token girl.

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't want to say token girl, but you are the girl on our panel, so yes, I need to ask your opinion.

56:38.000 --> 56:52.000
I, I'm happy with the option to play a female character. I just wish that they would have been, yeah, a complete swap, the way that Fem Shop was, and then again, she was also designed first.

56:52.000 --> 57:06.000
But, I would rather not have them be two entirely different people, or, I really don't like the, oh, the girl is lost and needs help trope, I hate that.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It should just be...

57:09.000 --> 57:18.000
But we should be clear, just to make sure it's clear, with Zelda NX, this is all rumors anyway, and we don't know the portrayal is going to be the same as it was in Hyrule Warriors, so...

57:18.000 --> 57:27.000
But I certainly would like to see a capable, if it's going to happen, I would like to see a capable gender swap.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
Or just the same thing with lady acting.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
I know Nintendo's will down this, because that means they're going to make one more amiibo for this shit.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Oh, that's what it's really about, Lo-fi.

57:39.000 --> 57:47.000
This has nothing to do with representation, this is about, hey, how could we sell a female Link figure and a male Link, this is an extra amiibo figure for yourself.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
What about Link, I mean, what about the color of his skin, I mean, you can have multiple colored Links as well.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
There you go.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
I mean, there is a potential for like 32 amiibos or something for this.

57:55.000 --> 58:09.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, well we don't know yet how they'll handle her if she's in Zelda U, so who knows, maybe she'll be on par with Link.

58:09.000 --> 58:19.000
And why can't we just have the gender of Link be determined, can I have Ganondorf be a different gender, can I have Ganondorf be a sexy woman, is that an option on there?

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
I mean, does he have to be some evil dark elf troll thing?

58:22.000 --> 58:32.000
Who knows, who knows. I believe, do any other genders, like when you pick a femshep versus an mshep, do any other genders of characters change in Mass Effect? I don't think so.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
No.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
No, but your love options change.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Yeah.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Which is a whole other issue, but anyway.

58:37.000 --> 58:49.000
Well, there's some, I'm trying to find the artwork, someone did a very good gender swap Link, not a Linkle, but a gender swap Link, and I'm hoping to find that picture, so I'm going to put it in the chatroom.

58:49.000 --> 59:00.000
Let's see, AkumaJP in chat says, bingo, at Loki, regarding the amiibo thing, and actf says, if they haven't announced a Linkle amiibo, I don't think they'll do it now.

59:00.000 --> 59:06.000
Oh, come on, please, we're not going to do it now. No, they will.

59:06.000 --> 59:13.000
Maybe not for Hyrule Warriors, but for wherever Linkle's next appearance is, perhaps.

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
Alright. Oh, you're pasting a picture in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com? Sounds good.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Alright, it's pasted.

59:23.000 --> 59:31.000
Alright, well let's move on. Let's talk about another game that a lot of people want to know more about, and that is Final Fantasy VII, the remake.

59:31.000 --> 59:38.000
And do you remember the controversy a few months ago when it was revealed that Final Fantasy VII's remake is going to be episodic?

59:38.000 --> 59:46.000
And everybody was like, fuck that shit, because I'm not paying one disc at a time and all this other stuff, right? People were not very happy about that.

59:46.000 --> 59:54.000
But there was some other folks that were thinking, well, wait a minute, with as much as they're going to have to redo in Final Fantasy VII,

59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.000
there's probably going to be a lot more than there was in the PlayStation version versus what will be in the PlayStation 4 version.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And it turns out that is what essentially is being confirmed this week, is that Final Fantasy VII's remake, the episodic strategy, it's not going to necessarily be a one-to-one ratio.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:24.000
In the new issue of Game Informer, each episode is a full-scale game on par with installments of the Final Fantasy XIII sub-series.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Interesting comparison there, and also a controversial one in some ways, because some would say that the Final Fantasy XIII series was unnecessary.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Some would say I would not be one of those people, although I would say XIII-2 was better than Lightning Returns, but that's, you know, whatever.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:53.000
But anyway, so yeah, that's what they're going for, is that yes, it's episodic, but we're talking about like three full games, like Final Fantasy XIII was three full games.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So again, that and the latest Game Informer magazine, who I guess have talked to the folks behind it and have played a little more than the rest of us have there.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So I am still very curious to see what this looks like. I, come on, I practically, I don't want to say I grew up with this game, but this game like defined like my college years.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm going to buy this game pretty much no matter what. So, and maybe that just makes me the sucker, but I have a pretty good feeling that it'll be worth it.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It'll be worth it. Yeah, I think it'll be worth it. We'll give it a chance. We'll see how episode one plays out, and if it ends up being like Sonic 4 episode one, then maybe I just won't get the others.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But I have a pretty good feeling it'll be fine.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I think you go and play the whole Advent Children stuff too. I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Yeah. Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Well, I just had to laugh at this because someone had actually linked me the ad before, but Drumpf, because I refuse to say the idiot's name, the Republican presidential candidate, did, he tweeted a video that has footage and audio of him in the Mass Effect 2 trailer.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Now, his campaign didn't have anything to do with actually making the trailer, but I guess one of his fans did, but EA didn't like it and issued a DMCA takedown.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:41.000
It's funny because some people think that this is an issue of fair use. However, EA's whole thing is that, and I'm going to read the quote,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So I wonder if this is something that's going to be listed as a true fan mashup or a parody, or if it's something that truly does negatively affect the image of the company.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I mean, if that jerk face was associated with anything I did, I wouldn't want his name on it.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:19.000
You know what this really reminds me of, and regardless of how you feel about him, this just reminds me, and you see this all the time, this reminds me of the musicians where the politicians will use their song.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Like, didn't that actually happen with that same candidate? And I think it was Twisted Sister, of all people, who, man, Twisted Sister was awesome.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Born in the USA and Reagan was using it? And told him not to?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
We're not gonna take it, right? And then Twisted Sister was like, please stop, or I'm going to sue you.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So really, it's like the same thing, except now instead of music, it's a video game, which I think says a lot about how far games have come.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Don't make me feel dirty playing Mass Effect 2.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Well, you know, you can't, you know what, some people are gonna make pornography out of Mass Effect 2, and, well, then again.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I'd watch that.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
But maybe it's not the characters you want shipped, Dark Sakura. Maybe it's like, maybe Ashley gets with Garrus.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
No.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Are you gonna let that happen, Dark Sakura?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It should be Garrus the Ride.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
That's what they should call it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Speaking of Garrus the Ride, no really, don't turn off, don't tune out, don't tune out.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Right.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That ride at Great America opens, like, in the next couple months.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I know, I need to go.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I can't believe I'm sitting here on the show saying this. We need to go to Great America.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I know, right? Well, you know, it's the same room that the seventh portal was in, which was literally the last time I'd been to Great America, was when we saw Margaret Cho, and I got flirted with by a cute lesbian in the bathroom.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Oh my god, how many, that was pre-OLR. That was a long time ago.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And I played Planet Harriers. And you saw, you remember how excited I was to find a Planet Harriers?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yes.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And I don't even think it's there anymore, which is sad.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I remember that day very well. I was with one of my exes, the same person I was with when OLR first started, which was a long time ago.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And I wanna say that, I know Jessica was there.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And I remember that was the day when you said, you know, I love Dan, and I don't ever wanna, you know, be apart from Dan.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
But if Dan and I do ever break up, I'm gonna marry Margaret Cho.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
That was like the day you made that decision.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That was the day.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
You put a ring on it that day.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I put a ring on it.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
A backup ring.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
That Margaret Cho would be my backup wife.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Anyway, good times, good times.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I don't know, though. I've got, like, new backup wives.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Kaijito in chat says, is Mass Effect still a thing?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
The week we were off, actually, some gameplay from Andromeda leaked.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Just a little bit, and I think it was like a pre-alpha build, so you probably shouldn't read too much into it.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But I think you'll hear a lot more about Andromeda out of E3 this year.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And I fully expect that it's gonna be one of the games that EA is pushing at their little satellite show.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Since I can't say that they're pushing at E3, because they're not there, but that EA is gonna push at their satellite show.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000
So, yes, I think there is still, I mean, who's to say if the new Mass Effect is gonna be any good or not?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But we're hoping. Here's hoping. Fingers crossed. Toes crossed.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
All right.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
SSJ-100 Matt in chat.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
But would Margaret Cho pull over for coffee in our saga?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
It doesn't matter, because I have Dan, and Dan is wonderful.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And Dan does pull over for coffee.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Dan does pull over for coffee.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
After a lot of reminders.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Dan!

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Dan, I need caffeine!

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Dan!

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I was so angry that day.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
That day?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Oh, girl. Okay.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
So you know how some people get hangry?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Hangry? Oh, that's me.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I get hangry.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I get caffeine angry.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Ask Allen. Ask Allen what happens if I don't go, or if I go without eating for like six hours.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I get caffeine angry.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Caffeine angry.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Hangry. I gotta use that more often.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I'm hangry!

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Oh, goodness.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Let's see.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Bonds006 says, Rob, don't read too much into it.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Hello, Rob. We gamers read far into anything game-related.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And from Lord Gabe.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Oh, that is true.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
You know, today is

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
April 10th.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And April is the fourth month.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And if you take four and you subtract one and then you subtract zero,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
you get three. Half-Life 3 confirmed.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Hmm?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, we definitely need to go to our next story.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Loki.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
So, there's a brand new game being made by the

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
creators of Rust.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
It looks very similar to Minecraft.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Like, a little too similar if you ask me.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But, it is a VR version of, like, a Minecraft type game.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Called Chunks.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And what's kind of cool about it, though,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
is not only can you use, like, the Vive controllers sexually,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
you know, build stuff in there,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
but it has a roller coaster tool as well.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So you can actually, instead of just your typical mine carts and stuff like that,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
you can pretty much just draw your own roller coaster.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Which is awesome.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Because we like, you know, roller coasters in VR.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Roller coasters in VR.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So, it's going to be coming out very soon.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I want to say on the 12th of April.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And they're going to be charging $19.99.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And it's going to be on early access for about two to four months.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Same $4.80.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Steam proper.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
So the game is called Chunks?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Chunks.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I can't hope it has Chunk from the Goonies in it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I'm afraid it does not.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
No truffle shuffle?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
No truffle shuffle.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Fuck this game. No, I'm just kidding.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It sounds awesome.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It looks pretty cool. I mean,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I'd pick it up if I had, you know,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
a computer that could run VR in the Vive,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and all the things that would be essential.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Or if you actually had a Vive.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Because I don't know if you've been following Bobby Blackwolf on Twitter,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
but apparently getting a Vive is a challenge in itself.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Or giving money to the Vive people is not a problem.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Getting that object to actually be delivered to your house

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
is apparently a bit of a challenge.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Well, I understand that. I mean, anything is a challenge with Valve.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I mean, how long we've been trying to get them to make Half-Life 3.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
It's a challenge.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
At least they're not shipping on, you know, Valve time.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Because you'd be fucked.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
They've only sent out three Vives.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And you know what that means.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
They're really far behind from their estimated delivery schedule.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Apparently. Apparently.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Well, let's talk more about Rust,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
because Rust is another game from that same creator.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
And I've got to admit, I've heard a little bit about this game,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
but not a lot. But I know it's one of those open world survival games.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
But I'm hearing that, like,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
you get a lot of people that get really powerful,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and all they do is they pick on the lower people,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and it kind of takes some of the fun out of it,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
is what I'm hearing about this game, Rust.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I don't know. I haven't played it myself.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
That's just my perception based on other people I've talked to.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But I still think the concept sounds really interesting.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So I'm kind of wondering if you can have, like,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
a more closed off world that's just you and your friends,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and you all agree to, like, not be dicks.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I don't know. If any of you guys have played Rust, you need to let me know.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
But I thought this was very interesting about Rust,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
is that earlier we had talked about Rust.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Actually, I don't know if we had talked about it here on the show.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
But I know the news had come up previously that

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
the size of your penis in Rust

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
was directly tied to your Steam ID.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000
In other words, you had no control over the size of your penis in Rust.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I think it should be really connected to your Steam library

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and the amount of games you have.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
That's going to get people to buy more games.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I'm telling you.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
A literal e-penis. A literal e-penis.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Well, but here's the thing now.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Here's the thing, is that although the talk was all about peni,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
previously, here's the thing, now in the latest update,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Rust has also tied gender assignment to your Steam ID.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You will not have a choice if you are male or female.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And I am assuming, if you're going to ask that question about boobs,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
because that's where you're going to go the minute you hear females,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
right DarkSakura?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
She's nodding.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That is probably also determined on your Steam ID.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I'm just going to take a lucky guess.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
You probably do not get to really control any of those factors.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Well, I mean, what about the penis size on them too, though?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I don't know.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I have not played Rust myself to know how that all works yet.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
But this is the interesting thing.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I read the letter from the developer about why they did things the way they did.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And it was very, very, like, I don't want to say it was shady,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
because it definitely wasn't shady, but it was just very much like,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I don't give a flying fuck if you don't like this type of thing

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
in the way that it was described.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I kind of loved it.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I wholeheartedly agree with that opinion.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
That really should be the developer's opinions.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Most developers out there should have that opinion.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Like, when people ask them to make changes to a game,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
just like, I don't give a flying fuck what you want.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I made the game this way.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
But conversely, if the developer wants to go,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I didn't think of that.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I have decided, based on that, I am making the decision to do this,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
then that's fine.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You know what I mean?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But the buck stops with the developer.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Anyway, but here's the thing.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Gary Newman, the developer, actually said,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
we're not taking the choice away from you.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
You never had a choice.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
A man's voice coming out of a woman's body is no more weird

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
than an eight-year-old boy's voice coming out of a man's body.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And then it goes on that the developer's blog,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
oh, I've got to find, there was the best shade in here.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Where is it here in this dev blog?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Sorry, I know this is like terrible radio here.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Let's see.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
We understand this is a sore subject for a lot of people.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
We understand that you may now be a gender

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
that you don't identify with in real life.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
We understand this causes you distress

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and makes you not want to play the game anymore.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Technically, nothing has changed since half the population

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
was already living with those feelings.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And I was like, he does not give a fuck

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
if you do not like this change.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I got to give him props for that.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And that's a brilliant way to put it is that, you know what?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Other people, so it was great.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
It was great.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And, you know, there's plenty of games that we play

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
where they happen to have a female lead like Tomb Raider

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
or Final Fantasy 13 or plenty of games out there,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
but there could stand to be more, but there's plenty.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And it's not like, does that make you not want to play Tomb Raider?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Because you're missing out if you don't want to play Tomb Raider.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So anyway.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It's like all of those, you know, to quote Wil Wheaton,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
the best word ever, whiny man babies who are complaining about Rogue One's lead.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Oh, yeah, that whole thing.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I still haven't watched that trailer. Am I on cool?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I haven't watched it either.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I'm interested in it though, but that's the best description,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
whiny man babies.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Alright.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Moving on.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Well, did you hear about the crap going on with Siege of Dragonspear?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Oh, that's the Baldur's Gate thing, isn't it?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Yeah, it is.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I have a Twitter account. Believe me, I've heard.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Well, to go ahead and tell, you know, explain to people what was happening,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
there was a character named Mizana who is transgender.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And people were just flipping their shit about having a transgender character.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And then some people were going, oh, well, it has to do with the exposition in it

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and that, you know, what NPC is going to give you their life story

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Just going to throw that out there for these people.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
There's probably a transgender character in your life somewhere

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
and you just don't know.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Just saying.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And I'll be honest, I think that it was a little bit shoving it in your face,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
but I am happy there's a transgender character.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I mean, good.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
It's more of one of those things that, and this is, I think, how it should be.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000
If there is a character that is not, you know, cisgendered hetero,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
it should still be, so what?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
That's what people are like.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
It should be accepted as normal.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Go, huh, and moved on.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Because that is equality.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Giving, making a big deal out of it for the sake of making a big deal out of it,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
that is not equality.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
That's just how I feel about it.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
However.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And just to be fair, for the trans people who happen to play this game,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
that probably feels awesome to see, like, a representation in the game.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It does.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
We heard a lot about that yesterday.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I know as a gay guy, when I see a gay romance plot in a video game like Mass Effect,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I'm like, I can't tell you how fucking happy it makes me that you and Kaiden,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
as male Shep, can bang.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
It makes me so happy, like, that that is an option that's available to you.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It's an option.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
O-P-T-I-O-N. Option.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
The thing about it is that, the way it was handled, it is, like, no big deal.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Because it's no big deal.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It's a choice that, I'm not even a choice.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's, it's just how people are.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Yep.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And I like how that was handled.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
You know, but I'm also like that with, you know, women's issues with,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I'll just won't go into that anymore.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So, but anyway, there was a lot of just online harassment going on toward Amber Scott,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.000
who was the writer for, one of the writers for this series.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And, so Trent.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I'm sorry, I'm just going to take a lucky guess and assume that Amber is not being harassed because they didn't write enough on this character.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I'm going to guess that's probably not where the harassment is. Am I right?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Well, Trent Oster, the CEO of Beamdog, the developer, basically went and said that bullying isn't going to work.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And that being abusive isn't going to do anything.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And I'm going to read the quote.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
So, and he said that, you know, he admits that the inclusion could be better.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:05.000
In retrospect, we am reading the article, in retrospect, it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000
This is a lesson that we will be carrying forward in our development as creators, and we will be improving this character in a future update.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Great. So, we talked about just a minute ago, developers should be able to do whatever they want.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And so, the dev says, okay, you know what, you gave us that feedback, and you know what, we're keeping the character the way that they are.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
But, you know, maybe it was a little, like Darcy said, maybe it was a little too like blatant, so we need to develop it better.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So, we're going to give it a better story. Cool.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I'm just going to, I'm just super looking forward to the day where, and I'm not trying to make it sound like it's not an important issue.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But I'm looking forward to the day where it's not an important issue. Does that make sense?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:11.000
When everything is taken in stride, when there is an acceptance to the point that it is just as accepted as a cisgendered hetero couple or person, that we have that same level of acceptance and equality for everybody.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I am anti-censorship. I demand you remove this offensive content from your game. Do not censor me.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It's a little parody there. Alright.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And I hope the way that I said that makes sense.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:35.000
It does. It does. Anyway, let's move on. However, there's much more to talk about. In fact, we got to talk about what is actually going to be on the shelves in the gaming stores near you this week.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So, let's check out release dates, starting with Loki.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Well, on PlayStation 4, we have Ratchet and Clank. So, that's going to be coming out.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Dark Souls 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as PC.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And last but not least, Bravely Second and Lair on 3DS.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I have a feeling that's the one that a lot of people I know are going to be getting.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I still haven't played the demo for Bravely Second. I need to get on that.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So, alright. If that's it, let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out this week in Japan.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
In Japan, on the 14th, we have Republique on the PlayStation 4.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Skullgirls Second Encore also makes its way to the PlayStation 4.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And Divinity Original Sin, excuse me, Enhanced Edition also on the PlayStation 4.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:30.000
On the Wii U, nothing because Star Fox Zero isn't until the 21st, but at least you have that to look forward to.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
On the Vita in the meantime, Skullgirls Second Encore is really the only release on the Vita this week.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It's a slower week on the Vita.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
But on the 3DS, nothing. I'm kind of surprised to see that. There's nothing on the 3DS.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Terraria is the next release on the 3DS in Japan, and that is not until the 21st.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
So, not as busy of a week in Japan, it appears.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Dark Sakura, how about Europe?

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Very few things. We just have Dark Souls 3 on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and that's really about it until the following week.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Alright. We have just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
But first, Loki.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Alright, so this is kind of disappointing.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:27.000
The Studio Gaijin Games, which is, I guess, choice provisions in North America, has closed its San Francisco office.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Over the past few years, the game industry has changed so dramatically that a mid-sized studio operating as we have for the past several years just simply can't continue the same way.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And so, you know, they've unfortunately had to close their office. I didn't really see how many people were affected by that, but that still sucks.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Yeah, I didn't see the number of people either, and that sucks because that's a fun series of games.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
But I guess things have kind of slowed down. Like, I don't know, what was the last bit game they put out?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I know there was Bit.Trip Runner 2, which was on, like, every platform.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And then they had that collection on PlayStation 4, because I know that was a big thing that came out of the PlayStation Expo that they had at the end of last year.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Well, their latest project was a game called Tharsis, and I guess it had some issues with that game, although they're saying that's not why the studio closed.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:35.000
That's too bad. We never like to hear about layoffs in the industry, but hopefully the folks affected will be able to find work somewhere else relatively quickly.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Let's talk about another game. Oh, this is a game that's, like, on my Steam link thing, like, ready to play, and I really want to check this out, because so many people have told me I need to play Life is Strange.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:52.000
And I really do want to get around to that, just, you know, time. But the folks that have played Life is Strange, there's a lot of hardcore fans.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:01.000
In fact, some fans are going so far as to demand a sequel. Oh, by the way, they're not just demanding a sequel. Some fans went and made a Kickstarter for it.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:12.000
That's right, there's a Life is Strange 2 Kickstarter, or was, I'll get to that in a minute. There was a Life is Strange 2 Kickstarter out there with the aim to raise $20,000.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:24.000
This is, I guess, in an attempt to get the developer to notice that the fans are eager for the sequel, and they want to give the studio the funds that are needed for the project.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So, interesting, but it didn't last very long. The Kickstarter was shut down within minutes. No hours, but still, it was, like, not even a day, and the Kickstarter was taken down.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And you can probably imagine why. You can't really raise money for a game that's not yours, but regardless, it sounds like a lot of people want that Life is Strange sequel to happen.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Alright, and DungeonBuster in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, Life is Strange is so good!

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:11.000
AkumaJP, trying to explain why there's not a busy release schedule in Japan this week, saying everybody is still busy with Yokai Watch, oh, I forgot that came out in Japan, and DQM.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So, there you go. Meanwhile, we gotta get busy with a classic video game, Dark Sakura.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Going old school.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Alright, we're gonna go old school. We're gonna step into the gaming vault, where Dark Sakura finds the game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this out this week.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Between your indie games and your randomly generated penis sizes, you need to check this out. This was back in the day when you didn't have any of that online garbage and Kickstarter.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
This is a classic. What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Fantasy Zone The Maze. In Japan, it was just known as Oppa Oppa, which is, of course, the main ship character with cute feet and wings from the Fantasy Zone series.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It was originally an arcade game, and made it onto the Sega Master System as a home console release. Some people like to call it Fantasy Zone 3, but it really is kind of its own different game.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:20.000
While the other Fantasy Zone games are called, quote, cute-em-ups, Fantasy Zone The Maze is a maze puzzler.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So, basically, it's kind of Pac-Man-like, but you collect coins as you go, and you spend them on weapons in different places in the stage.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And then you have to shoot down enemies. And the dot's going to turn red over time, and when it turns red, an enemy will spawn.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
The only way you stop it is by passing through the dot, and then when you do, the process starts over.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And when you finish the stage, you get a certain amount of points at the end, depending on how long it took to complete the level.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
There are also bonus stages where you collect coins in a limited time.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So you play as, um, two ships. Player 1 is the Oppa Oppa, and Player 2 is the Oppa Oppa.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So, um...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
But Player 3 is the Oompa Loompa.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
No.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:16.000
The Sega Master System port and the original arcade version were in the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection for PS2.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Um, there's not really much else to say about that one. It's cute, it's novel, and it's Fantasy Zone, which means that makes it automatically a winner to me.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
That's it. It came out in 1987. You're welcome.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
So, that's it.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:41.000
There it is. Fantasy Zone. The maze. It's Pac-Man-esque, but that would be way oversimplifying it. There's obviously more going on here.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Oppa Oppa.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And, uh, actually in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says, I recognize this song. It's on Taiko no Tatujin Vita!

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Um, also, wasn't that just kind of a remix?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Well, it's just the remix of the Oppa Oppa music.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Yeah, which is...

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Ah, guys, yeah. The main theme, right?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Yep.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
A little remix there.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Uh, alright, so, uh, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, we've got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news tonight.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Uh, some news on a Mega Man cartoon. One of Dark Soccer's favorite websites closing their doors. That's kind of sad, so we'll talk about that in the next segment.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I am pissed.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And then we're gonna talk about, uh, your calls as well. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Uh, we're gonna take a quick break. We'll be right back after this with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio. Live toni- Excuse me. Boy, coughs suck when you're doing live radio. Sorry about that.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Uh, we are live tonight with episode number 637 of our show for this April the 10th of 2016. Our show already in progress.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Back after the awesome Sack Indie Arcade event yesterday. Looking forward to hopefully attending more events, um, throughout the year.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Uh, I can mention that, uh, Dark Soccer and I, at least, we will certainly be back at GamerX this year.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Um, that has all been filed away and taken care of, so at least there's that.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Um, I'm- I know Bobby Blackwolf, myself, and I'm sure plenty of other people from VOG Network. I just don't know all who yet.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
We'll also be in attendance at DragonCon, for those of you in the Atlanta area or really anywhere in the south.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Uh, cause everybody converges on Atlanta, uh, over Labor Day weekends, there's that as well.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Hopefully some more, uh, cons and things of that nature as well, um, to look forward.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I know there's one- another one that I'm gonna try and work on, uh, so we'll talk hopefully about that in the future.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:46.000
But anyway, for now, we want to get back into some gaming news. We're gonna do some rapid fire news, starting with Loki.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Alright, so this is kind of a cool story, um, apparently this guy, uh, Peter Bryan reached out to Sony because he had problems with his DualShock 4 due to, um, his illness.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.000
He has cerebral palsy, and because of that he had some issues when he would hit the touchpad, um, with his hand.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It's very sensitive, it would pause the game. So, Sony actually, um, created a custom controller that had, like, some tweaks to it.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Including dis- uh, dislabeling the touchpad and adding a new button to act as a touchpad.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I think that's pretty awesome that they went that far to take care of him. So, bravo Sony.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Um, if you actually played some of the Minecraft story mode, um, you'll be happy to know that the skins from the characters from that series, uh, from Telltale are actually available for free, temporarily.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:52.000
So if you have the Pocket Edition of Minecraft, uh, for iOS or Google Play, or Windows Phone, or the Windows 10 Beta for those.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Or the Console Editions for Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, it is free for the first week. After that it's $3.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I did not see Wii U on there, so I'm not sure why they don't get the free version of that, so, that's kind of lame.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Because that's what my son plays it on. But hey, I'll download it for free. Because it's free. I like free.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Finally, uh, Bethesda, they have some more, um, details on their E3 2016 showcase. It's going to be on June 12th.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And on top of that they're going to have some, uh, extra things that are going to be part of that. Including a band that will be taking the stage at 9.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And then they're also going to have, uh, some other, some announcements and they're going to be showing, you know, um, some more stuff for Fallout 4 and, I don't know.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:03.000
But, uh, yeah. And then I guess they're saying that the stream will be starting at 6.15 Pacific Time.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So much for OLR. Thanks Bethesda. Appreciate that. It's alright. E3 week always tends to ruin everything.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:25.000
But we'll, we'll figure something out. I have some clever ideas for how we might accommodate this unfortunate situation. So stay tuned. That's all I have to say.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I'm just saying, I mean, I'm actually pretty excited because this week also, one of the things I forgot to mention, is this week they also do have the, um, the next piece of DLC that's coming out for Fallout 4.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And I'm pretty excited about that because the last piece wasn't that bad. This one you can add more stuff for, um, you know, building your settlements and everything. You can create traps.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:52.000
You know that's all Alan, like, plays these days, right? He's played so much. I think he finally beat it, but he said there's still a bunch of side stuff he has to do.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Oh god, yeah. Because it's, you know, like Skyrim. I mean, I've been playing more of the story, you know, actual storyline in the game because I was doing all the side stuff.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I just kind of want to finish it. And I was going to start a new gameplay, or playthrough, but they've gotten rid of all my exploits and I'm not too happy about that.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Maybe when the mods come out and they can cheat again. Because that's half the fun. I mean, you spend all this time building yourself up, you know, I don't want to have to play through the whole thing again, grind for all that stuff. You know, that's not fun.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Well, let's move on and talk about Quantum Break on PC. You know, when I was doing my review earlier, I was talking about Quantum Break on the Xbox One, but I made an illusion of the fact that, you know, because some people said,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Well, Rob, when you say it's an exclusive, it's also on the PC. And I said, yeah, well, because there's some news this week that the Windows 10 version, it's a little rough. Apparently it has some frame rate issues. There's no quit game button.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
That's ridiculous.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:01.000
You know what it reminds me of? Do you remember when Final Fantasy 13 first came out for the PC? This really reminds me of a lot of the same complaints.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
No, it's the fact that it doesn't have a quit button. Is that because, like, Windows 10 apps, you kind of drag and dump to the bottom of the screen?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I have no idea why it does not have a quit game button. But, yeah, apparently Nvidia hardware will also crash the game often.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:24.000
The game will not run 60 frames a second on a 60 hertz monitor, even using an Nvidia Titan X. A frame rate matching the refresh rate on a user's monitor isn't possible.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Yeah, so, you might want to think about that before getting Quantum Break. This is probably just part of the growing pains with DirectX 12 API.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000
A lot of people also blaming with the Universal Windows platform, saying this is a disaster for UWP and it's already dead.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
It's like games for Windows Live all over again.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
History is repeating itself a little bit. Well, we'll see.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Hey, Loki was talking about Bethesda a minute ago. How about Doom? Doom is out in five weeks. Did you know that? The new Doom.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Obviously, if you want to go play classic Doom, go have a ball. But, new Doom is out in five weeks.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And, already, $45 worth of post-launch content is planned for Doom, because that's the day and age that we live in.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:16.000
But, you can get a deal for 40 bucks. You can get a season pass. How about that? So, a little money off that.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Or, you can wait a year and play $40 for the whole thing.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Game of the Year edition. That's right. Or, even by the holiday on a Steam sale. You can probably get the Game of the Year edition.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Three premium multiplayer packs are planned for the months following launch.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:41.000
The first one is scheduled for summer. It will have three new maps, one weapon, one playable demon, one armor set, a piece of equipment, new hack modules and taunts, customization colors and patterns.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So, this is for multiplayer online?

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Yeah. So, if you don't have it, you don't get to use it. I'm assuming you'll see other people with those taunts and things, but, hmm.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Anyhow, yeah, $40 for the season pass if you want that.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Moving on, how about a story about Hideo Kojima? Because, you know, even though Kojima hasn't really done anything in a little bit since, you know, Metal Gear Solid 5 has been done and out there, and we all know what happened with P.T.,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.000
it doesn't mean we don't stop showering love on the man who was done so wrong by Konami.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Hideo Kojima is going to be hosting a keynote presentation at the Develop Conference in Brighton, that's in the UK, and that will be later this year.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Joined by Mark Cerny from Sony, they're going to present a session called Industry Legends Discuss the Future, a conversation with Hideo Kojima.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:41.000
That will be on July 13th, and Kojima getting an award, the 2016 Industry Legendary Award.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Well, they're letting him accept it now because he's not with Konami.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yeah, he's allowed to make appearances at award shows now. So, congrats for Kojima.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Moving on, Dar Sakura.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Well, there is not going to be any more Rock Band 4, at least on PC. The crowdfunding campaign failed to meet its goal. It made only barely above 50%, so no, sorry.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Well, to be fair, they may find another way outside crowdfunding, but I still say there's a lot they need to conquer on consoles first, but we'll see.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Well, this face here, this is the bitch face of not caring. It's resting right now.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I'm kind of with you. Like, I just, I can't care about Rock Band 4 PC when I still feel, still feel like the Rock Band 4 we have on console is not what we were promised, but anyway.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Anyway, though this is better news, so guess what? We have new DDR! DDR ACE, and it's coming to Dave and Buster's. Some Dave and Buster's locations.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:04.000
It's also going to be definitely running with the E-Amusement Network, and we don't know if they're going to be selling the passes or not, but hey, if they do, that will be awesome.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So it will be out Summer 2016. And then, David Hayter, speaking of being slightly bitter with Kojima and Konami.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So, he re-voiced Snake for a Ford commercial. This was part of this overdub video series, and this one is for the Ford Fusion SE.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And then, um, yeah. Sad. Why can't we have him back? He did have some kind of nasty things to say about Kojima.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Yeah, unfortunately, it was a messy divorce, unfortunately, but hopefully they can both find long, happy lives together just separately.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Alright, um, this is the part of the show where I would usually do the Foogle Question of the Week.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.000
But I failed in asking a question, so we actually did not have a question posted to our Facebook and Google Plus communities this week. I apologize, that's on me.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Just because, again, I can't stress how busy I've been this weekend between the Sac Indie event yesterday. I actually went to a wedding this morning, and I certainly don't regret that whatsoever.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:40.000
It was a beautiful wedding, and the cool thing about the wedding, I will say this, because this is the question I was thinking of doing. I was intending to ask this question, but then I had to turn around to show roll in like 45 minutes.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:52.000
But, the question I was going to ask, my friends got married today, and they had a Star Wars themed wedding. And it was super fucking nerdy, and I mean that in the best possible way.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So congratulations, Amanda and Dan, even though I don't think you guys listen to the show, but your pals that I met you through probably do, because they are the hosts of GameBui.org, so I got to see them today for a little bit.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:15.000
But I digress. So I went to a Star Wars themed wedding, and it was super cute. All the people in the wedding party had lightsabers, and they played the Star Wars music, and they encouraged people to dress up, and da da da.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:21.000
So I was going to ask, because it also kind of made me think the Blu-ray was released this week as well for the new movie.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Our coffee arrived today.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Yeah. And I was worried. I asked this question already back in December, but I guess I didn't. I went back and looked at December's questions, but I didn't.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Because I would have thought I would have asked this when the movie came out, but I think we had an interview around the same week, so I didn't ask about it.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But I was going to ask, what is your favorite Star Wars video game? Because there's been a lot of Star Wars in video games. There's been a lot of really good Star Wars video games, and there's been other Star Wars video games.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:40:02.000
But my question is, what is a favorite Star Wars moment in video games? So although I apologize to our Facebook and Google communities, maybe I can read at least a couple quick answers from chat if people want to let me know a favorite moment or game from Star Wars video games.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000
What about you guys here in studio? Sorry to spring this on you, but y'all are creative. DarkSagra?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I really liked the old school Star Wars arcade. I mean, I liked the newer one that they did in the early 2000s. I thought that one was pretty fun.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:26.000
But I have to say though, one that came out not too long ago were the battle pods. And yeah, while those games usually make me motion sick, I have to say it was really fun.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:37.000
So I would also like to give a big fuck you to all of the Super Star Wars, Super Empire Strikes Back, and Super Return of the Jedi for being hard as balls.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Those games are assholes.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
They're assholes.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
But they're awesome games.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Oh yeah, they're great, but they're hard as fuck. But I love the debug code, and you can just like speed through the level and see all the stuff that's funny.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I'll piggyback on that since I was also going to say the original OG Star Wars arcade game, the vector graphics.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I remember playing that shit when I was like seven years old in the sit-down cabinets at the Tilt Arcade at Sunrise Mall, which, shit, that hasn't been open since the mid-80s just to date myself a little bit.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
But that game was the shit.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And when I go to California Extreme, which I think I'll actually get to go to this year finally. I haven't been in like five years. I'm so excited.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
But when I go to California Extreme, I get so excited when I see that cabinet.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And the Empire Strikes Back too, but there's something very special about the original OG vector Star Wars game.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Which, by the way, some folks in chat are agreeing with that same answer.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Over in chat, over at live.vognetware.com, Dark Tetsuya says,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Gotta go with the Atari vector Star Wars game, arcade game too.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Brad from Pod Culture, our buddy over there on Monday nights, says,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Hands down the original arcade game.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, Star Wars Galaxies spent way, way too much time in there right when it launched.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I think sometimes we forget, Star Wars has lent itself very well to a couple of large MMOs.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Some other people play The Old Republic as well. That's still going on.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Loki, what about you? I don't want to forget you. Star Wars game that you love?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I didn't really play that many of them.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
The one that I love talking about connects Star Wars.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Because what the fuck were they thinking with that stupid dancing game?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I mean, come on. That is just fucking stupid.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
But, yeah, I don't know. I didn't really play that many Star Wars games.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I played some of the Super Nintendo ones, and I don't know.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Do you want to hear about what an old grandpa gamer I am?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
We were somewhere. Where were we? We were at a club or something. I don't remember what it was.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Oh, I think this was when we were in Tucson, actually, because I think my friends were there to overhear my old-ass grandpa gamer moment.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And this song came on, and I'm like, why are they playing this? Why are we at a place that's playing this?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000
They're playing the Han Solo song from Star Wars Connect, the I'm Han Solo, like that whole song.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And my friends are like, no, Rob, no, no. This is the original song. That was a parody of another song.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:05.000
And this is the real song, Rob. I'm like, I have become that old man that's like,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I don't watch MTV. It's nothing but noise.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And apparently two new clips from Suicide Squad and Captain America Civil War.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Oh, boy.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Speaking of which, finally caught myself up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Did you? I'm still behind.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Yeah, I watched all the movies I missed.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I still want to see Superman versus Batman. I don't want to hear it. Look, I fully expect it's probably going to be bad.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.000
But I sat through Batman and Robin. I can fucking tolerate a bad Batman movie.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I can do it this way. It could have been a whole lot worse.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Yeah.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
It could have been a Joel Schumacher movie.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Right.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Can you imagine a Joel Schumacher Batman versus Superman?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Fuck off.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh, man, that'd be amazing.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Kaijuto in chat says, best Star Wars game was Jedi Academy, hands down.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Alan Alchemy agreeing. I really love Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Dungeon Buster saying Dark Forces 2 is also up there. Huge love for TIE Fighter.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Bob Coffey says rogue leader on GameCube.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000
S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, I was a big fan of the Jedi Knight series, mostly Jedi Outcast.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Act F says, Star Wars Battlefront 2.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
So a variety of answers there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Sorry I didn't get all the answers there, but there's a lot of chat going on.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
So, great. Thank you.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
So thank you for filling in for my lack of asking the question on FUGL.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But in the future, our Facebook and Google Plus communities will have a question every week.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Don't forget to answer it.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Honestly, you know, I haven't played them yet, but I thought about purchasing them.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Probably the Lego Star Wars games would be pretty good as well.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Those are pretty good.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Yeah, I've heard pretty good things about those. I'm not seeing a lot of that in chat, but...

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
That and the Force Unleashed, those games look kind of interesting.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
But I never got around to playing those.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
All right. Well, let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
All right. Let's see.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
So, I don't know how excited I am about this.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
But apparently, and I swear I didn't know they were even considering making this, but...

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Hey, you know, we haven't gotten a new Mega Man game in a while.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
But hey, let's make a cartoon series for it.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Why not?

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
So that's what they're going to do.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
They're making a new Mega Man cartoon.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Apparently it was announced last year.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And it's being done with the creators of the Ben 10 cartoon.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And it's supposed to be coming out in 2017.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000
To coincide with the 30th anniversary of Mega Man.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Please don't suck.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
And can we get a new Mega Man game that doesn't suck?

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Yeah, I was going to say.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
You know what would be awesome for the 30th anniversary of Mega Man?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
A fucking game. That would be great.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Don't get me wrong. Anime has the potential to be cool.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
You know, there's a lot of awesome tie-in anime out there.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
But a game would be the bee's knees.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
But with that.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Bee Man.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Just because something gets a series and then they go to make a game based off that series

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
doesn't mean it's going to be a good thing.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Especially off of an existing IP that people loved.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Like Sonic Boom.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
And it just like was fucking stupid.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Please don't give Mega Man more friends.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
He doesn't need more friends.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000
He needs more robots that have weird names associated with, I don't know, some gimmick that they have.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
That he can absorb their powers from.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
And that's it. That's really all you need.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Dartitsuyu in chat says, isn't there a Bee Man in one of the recent games, 9 or 10?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Actually now you say.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Like after the words left my mouth, I'm like, actually I seem to remember like a honeycomb level.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I would totally take though an Elmer Fudd Dr. Light again.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Because I'm going to kill Dr. Wiby.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I mean, it was so terrible.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Thank you, McManic.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Hey, did you guys play that Legend of Zelda browser game that was out for a hot minute?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I did.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
You could play it in a browser, but it was like a 3D Legend of Zelda.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Dan played the crap out of that.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Yeah, not like Oculus Rift 3D, but like 3D pixel style Legend of Zelda.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And yeah, it was up and you could play it in a browser and guess what happened?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:31.000
These things tend to do, we all know the punchline, Nintendo shut it down.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Although, you know, the creators took it in good spirit.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
You know, they said, they said their quote, Nintendo has every right to protect their IP.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And they knew this result could potentially happen.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
So they have no complaints and they even made some friends along the way.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
So maybe some folks noticed what they did and might want to use, not saying it was necessarily Nintendo,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
but anybody out there could have seen what they did and maybe want to put their skills to use somewhere else.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And to which after, you know, seeing all that, they're like, what's on the internet?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
It's always on the fucking internet, bitches.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And that is also true. Once on the internet, always on the internet.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Because you know, there's that person who found it even faster than Nintendo that saw it and said,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
you know, I bet Nintendo is going to take this down.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Right click, save as.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
See you indeed. Bye-bye.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Yeah. So somebody's got a copy of it somewhere.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Well, this is what makes me mad and sad and other negative things that end in ad.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Game politics is one of my absolute favorite sites.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I get probably the majority of my news from it.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It goes into a lot of the video game stuff that I really look more into, which is the social, legal, ethical side of gaming culture.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I mean, pretty much.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:56.000
These are all the things that affect life other than this game's crappy, this game's good, you know.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
So they are closing.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
And this is, this is the personal insult.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Not personal, but still, I'm taking it that way.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
It's going down the day before my birthday.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Well, they're going to stop doing updates on April 18th.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And the contents will still be up for a while before it is taken down for good.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And the ECA, the Entertainment Consumers Association that owns the domain and the brand, this is their decision.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:36.000
So if you want game politics to not die, if you want to see this stay alive, everyone should write in.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Well, Jamie, at least they didn't do it on your birthday.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Girl.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:48.000
What do you, Bobby talked about this at length on his show tonight, and he pointed out that game politics changed hands a few years ago.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:57.000
The guy that started it, and I remember the individual that started game politics was actually very prolific on the emerging podcast scene.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Because I don't know if we ended up in an article.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Like, I feel like in the early days of game politics, like we were quoted, like one of our shows was in an article or something.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Don't you remember that?

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I feel like something happened along the, it was a long fucking time ago, okay?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
But I, or he emailed us or something, I don't know.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
But anyway, the guy who started it is not the same guy who's been doing it.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Like that, it changed hands quite some time ago, but that didn't bother you, Dark Soccer.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:30.000
You were still, you weren't necessarily about who was behind it, but you were about like, this is the angle of the news and this is why.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know, I think that we need stuff like this out there instead of just the more flashy stuff, does that make sense?

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Yeah.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:58.000
You know, like the drama of, you know, whatever Sony's doing right now, or, you know, this game has too much boob in it or something.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I think we need to see what goes on a little bit behind the scenes and the effect that games being such a big part of society now have as an effect in society.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:18.000
We need to have exposure to this stuff because, you know, especially for adult gamers, this is what affects our day to day life.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:39.000
What about the argument, just not that I necessarily agree with this, but just devil's advocate, what about the argument that Jack Voldemort's been disbarred, Leelanese in jail, the Brown vs. ESA, the Schwarzenegger ESA thing got thrown out of court, or sorry, it got, you know, Scalia actually was the one that wrote the report on that, that shut that one down.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000
What about the argument that we don't need it anymore because games are no longer the underdog that they were?

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Except that I don't think that's quite the situation.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Is that I think that we do still have, maybe not necessarily the underdog angle, but there's still plenty of things that go on.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000
You know, for example, the whole, you know, bean dog thing with Baldur's Gate.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:13.000
You know, clearly we do have still instances of harassment and social issues that need to be addressed.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:18.000
I think it goes far beyond the, oh, video games are evil.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:29.000
It goes into more of, I guess, more of an everyday angle, things that are going to have to reflect on the state of the world.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Like the other one about there about the Congressman Duncan Hunter, who...

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Oh, yo, I didn't even put that on the show tonight, but, oh my God, Alan and I were talking about this in the car and having a laugh about it.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Because what, isn't he the big vaping Congressman that actually, what, he blamed his kid for $1,300 worth of Steam games in the library and all this stuff?

01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:01.000
The 68 Steam transactions were put as, quote, personal expense to be paid back.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Yeah, the House Ethics Committee smacked him. He's under an investigation by the FEC right now.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:17.000
So, but I mean, would you have known that? Would most gamers know that? Just reading EGM.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
EGM came back, right?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Would they know this reading Game Pro or Nintendo Power?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
They may have learned it on Twitter.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Pro tip, study.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Depending on who they follow. But anyway, no, I get your point because from, and the way I really feel, as much as, you know, I have to play devil's advocate on the show sometimes.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:43.000
The way I really feel is that, okay, well, these things may not be an issue now, but it seems like whenever something goes wrong in society, video games will ultimately get blamed.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.000
So the next time there's a shooting or something, we're going to be right back to where we were, blame the games. It always happens.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Well, I mean, and like, just to go over some of the important things. I mean, the issues that were brought up just in the very first page.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:03.000
We have the Dragon Spear thing. We've got the Steam games that we just mentioned.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:09.000
There's also IGDA criticizing Nintendo for firing Allison Rapp.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:18.000
There's another one. There was the DMCA takedown of, you know, the Mass Effect Trump thing.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Lots of other stuff on here. I mean, that's just the first page and it's already a handful of really important information.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Things that are affecting, you know, everyday things, things that are, you know, speaking about not just the legal side of things, but how, and I'm not going to say ethics and reporting, but I'm going to say just general ethics in relation to how they apply to gaming and the gaming industry and the way people behave.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
So it's lots of.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Well, Jamie, is it time to maybe start game politics to Electric Boogaloo led by Dark Sakura?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Is that, is that what, is that what America needs?

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
You know what?

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
What?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I just think that if I did my own version of, uh, and you know what I'm talking about?

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Okay. If you have no idea what Dark Sakura is talking about, and I'm sure most of our audience probably doesn't give a shit, but I need you to try.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Go to YouTube. I need you to try. For Rob Roberts, I need you to try and embrace drag queens for a minute.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:36.000
You need to go to YouTube and look up Katya and Trixie Mattel because they do a web series called, and I laughed so hard on the last episode.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I may have piddled.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I love it.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000
I have to explain Dark Sakura's in-jokes because it's just not fair otherwise.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
So there you go. It's just referencing drag queens, everybody.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I know. And well, Dan blames you.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Good.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Good.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Good.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
You're coming over tomorrow to see who's eliminated, right?

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Because I have it all on my Apple TV now.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yes, I have. I have a season pass for season eight of RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:14.000
So anyway, if I did my own version of, uh, it would basically just be me bitching about people's behavior in video games in the industry.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:22.000
How, I mean, I would have to dedicate like a part of the shit that I want to talk about to just how all of this relates to everyday life.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:30.000
And then, you know, probably stuff about cosplay and bitches and, you know, and people that I don't like, I guess.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, why is it always going to come back to RuPaul's Drag Race?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I swear this is like the third week in a row.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I don't see a problem anywhere.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:46.000
You know why it has to keep coming back to Drag Race and why we're doing it because of you, really.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Because we know that you're going to bitch about it.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Yes. Dark Tetsuya, I'm actually just specifically for you, knowing that you are going to make that comment.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
That is why we're going to mention Drag Race next week as well.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And probably the week after that.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And you know what?

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And when I do it, I'm going to say, everybody take a shot in Dark Tetsuya's honor.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
You know what, Dark Tetsuya?

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Dark Tetsuya, I'll tell you when we're going to do it.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
When we're going to leave off discussing it for one whole episode is when we get you in drag.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And I mean, shave the brows, shave the pits, get some padding, and we're going to Sephora.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000
That is when we will go an entire episode of not talking about it.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
When we get you in drag.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
William Murderface in chat says, Dark Tetsuya, you better sashay away now.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Look, we're picking on the guy who supported us for like 14 years, so come on.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
So we're allowed.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Yeah, we're allowed.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, Sky is narrowcasting at Dark Tetsuya.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Look, anybody who spent 14 years with this show, I'm going to narrowcast once in a while.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
He just says, I can't.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I hope that's a can't even and not a traumatized I can't.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
You're learning from this.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
If you have learned the ability to can't, then you are getting somewhere.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
All right, no.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
It says that I dept.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
We can't have RuPaul's Drag Radio because Rob already has reading as fundamental.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
And who knows, maybe I will do my own version of...

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:21.000
All right, Loki, save us from this whirlpool, this pit of despair of Drag Race talk with another game story, Loki.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Yeah, let's talk about more rumors.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Woo.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Yay.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
It's another NX rumor.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
The only thing better.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And this is coming from a verified Reddit user.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
That's right.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
They've been verified as to what...

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I don't know, but apparently here is the rumors that they have.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
They have sources, trusted sources that have been verified.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
So, it's supposed to be x86 architecture.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
They're going to have some way to back up your data to Nintendo's servers,

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
like some sort of cloud saves or something.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Support for additional screens.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
It can handle ports of current gen games.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.000
And we'll be able to interact with smartphone apps or smart device apps.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And also using NX software will unlock my Nintendo reward points.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So, yeah.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
And looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Actf says, I trust the verified user, actually.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
The moderator in the NX subreddit also runs the Amiibo subreddit.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
SJ100Matt says, verified Reddit user is like a credible post on Neogaf.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
You know what?

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Here's the thing.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
As much as we make fun of rumors, some are going to be true and some aren't.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
That's what rumors are.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I think a whole shit ton, a lot of us,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:48.000
fell for the whole mock-up of the controller thingy thing.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Okay, so we've all seen rumors gone wrong.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
So if we're going to be a little skeptical of everything,

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I think you all can understand why.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Right?

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Are they rumors or trimmers?

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
And it doesn't really tell me anything about this.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
About, like, what this device does.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Who gives a shit if I can unlock my Nintendo reward points?

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
If I don't want to buy this system, that's going to be completely irrelevant.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
What exactly is this system?

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
But I guess we'll find out.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Yeah, thank God.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Thank God.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Two more months and we'll have these fucking answers

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
and no more of these goddamn NX rumors.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And I hope it's not like,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Huh. Okay.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
That's different.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Dark Sakura, as far as this NX rumor goes,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
are you going to toot it or boot it?

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
I don't know.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
How much glitter is it wearing and does it have ankle straps?

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Alright, moving on.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Let's talk about e-gaming.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
And, you know, there's a lot of e-games.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
There's a bunch of, like,

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Heroes of the Storm stuff going on this weekend.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I see a ton of stuff on my feed.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I know. I've had friends that are there.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Aren't they doing stuff on ESPN2 again?

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Yeah, they are.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Well, get this.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.000
The British government is talking about an e-sports version of the Olympics.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000
The British government announced the very first e-games.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
And, by the way, this is coming from the International Business Times,

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
which is a UK press source.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
The British government has announced that the very first e-games

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
will be taking place every four years

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
and will act as the e-sports equivalent of the Olympic games

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
and take place in the host countries of every Olympiad.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
So, meaning, this year will be in Rio de Janeiro,

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
which is where the Olympics are going to be, if you were not aware.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
E-games is a non-profit organization.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
There will be no prize money.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
But, like the Olympics, it will use national pride and competition

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
to generate interest and draw in competitors.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
And they're actually going to get the help of the International Olympic Committee.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
So, although games are not becoming part of the Olympics,

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.000
games are now potentially running side-by-side-ish with the Olympics.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
This is kind of a big fucking deal.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Like, I had to look at it.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I'm like, am I being punked right now?

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Like, is this for real?

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Because this is kind of a big deal.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000
So far, Brazil, Britain, the USA, and Canada have signed up for this.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
They will have their own e-teams.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Each nation will be advised by the Olympic Committee

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:17.000
and the UKIE, the UK's video game trade body, to oversee the e-teams.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So, this is a huge step, I think.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
It will be very interesting to see what comes of it this year.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000
I imagine it's not going to be as prolific and as out there as the Olympics,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
but perhaps if you are running in the same circles now

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
that sees a lot of talk about Heroes of the Storm this weekend

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
on Facebook and Twitter and stuff with the competition that's going on now,

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000
perhaps you are going to see a lot about this come summer or fall

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
or whenever they decide to do that.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I can't imagine they're going to do it at the same time as the Olympics.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
That's just asking for trouble, but maybe a couple months after or what have you.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000
So, I think it's very exciting.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
We will see.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I would love to go to one of these competitions.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Rio de Janeiro may be a little far for me, but where are they hosting?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Have they announced for 2020?

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Isn't 2020 in Tokyo?

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Am I crazy?

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Where is 2020 in Japan?

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Tokyo is in Japan, Rob.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I know that, but the Olympics.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Aren't the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo?

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Hold on, I'll find out.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Okay.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Somebody in chat will probably find it faster than a Wikipedia.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Yep, 2020 is in Tokyo.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
There's actdeft.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Now, that would be a lot of fun.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Akuma JP, make room on your couch in 2020.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
All right.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Let's get to the mailbag.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Every week we read your emails, which you guys send to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.000
And we will open up the mailbag and find that there are no emails this week.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Well, I will say this.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
There was an anonymous email that was sent that had a bunch of stuff that was like, read me, read me, read me.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
And with all my running around ragged this weekend and not get around to actually reading it yet.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
And it also said, don't read this on air.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
So, I won't.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:07.000
But I'm just going to acknowledge I saw it and I'm ready to move on.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I am just ready to move on.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
But you can send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Yeah.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000
But I will, I will give the benefit of the doubt and all that stuff.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I'm just saying.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
There were very good points made in it.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And I would actually like to have a discussion with that individual just to discuss.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
So don't, so don't be anonymous.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
We're not going to bite your head off.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
We want to know who you are.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
We're not going to bite your head off because you have a different opinion.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
And we're glad that you've listened to us for as long as you have.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I have a feeling it's somebody who already participates with the show.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Okay.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Just, I don't know, it's a wild fucking guess.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000
But if someone says that they want to, you know, not have their name right on air, that's fine.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yeah.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
We're good with that.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:50.000
We're nice people, contrary to what you've read on Twitter or wherever.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Dark Sakura is like, eh.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
All right.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
So you guys have to send us some more emails for next week.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:32.000
A few to the headache returning and not going away until like now.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
So, yeah, headaches the worst.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So, Loki.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:50.000
FU2, whatever chess cold thing I have right now that's annoying because it's just like uncontrollable coughing and hard to breathe.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
And I got to go to the doctor probably eventually.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000
But I don't know.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I don't know what it is.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I hope it ain't contagious.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
I don't think so.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
But I also hope you're okay.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
None of my kids got it.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
So usually that's, you know.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
That's a good sign.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
My FU of the week goes to my back.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.000
When I was, God, here I go, grandpa gamer again.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:15.000
But when I was moving, you know, I had to move the OLR computer and all that stuff out of here myself yesterday.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Which is fine.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I'm not, you know, being a baby.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
But I packed the sound board and the monitor in one of the suitcases.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
And I guess I just picked it up wrong.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I wasn't using my knees enough or something.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I hurt my back.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
And it hurt so bad yesterday.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
But I had to push through for the event, right?

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Because I didn't get time to get my show face on.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.000
So, by the time last night rolled around, I was invited to go somewhere else last night.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
And it was just like, I can't.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Because I just have to lie here and feel sorry for myself.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I need to lie here and feel like hot garbage for a while.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Is that the line?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Is that the character in Undertale?

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
He needs to lie there and feel like hot garbage.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
That was me last night.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
And my back.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
So FU to my back.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Alright.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Moving on.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
We just have a couple more stories for you guys.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Thank you, ActDeaf.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
It's Napstablook.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Because he naps.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Napstablook.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Alright.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Loki.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
So, this is kind of a neat little thing that's been found.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
So PunchOut.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Apparently the original PunchOut, or Mike Tyson's PunchOut.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
It's been out for 29 years.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000
And apparently a Reddit user, Midwestern Housewives.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
That's the name.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Discovered a little cue that's in the background.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:45.000
A visual cue that tells you on when to be able to punch certain fighters in the game to knock them out.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000
And so, apparently there's this guy that's kind of like bearded in the background.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:54.000
If you see him duck, that's the exact moment that you're supposed to punch them.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
And then they'll be knocked out with one punch.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
And I guess no one has ever noticed that until this time.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
It's kind of like an Easter egg.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I thought that you could one-hit.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I remember being able to one-hit punch KnockOut Pissed Honda.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Well, yeah.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Yeah, you can do that.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:19.000
But the thing is, to know when you're supposed to do that, that cue happens before he goes in to do whatever he has to do in order to do that.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I just remember as a kid, you look for the move he does, and you just kind of pray that you hit it at the right time.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Right, yeah. So before he does that move, that guy ducks in the crowd, and that's when you know it's done.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Yeah, I saw the video where you could actually see, because it was an 8-bit game.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000
So when we say, the guy ducks, it changes from one sprite to another, basically.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
It's not the most fluid animation.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
But yeah, it's still neat to find.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I mean, all this stuff aside, it's still neat to discover tricks and tips from a game that is so old, you know what I mean?

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Exactly.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000
ActDef says, didn't this cue be discovered by speedrunners already?

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
DarkTetsuya says, this was neat. You really have to work for that.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Well, lastly tonight in our main news, I want to talk about Mario Maker.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Because a few weeks ago, there was talk that Mario Maker was mysteriously deleting levels.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:30.000
And apparently, on the support page of Nintendo, there's now a bit of an explanation as to why levels are disappearing.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And the explanation goes like this.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
We sometimes have to delete courses from Course World.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Below are cases where courses can be removed from the server.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And believe it or not, they do list low stars and plays.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:49.000
After a fixed period of time, courses with low stars and plays will be automatically deleted from the server.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
They don't say how many, they don't say what the threshold is, they just say low.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Which I'm assuming is sort of a CYA thing where they can just delete whatever and say, oh, it was low.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:05.000
But I just, I still, I don't want to beat a dead horse because we talked about this already a month ago.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I'm not sure I understand when you have the power of the internet and a vast space where you can put all the Mario levels your heart desires in the cloud.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
It's up in the cloud.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I don't understand why you need to delete something just because it's low.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Maybe if it's like, literally nobody has played it but the user that created it, maybe I could see that.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
But since they won't tell me what the threshold is, I don't know what to do.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Well, whose fault is that? That only the creators played it because you have no goddamn way to share levels easily aside from that stupid code.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Oh, but you can go on the website and you put in a code on the website and add it to your queue and you go to the queue on Mario Maker and then you can look in the queue for the level you want to play and then play that level.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
So fucking stupid.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
It makes no goddamn sense.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Please, my god, it is the year 2016. Can you fucking do internet already?

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I mean, seriously, we have another console coming out possibly later this year or next year.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Fix that shit right the fuck now.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:18.000
I'm just gonna put that on a shirt. Can you fucking do internet already, Loki?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Comcast, too.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Can I put that as a bumper sticker on my car? Can you fucking do internet already?

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Uh, the chat room. The chat room is diving for cover. It's a Loki rants on the alarm.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Also, now not just the low stars thing, bugs.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Courses that include bugs that were unintended by either the course creator or the developers will be deleted.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:50.000
It's important that we remove levels with bugs quickly because letting these levels remain in course world can lead to negative outcomes for many players,

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:57.000
such as players experiencing levels in unfair ways that the original course creator did not intend or rewriting world record times.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
And then lastly, requesting stars from other users.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Oh, sorry, one more after this, but courses that are explicitly asking for stars from other players will be deleted.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:12.000
For example, using words like like, yeah, and the star symbol in their course names.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Please change the course name when saving a course that includes these words.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000
And lastly, of course, inappropriate content, offensive behavior, that whole type of thing.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.000
You can't spell out, you know, cunt in blocks and expect that that level is going to stay up because that's inappropriate.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So don't do that.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Alright, so, uh, there you go. Those are Nintendo's official explanation of why they take down levels.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Which is interesting that they explain some of them so well, except for the low, which is the one that everybody's focusing on.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Like, okay, yes, bugs. We get the bugs. Yes, don't put fuck in your level. We understand.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:51.000
But the low one is the one that, like, their explanation kind of sucks.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000
And I would like to know more about the thought process behind that.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
But we'll take what we can get.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
In the meantime, Skype line is open. If you'd like to give us a call to talk about anything we've talked about tonight,

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.000
anything we haven't yet talked about tonight that you'd like to bring up or whatever's on your mind, give us a call.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:14.000
In fact, Skype really is the preferred method in the year 2016. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000
That same cell phone you used to call us could probably be used to use Skype, just saying.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000
In the meantime, I always like to check in with Loki at this point and say, hey, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I don't know.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Um...

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Yeah, we kind of used a lot tonight, right?

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Yeah, I don't really have anything.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Yeah.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I didn't forget to mention that I attempted the Blade DDR a couple weeks ago. That didn't go well.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Oh, because you're old? Because I've had that moment, too.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Yes.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Yes.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Alright, let's get to the phones, because the line is ringing. Let's do it.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.000
It's the one and only Ranma. How is everybody out there in Sacramento today?

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Fabulous. Thanks for asking.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Except for this whole business where when we were talking about OLR going off the air earlier,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
you were the first one to say, I get the time slot.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Well, have you forgotten the part where Anime Jam Session is the baby brother of OLR?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
So, of course, we're going to call dibs.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Yeah, I know, I know, but we are going to continue to pick on you as well as siblings do.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
And we will continue to blackmail y'all in return.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Alright, fair enough. What's up? What's on your mind?

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I'm going to talk about this whole FF7 thing where people are, I guess, they're kind of losing their proverbial shit because it's going to be a trilogy.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Yeah, the whole episodic nature of the remake. What's your take on it?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Look, we know the story of FF7. We know that when they did the game, they didn't cover every aspect of it.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:51.000
So, we know that's what they're going to do. They're going to try to go into detail on the entire FF7 lore.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:57.000
And if we're lucky, they'll throw a nod at some of the spinoff titles such as Dirge of Cerberus.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I was going to say, besides it was a trilogy, there's Dirge of Cerberus, FF7, and Advent Children.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Crisis Core as well.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Yeah, and also, they did say they wanted to go into detailing as possible.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000
It's going to be more of an action RPG. Did they not say that?

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:29.000
No, and I agree with you. You can see that in the gameplay. You know it's not going to be the same game, and you can see that based on the gameplay.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000
But I think the other important thing with the whole FF7 thing, and let's get one thing clear.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:44.000
If you're expecting a shot-for-shot remake, except it's going to be in high definition, if you're expecting the voice acting to be word-for-word the script that you remember from when you were younger,

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000
you need to stop and prepare yourself for something different.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:16:00.000
This is akin to them remaking a movie. A classic movie in a new day and age. For better or for worse.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Yes, because if it was shot-for-shot and word-for-word, I think an hour in, I'd turn the game off and walk away.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:23.000
What I am looking forward to is the fact that it's going to be an action RPG, it's going to be more detailing, the voice acting is going to be amazing, and they're going to go probably into detail into the full lore of FF7.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Which I think is pretty cool. And they did say it was going to be multiple parts. I mean, not for nothing.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Yes, the game is going to be on a blu-ray disc that's 50 gigs. Can I tell you this shit right now? At least 40 of those gigs is going to be the graphical content anyway, and the rest is going to be the storyline, so they're not going to be able to fit everything in there, even after you install it onto the console.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I'm sorry, I love this zinger too much from our chat room. Bobby Blackwolf says, Final Fantasy 7 is going to be recast with all women confirmed.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Well, I mean, Takara Zuka is quite popular. I mean, look at the Sailor Moon musicals. I mean, come on.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.000
But on a related note, can we talk about the most overrated movie from my childhood, by the way?

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
What is it?

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Ghostbusters.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Okay, we're not going to go down that road. We're not going to go down that road. You're on my personal Facebook. You already know my opinion of what that is, and it's legitimate.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I'm sorry. I know I'm going to hurt some feelings. I know some panties are going to get bunched, but I just think...

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I have Ghostbusters movies on laserdisc.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I kind of think it's an overrated movie. I'm sorry. I don't think it's that great. I think I could name 10 other movies from the 80s that I remember better.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
We can start with Gremlins. But anyway...

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:55.000
If you're saying that Ghostbusters is overrated, I'm going to say that Legend of Zelda, the one for the N64...

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Can I remember the name? Because I just bought it. Here we go. Overrated time.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Overrated time.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
And my first mask. Both of those games were overrated as fuck.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Exactly! They were the...

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Guess what? I agree with you.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Try again, asshole.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
You're a dick.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Well, I will say... Wait, wait. Put that... Keyboard warriors, stop typing. Hold on, hold on. Here's the thing.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I've grown to understand more after time has passed why people feel so strongly about Ogreen of Time as they do.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Keep in mind... Walk a mile in my shoes for a minute.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:39.000
I had to go from Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, to the Ogreen of Time.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000
And that whole 2D to 3D thing did not sit well with me and a lot of gamers of mine.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
So anyway...

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Okay, Brad from Pod Culture says Mass Effect is overrated. Now you're just trying to hurt.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I mean, not for nothing. I mean, he kinda has a point.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
No, now you're just trying to be mean. Now you're just trying to be mean.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Come on, Rob. You kinda opened the door on that.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Alright, look, look. I didn't even get to say this. As much as I said all that stuff about the movie, two things.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
The Stafe Puff Marshmallow Man is pretty rad. I'll give you that.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000
And the video game kicked ass.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.000
And that's what I remember fondly.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:29.000
And maybe that's why I feel the way I do, is that for me, Ghostbusters was never about the movie, it was about the game. For me.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
But that's me.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Anyway, wow, we got from Final Fantasy 7 to Ghostbusters and it's all thanks to Bobby Black Wolf.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Somebody had to fire that shot.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I'm not the one that put the .357 in his hand. All I know is he had bullets.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Guns don't kill people, Rama. I kill people.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Oh, God. Now, now, now, now. You shoot like a stormtrooper, man. We're all gonna live. We're good.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Alright, I am now removing you from the program.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
No, did you have anything else? Oh, seriously, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we let you go?

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Oh, no, no. I just want my thoughts on the whole FF7 thing. People just need to calm down, enjoy it.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:17.000
You're gonna get more of the lore and questions are going to be answered.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:21.000
And if that's not enough, go fuck yourself.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I mean, really. These companies are giving, they're doing what they can.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:31.000
If that's not enough, you can just go make your own opinion, have your own little fart circle, you know?

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:37.000
And then be like, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah. And then they'll be like, you know what, you're wrong, here's a middle finger, have a nice day.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Hey, no, I'm right.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
And if you don't like it, go fuck yourself.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000
I'm gonna put that on my car, too.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000
I'm gonna get pulled over by all the cops. Anyway.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I agree. Everybody needs to calm their tits. The game isn't even, like, we don't even have the first gameplay demo of the game.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Everybody needs to calm down until we actually get to play the game. And then we can start to make decisions.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I will say this, though, as a bit of an aside, because again, this is the week we were gone, but the Final Fantasy XV demo...

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Yeah, that was pretty good.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I don't know how many of you guys checked that out, but...

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I forgot the mention I played.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Wait, wait, wait, FFXV, you mean Bros in the Hood? Okay.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000
No, this is more like, it's Kingdom Hearts, but it's not Kingdom Hearts.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Yeah, right? I was like, oh my god, I'm playing Kingdom Hearts 3, especially the level with the bricks and all that stuff.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:41.000
But when I saw that trailer, I cackled when I saw the theme song was Stand By Me for, like, the four dudes on the bro trip, right?

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.000
But then I also had feels, because I'm like, oh my god, Florence and the Machine? Like, that woman is fucking perfect.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
They're gonna totally poke a dead dude.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Brofancy XV.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:59.000
That's gonna be one of the first battles, you know what, teaching you the battle system and everything?

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It's gonna be a dead dude, your weapon's gonna be a stick, you're gonna have poke. Or run.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:13.000
If you have not seen the gif of the dudes in the car, is Sephiroth trolling alongside them? I don't know. I don't know.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:25.000
I'm willing to give the game a chance. Alan Alchemy in chat says, if the remake isn't up to snuff, they can just go write 500 more pages of fanfic, making it how they want it, like they've been doing since 1997.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Exactly! Alan Alchemy, he nailed it. That's exactly what it is. There you go.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
There's a reason why I keep that man close.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
As long as we can get some Haddaway in the car, and get them all head bobbing.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Has somebody done that YouTube yet?

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I think, probably. Internet, don't let me down.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I'm pretty sure that's probably in existence already.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Rom, I gotta let you go to free up the line.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.000
If it's not a YouTube video, give it a year, it'll be an anime con.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Awesome. Can't wait. Front row seat. Alright, take care my friend.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
YouTube, bro. Bye. Bye.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000
We're getting another call, coming in right now. Let's get to it.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Hey, Rom!

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
It's Marissa, isn't it?

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Yes, it is. How you doing?

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Good, these are my favorite phone calls. What's up, Marissa?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Marissa!

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Hi, kids! How's it going?

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Good. It would be better if you were here, but I understand.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Yeah, dammit. I have a nicer car, but now I only get 22 miles a gallon, so it's very painful to look at that drive.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Travel and six hour drive. Well, what's on your mind?

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I'm sorry?

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
What's on your mind?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I was calling to say hello. I guess you weren't able to make it to WonderCon this year, but that was a blast. That was a lot of fun.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Hopefully, you're gonna come down. I'm gonna just invent a convention for you guys to come down for.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I love that idea. And actually, a friend of mine, a really good friend of mine, Victoria, was that, for those of you that listen to guys on the show, she was on episode four.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I'm gonna call it fanfic, because I've actually written fanfic in my head where you and Victoria are friends, because you were both at WonderCon, and you probably even saw each other.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.000
She was dressed as some Disney princess every day. No, she was dressed as the-

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
She was Lottie. She did Lottie.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:21.000
She did Lottie, she did the wench from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. And that's my favorite.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
The redhead.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
The redhead.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Marissa, if you come to Disneyland on my- I should say California Adventure on my birthday, or for my birthday, which is- I'm gonna be there on May 1st, so I won't be on the show, Rob, sorry.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Just tell all the listeners where to find you.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
But Victoria will be there, and you two can meet, and the world can explode.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I would love that.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:58.000
You know, actually, I do think I saw her, because I had another friend who was cosplaying as Ariel when she had legs, and there was, like, Disney princess or Disney-related people taking pictures, and the obligatory, you know, redheaded cosplay, so I dug out the Jessica Rabbit outfit, although I did not wear that on the subway. I brought a change of clothes.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
That would have made for some interesting stories, though.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Now, Victoria has done a Jessica Rabbit at Rocky Horror Picture Show, so you guys have, like, a thing. You have the Jessica Rabbit thing.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.000
If you have enough bust and red hair, like, you know, you have certain options of, you know-

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Really? Because I haven't tried yet, but maybe I should.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I also thought of you two because I mentioned a certain program, I don't know if you're familiar with, I probably shouldn't, like, crap on them, but I was going to a comedy show, and I guess that they made the front room, which didn't used to be a room, at the place where all the stand-ups were going to see.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I know if anyone here knows Mike Polk, Jr., he does a lot of stuff on YouTube, I love him. All of a sudden we're sitting in the main room, and they're playing video games, and 40 minutes, like, into it, we realized, this isn't that the other show is running long, this is the show.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And I was like, oh my God! I thought of you guys, though, because although they have a large amount of success, it was not entertaining, and I wasn't being like, you know, like, Grandma, I don't understand these kids and their video game shows. No, it wasn't, you know, witty or entertaining.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:26.000
You know, like, your ability to project, you know, to play video games in a comedy club, that's funny, but I mean, that's a fun idea, but you still have to, you know, be entertaining. So, that was, I guess that's the new craze of entertainment right here, like, you have a successful enough channel, you know, you rent out the various venues.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:39.000
There's always gonna be that thing that so many people are into, like a TV show or a movie or something, and you're that asshole sitting in the back corner going, I don't get it. Like, literally the phone call we just took, Marissa.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Well, yeah, it's funny, because I'm not like one of those grandmas, because I know so many people that complain about Let's Plays and things like that, and I enjoy them, and I see why you like to share that experience. I see why when you have your friends together, and you're playing video game challenges together, you know, why that can be funny, but if you actually got, like, a bunch of really good comedians together, or even you guys, you're so funny, and did the same thing, it would be entertaining.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:16.000
But nowadays, it's just like if you have an impressive amount of metrics, you know, and followers, that, like, the actual part of being entertaining doesn't matter. It's like one of those things where people are there taking pictures of themselves at the event to impress their friends more than the event.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:24.000
I personally believe this, and not everybody agrees with me, but I really feel like the best Let's Plays are where the video game is secondary.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Yeah, you still have to have an interesting perspective, yeah.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Yeah, the video game, it's like an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway, where the video game is just kind of the device, it's that prop, but it's really the funny people and the personalities that make it great.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Which actually makes me think, I would love nothing more than for, like, Ryan Stiles, Colin Mockery, Wayne Brady, and Greg Proops to, like, have a Let's Play channel.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Like, how is that not a thing?

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Well, you know that somehow Patton Oswalt, given that he is so certifiably, you know, geeky himself, he somehow has to slip in there who's lying credit or not.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
It's true.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
His channel would be awesome, too.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
That would be awesome.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
That would be hilarious. I'm gonna go see him this week, too. Yay, we love Greg Proops.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Yeah, well, give him a big hug for me, because that man is awesome.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Marissa, I swear I'm gonna find a reason to come to LA soon. You know, a lot of people have been saying I should go to DragCon, because that is, like, the week after Dark Soccer's gonna be there.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
In fact, I'm kind of surprised she didn't push her whole trip back a week to go to DragCon.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.000
What? I didn't even know.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Yeah, RuPaul's DragCon is gonna be-

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000
I can't take Dan to that, though.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Well, you could.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I want Dan to be there for my birthday thing.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
But anyway-

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I'm glad you have to, and I was talking earlier about taking the subway and how I didn't want to wear my Jessica Rabbit outfit, you know, because you don't have to worry about parking.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000
That is a day where I would want to just sit and watch people on the subway. That would be an interesting day.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:59.000
What I'm trying to do with the new job, I don't have as much time off, because it's a new job. Like, my last job I was at for 14 years, so I had a lot of time off available by the 14th year, right?

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:07.000
So this new job, I don't have a lot of time off right now, but I'm trying to save pretty good, so that way in the coming years, I'll have a little extra time to do more,

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Hey, let's go to Disneyland this weekend, type of trips, because right now I have to plan everything in advance.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Okay, well yay!

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Alright, well Marissa, my dear, I'm gonna let you go so we can get one more call and then probably wrap up the show.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Okay, so maybe now I can actually eat and maybe bathe myself, since I've had this brief respite in between playing Stardew Valley, so that's good. Thank you.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Oh my god, are you obsessed with Stardew Valley?

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Actually, I was, like, my boyfriend was wondering if he was gonna have to have an intervention until the latest update, my computer's a piece of crap. Made it too slow.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:52.000
For what it's worth, Marissa, you're not alone. Like, Stardew Valley is like the new Minecraft, Five Nights, it's the new indie darling that people are obsessed with.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000
The first step is that you have a problem.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I get it.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Thank you so much.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Marissa, my dream is that we're gonna do a Let's Play someday for Stardew Valley. That's my dream.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Yes! We must make this happen.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Alright.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Alright, take care, my dear.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Alright, that is the lovely and talented Marissa calling us there on the Skype line, we'd love to hear from her.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:23.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, I'll give it just a minute there to see if any more calls creep in there.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:32.000
While we wait to see if any calls come in here at the last minute, I just want to express again my jealousy of Dar Sakura getting to go to Disneyland, or excuse me, California Adventure.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
But no, you know what, it's your birthday, you earned it.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Well, yeah, cause, you know, I grew.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I'm a little sad about your party, but I understand, don't get me wrong.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Well, that and, like, only, like, eight people said they could make it, and then I had another, like, feud to say they couldn't.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Girl, it only takes one person to make a party, and he's sitting right here.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Well, but I'm still gonna...

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:56.000
I can't come. I'm sorry.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I figured we could maybe do something on the show next week instead.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000
We could, we could look at doing something like that, we could get a cake, would Becky make a cake?

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Becky, if you're listening, make me a cake!

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Actually, that's super rude of me to volunteer her like that, but...

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I volunteer Becky for stuff all the time.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.000
For what it's worth, when I think of yummy cakes, I think of Becky, so take it as a compliment.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.000
That's it. Becky, your nickname now forever and ever is gonna be Tasty Cakes.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Sorry, I do have a last minute story real quick.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Fine. We were gonna talk about cake, but we were gonna talk about a story.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Hey, I'm putting this train back on the rails, so...

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Sorry, go ahead.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:42.000
So, there's a company called Precision Syndicate LLC, and they're a gun manufacturer, and yes, they made a handgun that resembles a Nintendo Zapper.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Okay, I don't like that you're bringing this up for Dark Sakura's birthday, because you know she'll be like, I want a gun.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
It's pretty awesome, actually.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
No, I don't want a gun.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
No, it does, I, as much as...

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Maybe the Nintendo-themed Glock.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
That is a Nintendo thing, but yeah.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
But I don't want a gun.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
You all know how I feel about guns, but when I do look at that Nintendo gun, I'm like, okay.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:15.000
You know what surprised me, actually? Because we get advertisements for a gun store nearby, and they sell handguns and assault rifles.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:24.000
And I was like, dude, their guns are the same price as airsoft guns. Airsoft guns cost the same amount of money as a real gun.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
What the fuck?

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
That's what I wanted to know.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Guns are accessible, what can we say?

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I guess it's all the ammo that you have to pay for as well.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
BBs are a lot cheaper.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:41.000
That's true. Alright, well sadly the phone does not appear to be lighting up, so I'm going to go ahead and shut it down.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
But if you do have anything you want to tell us for consideration in a future episode, please feel free to email us.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to participate with the show.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Thanks again to all you guys who have listened to the show tonight. Thanks to everybody participating in our chat room.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Thanks to everybody listening to us on podcast land or streaming radio, wherever it is that you're listening to the show.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Thanks for supporting the show.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Thanks again. I can't say this enough, and I don't even know if they'll hear this, but I just want to say thanks again to Gabe and Brie for including us as part of the Sac Indie Gaming Expo.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Yesterday was a fantastic thing. It was really truly an honor to be a part of it, and who knows, we may have even got some new listeners from that whole thing.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Actually, I can say this. I think I'm okay to talk about this. We met another local podcast there.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:32.000
We met the guys from Video Game Bang, which, by the way, I still love that name.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:41.000
And we are talking about Crossover Weekend. So, we're going to go there and they're going to come here. That's going to happen at some point.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:49.000
And it's going to be neat because, you know, they're very, and if you heard their panel, you know, they're kind of different gamers than we are.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.000
They play different stuff and they're into different things. When the Pokémon questions came up, they looked at us.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:02.000
But then there's certain things I'm sure that they're into that we would go, huh? So, we're going to have a fun weekend whenever we get that planned.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.000
That'll be in the coming weeks, so that'll be fun.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Alright, but in the meantime, we've got to shut it down for this week. Thanks again, everybody, for listening.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, as I always say, tell a friend or two or twenty about the show.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Help us spread the word. This is a show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't get the voices out there if they're not out there listening to it.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:26.000
So, your word of mouth and your referrals, your reviews on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Those five-star reviews go a long way and we really appreciate each and every one of them, so thank you.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.000
If you take thirty seconds right now to write a nice five-star review, it would go a long way and we'd really, really appreciate that.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Meantime, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Loki, good job after a month off.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:52.000
I hope to work more on my game. It's just been really tired when we get home.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:58.000
So I sit there, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to totally work on it. And then I watch YouTube videos instead, so.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:07.000
I'm trying not to do that. I'm trying. It's just not happening. Brain doesn't want to do what I want to do.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I have like a mental block right now. It's like I have, I'm rewriting, because I went back to my original project that I started, like the first, first project that I was starting.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:25.000
And I'm redoing everything on it. But I haven't worked on it so long, I don't know where to start, and I need to redo it all again.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000
So I kind of have to figure out how I need to redo it so it actually works better. And that's taking time.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
You can do it. I believe in you.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Alright, Dar Sakura, your final thoughts tonight? Two things. Number one.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Number one, I regret that burrito.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
That was a big burrito.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.000
That was a fucking huge burrito.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.000
But it looked like a delicious burrito.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
It was the only thing I've had to eat today other than oatmeal.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:58.000
I had a burrito in Tucson. I just wanted to share. You know, I never eat burritos. I was so fucking hungry after that Ingress May.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
And you put something big, thick and meaty in your mouth.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
You know it, girl.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:14.000
After six hours in the sun, while I was hungover, after seeing, thank you very much, drag queens, the night before, playing Ingress for six hours in the sun, I was like,

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Alan, I want a fucking burrito.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I'm proud of you.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Number two.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Uh.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I know you are not a big fan of the video thing, but I swear to God, we need to look at doing something like that.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
That's what, well, funny that you mention that.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I, the thing that I kept trying to talk to you about yesterday, that was it.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000
So, we have to talk about it.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Alright, my final thought tonight is my back is being a jerk again.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
So, I think I'm gonna do what I did last night and vegetate to MMOs and feel sorry about my life.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Oh, and feel like garbage.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Are your lovely lady lumps too lumpy?

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000
My lovely lady back, apparently, are my humps in my back.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
You know what, I don't want to think about that.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000
We're out of here. Goodnight everybody.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
We will see you in seven days. We'll do this all over again.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Have a great week. We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Goodnight.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
See you next week.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Thanks for watching!
