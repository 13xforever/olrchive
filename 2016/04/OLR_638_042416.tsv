0	27000	This week Sony's plans for the first PS4 refresh, codename Neo, comes with a modest bump in power but will not cause any incompatibilities for existing console owners. We'll explain what this could mean along with the rest of the week's gaming news and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 638 of our show for this April the 24th of 2016.
45000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joined here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California by my co-host, but not tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. DarkSakura is off.
59000	75000	DarkSakura is actually going to be gone for this weekend next. Just the timing of some things really unfortunately didn't work out. DarkSakura is out tonight. She came down with laryngitis. She's got a doctor's note and everything y'all so she actually can't talk.
75000	91000	I don't know if she's going to pop in to chat or if she's napping but she's not going to be here tonight and sadly next week, well not sadly actually, I'm actually jealous of next week but next week she has her pre-planned trip to Disneyland, a little bit of a belated birthday celebration with Mr. Dan.
91000	100000	So sadly we're not going to hear from DarkSakura for a couple weeks but she'll be back in a few weeks. Joining me in studio tonight, I am joined by the one and only Techmaster, Loki.
100000	101000	Hello.
101000	102000	How are you doing, Loki?
102000	104000	Almost 100%.
104000	107000	Yeah, I was like, you kind of have like a sick thing going on yourself.
107000	119000	Yeah, the stupid kids are always sick and then they get us sick. I swear to God, it's like we were talking about it like how we're getting someone to stay home with the sick kids and they're fucking sick every goddamn week.
119000	128000	Like it's one thing or another, like our youngest son had like a fever for like five days and then my oldest son has a fever and I was like, God.
129000	132000	Well, I hope you're feeling better and more importantly, I hope you didn't give it to me.
132000	146000	I'm not feeling that great. I mean, I'm okay but I don't know. It's just had cold stuff and it could be allergies because I had to chop down a tree limb and so as I was doing that, I was inhaling the sawdust.
146000	148000	Oh sure, oh sure. Yeah, that's healthy.
148000	151000	And it was like, oh, it was also going into my eyes so like...
151000	154000	That's why you have those little like flu mask things you can...
154000	156000	Yeah, I didn't do that.
156000	160000	Yeah, whoops. That's probably a bad call. Maybe next time you want to do that.
160000	163000	So I'm probably having like allergies or something. As you can tell, I sound congested.
163000	165000	He said I'm not coughing so that's good.
165000	179000	I swear, something out there is trying to keep us down over the past six months. It's like we kind of joked at one point, oh, we're on track to have episode 666 for Loki's birthday but now maybe it'll be on Christmas.
179000	183000	Like that's kind of where we're at at this point. We'll see.
183000	189000	We were not here last week so I just quickly want to address that because it was a bit of an unexpected week off.
189000	193000	Like I said, we don't like missing shows and I know I've talked about this before.
193000	196000	Y'all know how I feel about missing shows. I don't like to do it.
196000	203000	But the reality of the situation is I got a phone call Sunday morning and my last living grandparent had died.
203000	206000	So she passed away at the age of 99.
207000	210000	I know a lot of you write about that on Twitter and I just want to say thank you.
210000	217000	I had written that on Twitter and I got a lot of real great responses and everybody said take all the time you need and so forth.
217000	226000	I really deeply appreciate that. Especially as we have been a little spotty with shows just in the past few months, not intentionally.
226000	234000	I just really appreciate that there's so many of you that have really stuck by our side and so forth throughout these circumstances that keep coming up.
234000	237000	I really can't thank you enough but I'm doing fine.
237000	247000	To have found out that particular day and that morning, it takes a certain amount of extravertedness to be able to do this show for three hours every Sunday night.
247000	250000	And that wasn't going to happen last week. It just wasn't.
250000	255000	I'm sure y'all can understand. There was that.
255000	259000	The funeral was Friday. It was a lovely service and everything.
259000	268000	My grandma, she was 99 years old so you can't exactly sit here and say, oh my god, it's a surprise! We're so shocked!
268000	274000	Wow! But still, it's never one of those things that you're necessarily prepared for.
274000	278000	But I think we're all very fortunate that she got to live so long.
278000	289000	I just want to quickly say, I think a lot of the nerdy genes in my family probably come from my grandma and passed down to my dad.
289000	295000	Both of them, my grandma and my dad, are super nerdy when it comes to things like genealogy.
295000	299000	And they were always really on the cutting edge of tech for things like that.
299000	304000	Like using new PC applications and Family Tree Maker and things like that.
304000	308000	And getting scanners to scan in photographs and all that stuff.
308000	312000	They actually were part of a society in one of the local neighborhoods.
312000	314000	All that stuff is really cool.
314000	322000	I remember growing up, I used to spend weekends at my grandma's house once in a while, once every few months.
322000	328000	And she was very enabling in a sense to me playing video games.
328000	333000	Like I could hook up the Nintendo to the TV, Super Nintendo. She might take me out so we could rent a video game.
333000	337000	I remember the first time I ever rented an import game for my Super Nintendo was at my grandma's house.
337000	342000	I want to say it was either Dragon Ball Z or Ranma.
342000	346000	It was one of the two, because there was a fighting, there was a Ranma fighting game on Super Nintendo.
346000	348000	It might have been that. It was like one of those two.
348000	351000	And I remember playing that at my grandma's house. That was a lot of fun.
351000	357000	And she was always the type that would play board games with me, which I think is video game adjacent.
357000	362000	So yeah, just some memories there. Thank you for indulging me for a moment.
362000	366000	But that is why, in a surprise, there was no show last Sunday.
366000	373000	So again, thank you guys very much for the warm wishes and understanding as we've been dealing with a lot of crap this year.
373000	378000	I mean, all of us, you know, not just myself personally, but obviously Dark Sakura being sick.
378000	383000	Loki with the kids causing God knows what situation to go on.
384000	387000	I don't know. But yeah, I really appreciate that, you guys.
387000	392000	Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
392000	399000	Live.vognetwork.com. We are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, Sundays at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
399000	406000	And Tiger Claw in chat says, if Dark Sakura can talk, maybe she can use the device Stephen Hawking uses.
407000	414000	Maybe, but I think she's being told she has to sleep a lot, as sick people usually have to do.
414000	419000	So I think that's why she's not stressing it out too much there.
419000	424000	And then a lot of people saying very lovely things in chat, so I really appreciate that.
424000	429000	Dungeon Buster in chat saying, haha the Rama fighting game. I remember that.
429000	432000	Yeah, I'm almost positive that was the game that actually played on Super Nintendo.
432000	439000	Spoiler alert, it wasn't very good. It kind of came at the, you remember when Street Fighter 2 came out?
439000	441000	Well, maybe you don't remember this, but you maybe read about it.
441000	446000	When Street Fighter 2 came out on the Super Nintendo, it really kind of revolutionized things.
446000	449000	Right? I mean, it was a true, authentic, arcade experience.
449000	452000	And Street Fighter 2 was huge in the arcade, right?
452000	455000	But it was on consoles, you know, it was something.
455000	462000	And the Super Nintendo version was, I mean, for a 12 year old's eyes, arcade perfect.
462000	466000	Now granted, you could nitpick it and find things that don't make that game arcade perfect,
466000	471000	but for the time, it was a damn good translation.
471000	477000	I mean, you look at games of the past, you know, when they tried to put Pac-Man on the Atari 2600.
477000	481000	When they tried to put something like Crystal Castles on the 2600, blah.
481000	486000	You know, you try to put Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade game on the NES.
486000	488000	They had to cut some corners of that too, remember that?
488000	489000	It was still pretty good.
489000	492000	It was still pretty good, but it wasn't arcade perfect, right?
492000	497000	But Street Fighter 2 was like, I think for a lot of us, was like that first big moment where it's like,
497000	500000	okay, shit, this is like arcade perfect.
500000	504000	So then a lot of people really jumped on to kind of capitalize on that success, right?
504000	509000	And, you know, I would even argue Mortal Kombat was a big part of what came of that, you know,
509000	512000	but I think that's a great thing and had all that competition.
512000	518000	But then there was the whole lawsuit because Data East came out with that game, Fighting Street,
518000	522000	that was very, very similar in a lot of ways.
522000	524000	That was a whole other mess.
524000	529000	So anyway, just, you know, there was a lot of fighting games that came out around that era in the Super Nintendo,
529000	531000	and unfortunately, a lot of them were kind of garbage.
531000	535000	And I would say the Rama game was probably one of those.
536000	540000	And Tigerclaw pointing out that, yeah, there was a Rama game on the PlayStation as well.
540000	542000	Yeah, very true, very true.
542000	544000	Anyhow, let us start off this week.
544000	549000	Usually we do a kickoff topic, but since we did miss last week's episode of Orange Launch Radio,
549000	555000	I want to get into a little bit of the what you missed with last week's news set to Holik.
557000	562000	So last week in gaming, rumors, rumors, rumors galore.
562000	564000	There is more NX rumors.
564000	570000	This one had to do with Wii U ports, that we were going to see ports of popular Wii U games on the NX,
570000	575000	including Splatoon and Super Smash Brothers, which I suppose isn't completely out of character for Nintendo.
575000	583000	But also rumors that there is huge, plentiful first-party support for the NX, which, I mean...
583000	586000	What? They're going to support their own console? You don't say.
586000	589000	This is the Pope Catholic, but I guess this is worthy of a headline somewhere.
589000	596000	Star Fox Zero, which came out this week, was getting its kind of reviews and was leaking some information last week.
596000	601000	And there was apparently a very lovely tribute to Satoru Iwata in the credits of Star Fox Zero.
601000	603000	So very nice to see them paying tribute there.
603000	608000	Animal Crossing last week turned 15 years old.
608000	614000	I remember very well when that game came out, so that just makes me feel a little bit older.
614000	622000	Microsoft confirming that their E3 press event is Monday of E3 week at 9.30 AM, the same time that it always is.
622000	628000	Final Fantasy VII Remake Producer talks about the fact that Final Fantasy VII is going to be in three separate episodes,
628000	632000	saying each episode is a complete game.
632000	636000	They compared it to, like, 13, which I'm fine with that.
636000	639000	I'm fine with that too, as long as, you know, they're all pretty good.
640000	644000	But I think a lot of people crap on 13 unnecessarily.
644000	648000	I feel like I'm the one in the room that will defend 13 more than...
648000	650000	I haven't finished 13, so I don't know.
650000	652000	You know, 13 had a great ending.
652000	656000	I understand where some people get a little bothered with the hallway.
656000	658000	It was just hard to follow.
658000	661000	The story was hard to follow for me.
661000	668000	Yeah, it gets into... it's very... a lot of made-up words and a lot of, like, I need graphs and charts to help me understand this.
668000	674000	Exactly, yeah. It's kind of like, uh, I don't know... wait, what? Falsy?
674000	679000	Yeah, there's a lussy, a falsy, a pulslessy. Yeah, there's all this, right? There's all this crazy stuff.
679000	684000	And then the sequel didn't help, because then they fucking brought time travel into it.
684000	689000	And then when you bring time travel into it, then you really have to have all these bars, charts, and graphs, right?
689000	692000	And then the third game, I have to admit, I'm not as familiar with the third game.
692000	697000	I didn't play that one extensively, but I've spoiled the ending of 13.
697000	700000	Well, it was spoiled for me on Twitter, so I went ahead and watched the video.
700000	707000	And the little, like, post-credit sequence they have that's very, very touching and kind of puts a bookend on everything.
707000	712000	But the only thing that disappoints me, and this is funny, because this had come up in a conversation on Twitter I was having this week.
712000	716000	I actually wouldn't mind if they did yet another Final Fantasy 13 game.
716000	722000	I understand they really want to get past 13 and talk about, you know, 14 is the MMO, it's different.
722000	727000	But they want to talk about 15, you know, that's the new era that's starting in September and so forth.
727000	733000	But I would be all for a fourth Final Fantasy 13 game, like maybe a prequel that has fang.
733000	738000	That's nothing but, like, fang, and I suppose you'd have to have Vanille in that as well if fang is in it.
738000	740000	But I would be all about that.
740000	744000	I think that's another problem, speaking of Vanille, I think that's another problem 13 had.
744000	756000	Was that if you didn't play enough of 13, Hope and Vanille were your very stereotypical, unlikeable, anime trope stereotype kids that, like, you just didn't like.
756000	766000	But the more you play, especially in the first game, Vanille, as you start to peel back the layers, I think is a very complex character that's very interesting.
766000	771000	Hope has kind of a development arc in the first game, but I really think he starts to shine more in the second game.
771000	777000	And he's actually kind of a badass in the second game, but most of you would never know that because you gave up on it by the time it took to get there.
777000	785000	So I would say if 13 has any faults, it's that it didn't maybe ramp up quick enough in some ways, but I still think it's...
785000	786000	Oh yeah, it dragged.
786000	788000	It does drag a little bit in the beginning.
788000	789000	It's also very linear in the beginning.
789000	790000	It is, it is.
790000	795000	But I still think, in spite of all that, it's worth playing through.
795000	800000	It's kind of like, surely, aren't there shows on TV where, like, the first season...
800000	802000	Oh, I know one. 30 Rock.
802000	804000	It was okay in its first season.
804000	808000	It was kind of funny, but it really didn't come into its own until, like, some of the later seasons, right?
808000	811000	Like, sometimes shows have a really rough first season and then they start to get better and better.
811000	817000	But, and, like, people will forgive it and watch the first season and then watch the later seasons because the later seasons are the ones that are really good.
817000	822000	I would say it's kind of like that, but you're going to have to invest a little bit of the time in it.
822000	823000	Anyway.
823000	826000	So, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
826000	829000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, bring back Saz.
829000	830000	Totally.
830000	833000	He was a very interesting character, too, and had a great storyline in that game as well.
833000	839000	I do know he sort of had a cameo in 13, too, but yeah, it could have been a little more.
839000	842000	Kaijuto says, no prequels, please.
842000	843000	Hater.
843000	844000	Let's see.
844000	852000	RageNator wonders, if Final Fantasy 13 ends up having 13 sequels, would the 13th one be called Final Fantasy 1313?
852000	853000	Yes, it would.
853000	856000	Dungeonbuster says, Vanille wasn't so bad.
856000	858000	I'd pick her over those two.
858000	862000	And Brad from Pod Culture saying, Deep Space Nine.
862000	863000	Yes, thank you.
863000	865000	That is a wonderful analogy.
865000	871000	Final Fantasy 13 is the Deep Space Nine of the Final Fantasy 13 saga.
872000	877000	Because Deep Space Nine kind of gets a lot of weird complexities and shit in the later seasons.
877000	880000	So I would say, yeah, I think there's a really good parallel.
880000	882000	In my opinion, anyway.
882000	883000	So, there you go.
883000	889000	Anyway, not to dominate our show with a talk of a game that's probably, what, pushing 10 years old at this point.
889000	892000	What about the Final Fantasy 15?
892000	898000	You know, since we've had kind of a spotty schedule the past couple months, we haven't been able to talk a lot about the Final Fantasy 15.
898000	900000	I'm not all that hyped up about it, to be honest.
900000	901000	Yeah.
901000	902000	Did you check out the demo?
902000	903000	I did play the demo.
903000	904000	It was alright.
904000	910000	I just, it, you know, the demo felt more like Kingdom Hearts than it did Final Fantasy 15.
910000	912000	It was alright, though.
912000	916000	I mean, I could get into it, I guess.
916000	919000	I just have to see what the story is, because I don't really know much about it.
919000	926000	It wasn't like, you know, it doesn't, to me, it doesn't seem like it has that Final Fantasy 7 start.
926000	930000	Where you're like, you know, you watch the beginning and you're like, fuck yes.
930000	934000	You know, it's just like that impact, like, let's do this shit.
934000	944000	Yeah, that's true. I will say that is one thing Final Fantasy 7, maybe one reason people, like, remember that one so fondly is that that game just throws you right fucking into it.
944000	950000	It throws you right fucking into it, and then like, just the music and everything, it's just like, yes.
950000	951000	That's true.
951000	959000	That's true. 13 did lack that a little bit, although, well, ironically, 13 also starts kind of with a big, like, type of war, but it's different.
959000	961000	It's not like past.
961000	964000	Like, 10 was pretty good. 10 kind of had that a little bit.
964000	965000	Yeah, that's true.
965000	967000	We'll see. You know, I have to see what it looks like.
967000	970000	I'll probably pick it up, because it looks interesting to just, I don't know.
970000	975000	I'm still getting used to the battle system as well, like, I'm kind of fumbling with that, but we'll see.
976000	983000	What's so wrong with turn-based? I mean, seriously, I don't understand what the problem is with that. I like it.
983000	989000	It's the millennials' fault. That's the new, don't you know that's the new cool hip thing for people over a certain age to do?
989000	990000	Blame the millennials.
990000	998000	Blame the millennials. Yeah, millennials don't have a big, and we have plenty of millennials that listen to this show. Please realize this is very tongue-in-cheek, what I'm saying.
998000	1002000	But, you know, the millennials don't have the attention span for turn-based.
1002000	1006000	They need something that's a lot more, they all have ADD.
1006000	1010000	So they're not going to be able to stand the turn-based thing.
1010000	1012000	They have to have something a little more fluid.
1012000	1015000	That's why they have to go back and change Final Fantasy VII.
1015000	1017000	It's because of the millennials.
1017000	1021000	I don't know. Like, even the last Final Fantasy game I played, I didn't really get it.
1021000	1023000	Was it Final Fantasy Type-0?
1023000	1026000	Or, Type-0 HD, or whatever that was?
1027000	1031000	I never really got into that. Like, I played it, and I was kind of bored with it.
1031000	1037000	Well, but that was also not really a mainline game either. That was intended to be a different, you know, type of game that just...
1037000	1042000	Well, originally it was supposed to be in the XIII canon, if I'm not mistaken.
1042000	1044000	Yeah, which I don't see how that would have worked at all.
1044000	1053000	But all the games in the XIII canon ended up becoming different things, because remember, Final Fantasy XV was supposed to be Final Fantasy XIII Versus.
1053000	1060000	Which I don't even have, like, an idea of how that would tie into each other.
1060000	1070000	Well, my thought, because this game's been tied up so fucking long, obviously at one point they moved it from the PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 4, and, you know, Microsoft equivalents.
1070000	1073000	And I think they went back and probably completely changed the battle system.
1073000	1079000	I wouldn't wonder... Well, no, because I want to say in the early stuff, for Versus, it did have more of an action battle.
1079000	1085000	Like, people were kind of, even in their early days, were saying it looked more like a Kingdom Hearts game or something.
1085000	1092000	So, I don't know what's been holding up that game, but I imagine it's just been going through a lot of different design changes and so forth.
1092000	1098000	And maybe they realized the story really didn't have a lot to do with XIII, so they just made it a mainline game at some point.
1098000	1105000	But I will buy Final Fantasy XV. Well, I already have it pre-ordered. It's coming. I don't plan on canceling it.
1106000	1108000	What's that supposed to be coming out?
1108000	1112000	I always get Final Fantasy games the day they come out. September 30th. It's the big day.
1112000	1115000	Like, we actually have a date now. I don't know if you realize that.
1115000	1117000	No, I didn't realize that.
1117000	1123000	It's happening! Although, you know it's not happening soon enough in Final Fantasy XV world.
1123000	1130000	That Florence and the Machine single for Stand By Me, that is the song for Final Fantasy XV. Have you heard this at all?
1130000	1131000	No.
1131000	1138000	That's the new song. It's Florence and the Machine, and it's a cover of Stand By Me, the old song from the 50s.
1138000	1140000	I can't imagine how that would sound.
1140000	1143000	But they incorporated the Final Fantasy theme into it.
1143000	1144000	Huh.
1144000	1150000	It's really rad. I have to bring up a little clip of it so that you can hear that here.
1150000	1155000	Let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1155000	1160000	Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf saying, you want to know what game I think looks like a Kingdom Hearts game?
1160000	1166000	Kingdom Hearts III. Well, yes, there is that. Although, we haven't really seen a lot of Kingdom Hearts III.
1166000	1168000	When do you think that one's coming out?
1169000	1171000	Will we see Kingdom Hearts III next year?
1171000	1172000	I don't know. Maybe next year.
1172000	1175000	It's not going to be a PlayStation 5 game at this point.
1177000	1180000	I don't know. Let's see.
1181000	1182000	Uh...
1183000	1190000	SSG100Matt says, no hoverboards, no Wi-Fi, no dice, and attributes that to millennials.
1190000	1192000	So there you go.
1193000	1199000	I'm actually trying to bring this up so that Loki can hear this. If I can find a clip of this.
1199000	1202000	Okay. Let me see if I can find this here.
1204000	1207000	A little clip of the Florence and the Machine during Stand By Me.
1210000	1212000	Here you go.
1223000	1226000	See, it has the crystal theme in the background.
1226000	1238000	Anyway, a little clip there. I kind of laughed when they unveiled that as a song.
1238000	1245000	I laughed in a good way because I was like, with all the talk about what a bro trip game this is supposed to be and everything.
1245000	1252000	The fact that it's that song and a lot of people instantly associate that song with the movie from the 80s.
1252000	1256000	Which was about, you know, four boys going on an adventure to find a dead body.
1256000	1260000	When Stephen King did it, it wasn't even called Stand By Me. It was called The Body, I believe.
1260000	1263000	It was like a short story in one of his collections.
1263000	1264000	That's very funny.
1264000	1266000	Yeah, kind of funny how that worked out.
1266000	1269000	Alright, anyway. So, lots of tangents.
1269000	1271000	Talking about Final Fantasy stuff.
1271000	1276000	Let's get into the types of video games that we have been playing this week and then we'll get into this week's news.
1276000	1280000	We're going to do a little bit of how was your gaming week and starting off with Loki tonight.
1280000	1281000	How was your gaming week?
1281000	1286000	So, I actually purchased another game for the Wii U. I have Mario Kart 8 now.
1286000	1288000	Oh, it took you long enough. That one's fun.
1288000	1293000	Yeah, so I got that because, I don't know, I just thought it'd be cool.
1293000	1295000	So, I played a little bit of that.
1295000	1298000	And then, more Enter the Gungeon.
1298000	1304000	And, surprisingly I haven't played any Fallout 4 this week even though they did release another update.
1304000	1306000	You know, the other piece of DLC.
1306000	1311000	So, I do have to check that out eventually, but I just haven't gotten to it yet.
1311000	1319000	I'm on a new work schedule, so I get very tired at night instead of, like, actually playing a lot of games.
1319000	1322000	What else? Ingress a little bit.
1322000	1325000	Actually, last week I did play quite a bit of Ingress and walked around and everything.
1325000	1328000	Yeah, I think that's about it.
1328000	1331000	That Enter the Gungeon game.
1332000	1336000	I saw that on PlayStation 4 and I was going to buy it and then I got distracted and didn't.
1336000	1339000	But, I'm hearing a lot, a lot of great things about that game, like, everywhere around the internet.
1339000	1343000	Now, you talked about that a little bit on the last show because you love the soundtrack.
1343000	1346000	Yeah, and they have a trailer for, like, the game that's all animated and it's awesome.
1346000	1349000	You gotta check that out. It goes with the music and everything.
1349000	1351000	But, yeah, that game's pretty fun.
1351000	1355000	Why do you think so many people are loving that game?
1355000	1358000	The music's great. The art style's pretty awesome.
1358000	1361000	I thought everybody was getting sick of the retro thing.
1361000	1364000	It's not really retro. I mean, it's retro, but it's, like, it's just all cohesive.
1364000	1369000	So, it's all very gun-themed. You know, the bullets that, you know, have guns and everything.
1369000	1373000	And it's just cutesy. I don't know. It's just, like, a pretty cool art style.
1373000	1374000	It's cute guns!
1374000	1379000	Yeah, it's cute little bullets that are, like, you know, shooting things and there's, like, everything.
1379000	1381000	All sorts of gun-themed things.
1381000	1383000	Hello Kitty guns, maybe?
1383000	1386000	They have a gun. Well, they have all sorts of guns that are in the game.
1386000	1388000	I haven't gotten a lot of them. A lot of them shoot weird things.
1388000	1390000	Like, they have a shark gun.
1390000	1394000	You know, like, squirt guns and all sorts of weird stuff.
1394000	1396000	Alright. I'm gonna have to check the game out.
1396000	1399000	I just, you know, this week, this week kinda was crazy.
1399000	1400000	So, my gaming week.
1400000	1404000	Honestly, I didn't play a lot, a lot of new stuff. I'm gonna be honest.
1404000	1409000	I've been spending a lot of my gaming time in Final Fantasy XIV, which is just kinda my,
1409000	1413000	I don't wanna say brainless MMO time sync, but it's maybe like that,
1413000	1417000	you just kinda hit that zen thing where it's like, alright, I have this goal in mind
1417000	1420000	and my goal is to get my Dark Knight up to level 60,
1420000	1424000	so that way I have every single class from Heavensward 60.
1424000	1429000	I don't have any other jobs level 60, but I have astrologian, machinist, and soon I'm gonna have,
1429000	1433000	I'm level 58 on Dark Knight, so I will have all of those level 60s.
1433000	1435000	It's kinda like a thing I'm going for.
1435000	1440000	So, it's like every day, it's like, okay, log in, do a random dungeon for XP, do dailies,
1440000	1442000	and, you know, just kinda, kind of a zen thing.
1442000	1445000	But because of that, I haven't been playing a lot, a lot of console games.
1445000	1452000	I did end up, thanks to a nice listener, I did end up getting a beta key for the Mirror's Edge catalyst,
1452000	1456000	which has been going on this weekend, but I think there's still a couple more days left with it.
1456000	1459000	So, I wanna definitely get in on that in the next couple days before it's down.
1459000	1464000	Speaking of betas, though, that kinda came and went, I tried the Battleborn beta.
1464000	1466000	Did you check that out on PlayStation 4 at all?
1466000	1467000	No, I had no interest in that.
1467000	1474000	I couldn't get into it, you know, but at the same time, it's just, I kinda also recognize it's just kinda like not my kinda game.
1474000	1479000	So, like, don't listen to my review if you're on the fence about Battleborn, because I just couldn't get into it.
1479000	1486000	But keep in mind, I maybe was not also in the best, like, you know, this week has been a lot of ups and downs, right?
1486000	1492000	So, sometimes I might just kinda start a game and just be like, you know what, I'm not here for this right now.
1492000	1498000	And unfortunately, with the beta, there's only so much time to do it and kinda base your decision off of that, yeah, I don't know.
1498000	1500000	But I just don't think Battleborn was gonna be my type of game.
1500000	1507000	Plus, Sony, after I've played the beta, I can't get that shit out of my fuckin' library, thank you very much.
1507000	1511000	Oh, not even going into your library and, like, deleting it from there? I thought you could do that.
1511000	1513000	You can delete it, but the entry's still there.
1513000	1514000	Oh, I didn't realize that.
1514000	1516000	Yeah, you can't actually remove it.
1516000	1521000	I think, like, the Destiny alpha is still in my frickin' library somewhere, yeah.
1521000	1524000	Well, I also played the beta for Doom.
1524000	1532000	And I liked that a little more because it reminded me of the old school Doom games, but because, you know, again, it's a beta.
1532000	1539000	And I realized I should not be making a judgment on if I'm gonna buy the game or not off of beta, but let's be real, it's what a lot of us do.
1539000	1549000	As far as Doom, I enjoyed it and I liked that it really felt like a throwback to the multiplayer in the older games with the nicer graphics and so on.
1549000	1556000	I just wanted to be able to have more control to maybe just battle single player versus bots and things like that, but I get it.
1556000	1561000	It's a beta, they need to test the multiplayer, so I also had to find that out separately.
1561000	1570000	I may still end up picking up Doom just to dink around in the single player modes and take things a little different pace than playing online with people who've probably spent all day playing online.
1570000	1574000	Did you check out the sale this week on PlayStation Network? They have a lot of $8 games on there now.
1574000	1580000	Yeah, I wanted to pick up Beyond Two Souls, but I just didn't get around to buying it this weekend.
1580000	1582000	They had Little Big Planet 3 for $8.
1582000	1583000	I already have that.
1583000	1587000	And I'm like, I don't have it yet, but I'm like, am I really gonna play this? Probably not.
1587000	1594000	$8? Yeah, I think it's worth a look for $8. Little Big Planet 3 is still a worthy platformer.
1594000	1597000	It'll be down cheaper later.
1597000	1598000	We'll see.
1599000	1602000	And then betas. Just beta, beta, beta is all I've been playing.
1602000	1608000	I also played Overwatch, had an open beta, because it's the only way I can seem to play it.
1608000	1615000	Because I don't get Blizzard's logic with the whole super special secret club people that they let in.
1615000	1622000	Because it just gets very frustrating to see all these people on your Twitter timeline that are playing the beta and have been for months.
1622000	1627000	And then it's like, oh, but you're not, for whatever reason, you're not cool enough to be in it.
1627000	1632000	And I don't know. It kind of makes you resent it a little bit and just be like, well, fuck this game.
1632000	1633000	But I did try it.
1633000	1636000	Why did you pick me? I support you all the time.
1636000	1640000	Exactly. Like, I was rooting for you. I played Diablo day and all night.
1640000	1643000	And actually, I played Diablo this week too, because the season finally ended.
1643000	1648000	But anyway, so I played a little bit of Overwatch during the open beta.
1648000	1651000	And I got to admit, it's a slick little game.
1651000	1655000	And of all the betas I played this weekend, I probably had the most fun with Overwatch.
1655000	1660000	And I played it before they had an open beta maybe two months ago that I also played in.
1660000	1663000	And I was kind of like on the fence about it.
1663000	1666000	But I just, I played some characters in this one.
1666000	1670000	And man, the character design, Blizzard does such a good job with character design in the game.
1670000	1679000	So, you know, they got just some really neat characters that you just, you want to play with and see their little catchphrases and see how they all kind of play a little differently.
1679000	1686000	I was playing a character this time in the beta named Symmetra? Symmetria?
1686000	1690000	Hopefully. Sorry, I'm totally butchering that if there's any Overwatch fans listening.
1690000	1693000	But she's the one that has the turrets on the ground.
1693000	1698000	And they actually divided the characters up into their, like, classes this time.
1698000	1702000	So you can see, here's who the tanks are, here's who the support classes are.
1702000	1707000	And I was like, oh, I like support classes because last time I played Mercy I really liked her, so I want to play Symmetra.
1707000	1714000	Because I remember playing her at BlizzCon the very first time they showed Overwatch that time.
1714000	1718000	But I didn't really like her at that time.
1718000	1723000	But this time, now that I played her during the beta, she was a lot of fun.
1723000	1730000	I loved playing with the little turrets, and she does, like, shielding, which felt a lot like a Disc Priest in WoW or something.
1730000	1732000	So I had a lot of fun playing with her.
1732000	1735000	So I think I might actually pick up the full game for Overwatch.
1735000	1741000	And then I get mad at myself because I'm like, but you're mad at Blizzard because they won't let you in the beta.
1741000	1744000	You're not supposed to like them, rawr. But I can't help it.
1744000	1750000	Like, Blizzard puts out stuff that has such good polish it's hard to ignore.
1750000	1752000	It's, like, really hard to ignore.
1752000	1756000	Say I was confusing Battleboard with Overwatch since they're both free.
1756000	1757000	Oh, were you really?
1757000	1761000	I was like, wait. I didn't play either.
1761000	1766000	Let's see. William Murderface says, the Overwatch open beta starts in about 10 days.
1766000	1769000	I thought, don't you have to actually pre-order the game to get into that?
1769000	1778000	Because you know, you can pre-pay for the game and get, like, an extra skin for one of the characters.
1778000	1782000	And I'm like, fuck that. You could pay the full, like, 60 bucks right now.
1782000	1785000	Give it to Blizzard and get the skin.
1785000	1789000	I'm like, wait a minute. Wait a damn minute. I don't like that.
1789000	1794000	I do worry a little bit, though, there may be some free-to-play.
1794000	1799000	I'm almost positive there are some free-to-play elements in Overwatch, which is a little bit double-dipping.
1799000	1801000	Which I don't know if I'm okay with that.
1801000	1810000	Because they have these little boxes that you open that will contain different quotes for your characters, different costumes, different stickers.
1810000	1812000	You know, things that don't really affect gameplay.
1812000	1816000	So I think that's why they're trying to kind of balance on this fence.
1816000	1821000	Because they don't affect gameplay, but they affect cosmetics left and right, right?
1821000	1824000	But I noticed there was an option.
1824000	1827000	You know, you get the little boxes free when you level up, but there's an option.
1827000	1832000	Go to the store. Get money. Drop some Blizzard cash and get money.
1832000	1835000	Just like you do in Heroes of the Storm, which is free-to-play.
1835000	1837000	Get all this stuff.
1837000	1840000	So I definitely think that's an element of it.
1840000	1845000	Well, wasn't it supposed to be free-to-play originally, and then they decided to do a retail game on that?
1845000	1847000	Well, it's hard to say. Nobody really knew.
1847000	1850000	Everybody assumed it was going to be free-to-play.
1850000	1856000	Because it was a multi-hero game, like Heroes of the Storm, which was free-to-play.
1856000	1860000	So I think everybody assumed it was going to be a Heroes of the Storm model.
1860000	1863000	And maybe that's why that whole part of the game is built into it.
1863000	1866000	Because maybe they were flirting with that model at one point.
1866000	1868000	But they didn't go that way.
1868000	1872000	Probably, I would assume the console releases are why they didn't do that.
1872000	1876000	When they made the decision to go console, they made the decision to no longer be free-to-play.
1876000	1879000	I just, I have a weird feeling there's a correlation there.
1879000	1885000	Yes, I know free-to-play exists on console, but does any of it do really, really well?
1885000	1892000	Like, I know there's DC Universe. I know there's another shooter.
1892000	1895000	It's on the tip of my tongue that I see advertised on PS4 all the time.
1895000	1898000	But do any of these games do really, really well?
1898000	1902000	Because I don't know. I know there's a few people that play DC Universe.
1902000	1907000	But it's not Heroes of the Storm-sized or anything like that, you know what I mean?
1907000	1914000	Over at live.vognetwork.com, William Murderface says,
1914000	1919000	You get all the characters unlocked for free, so that sort of justifies the cost.
1919000	1925000	I know Smite charges 30 for the same thing, which is less, but there is precedent for this sort of thing.
1925000	1931000	Kaijuto in chat says, Hearthstone is magic for babies. Overwatch can't even touch Dota.
1931000	1938000	Plus, Blizzard are dicks for banning the cheating in this game offline, and then told the kid they did it because they can.
1938000	1940000	I have to see more about that.
1940000	1944000	Overwatch and Dota are not the light games, though.
1944000	1949000	Overwatch is more Team Fortress 2, and Dota is more akin to Heroes of the Storm.
1949000	1954000	Just for your future rants.
1954000	1955000	Anyhow.
1955000	1958000	So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.
1958000	1960000	I played a lot of free betas.
1960000	1964000	And then Final Fantasy XIV, which I actually pay money for.
1964000	1968000	They do a lot of content updates in XIV.
1968000	1970000	Keeps me busy, keeps me happy.
1970000	1972000	So that's what it's all about, right?
1972000	1975000	Someday, XI will go free to play.
1975000	1977000	Someday. Keep on waiting.
1977000	1979000	You know XI is finally done.
1979000	1981000	That happened while we were gone at some point.
1981000	1985000	Final Fantasy XI finally sunsetted on Xbox 360 and Playstation 2.
1985000	1988000	You can no longer play Final Fantasy XI on those consoles.
1988000	1990000	It is a PC-only game now.
1990000	1996000	So I can't see that they're going to go back and suddenly do HD graphics and all this stuff.
1996000	2000000	And they've ended story support and all this stuff.
2000000	2004000	But I guess they are still working on it in some capacity.
2004000	2011000	There is a group that is still working on Final Fantasy XI, but it's very small, infrequent type of updates at this point.
2011000	2015000	So, I don't know. Don't expect any fancy graphics or anything like that.
2015000	2021000	Yeah, Alan Alchemy is saying, no more content or quality of life patches for PC.
2021000	2025000	Well, maybe quality of life. But story-wise, it's done.
2025000	2029000	S2100mattagreen with Loki in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com saying,
2029000	2032000	Still holding out for free to play Final Fantasy XI.
2032000	2037000	Well, you know one thing they do a lot of, Loki, is they do a lot of welcome back campaigns.
2037000	2043000	Like once every couple months, they do this thing where it's like, if you have ever had a Final Fantasy XI account, play for free.
2043000	2045000	They do that all the time.
2045000	2047000	Yeah.
2047000	2051000	Didn't you say you hopped on at one point recently in the past couple of years?
2051000	2057000	Yeah, I bought it again because it was like $7 for the game with all the expansions, so I played again.
2057000	2059000	And it was different.
2059000	2064000	I would even be fine playing on a modded server, like a private server or something like that.
2064000	2067000	I don't know if that's something that's out there.
2067000	2073000	I assume it is, but if it is, Square probably doesn't like it and would like to see that end.
2073000	2081000	Just like Blizzard did this past week or two with one of the really popular, I guess, underground servers, so to speak.
2081000	2088000	But the twist on this server that Blizzard finally shut down, well, they didn't go to the person's house and press the power button,
2088000	2093000	but they sent a cease and desist, which is pretty much, if you don't have the legal team to back it up,
2093000	2095000	you're going to get shut down.
2095000	2104000	But the big twist was that this server was a vanilla Warcraft server, meaning you didn't play any of the expansions on it.
2104000	2107000	It was only for regular World of Warcraft.
2107000	2110000	And there's people all the time that bitch and bellyache about,
2110000	2118000	Oh, I miss 40-man Molten Core. Those were the days when you couldn't get your mounts until level 40.
2118000	2121000	That was World of Warcraft.
2121000	2125000	None of this cross-server raiding shit.
2125000	2131000	But I kind of think a lot of that retro WoW stuff was through rose-colored glasses, in my opinion,
2131000	2137000	because they did bring a 40-man raid into the game for one of the anniversary events, and everybody was telling me it was a nightmare.
2137000	2139000	So, I don't know.
2139000	2146000	Some people out there crave it, so good for them, I guess, but unfortunately, they don't get to do it anymore because Blizzard shut it down.
2146000	2148000	So, of course, they started this whole petition,
2148000	2157000	Hey, Blizzard, if you're not going to support non-official vanilla servers, then you need to do your own vanilla server.
2157000	2166000	But, of course, it's falling on deaf ears because Blizzard, in the meantime, is rolling around naked in piles of money from people pre-paying for Overwatch,
2166000	2171000	and the additional money they're going to get from selling boxes with stickers and quotes from Overwatch.
2171000	2177000	And the fact that BlizzCon sold out in, like, what, literally six seconds.
2177000	2181000	And who cares if half the tickets went to scalpers through a cash exploit.
2181000	2184000	Blizzard is rolling around naked in their money pits as we speak.
2184000	2187000	It's just like that scene in DuckTales where Uncle Scrooge died.
2187000	2189000	That's Blizzard right now.
2189000	2191000	They could give a rat's ass about vanilla WoW.
2191000	2202000	Sorry, but if you really want Blizzard to make some changes, you have to stop pre-paying for their upcoming games.
2202000	2205000	Just throwing that out there.
2205000	2209000	Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2209000	2215000	Did you hear that Steam is going to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment?
2215000	2218000	No, I did not. I legit did not know.
2218000	2225000	Do they accept Dogecoin? Because I had a few of those at one point during the week that everybody was in Dogecoin.
2225000	2228000	I still have some of those in a Doge wallet somewhere.
2228000	2230000	I have no idea how to get...
2230000	2235000	I could be sitting on a fucking goldmine right now. I have no idea. I don't know how to log into it.
2235000	2243000	So, can I trade Doge for Bitcoin and then spend the Bitcoin to get...
2244000	2250000	What could I afford on Steam? Maybe I could get Shower with Your Dad Simulator for half off. Maybe.
2252000	2255000	Super Hexagon? 33% off? Maybe.
2255000	2259000	That's about what I could afford with all my coin.
2262000	2264000	VxjasonXV in chat says,
2264000	2270000	I'm sure you don't even have a cent of Bitcoin. Womp womp. Thanks. Appreciate that.
2271000	2278000	Hey, maybe we could open up like a Patreon for OLR. Because it's not the thing everybody's doing now.
2278000	2282000	We'll do a Patreon, but we'll accept Bitcoin.
2282000	2288000	And then it's like, we're going to just have this money pit of Bitcoin to spend on...
2288000	2290000	Nothing.
2290000	2294000	Steam games. Enhance our library. I don't know.
2295000	2299000	Wyland says, pay me tons. Is that a thing? It must be.
2299000	2303000	Surely somebody has already invented the Patreon that is nothing but Bitcoin.
2303000	2307000	Surely that is a thing out there. I'm just not well educated.
2307000	2311000	Listen, we need lots of money to be able to talk on this show.
2314000	2317000	Please fund Loki's fast food habit.
2317000	2324000	Ugh. I'm on the KFC today. I swear. They're just not good.
2325000	2332000	Alright. Wyland says, pay me tons goals. That was a thing? Alright, I'm going to look into that.
2332000	2339000	I'm going to, just because Jason said, just because Jason said, I bet you don't even have a cent of Bitcoin.
2339000	2344000	Well, Jason, I am motivated big time by spite.
2344000	2350000	I'm going to raise one whole dollar of Bitcoin by the time this is done. You hear me?
2351000	2360000	Dungeon Buster says, donate five dollars and watch Loki eat a burger. Could we have that happen?
2362000	2364000	Alright, look. I'll do that without five dollars.
2364000	2368000	I don't want to make people think that I'm making fun of the cryptocurrency stuff.
2368000	2372000	I actually find that whole culture fascinating, for what it's worth.
2372000	2376000	Just the fact that you can kind of invent this digital currency.
2376000	2379000	And it does, I do actually really find it fascinating.
2379000	2382000	And that's why I did get into Dogecoins for the short time that I did.
2382000	2389000	But, yeah, it still seems like it's taken a while for it to become super mainstream. But we'll see.
2389000	2394000	Alright, let's move on. We got to do some quick housekeeping and then we'll get into gaming news.
2394000	2398000	As far as housekeeping tonight, follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2398000	2404000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Google Plus as well at Orange Lounge Radio.
2404000	2410000	As far as I know, no upcoming shows off for a while until we get to Dragon Con.
2410000	2412000	But, God, the way things have been going lately.
2412000	2413000	Who can tell?
2413000	2415000	I know. Who can tell?
2415000	2420000	But we are going to do our very best to be here with you every Sunday from here on out.
2420000	2423000	I do want to give a quick shout out, by the way. This is a pretty big deal.
2423000	2428000	If you're an Android user and you have the Google Play and the Google Music on your phone,
2428000	2431000	we are now in the Google Play Podcast.
2431000	2437000	That started on Monday, actually, where Google Play has its own podcasting built in now.
2437000	2440000	So you can actually look for Orange Lounge Radio. We are there.
2440000	2443000	There's several other VOG shows as well in the store.
2443000	2450000	I am not an Android user myself, I must admit. I've been an iPhone user for years and years.
2450000	2453000	So judge me if you want, but I don't care.
2454000	2459000	But Alan is an Android user and he's been trying to show me what it looks like and so forth.
2459000	2462000	I was looking around online and so forth.
2462000	2470000	You can't really rate shows or anything like that, but you can at least subscribe and get the new shows in your library, which is great.
2470000	2481000	Especially if you are still using a third-party thing on Google Plus that, for whatever reason, is not updating OLR in a timely fashion, like Stitcher Radio,
2481000	2491000	then maybe you want to consider switching to Google Play Podcasts because I checked and all our latest stuff is pushing out to Google Play Podcasts, so things look great.
2491000	2494000	If you do want to use third-party, though, TuneIn is pretty awesome as well.
2494000	2503000	And the reason why I like TuneIn is that not only can you use that to listen to the OLR archive, but you can also use TuneIn to listen to VOG when we're live.
2503000	2508000	So it's like one app kind of does both. So that's why I kind of like TuneIn and why I recommend that.
2509000	2516000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Under 80 with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, push.
2516000	2523000	Alright, and some comments on the Google Play thing from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2523000	2528000	Alan says, it's kind of buried. You need to click on there. We have podcast now banner to go straight to it.
2528000	2534000	Otherwise, you need to click on my library under music and look for podcasts in the menu.
2534000	2541000	I'm also told, and this is very important because I sometimes forget to remember, we have an audience that's bigger than just the US and Canada.
2541000	2546000	We're very fortunate for that. But the podcast thing is not worldwide yet, from what I understand.
2546000	2551000	So you may have to wait a little longer for the podcast thing to hit your country, just so you know.
2551000	2556000	Let's see, nss2100matt says, fastest way to listen to OLR is to listen live.
2556000	2559000	But in all seriousness, the more platforms, the better.
2559000	2569000	That's what I say. As long as like a third party isn't profiting off our show without, you know, giving us a little kickback or whatever.
2569000	2575000	Like I pretty much am all for getting our show out there wherever.
2575000	2580000	So I don't even really care if people torrent this and put it out somewhere.
2580000	2585000	Because yeah, my thought is somebody might find it and decide, oh, hey, I want to listen to it live someday.
2585000	2589000	And then our live audience grows, we get more participants, and it's awesome.
2589000	2594000	So raginator says, I use iTunes to download podcasts as a stream vog.
2594000	2599000	Yep. For the iPhone people, you know, the iTunes podcast, it's kind of had some ups and downs.
2599000	2604000	But it works enough to use Orange Launch Radio and stream your podcast there.
2604000	2610000	But it's nice that Android has something that's kind of like built in now. It doesn't have to rely on third party.
2610000	2616000	All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Loki, start us off tonight.
2616000	2623000	So Microsoft has finally sunsetted the Xbox 360. They're not going to be manufacturing any more consoles.
2623000	2629000	But they will be selling off their initial supply, whatever is currently left.
2629000	2637000	Of course, along with that, they are going to be still continuing on with the Xbox Live service for those consoles.
2638000	2648000	You know, games of gold and your party support, that's all going to stay, you know, working for the time being.
2648000	2655000	I'm sure eventually they'll shut it off. But yeah, had a good run.
2655000	2660000	That's going to be weird when they shut off the Xbox 360. That's going to be very weird.
2660000	2667000	And I wonder what kind of pushback the populace is going to have with that.
2667000	2670000	Because I'm sure there's still games people will want to play online.
2670000	2674000	Just like happens when the EA server shut down and all that stuff.
2674000	2679000	But you know, it'll be interesting when there's no more store on Xbox 360.
2679000	2684000	That'll be the last plug they pull. But it's going to be interesting when there's no more store.
2684000	2688000	Well, I mean, I would hope that they would keep those servers still online.
2688000	2696000	I mean, they have all those Cloud Azure servers or whatever that they are going to be using for different things.
2696000	2701000	Including on Xbox One, two, like, you know, for processing of different games and things.
2701000	2706000	I'd hope that they'd be able to utilize some of that for keeping those consoles online.
2706000	2709000	Maybe that might be something that they'll do. I don't know.
2709000	2714000	It's all going to be whether it's cost effective for them. If there's people actually using it.
2714000	2721000	Because they won't shut them off until there's really no one online for the Xbox 360.
2721000	2724000	Well, and this news isn't too terribly shocking either.
2724000	2732000	Especially as they try to get more and more of the backwards compatibility of at least the biggest selling games on the Xbox One.
2732000	2735000	At least they can say, hey, there's still a place where you can play 360 games.
2735000	2741000	It's on the Xbox One, but invalid to me until they get Lost Odyssey working, that's for sure.
2741000	2744000	They still need to get Mass Effect 2 and 3 working on there too.
2744000	2746000	They got the first one, but not the better games.
2746000	2752000	So, yeah, there's still a lot to be done on the 360 front, in my opinion.
2752000	2757000	But, I mean, is anyone really shocked that this is happening?
2757000	2758000	No.
2758000	2759000	Probably not, no.
2759000	2763000	Are they still making PlayStation 3? They are still making those, right?
2763000	2764000	Maybe.
2764000	2770000	I imagine that, yeah, well, didn't PlayStation 2 just end support not that terribly long ago?
2770000	2775000	So PlayStation 3, you know, will probably still be going for a couple more years.
2775000	2778000	But, you know, there will come a day where Sony pulls the plug on that too.
2778000	2782000	Because, you know, there's no more market for it.
2782000	2788000	There's no more price that it fits in as the current generation of consoles gets cheaper and cheaper and more affordable and so forth.
2788000	2792000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2792000	2799000	Cajudo in chat says games like GTA 4 and Red Dead will still be playable since they use System Link.
2799000	2802000	That's why System Link and LAN is always good.
2802000	2804000	GTA 4 is not System Link, unfortunately.
2804000	2807000	Oh, is there no patch or anything shady to it?
2807000	2813000	There is. There's nothing for GTA 4. However, Red Dead is System Link, so that is awesome.
2813000	2820000	Saints Row is System Link, though. One and two. But not Grand Theft Auto 4, unfortunately.
2820000	2821000	That would have been nice.
2821000	2829000	SSG100Matt pointing out an interesting kind of parallel here, saying they're shutting down the Xbox Live indie game servers in the next two years.
2829000	2833000	I wonder if it'll be some time after that that they will shut it all down.
2833000	2840000	And AkumaJP pointing out there's still new limited edition PlayStation 3s here in Japan.
2840000	2845000	So PlayStation 3, not quite in the same boat right now.
2845000	2848000	It's just Xbox 360 is done for the now.
2849000	2861000	It'll be interesting to see what Microsoft's vision is, because Microsoft is trying to do this whole PC, Xbox One Synergy thing in a way they didn't really do with 360.
2861000	2864000	So it'll be interesting to see what Microsoft's going to look like.
2864000	2866000	Well, they keep talking about it, but I don't see that yet.
2866000	2867000	How so?
2867000	2870000	What Synergy is there with the PC right now?
2870000	2874000	Well, there's the whole fact that you can play the Xbox One stuff on the PC.
2874000	2886000	You can't really do streaming PC onto your Xbox One that I know of yet, but I think that's just an E3 away from something like that.
2886000	2887000	They're pretty cool.
2887000	2897000	I mean, if the Xbox One could do kind of what the Steam Link does basically with PC games, and it's not a terribly complex procedure, I really think that's just an E3 away.
2897000	2900000	If it's not already doing something like that, I'm just completely not aware.
2900000	2904000	Because it does stream media, right? Because Xbox One would do that.
2904000	2907000	Forgot to mention, I did try out the PlayStation 4 streaming.
2907000	2912000	Yeah, that doesn't work well with my laptop at all.
2912000	2916000	Oh yeah, no, you didn't mention this on the last show. It was very, very slow and didn't work well.
2916000	2917000	Yeah, it's just unplayable.
2917000	2919000	I haven't tried it yet, I must admit.
2919000	2923000	Kaijuto pointing out, oh shit, I thought it was System Link, Grand Theft Auto 4.
2923000	2925000	Fuck, well, there's the PC version.
2925000	2927000	That is true.
2927000	2928000	That is true.
2928000	2933000	All right, so rest in peace, I guess, Xbox 360.
2933000	2938000	Although, you know, no great console dies forever.
2938000	2942000	We still talk about Super Nintendo on this program.
2942000	2948000	And we still talk about the Sega Genesis, NES, Atari 2600, just Xbox 360.
2948000	2954000	What I'm hoping for, because they do have, you know, tunneling and everything with, you know, LAN stuff for those consoles.
2954000	2962000	But after they do shut it off, like some sort of independent Xbox Live that they could tie into or something like that, that'd be pretty awesome.
2962000	2963000	Yeah, it'd be interesting.
2963000	2969000	It'd be interesting to see what they're going to do when that sort of endgame hits, but I think we're still a couple years away from that for sure.
2969000	2977000	It will probably be to the point where we're looking at the Xbox One successor before they go that far and pulling the plug completely on the Xbox 360.
2977000	2979000	I really do think we're going to have to go that far.
2979000	2981000	But we'll see, we'll see.
2982000	2990000	Any Xbox 360 memories, Loki? Is there a particular game, is there a particular thing about the 360 that you think, you know, it's kind of one of those,
2990000	2997000	this is where the Xbox 360 will be remembered for me as the great gaming accomplishment?
2997000	3000000	Probably Grand Theft Auto IV.
3000000	3001000	Mm-hmm.
3001000	3003000	Because I play the crap out of it.
3003000	3006000	And you were once a top 10 player, right?
3006000	3007000	Top 60.
3007000	3009000	Oh, I thought you were all the way in the top 10 at one point.
3009000	3016000	It's hard to get beyond that because after a while, like when you play those really good people, if they're losing, they just quit.
3016000	3027000	And there was no penalty for quitting, so it's hard to excel past that because you have to play the higher ranked players and if they're getting their ass kicked, they just quit.
3027000	3028000	So, yeah.
3028000	3038000	I was talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show, but I think one of the great, for better or for worse, I think one of the greatest things the Xbox 360 gave us was the Xbox Live Arcade.
3038000	3043000	And the fact that, you know, you could download little games.
3043000	3045000	At the time, it was little games.
3045000	3046000	Or, go ahead.
3046000	3047000	Digital distribution.
3047000	3049000	You downloaded it for what, five bucks?
3049000	3057000	You'd get Joust or you'd get an original like Geometry Wars that in some ways, in some ways Geometry Wars was the system seller in the beginning for some people.
3057000	3059000	Well, Xbox in the games was pretty cool.
3059000	3067000	And then also Xbox Minecraft because that really, you know, launched the whole console Minecraft.
3067000	3068000	That's true.
3068000	3069000	And it did incredibly well.
3069000	3071000	That's true. The Xbox 360 is the home.
3071000	3079000	You can actually hear our voice in an Xbox 360 game on the Indie Marketplace in Bungie Ferret Tossing.
3079000	3083000	We're in the opening credits there, so that's pretty cool.
3083000	3086000	This is something we can kind of tip our hat with the 360 too.
3086000	3091000	But I do think Xbox Live Arcade, I think, certainly like changed gaming as we know it.
3091000	3093000	You know, it was kind of the beginning of the digital distribution.
3093000	3100000	And even though it was very much like a drip feed of games in the beginning and it was a lot of reimagining of older games,
3100000	3106000	because I'm such a retro gaming nerd, I loved that the early stuff was all retro games.
3106000	3107000	I really loved that.
3107000	3116000	And even discovered some games that I missed out on in the 80s through, you know, the reimaginings that came out on Xbox 360.
3116000	3118000	So I'll kind of always remember it for that.
3119000	3122000	Hopefully they get more and more and more backwards compatibility on Xbox One.
3122000	3127000	Because I got to admit, I love turning on the Xbox One and looking at the games library and then all of a sudden,
3127000	3132000	shit, this arcade title I bought back in the day on 360 is suddenly like backwards compatible.
3132000	3134000	Something random like Galaga to show up.
3134000	3139000	I'm almost afraid to check out what my download list looks like for Xbox Arcade.
3139000	3143000	I mean, I've over 100 titles, I know that.
3144000	3147000	S2100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3147000	3151000	Xbox Live and Xbox Live Arcade in a way hurt real life arcades.
3151000	3159000	Yeah, I mean, you know, you could really, I mean, when we talk about Xbox Live, I really attribute that to the original Xbox.
3159000	3166000	But certainly, you know, the Xbox 360 kicked up that game a whole nother notch.
3166000	3172000	You know, and I think because it made living room gaming with your friends something more and more that you could do.
3172000	3178000	Across a great distance. Yeah, I think it did have a huge impact on arcade culture and all that.
3178000	3182000	Because people didn't need to go out to arcades anymore to drop a quarter to play with friends.
3182000	3185000	So, you could do it across the internet.
3185000	3188000	So, yeah, it was a huge impact on culture.
3188000	3192000	Alright, let's move on. More gaming news.
3192000	3196000	We talked about Blizzard earlier in the show and we talked about Overwatch.
3196000	3201000	And Overwatch, you know, is what came after an MMO that Blizzard was working on.
3201000	3204000	Not World of Warcraft, but an MMO called Titan.
3204000	3209000	Titan was in the works for years and years and years over at Blizzard.
3209000	3217000	And in a very interesting interview over at GameSpot that was done with the Blizzard designer Jeff Kaplan this week,
3217000	3225000	he had some very interesting words for Titan as it was an MMO saying that the development team failed horrifically.
3226000	3230000	Now, he said, you know, he wasn't trying to like throw his team or whatever under the bus, but he said,
3230000	3233000	you had a really amazing group that was working on Titan.
3233000	3237000	They were really talented individuals, but we failed horrifically in every way.
3237000	3240000	In every way that a project can fail. It was devastating.
3240000	3243000	You had these people who came from other companies or from within Blizzard
3243000	3247000	and who were used to working on games that were very successful, like World of Warcraft, for example.
3247000	3254000	To go through such a complete and utter failure is very hard for people who are used to experiencing success.
3254000	3261000	So, but what's weird is that there, he talks about it was a failure. We never really figured out why.
3261000	3266000	I mean, we can kind of read it between the lines that the game wasn't fun, or maybe it was,
3266000	3271000	I kind of read it between the lines that it might have been too ambitious.
3271000	3276000	And so it might have been a spore like situation, if you remember the spore,
3276000	3283000	where like the whole game, the sum of the parts didn't add up to a whole game that was really fun to play.
3283000	3287000	And that's the impression I'm getting from what Titan is, because my understanding,
3287000	3291000	and again, this is just a bunch of rabble rabble and rumors and all that,
3291000	3297000	is that Overwatch was essentially one part of Titan.
3297000	3302000	Now, it's been fleshed out and fully realized as an entire game,
3302000	3306000	but I guess you could say maybe like there was an away mission type of thing.
3306000	3311000	Like I kind of think like Mass Effect, like you could do like the multiplayer was like an away mission type of thing
3311000	3317000	that was kind of like second to the rest of the game, but like this Overwatch was kind of born of that one element of it.
3317000	3322000	And so here's the game that we have now. But, you know, Overwatch is very polished.
3322000	3328000	A lot of people saying very positive things about it, even though, yes, there's the similarities to Team Fortress 2 there.
3328000	3334000	I think there's just much more diversity in the character, like the abilities and so forth,
3334000	3337000	that makes it feel like a whole different game, Overwatch.
3337000	3344000	So, you know, hopefully they're feeling a little better, even though, you know, that was years and years and years of development
3344000	3348000	that ended up being, I guess, thrown away or just turned into Overwatch,
3348000	3351000	which hopefully will recoup a good chunk of that money and then some.
3351000	3359000	But, yeah, it's just weird to hear that, that, you know, they spent all that time on this MMO and it just, it was not good.
3359000	3362000	And Blizzard decided not to release it.
3362000	3363000	That's too bad.
3363000	3368000	You always got to wonder what other types of games companies make and they spend a long time on, only just not to release them.
3368000	3374000	Well, I mean, we do get examples. We know there's big games that get cancelled all the time.
3374000	3376000	The Fable thing, we were just talking about a couple weeks ago, right?
3376000	3380000	There was a Fable game that was coming out on Xbox One and all of a sudden Microsoft was like, you know what, no.
3380000	3384000	And then they scanned the whole studio. I was like, dang.
3384000	3387000	You know, it's kind of, wow, you got to wonder.
3387000	3394000	At least, at least that game people got to play at 1E3. At least it showed up at some point.
3394000	3396000	Titan never showed up.
3396000	3403000	We're just left to believe that Overwatch is kind of like a part of what Titan may have been.
3403000	3405000	But we don't really know.
3405000	3409000	So, all right, let's move on. Loki.
3410000	3415000	So, there's been a lot of talks about an upgrade to the PlayStation 4.
3415000	3422000	You know, whether it be like a 4.5 or I guess they're referring to it as a PlayStation 4 Neo.
3422000	3430000	So, the rumors regarding this, apparently the Neo is going to feature a higher clock speed than the original PlayStation 4,
3430000	3433000	improved GPU, and higher bandwidth on the memory.
3433000	3440000	And they've had different documents received about the note that the hard drive in the Neo is the same as the original PlayStation 4.
3440000	3445000	Basically, you know, they're talking spec-wise, it's just a little bit faster.
3445000	3455000	But what it's supposed to do is be able to support 4K image output and requires, you know, games be like a native 1080p.
3455000	3460000	And I guess they upscaled those. And it's also supposed to have better performance on the VR games as well.
3460000	3466000	And it's supposed to sell for $400? I don't know.
3466000	3471000	And what they're going to say with this is they're not getting rid of the original PlayStation 4 as well,
3471000	3473000	but they're going to have like a base mode and Neo mode.
3473000	3479000	So, any games that come out after like October-ish, they're going to have different modes for those.
3479000	3486000	So, they're going to have like better visuals on this new system versus the current system.
3487000	3492000	I don't know. We're getting a whole mess of trouble splitting the market up that way.
3494000	3497000	I have a weird feeling too it's going to be a lot of first party games that have this,
3497000	3502000	but there might be some third parties that are like, we don't really have the resources for that shit, so no.
3502000	3504000	You know what I mean?
3504000	3507000	I just, I don't know. I think it's a really bad idea.
3507000	3512000	I mean, you're segmenting your marketplace, basically.
3512000	3519000	And eventually, I understand they're saying that all games will play on both systems, but they say that now.
3519000	3525000	But eventually, what's the point in putting out a higher spec system if you're not going to take advantage of that?
3525000	3530000	And is that going to mean that games that are going to come out are going to run like shit on the regular system
3530000	3533000	and then run okay on the other one?
3533000	3536000	I don't know. I think it's a very terrible idea.
3536000	3541000	And Microsoft is, they're rumored to be doing something similar, so I think it's just a terrible idea across the board.
3543000	3547000	Just, if you're going to put out a better spec system, put that out as a new system.
3547000	3552000	Don't just, you know, new 3DS it.
3552000	3555000	Because, yeah, that's a perfect example right there.
3555000	3564000	It's like, Nintendo is really guilty for this type of thing, and they release higher spec systems for games that are,
3564000	3567000	like a handful of games that are going to run on them, like the new 3DS.
3567000	3573000	And like, that system is kind of pointless if you think about it, because there's a handful of games that are going to run that system exclusively.
3573000	3577000	And then, you know, some games that run better on it.
3577000	3581000	And I really feel like there are no must-have games for new 3DS.
3581000	3584000	Some Nintendo loyalists would really disagree with me.
3584000	3587000	I'm sorry, I don't see a single must-have 3DS game.
3587000	3594000	Exactly. And it's just, it's kind of like, oh yeah, we really should have done that, you know, when we originally were designing the system.
3594000	3596000	New 3DS game.
3596000	3602000	Yeah. You know, we should have really had that second analog number, whatever the hell they were supposed to be doing.
3602000	3609000	You know, remember because they had that stupid, the add-on, super wide, you know, extra analog stick thing, which is dumb.
3609000	3614000	I don't know. Especially since the specs aren't that much better.
3614000	3617000	I mean, it's just slightly faster. I just don't know.
3617000	3619000	It'd be interesting to see how they sell this.
3619000	3623000	I'm really curious to see how they are going to advertise it, how they're going to sell it.
3623000	3630000	If they have some sort of program where I can trade up for it, I'm down with that. You know, that'd be kind of cool.
3630000	3634000	Oh, I'm sure GameStop is already thinking of something.
3634000	3640000	But yeah, I mean, it's just, it'd be interesting to see what exactly they're going to get out of it.
3640000	3644000	Yeah. I'm curious too. I mean, I don't have a 4K television.
3644000	3645000	No, I don't either.
3645000	3648000	Is there anything in this for me?
3648000	3650000	Slightly better looking games?
3650000	3653000	Better VR? Faster frame rates, maybe?
3653000	3661000	Why not just wait till the Neo 2, then? If this is going to set a precedent for Sony, you know, I'll deal with it like I deal with iPhones.
3661000	3664000	I'll get every other one, but I don't have to get every one when they come out.
3664000	3670000	And that's the thing too, is like, you just took pre-orders on your PlayStation VR, and you're telling me that these games aren't going to run well on the current system?
3670000	3675000	That you need this, like, you know, PlayStation 4 Neo for them to run better?
3675000	3678000	How are you selling that? I mean, seriously, that's just like,
3678000	3683000	yeah, hey, we just took pre-orders, but it's not going to run that great? Just letting you know?
3683000	3687000	That's true. Do I need to cancel my pre-order or the VR? Now I'm starting to worry.
3687000	3689000	Yeah, it's just, it's ridiculous.
3689000	3693000	We'll have to wait until E3 to see how they sell it. That's what I want to know.
3693000	3696000	Go to our chat over at live.vognetware.com. Dungeon Buster says,
3696000	3705000	psychologically, people are seeing new and upgraded Super PS4, and more than a few are upset on feeling that they have an old system.
3705000	3714000	Well, to be fair, though, this isn't something that, like, if you've ever owned an Apple product, you haven't experienced at some point, right?
3714000	3718000	And there's, you know, a lot of these upgrade things happen all the time.
3718000	3726000	So in that regard, I kind of get it, but at the same time, I'm also not convinced I need one.
3726000	3731000	And also too, you're looking at, like, you know, you're talking about apps that run differently and stuff.
3731000	3736000	We're not talking about $60 apps on the Apple systems, either.
3736000	3742000	It's just, that's a lot, you know, especially, like, if we're talking now that, like, a game's going to come out,
3742000	3746000	and I've got to wait for the reviews to come out to see how it's going to run on my system,
3746000	3750000	because it may be designed for the PlayStation 4 Neo.
3750000	3753000	It's like, oh, hey, you like that 60 frames per second frame rate?
3753000	3757000	Well, I hope you have the new system, because it's not going to get that on the other one.
3757000	3760000	I mean, I just, I don't know. We'll see.
3760000	3764000	And from what I hear, you know, with developers and stuff, they're saying that they don't like it either,
3764000	3769000	because it's, they have to prepare for all this stuff.
3769000	3771000	Yeah, if the developers don't like it, that's going to be damning.
3771000	3776000	That's why I say, like, maybe the first party games will have this whole regular mode in Neo mode,
3776000	3781000	but the third parties are going to be like, you know, we're just going to develop for the PlayStation 4
3781000	3785000	that you've already sold millions of units of, and kind of work with that.
3785000	3788000	That we can easily port over to Xbox One to get those as well.
3788000	3794000	It's also very interesting that they're doing this now, even though I think that they're pretty much like a lead platform.
3794000	3800000	Like, a lot of games run better on PlayStation 4. Is this in response to, like, the NX or something?
3800000	3806000	That is a thought, is that maybe they don't want Nintendo to have the most powerful console that's out there,
3806000	3810000	so maybe PlayStation feels the need to bump things up a little bit.
3810000	3812000	I don't think that they will, though.
3812000	3816000	I can't see Nintendo doing a high-cost system, remember?
3816000	3820000	Because they're all trying to, you know, that's the problem we've had the last few generations with Nintendo,
3820000	3826000	is they've tried to keep it budget-friendly, and so they weren't putting out these really high-end systems.
3826000	3831000	It would be a nice change, but I just don't know if I'm going to see that happening.
3832000	3836000	RageNator in chat says, to be honest, I don't see what the big deal is with 4K.
3836000	3842000	I saw Star Wars The Force Awakens in 4K, and I couldn't tell the difference between 4K and 1080p.
3842000	3846000	Hell, I still can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p.
3846000	3855000	So, I think it would depend on, you know, how big is the TV, how many pixels are you really seeing there, but yeah.
3855000	3858000	I mean, I get it, I get it. 4K is...
3858000	3859000	Well, here's the thing.
3859000	3862000	I can tell the difference, but it's not huge.
3862000	3865000	4K, I don't know if it's how well it's being adapted.
3865000	3870000	I think right now there's not a lot of content for 4K TVs, so I think that's a problem.
3870000	3874000	And it's almost like the whole 3D TVs thing all over again.
3874000	3881000	Because remember when Sony really pushed 3D, and they're going to have all these games that supported 3D, and that went away.
3881000	3886000	It's like, is this going to be the same thing, or are we going to be pushing 4K, and it's just...
3887000	3888000	You know.
3888000	3893000	One, the games aren't necessarily going to be native 4K anyway, so it's upscaling, so...
3895000	3898000	Is that really worth it? I mean, I don't know.
3898000	3902000	And games are not going to be developed in 4K for a long time.
3902000	3909000	I mean, a lot of developers hate HD as it is, because there's so much, you know, definition that has to go into the art and so forth.
3909000	3912000	Can you imagine, you know, multiply that by 4?
3912000	3919000	They don't really do 4K on PC either. I mean, it's higher resolution, but it's not 4K, I don't think.
3919000	3924000	I mean, I just don't see... I don't really see this being that popular.
3924000	3927000	I mean, what are you really gaining? I mean, is it going to be that much of a difference?
3927000	3933000	That's the problem, is each generation when we're doing this, the jump is less and less.
3933000	3937000	I mean, there's more detail, but it's just not... you're not noticing it.
3937000	3944000	It's not like you're going from VHS to DVD, and then DVD to Blu-ray, and now Blu-ray to Ultra Blu-ray or whatever.
3944000	3949000	It's not that your diminishing returns on that.
3950000	3957000	Alright, well, moving on to a game that I doubt will be in 4K, but it's still probably going to be pretty good, and that is a new game called Pyre.
3957000	3961000	Pyre was announced this past week from the makers of Bastion.
3961000	3967000	That's right, Supergiant Games, who also made the game Transistor, announced the game Pyre.
3967000	3975000	Pyre is about three wanderers living in exile in a vast purgatory called the Downside, and they're fighting for a chance to rejoin their homeland.
3975000	3988000	It will be hitting PlayStation 4 and Steam in 2017. It's a party-based role-playing game, and it was at PAX East this week, so maybe some folks got to get their hands on that.
3988000	3997000	I don't know if they'll have any callers tonight who are at PAX East, but we skipped out this year, and I know some of our other people who usually go didn't go.
3997000	4004000	However, I do know at the Voice of the Geeks Network, the gals from the Electric Sisterhood, they did go. It's in their backyard.
4004000	4014000	I would be shocked if they didn't go. They are from Boston, so they went, and they will talk about PAX East, I'm sure, on their show this week, which airs Tuesdays here at the Voice of the Geeks Network.
4014000	4026000	Hopefully they got to get their hands on Pyre, but I do know Supergiant Games, both those games, Bastion and Transistor, very stylistic sort of games, and almost a cultish type of following behind them.
4026000	4031000	So I'm sure this Pyre is going to do very well for them as well, so looking forward to checking that out.
4031000	4036000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that will be coming out a little bit sooner.
4037000	4042000	Alright. I'm not even prepared at all for this.
4042000	4045000	Good job, Loki. That's always the first thing you want to admit.
4045000	4057000	Exactly. Hey, it's true. I mean, we were talking all about this bad idea that is multiple systems in a certain generation, and I got distracted.
4058000	4065000	Anyways, we can talk a little bit while I'm looking this up about games I'm looking forward to.
4065000	4070000	I can't believe we're only two months away from No Man's Sky.
4070000	4072000	Finally!
4072000	4077000	I'm just like, I'm totally down for that. I can't wait for that to come out.
4078000	4081000	And it'd be kind of interesting to see what it actually is.
4081000	4091000	And the more I watch about it, the more interesting it looks, which is a good sign, versus something like Elder Scrolls Online, where the more I'd see about it, the less interested I'd become.
4091000	4100000	So I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out. That's on my, you know, I haven't pre-ordered it yet, but it is my day one purchase type thing.
4100000	4102000	It'll probably be a digital pre-order or something like that.
4102000	4112000	You know what else is coming soon that there was just a trailer for? I think it was this week or the week we were off. There was just a trailer for this, and this is coming spring of this year, apparently.
4112000	4117000	And that is Mass Effect, the ride at California.
4117000	4118000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4118000	4122000	Great America is, they say, spring this year. It's going to be open by summer.
4122000	4127000	But that's the thing, though. The ride, though, aren't they closing that park, though?
4128000	4140000	No, they are, and this was some huge news that came out this week as well. California's Great America, did I say Great Adventure? California Great America, which, for the longest time, everybody called Marriott's.
4140000	4142000	Because it was Marriott's.
4142000	4147000	Because Marriott owned it, and, you know, like the hotels or whatever. So, I don't know, maybe I'm just old or whatever, but I still call Marriott's.
4147000	4149000	Well, yeah, it used to be Marriott's Great America.
4149000	4154000	That's when I was a kid, and then it was Paramount for a long time, and they actually had Star Trek characters that would walk around.
4154000	4158000	They had the Survivor ride, Top Gun, everything was based off Paramount stuff.
4158000	4164000	But now it's the same people that own Knott's Berry Farm. So, it's Great America.
4164000	4176000	But the big news that came out this week, not just about the Mass Effect thing, but they are going to be pouring, speaking of California Adventure, they're going to be pouring a ton of money into a major renovation of the park.
4176000	4180000	Really? I thought they were closing it down to build more parking for the Niners' stadium.
4180000	4183000	No. No. They're doubling down on the theme park.
4183000	4185000	Nice. Okay, well that's cool.
4185000	4186000	Yeah.
4186000	4190000	I was like, yeah, ooh, Mass Effect ride. It will only be up for a few months because they're going to be closing down the park.
4190000	4191000	No.
4191000	4192000	I thought that, yeah, okay.
4192000	4203000	So anyways, so games that are actually coming out this week, we've got, let's see, Stranger of the Sword City on PlayStation Vita, including a limited edition before that as well.
4203000	4213000	The season, or a complete set of Tales from the Borderland coming out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One and PC.
4213000	4218000	The Sega 3D Classics Collection on 3DS.
4218000	4224000	And Pokemon Rumble World on 3DS as well.
4224000	4231000	You know what was supposed to be coming out, but it's probably going to be delayed again. It's Mighty No. 9.
4231000	4238000	I shouldn't laugh, but I can't help but laugh just because of how deadpan you said that and what a truth that is over there.
4238000	4244000	Alright, let's travel to Japan real quick and check out some of the releases over in Japan on the PlayStation 4 this week.
4244000	4252000	In the Ultimate Hits Collection now on the PlayStation 4, which means a price reduction for Dragon Quest Heroes.
4252000	4254000	Gets a price reduction in Japan this week.
4254000	4261000	Also, Jikuyu Powerful Pro Yakuu 2016 from Konami this week in Japan.
4261000	4265000	That's the baseball game that they have in Japan that I don't think they have.
4265000	4266000	Wow, they're making games!
4266000	4268000	I know, Konami is putting out a game, how about that?
4268000	4269000	That's surprising.
4269000	4276000	Lego Marvel's Avengers gets its release on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.
4276000	4282000	And then Punchline in regular and limited edition, which I believe is based on an anime, at least it certainly looks like it.
4282000	4286000	That is also out in Japan this week. Again, regular and limited edition.
4286000	4293000	Checking out the Wii U, you have Lego Marvel Avengers getting its Wii U release in Japan this week as well.
4293000	4298000	You know what Punchline sounds like? It sounds like it should be a fighting game starring stand-up comedians.
4298000	4304000	I know that the comedy club here in Sacramento is called the Punchline, so I can't help but, yeah, I make the same association.
4304000	4308000	I'm like, oh, it's going to be a stand-up comic game. No, it's not like that at all.
4309000	4314000	Coming out on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan, this is kind of a big deal.
4314000	4319000	Hoshi no Kirby Roboble Planet is out this week in Japan.
4319000	4323000	I kind of did one of those double takes, like, whoa, already? The new Kirby game is coming out already?
4323000	4329000	But, yeah, they didn't announce it that long ago, and it's already on its way out in Japan, so check that out this week.
4329000	4334000	Roboble Planet, the new Kirby game. Somewhere ACT-F is ordering a Japanese 3DS.
4335000	4340000	There is also a new 3DS bundle coming out this week that's a Monster Hunter cross-start pack,
4340000	4343000	as if, you know, there weren't already enough Monster Hunter packs.
4343000	4347000	But you can also get Shovel Knight in an amiibo set this week in Japan.
4347000	4351000	So you can get Shovel Knight on the 3DS and your amiibo right there with it.
4351000	4357000	And, lastly, checking out the Vita this week in Japan because the Vita still gets, like, a lot of releases in Japan.
4357000	4363000	That same Jikuyu Powerful Play Pro Yakuu 2016 is out in Japan this week on the Vita.
4363000	4366000	Eve Bust Error R in regular and limited edition.
4366000	4368000	Punch Line, also on the Vita.
4368000	4375000	And Roseto Saogare no Koju in regular and premium box from Nippon Ichi comes out this week.
4375000	4378000	This game looks kind of cool. It's, like, a stylistic kind of...
4378000	4385000	It looks like it might be a horror game that's got a very stylized, like, black and white with splashes of red sort of look to it there.
4385000	4387000	So those are your Japanese releases.
4387000	4392000	Dark Sakura would usually do the UK releases, but she's not here.
4392000	4398000	So I'm going to do my best to fill in and talk about the games that are coming out on the 26th of April in Europe.
4398000	4408000	Alienation is out on the 26th, as well as Aliens vs Pinball on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Android, iPad, iPhone, 360, PS3, Mac and PC.
4408000	4410000	And there you go.
4410000	4412000	That is it for your European releases this week.
4413000	4419000	So just another story here and then we're going to get into our classic game of the week for the week.
4419000	4424000	I'm taking it over this week. We'll let Loki do next week since we know Dark Sakura's gone next week too.
4424000	4433000	But for the pick I'm doing this week, I am picking one of my favorite games of all time that somehow has never been a classic game of the week.
4433000	4437000	So you guys try to figure out what it is while we hear this story from Loki.
4437000	4445000	So GameStop, kind of getting into the publishing game, they published a game called Song of the Deep earlier this year from Insomniac.
4445000	4450000	Or I should say they have a deal to publish that game.
4450000	4457000	They are going to be publishing games now also from Tequila Works, Ready at Dawn, and Frozenbite.
4457000	4461000	They haven't really announced which titles those are going to be yet, but some speculation.
4462000	4466000	Frozenbite just announced that Shadwin would be coming to PlayStation 4.
4466000	4474000	Tequila Works has been working on Rime and yeah, the other ones, who knows.
4474000	4479000	But interesting to see that they're doing more publishing. I remember MadCats was kind of getting into that as well.
4481000	4484000	I guess these are going to be GameStop exclusives then?
4485000	4490000	Well, GameStop's going to have to keep people going in their stores.
4490000	4494000	It's the whole digital thing we were talking about in the 360s. That becomes more and more and more.
4494000	4503000	We went there the other day actually on Friday and I was going to buy some more Disney figures, but we didn't because they didn't have any that we wanted.
4503000	4511000	And they're still doing the buy two get three free so you can't beat that on the used ones.
4511000	4524000	We did end up getting though my son Josh a Minecraft cow that you can flip it inside out and it turns into a piece of raw beef from the game.
4524000	4529000	He thinks it's awesome. He's been sleeping with it now because it's a stuffed animal.
4529000	4539000	Alright, well we are going to take a moment now to go back in time and step into the gaming vault as we visit our classic game of the week.
4542000	4551000	Every week DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game ten years old or more that she says is a classic game of the week and says,
4551000	4556000	Hey, you insufferable little brats, check out this game and worship it.
4556000	4562000	But she's not here, so this is the week I can pick Halo just to piss her off. No, just kidding. I wouldn't do that.
4562000	4573000	Because this week I am picking a game that I consider to be one of my all time favorites and probably part of the reason I'm such a big gamer as it is.
4573000	4581000	It doesn't unfortunately have a lot of music to it, but I'll try to get what there is here playing in the background a little bit.
4582000	4591000	So the classic game of the week produced by Microprose in 1991 and designed by Sid Meier.
4591000	4602000	That's right, the original Civilization is my pick for the week this week, which spawned sequel upon sequel upon sequel.
4602000	4610000	But they're all pretty good. But the original Civilization honestly is one of my, like I said several times, is one of my very favorite games.
4610000	4619000	I remember when a local PC store here in our area, they used to have like a little demo station set up where you could actually play games.
4619000	4623000	They had Civilization on it and I literally spent like two hours there.
4623000	4626000	I was going to say, how does one demo Civilization?
4626000	4629000	You just have to kind of show it on a kiosk and kind of let people play it.
4629000	4637000	And I got obsessed and I would like beg my mom and beg my dad, buy me the game, buy me, buy me, buy me, buy me, until it finally worked.
4637000	4642000	And finally I got good grades or something and we finally got this game at home.
4642000	4644000	So it was, Civilization was the game.
4644000	4649000	And you can hear the rocking ad-lib soundtrack there in the background.
4649000	4654000	Because again PCs in 91, sound blasters weren't exactly everywhere at that point.
4654000	4660000	So you didn't have a lot of like voice to speech or the real like super harmonies and things that we have now.
4660000	4664000	But Civilization was originally developed for DOS on a PC.
4664000	4667000	And there have been revisions for other platforms.
4667000	4669000	So they did do a Windows version of Civilization.
4669000	4671000	They did a Mac version as well.
4671000	4677000	Amiga, Atari ST, PlayStation had a version as well, which I must admit I've never played.
4677000	4681000	The N-Gage had one, which I really never played.
4681000	4684000	And also the Super Nintendo had a version of Civilization.
4684000	4686000	Super Nintendo also had like Sim Earth.
4686000	4688000	They had a lot of interesting stuff on the Super Nintendo.
4688000	4693000	But anyway there was also CivNet, and I played that too.
4693000	4696000	That was a huge deal. That was released in 95.
4696000	4699000	That was the first time you could play Civilization with other people.
4699000	4705000	Because the first release of Civilization, you know, 91, the multiplayer gaming thing hadn't caught on as much yet.
4705000	4707000	So it was pretty much you versus the computer.
4707000	4708000	You didn't really play.
4708000	4711000	I think you could do round robin turns.
4711000	4714000	Like you could have a hot seat that you rotate people in and out.
4714000	4716000	But that's not the most exciting way to play a game.
4716000	4719000	So they did CivNet where you could play online.
4719000	4720000	That came a lot later.
4720000	4727000	And of course Civilization, it is a mostly single player, but you could play multiplayer round robin strategy game.
4727000	4733000	You are the ruler of a Civilization, and all you start with is a settler unit.
4733000	4738000	Sometimes if you start in a shitty part of the map, it'll give you two settler units as a bonus.
4738000	4745000	But you get the settlers, and you are trying to build an empire in competition with anywhere from two to six other civilizations, depending on the game settings.
4745000	4750000	You do have to micromanage things, including what is your city building?
4750000	4752000	Where is your military going?
4752000	4753000	Where are you exploring?
4753000	4759000	Are you improving the land that your city is next to?
4759000	4761000	Are you researching the technologies you need?
4761000	4766000	Do you want technology that's going to get you better buildings that make people happy?
4766000	4771000	Or do you want technology that's going to get you better guns because you're going to overrun your enemies with guns?
4772000	4780000	And that was a big part of Civilization, which later games really kind of explored more was what kind of ruler are you going to be in?
4780000	4782000	What is your path to victory?
4782000	4787000	But even in the original Civilization, there were several different ways to win the game.
4787000	4797000	You could either just play the game out to the year 2100, in which case I guess whoever had the top score would win.
4797000	4798000	I never would win that way.
4798000	4807000	But there was also Space Age, where if you were the first civilization to build a spaceship and settle on Alpha Centauri, then you would also win the game there.
4807000	4809000	Or you could just kill everybody else.
4809000	4814000	If you dominated and overruled every other civilization in the world, you could also win the game that way.
4814000	4820000	Also, another big part of Civilization was that you could build wonders of the world.
4820000	4830000	And as you built these wonders of the world, that could be the pyramids, to the Great Wall, to more modern things like the Manhattan Project that would allow you to use nuclear weapons.
4830000	4838000	You would build these things and they would have some big benefit for your civilization that no other civilization would get.
4838000	4841000	That might be just something like plus one happiness in every city.
4841000	4847000	That might be the ability to use a certain technology that nobody else can.
4848000	4856000	And I noticed a comment in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, Dungeon Buster says, I put the pyramids in Moscow because you could.
4856000	4865000	A lot of folks remember the personalities that this game gave to the various leaders of civilizations.
4865000	4869000	Because you could play as a leader of a famous civilization.
4869000	4873000	Like you could be Abraham Lincoln was the representative they had from the Americans.
4873000	4876000	But you could be, I think Queen Elizabeth was in there from the British Empire.
4876000	4881000	You could play as Genghis Khan from the Mongolians.
4881000	4884000	Then Gandhi from the Indian civilization.
4884000	4886000	That one's kind of infamous, right?
4886000	4894000	Because Gandhi didn't exactly act like you would expect Gandhi to act because of a little bit of a bug in the way the game was coded.
4894000	4898000	Gandhi loved to use nuclear weapons more than anybody else.
4899000	4904000	And that was because originally the designers set him to be low.
4904000	4906000	Like he was the lowest of the nuclear weapons.
4906000	4915000	But there was some modifier that would in the game might cause it to go like a negative one on everybody in their chance to use nuclear weapons.
4915000	4922000	But when that happened to Gandhi it was like you were rolling back the odometer and it set it back to 900,999.
4922000	4925000	So Gandhi would nuke your ass in a heartbeat.
4925000	4929000	And so everybody remembers playing against Gandhi.
4929000	4936000	And unfortunately for such an important historical figure, what an asshole this game made him.
4938000	4942000	But we are all able to separate game from real life I would hope.
4942000	4951000	Anyway, Sid Meier of course, a great genius in game design honestly who developed this game.
4951000	4958000	Who admitted that he borrowed a lot of the technology ideas from the board game Civilization which was published in the UK in 1980.
4958000	4960000	But otherwise unrelated.
4960000	4966000	There was a board game of the computer game Haumetta that was published in 2002 however.
4966000	4973000	Apparently Meier was actually not the first designer to do a computer version of the board game Civilization.
4973000	4975000	But he's the first that actually carried it out.
4975000	4982000	Danielle Berry was going to do it after M.U.L.E. and if you ever played that, that was a really in-depth game.
4982000	4986000	And also the Seven Cities of Gold was something that was worked on by Danielle.
4986000	4989000	But then that just never came to fruition.
4989000	4997000	And then, yeah, but Meier's did Pirates and kind of ended up doing Civilization.
4999000	5002000	Civilization originally was going to be a real time game.
5002000	5007000	But Sid Meier felt it was too similar to other strategy games like Sim City.
5007000	5016000	So he decided to do something where each turn would take a predetermined amount of time and then would automatically execute.
5016000	5024000	He went back to the game after Railroad Tycoon and made sure that there was an emphasis on entertainment so that the game was fun.
5024000	5029000	He did not want to simulate a fall of Civilization despite the historical accuracy.
5029000	5033000	He didn't want the game to regularly destroy the player's country.
5035000	5043000	Originally, multiplayer alliances were omitted because the computer was using them too effectively, causing players to think that the computer was cheating.
5043000	5048000	But don't you know the computer always cheats? They always cheat.
5049000	5054000	Anyway, Civilization of course followed by several sequels.
5054000	5068000	Civ 2 in 96, Civ 3 in 2001, Civ 4 in 2005, Civ 5 in 2010, and then in 94 there was also Colonization which also got a remake in the Civilization 4 engine.
5068000	5073000	If you've never played a Civilization game, Civilization 5 is really a fine place to start.
5073000	5077000	It's probably my favorite in the entire series next to the original.
5077000	5090000	But I would not overlook, speaking of Xbox 360 and all that, Civilization Revolution, or Civ Rev for short, in 2008 that was on the 360 and I believe the Playstation 3 as well,
5090000	5097000	is a great version that I think is more similar to the first game than anything else.
5097000	5103000	But it actually kind of works on a console in ways that the other games would never work so well on a console.
5104000	5113000	There you go. There it is, your classic game of the week, Sid Meier's Civilization, and one of my absolute favorite games of all time.
5113000	5116000	Have you played the original Civilization, Logie? Are you a fan?
5116000	5124000	No, and I've got Civ, like I have several versions of Civ and Steam, but I have not played it, including Civ 5.
5124000	5133000	Well the later games get even worse with the whole, just one more turn, that's all I wanted, just one more turn, then I'll be done, I promise.
5133000	5136000	And it never works out that way.
5136000	5142000	Alright, well there's your classic game of the week, but we've got plenty more show to come.
5142000	5149000	We're going to take a quick break and when we come back, rapid fire news, Fugu question of the week, and also your calls.
5149000	5155000	We're going to take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
5155000	5160000	We're going to handle all that when we come back after a quick break with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.
5166000	5177000	Welcome back everybody to OrangeLoungeRadio, live tonight with the 638th episode of our show for this April 24th of 2016.
5177000	5181000	If you're just joining us live at the Voice of the East Network, vog.network.com.
5181000	5187000	You missed a fun part A, we were reminiscing about random Final Fantasy games, that's what happened,
5187000	5191000	and then we were talking about some of the week's news, including the PlayStation 4 redesign rumors,
5191000	5196000	as well as the sunsetting of the Xbox 360, where they're not going to be making any new consoles.
5196000	5201000	And I was getting into the classic game of the week, which I picked Civilization for this week with Dark Soccer,
5201000	5206000	she's out sick this week recovering from laryngitis, which, you know, very hard to do a radio show when you have laryngitis.
5207000	5211000	But that caused some folks in chat to be talking about, you know, some of the later Civ games,
5211000	5215000	such as Civ IV and RageNator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
5215000	5220000	best part of Civilization IV, Leonard Nimoy. Yeah, that's right, he did a lot of the voiceovers.
5220000	5224000	The later Civilization games brought new stuff, like Civ II, I remember,
5224000	5227000	which actually was probably one of my least favorite Civilization games in retrospect,
5227000	5232000	which I know some people would raise me for, but that game had like the full motion videos
5232000	5235000	when you would build the wonders of the world, and that was, you know,
5235000	5239000	that was that era when those are really big, seeing the full motion videos.
5239000	5244000	So, yeah, good stuff in those Civ games, lots of great memories.
5244000	5251000	It makes me want to go and play Civ V, only I have to book like a 14 hour window somewhere on the weekend to be able to do that,
5251000	5254000	and I don't know, I don't know if I can game like that anymore.
5257000	5260000	So this was a weird week though, I wanted to make sure we brought this up on the show at some point,
5260000	5264000	although not totally gaming related, we can kind of tie it to gaming.
5265000	5271000	But, you know, I mentioned that we were off last week because of the passing of my grandma,
5271000	5275000	it had happened, and I got the news the same day the show was supposed to be done,
5275000	5283000	and, you know, it was kind of a rough week because there was just reminders of our mortality,
5283000	5289000	I suppose, just all week long as we heard about the passing of so many people throughout the week,
5289000	5293000	including what Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond had passed away, the sassy,
5293000	5300000	which by the way, no relation, bless their heart, somebody thought when they heard that my grandma passed away,
5300000	5303000	thought it might have been that, because it actually was the same day.
5303000	5308000	And I mean, to be fair, my real, Roberts is just a radio name, it's not my real last name.
5308000	5314000	There is a tie to gaming though, wasn't she in Grandma's Boy?
5314000	5319000	Oh, probably, that's totally, yeah, I think that was her, that's totally the type of character that she would play.
5319000	5325000	But I was totally flattered, somebody would think I would have her sense of humor,
5325000	5329000	because she was one of those sassy old broads that we love, just like Betty White,
5329000	5335000	who I hope to hell is in a protective bubble immediately, just saying, after this week.
5335000	5340000	And then we lost Chyna this week, which was, you know, that was a surprise,
5340000	5344000	because Chyna was very young, but Chyna really paved the way.
5344000	5348000	And what's interesting, we had just had a conversation about wrestling on one of my other shows,
5348000	5351000	Guys on a Show, I had one of my lady friends on.
5351000	5352000	So where did she die from?
5352000	5356000	I don't know if they said, I don't know if any of the autopsy stuffs have come out yet,
5356000	5360000	and I don't want to speculate, so I don't know why she died, but she died.
5360000	5366000	And you know, she obviously broke down walls, she Hulk smashed down walls for women in wrestling,
5366000	5373000	and you know, just so much that she did in showing that women can get in there and play with the boys
5373000	5379000	when it comes to wrestling, and I'm sure Chyna had to be in one of those wrestling video games at some point, right?
5379000	5381000	She had to have been, she had to have been. So there's that.
5381000	5389000	And then, of course, the one that everybody's talking about is Prince, with the shocking passing of Prince on Friday,
5389000	5396000	which, you know, it was so similar to when Michael Jackson passed away a few years ago,
5396000	5405000	in your 50s is not that old, that's still really young, a surprise, because nobody knew he was sick,
5405000	5410000	although now people are reading into, did he know he was sick, because he said something in his last show,
5410000	5414000	he played his last show in Atlanta, probably a week before he died, and he said something like,
5414000	5419000	save your prayers, or something like that, because, I don't know, it was very cryptic stuff going on,
5419000	5421000	but anyway, I don't want to tinfoil hat too much.
5421000	5429000	But, I don't know if you know, but Prince actually had, like, a game, it was more of like a multimedia experience,
5429000	5435000	it was kind of back in the day when CD-ROM, I remember, I never played it, but I remember seeing it on the shelf,
5435000	5441000	I remember seeing it at, like, Costco, or whatever that was called, I don't think it was called Costco back in 94,
5441000	5446000	I think they called it something else, or Costco Bottom, Costco Plus, was that a thing?
5446000	5448000	Oh, that's the import store.
5448000	5453000	That's the import store. What do they call the club stores here? Price Club! That's what they were called here,
5453000	5459000	and then they got bought. Remember that? Yeah. So I think I remember seeing the Prince thing at Price Club,
5459000	5464000	amongst other, you know, video games that were out at the time, and that was more of like a multimedia experience,
5464000	5470000	because, you know, there were a lot of similarities, a lot of similarities being drawn between Prince and David Bowie,
5470000	5478000	who obviously was also a huge, unanticipated loss this past year, but just what they both did for multimedia,
5478000	5485000	and really kind of using these new experimental formats to push things forward, I mean, this was something Bowie did,
5485000	5491000	this was something Prince did, and this was right at the height, I believe the game was just the love symbol,
5491000	5498000	the experience, because that was in the years when he was going by the symbol, right, which everybody made fun of,
5498000	5503000	tongue in cheek, but, you know, when you kind of listen to the reasons why he did it, it made a lot of sense.
5503000	5511000	So anyway, just shocking stuff this week, and I just wanted to take a moment to tip my hat and, you know,
5511000	5519000	say that I know Prince is, everybody knows at least one damn Prince song, everybody's probably fucked to at least one Prince song,
5519000	5523000	let's just blow that out of there, everybody's probably fucked to a Prince song at some point in their life,
5523000	5531000	or if you haven't, you will. You know, it's just like, that's just, his music is legend, and just, God,
5531000	5537000	even if the stuff you remember most, like, you know, obviously for me, I remember when doves cry,
5537000	5543000	and I remember seeing that video on MTV back when MTV played videos, and I remember, I probably only would have been
5543000	5552000	about five, six years old, but that was the first time I saw, like, a dude on TV that was, like, pretty like that,
5552000	5558000	and yes, I realize, again, people like Bowie and stuff were doing it, you know, as well, but, you know,
5558000	5566000	with the age that I was, Prince was really the first time I remember seeing that on TV, and yet he could have the sparkles,
5566000	5573000	and the purple tights, and the assless jeans, or, I'm sorry, the assless, whatever that thing was he wore at the MTV awards
5573000	5579000	that one year, and yet he still oozed a lot of that, you know, masculinity, and he really, you know, Prince was straight
5579000	5585000	as far as I know, and he really kind of, like, bended that line a lot of, you know, what's masculine, what's feminine,
5585000	5591000	who fucking cares, that I thought was always really cool about something that he did, so, but I will say about Prince
5591000	5597000	is that if you only know, like, his older stuff, like, go listen to some of his newer records on a whim,
5597000	5603000	because, like, he puts out, like, I was just listening to the last album he did, as I'm sure a lot of you were
5603000	5608000	when you heard he passed, I listened to some of the stuff from the last album he did, and it's still very good,
5608000	5613000	I don't know why the new stuff doesn't get played on the radio these days either, but I guess, you know,
5613000	5623000	that's just radio for you, what can you do? Dungeon Buster in chat says, but David Bowie really embraced tech
5623000	5629000	going so far as to write an original song for Omicron Nomad Soul. Yes, that might be true, but I don't want to
5629000	5635000	turn it into a competition, I think they both pushed the envelopes in their own separate ways, as artists tend to do,
5635000	5641000	and there were very few people, I mean, it was an exclusive club, this club of people that embraced the online,
5641000	5647000	the CD-ROM, and all these technologies, it's a very, very, very small club that Prince and, you know, Bowie had both
5647000	5655000	belonged to. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, please realize, Prince wrote a song about Batman that people could make
5655000	5668000	love to. Accurate! That soundtrack is everything, it really is. Dungeon Buster says, Prince did everything, played
5668000	5675000	everything, and literally wrote everything, he was an incredible artist, and was also hugely protective of his music.
5675000	5680000	That's true, when you wanted to go listen to Prince music because he passed away, you weren't going to find it on YouTube,
5680000	5686000	you weren't going to find it on Spotify, you had to go to, you know, you had to buy it on iTunes, or you had to buy it,
5686000	5692000	I'm assuming it's on Tidal, or you know, some of those places, and sometimes Prince gets a lot of shit for that, but I read an
5692000	5700000	article that talked about the reasons why Prince was so protective of his music, and it kind of dates back to, you guys
5700000	5706000	know he had rocky relationships with his record companies early on, it kind of has traces in that, and when you kind of read
5706000	5712000	about it, it makes a lot of sense. So, you know, love him or hate him for that. You know, it was Prince's music, he could do
5712000	5717000	what he wants with it, for better or for worse, and if he wants to keep it protected and as locked down as he can, he has the
5717000	5723000	right to do that. Tigerclaws says, my experience with Prince was during the beginning of MTV, they used to play a lot of his
5723000	5729000	music videos, and those were my first exposure to Prince. I wasn't a huge Prince fan, but I remember hearing his music on it.
5730000	5738000	Let's see, Alan Alchemy says, the irony in homophobic idiots calling Prince fruity when the man literally couldn't turn his head
5738000	5754000	without planting a part of his face into a vulva. Accurate, accurate. Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, according to a Kevin Smith
5754000	5762000	talk, he has a huge catalog of unreleased tracks with music videos, so we may not have heard the last of Prince. Kevin Smith
5762000	5769000	also did a whole documentary that Prince locked in the same vault. Dungeon Buster says, according to one of his former producers,
5769000	5775000	there's literally enough unreleased music in there to release an album every year until the end of the century. You know, I wonder
5775000	5781000	if we're going to find out it was one of those things where maybe Prince knew he was going to be passing away, and so he was starting
5781000	5785000	to stockpile a lot of this. I mean, I kind of think he was always doing that anyway, but he especially started doing it with the
5785000	5792000	documentary and everything. Because, you know, Bowie had cancer, tragically, and was doing something, I mean, he knew Black Star was
5792000	5799000	probably going to be his last album, at least while he was still alive. And when you heard a song like Lazarus, like, those lyrics are
5799000	5807000	fucking haunting. Because, what is it? Sorry if I misquote this on the spot in live radio, but he says something like, hello, I'm in heaven,
5807000	5815000	you know, type of thing. It's like, ooh, scary. But it'll be interesting to see kind of what comes of the posthumous stuff from Prince
5815000	5823000	and so forth, but what a tragedy. Anyway, I'm sorry, I know that's not completely video games, but I think it's just something we're all
5823000	5830000	thinking about this week, so sometimes we're a little more than just video games here at OLR. But I do want to get back into video games.
5830000	5833000	Loki, you're going to start us off with some rapid-fire news, right?
5833000	5840000	Yeah. So, there was a stealth release for Mojang for a game called Crown and Council. It's on Steam.
5840000	5846000	I did play that this week. I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, because I knew you were going to bring this up, but it reminds me a lot
5846000	5849000	of an early 90s PC strategy game, which is not that bad.
5849000	5858000	It kind of looks like an early 90s PC strategy game. So, Crown and Council, you can go check that out. It's a pixelated, fast-paced strategy game
5858000	5862000	about dominating lands as a monarch and trying to keep rivals from doing the same.
5862000	5869000	It kind of plays like a board game, too. I don't know if you realize this looking at the pictures and so forth, but it plays a lot like a board game.
5869000	5873000	It reminds me of Risk or something, so check it out for sure.
5873000	5885000	Yep. And then, you know, we heard a lot about modding Smash Brothers on the Wii, but this is the first I've heard of something on the Wii U.
5885000	5892000	They have modded Ryu's skin to change him into Goku.
5892000	5902000	So, you can play as Goku now in Smash Brothers. I'm assuming as some sort of modded version of the game.
5902000	5909000	Pretty cool. I wonder if we'll get into some more of the complex stuff that they did with the last Smash game.
5910000	5916000	And then finally, you know, we've been asking the question every time we hear something about Street Fighter.
5916000	5922000	So, whatever did happen to Tekken Cross Street Fighter? And apparently, we have an answer. It's on hold for the moment.
5922000	5923000	Uh-oh.
5923000	5927000	And this is coming from Katsuhiro Harada.
5927000	5934000	That wasn't what they said like six months ago, by the way. I remember bringing this up on the show not that long ago, and they talked about,
5934000	5939000	yeah, it's still, you know, we've still got ideas. It was like a non-answer answer.
5939000	5944000	Yeah, it basically said, you know, Street Fighter V just released. A lot of people are playing it feverly.
5944000	5955000	There's a large crowd of them out there waiting, or Tekken 7. We don't split these communities, or we don't want to split these communities.
5955000	5961000	A good window in which to release Tekken Cross Street Fighter is something that's becoming difficult recently.
5961000	5963000	So, it's on the hold for the moment.
5964000	5971000	That's weird. I just feel like they're going to have to go back and build it from the ground up because, you know, again, so much time has gone by.
5971000	5974000	They have to catch it up for the current consoles, huh?
5974000	5976000	I don't know. I think they could build it up the Tekken 7 engine.
5976000	5978000	All right.
5978000	5979000	Why not?
5979000	5989000	Well, some rapid-fire news over here. I know a lot of you guys get really excited about the Games Done Quick marathons, and the announcement for Summer Games Done Quick came out.
5989000	5996000	Summer Games Done Quick will be in Minneapolis. I didn't realize they moved it from place to place, but they must, because winter was in DC, right?
5996000	6004000	So, summer is going to be in Minneapolis. It's going to be from July 3rd to July 10th, which, for a lot of people, that's good news because that means the 4th of July is right in that.
6004000	6014000	So, a lot of y'all will be off work, so I know you're just going to get on the couch in your underwear in a big tub of popcorn and watch the Summer Games Done Quick.
6014000	6027000	Some of the games you will be seeing. Catherine, Demon's Souls, Mighty Switchforce Hyperdrive Edition, Fast Racing Neo, the Tetris is coming back this year.
6027000	6030000	What do they call that? The Tetris...
6030000	6032000	Was it World Championship?
6032000	6036000	Yeah, it's the ones in Japan that aren't out here. The Grandmaster. Thank you, Darcy.
6036000	6037000	Grandmaster.
6037000	6039000	That is going to be a part of it as well this time.
6039000	6050000	Sadly, what will not be a part of it this time, P.T. I believe Flacco submitted for P.T. because you know he has one of the top three speedruns, but unfortunately I'm not seeing it in the schedule.
6050000	6056000	So, maybe for next winter. Maybe it's more appropriate as a Halloween choice. We'll see.
6056000	6068000	Some folks surprised when an extra $5 showed up in their Steam wallet, and good news, guys, that $5 credit that's showing up on Steam, that actually is not a scam or anything like that.
6068000	6077000	What is up with that is if you bought Dark Souls 3 with the Steam Controller Bundle, you were supposed to get an extra discount that actually never posted to your account.
6077000	6083000	So, Valve never really gave a big update as to why that happened, but that's what happened.
6083000	6095000	The $5 that came from Valve's MasterCard or whatever, that was a legit thing that is brought to you by if you bought the Dark Souls 3 Steam Controller Bundle. So don't worry about that.
6095000	6107000	Also, apparently it's been leaked that there is a Batman Arkham HD collection. Now, it's from a GameStop employee memo, so, you know, here's your salt lick to go with it.
6107000	6113000	But, I mean, it does make sense. It makes sense, exactly. It's kind of one of those, you know, when's this happening?
6114000	6127000	Remastered versions of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, along with the DLC, supposed to be remastered, but not in the collection, Batman Arkham Origins, but of course that was done by a different studio, so it makes sense.
6127000	6137000	But the Arkham Knight, not in this collection, but that was on PS4 anyway, so it makes sense that these games are probably coming out for the holidays.
6138000	6146000	Apparently pre-orders are going live and the game will release on June 10th, so maybe that's, I don't know.
6146000	6151000	Raginator says, aren't the Arkham games already in HD? Yeah, I mean, because PlayStation 3 is HD.
6151000	6152000	It's HD-er.
6152000	6154000	Yeah, it's more HD-er.
6155000	6158000	It's just like, why do we need 4K? I don't know.
6158000	6171000	They're going to run, it's going to be bigger, badder, and better on PlayStation 4, just like, what, God of War, or Journey, or, I mean, come on, it's not the first game to go from the PlayStation 3 up to the PlayStation 4.
6171000	6173000	There you go.
6173000	6176000	Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6184000	6190000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities, we slam those words together, we call it foogle.
6190000	6195000	And this week we asked, aren't these rumors about upgraded consoles mid-cycle interesting?
6195000	6199000	Haven't you read about the PS4 and Neo and the Xbox One upgrade rumors? What do you think of them?
6199000	6205000	Would you consider buying a PlayStation 4 and Neo, and that's what I'm calling it until we know a different name, if it was released this holiday.
6205000	6209000	Over on Google Plus, womp womp, nobody answered.
6209000	6214000	I hear Act Deft is at a tournament this evening, so that might be part of the reason why, so I don't know.
6214000	6220000	But anyway, let's go over to Facebook and read some of the answers there, where Fifth Dream says,
6220000	6227000	I have very mixed feelings about this. While Sony is trying very hard to make sure the user base isn't split between the base console and an upgraded one,
6227000	6233000	I can't help thinking that an upgraded PlayStation 4 will be all but required to get the most out of games in the near future.
6234000	6243000	Having said that, I've already made tentative plans to sell my current PlayStation 4 to a friend who's been wanting one, so I can upgrade to a Neo cheap if the rumors are true.
6243000	6250000	Fat Cylon replied, which by the way, I love that name. I think that's a new name, I don't think I've seen that before, so welcome Fat Cylon.
6250000	6255000	Uh, yep, I'll be getting one, though I'm curious how obsolete it would make my current PS4.
6255000	6261000	I could definitely use two consoles, but I'm hoping the Neo isn't so superior it renders the older version useless.
6261000	6265000	I'm sure there will be trade-in deals, but we all know how lame those can be.
6265000	6272000	End of the day, if I'm going to have a PlayStation 4 as my primary choice for gaming, it has to be the best available, so it might be a case of SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
6273000	6278000	Uh, Rettertainment says, I've been following the rumors due to the fact that these rumors are reported as news.
6278000	6283000	As far as buying one, like many things, it will depend on price, availability, and desire for the product.
6283000	6294000	Desire is the critical element. Remember, despite being available, I have yet to buy a 4K HDTV, due mostly to me not knowing of anybody who distributes content I want to watch in 4K resolution.
6294000	6298000	Um, I think Netflix does 4K, for certain things.
6298000	6306000	Well, that's the thing though, Netflix may do HD and everything, but I can tell you this much, I am not getting those types of streams through my stuff.
6307000	6308000	Yeah.
6308000	6319000	It's, I mean, even if it were to come over as 4K, I mean, it's just not gonna, you have to have the bandwidth for that, and it's gonna come in compressed, I mean, it's just gonna look not good.
6319000	6329000	I think a lot of it too is like documentaries and nature stuff, like, let's fly around Yellowstone in an airplane, or let's look at volcanoes erupting in Hawaii in 4K.
6329000	6334000	Like, and this, this is the same type of stuff whenever there's new technology, it always starts with the National Geographic stuff.
6334000	6335000	And here's the problem.
6335000	6339000	And I'll tell you why 4K is just not working out right now.
6339000	6342000	It's cause there's no porn in 4K.
6342000	6344000	There's not enough 4K porn.
6344000	6349000	You say that jokingly, but, I don't know.
6349000	6351000	That's probably a big part of it.
6351000	6354000	Even The Rift has porn.
6354000	6355000	Yes it does.
6355000	6357000	That's why the time for VR is now.
6357000	6362000	VX JasonXV, by the way, saying there is absolutely 4K porn.
6362000	6363000	How do you know?
6363000	6366000	Well, there is, but it's not prevalent.
6366000	6369000	Alright, it's not mainstream. It's not mainstream is what you're saying.
6369000	6374000	Alright, VX JasonXV says, if you think there isn't any, you haven't looked.
6374000	6375000	That is true.
6375000	6376000	And it is true.
6376000	6377000	This is the internet looking.
6377000	6383000	I have not looked because I do not have anything that I could play back 4K porn on, cause it ain't gonna happen on my laptop.
6383000	6387000	You can downsample it to really pretty 1080 porn.
6387000	6391000	Back to the question.
6391000	6393000	I apologize for the porn tangent.
6393000	6395000	Right in the middle of listener feedback.
6395000	6398000	Right before poor William Murderface's answer.
6398000	6399000	We gotta porn up the show.
6399000	6400000	Jeez.
6400000	6402000	Anyway, back to William Murderface.
6402000	6407000	I own neither, and I will probably pick up a PS4 sooner or later because of Kingdom Hearts 3.
6407000	6411000	So if I can get my first one and it has more power than the base, why not?
6411000	6417000	On the other hand, the idea of games that are exclusive to these variants or run badly on the older variants sound like a very bad idea.
6417000	6422000	This is interesting though as it shows that more and more consoles are becoming almost indistinguishable from PCs.
6422000	6427000	Hopefully that fact will encourage them to anticipate problems and learn from their PC forebears.
6427000	6432000	Andy Arz says, didn't like the idea of the new 3DS and don't like the idea of the Neo.
6432000	6435000	And this is coming from someone who uses their PlayStation 4 on a daily basis.
6435000	6438000	I'd rather have to not buy the same console more than once per gen.
6438000	6446000	And while I like pretty games, I'm not to the level of the PC mustard rice where I care enough to spend a ton of money for slightly better graphics.
6446000	6447000	I see what you did there.
6447000	6453000	All that said, we'll see if Sony can change my mind when they officially announce it.
6453000	6459000	I will say I think the people who are getting too bent out of shape over this should wait and see how Sony announces it.
6459000	6463000	And that's the other thing too is like do we really need to push like cutting edge graphics?
6463000	6465000	Because look at some of the great games that are out now.
6465000	6466000	The graphics are good enough.
6466000	6471000	They're not pushing, you know, like Enter the Gungeon is like a 16-bit quality game.
6471000	6476000	I mean it's, you don't, that's not going to benefit from 4K.
6476000	6481000	No, well, the sharper retro graphics, sharper.
6481000	6483000	Pixel so sharp it'll poke you in the eye.
6483000	6488000	That's the new tagline for OLR by the way.
6488000	6493000	If OLR ever does a gaming studio, or YYR, you want a tagline for your gaming studio, there you go.
6493000	6495000	Pixel so sharp they'll poke you in the eye.
6496000	6506000	Tigerclaw says, I currently own both consoles, but with the two getting upgrades this will be a problem if they start developing games that run poorly on current consoles.
6506000	6511000	Some games will probably only run at 30 frames per second, but at 60 frames per second on the new ones.
6511000	6513000	Think of what happened with the 3DS.
6513000	6518000	Nintendo has developed games that take advantage of the new 3DS features, but that poorly run on the old 3DS.
6518000	6519000	Yes, that's true.
6520000	6526000	By the way, I'm just saying to Andy R, Chatroom is loving the mustard rice thing.
6526000	6532000	Kaijuto says, I love mustard rice, great way to slap those stuck up PC gamers in the face.
6532000	6541000	Actually, it might sound weird, but I like mustard and I like rice, so I don't know if I'd like them together, but maybe I wouldn't truly know until I've tried.
6541000	6546000	I can tell you this much though, Benihana's mustard sauce is fucking delicious.
6546000	6548000	Have you ever eaten that and then some rice?
6548000	6553000	And I have had it on their fried rice and it's fucking delicious, so yes, it would definitely work.
6553000	6555000	Benihana mustard rice.
6555000	6560000	Seriously, that mustard sauce, they have the recipe online at Benihanas.com or something like that.
6560000	6564000	You make that shit, you can put it on anything. It's fucking delicious.
6564000	6566000	That does sound pretty amazing.
6566000	6572000	Oh, now I'm craving the best thing in the world to put mustard on.
6572000	6573000	A soft pretzel.
6573000	6576000	Like the kind you get at Costco or a baseball game.
6576000	6580000	Those are the best, in my opinion. Anyway.
6580000	6582000	Hey, one more answer over on Facebook.
6582000	6585000	We keep getting derailed here at OLR. When does that happen?
6585000	6591000	Guillermo R. lastly on Facebook says, people spend much more money on annual phone upgrades.
6591000	6597000	And it's not that different from upgrading your video card on the PC every few years to get a performance boost on the newer games.
6597000	6601000	My last video card cost more than any of the current consoles at launch.
6601000	6605000	I don't think it's such a big deal. If you can't afford the upgrade, stick with the current one.
6605000	6609000	At least they're mandating software compatibility between the two versions.
6609000	6613000	And Sony is reportedly prohibiting Neo-exclusive games.
6613000	6615000	If you want better performance, pay for it.
6615000	6619000	What's the point then? If they're just... What's the point then? Seriously.
6619000	6626000	I kind of like half agree with the comment. I agree with the whole, thank gosh they're mandating that you can't do Neo-exclusive.
6626000	6628000	So it's hard to get super bad.
6628000	6633000	For now. That's not always going to be the case.
6633000	6634000	That's true.
6634000	6636000	And we don't know anything. We're just speculating.
6636000	6640000	That's true. We don't know. It's all tinfoil hats until E3.
6640000	6642000	I need E3.
6642000	6645000	Or I need the press conferences anyway.
6645000	6652000	Alright. There it is. Your rapid fire, excuse me, your Fugu question of the week and your rapid fire news for the week.
6652000	6656000	Be sure to friend us on Facebook and Google Plus to get more questions.
6656000	6660000	In the meantime, let's get back to some more news. Loki, what do you have for us?
6660000	6668000	Alright. So we have something that really should have been enabled a long time ago.
6668000	6671000	And that's two-factor authentication for the Playstation Network.
6671000	6676000	Finally getting it now five years later after the whole breach that happened.
6676000	6678000	They're going to make it available to you.
6678000	6685000	Apparently you could use this via, it's a text message using a special smartphone or desktop application.
6685000	6693000	And basically, you know, it's something similar to what you see with a lot of other companies that do two-factor authentication.
6693000	6695000	But yeah, I'm down with that.
6695000	6701000	Yeah. I will definitely enable this for PSN myself.
6701000	6707000	Yeah. I do that for Steam because I've been starting to see a lot of like, oh, hey, someone's tried to log into your Steam account.
6707000	6711000	Yep. Steam guard is awesome. And honestly, I really can't stress this enough to you guys out there.
6711000	6716000	If you're not using two-factor authentication, you really should look into it.
6716000	6719000	You really, really, I mean, it is, it's so important.
6719000	6726000	Especially if you have a smartphone that you like carry it with you or whatever, you really need to use it.
6726000	6730000	Especially if nothing else, use it on your email.
6730000	6734000	If nothing else, use it on your email. I would say use it on your bank account too.
6734000	6742000	But use it on your email so that way only you can access your email because, you know, it sends you a text message with the code or whatever.
6742000	6745000	And, you know, you have that wherever you go.
6745000	6750000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Steam guard is now required to use the Steam market.
6750000	6755000	I didn't realize that. I adopted Steam guard as soon as it was out.
6755000	6759000	I think they offered like a free trading card or a badge or something for enabling Steam guard.
6759000	6761000	I was like, oop, okay.
6761000	6763000	Badge, you say?
6763000	6768000	But then also at the same time, two-factor authentication, and yeah, there's plenty of people in chat piping up.
6768000	6773000	Jason says use two-factor authentication everywhere. Everywhere.
6773000	6777000	Yeah, I use TFA as the hip kids call it.
6777000	6786000	I use that, I use it on Twitter, I use it on Facebook, I use it on mail, I use it everywhere that it's available.
6786000	6797000	And it's, you know, at first, the Twitter one is the most annoying one because when Twitter, when you log in, it sends a ping to your phone.
6797000	6800000	And you have to log into the app on your phone and accept it.
6800000	6806000	But if the push message doesn't come through, like they have it buried in the app.
6806000	6811000	If the push message comes through, you just swipe on the push message and it takes you right to the screen where you allow access.
6811000	6820000	But if it, oh my God, if it doesn't push through, then like you have to go in, I have, you guys are going to laugh, you ready for this?
6820000	6829000	On Twitter, I have, I want to say seven accounts that I manage or own.
6829000	6834000	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, yeah, I have seven accounts on Twitter that I manage or own.
6834000	6839000	So I have to go into my right account that I want to use first, then I have to go into the options for that account,
6839000	6842000	and then I have to, like it's buried in menus.
6842000	6848000	But you know what, I would rather be slightly inconvenienced than have my Twitter taken over.
6848000	6852000	I have a four letter name on Twitter that I think people want in other countries.
6852000	6862000	So I will keep that two factor authentication on even if it does take me 30 more seconds to get logged in, I don't care.
6862000	6869000	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, I'm glad to have the Microsoft one, I get people trying to social engineer my gamertag about twice a year.
6869000	6878000	And I know this because the person on the phone sends me a code via all my devices to have the guy try to social engineer them, read back, and then I get the survey.
6878000	6880000	Sheesh.
6880000	6884000	Alright, and Raginator says, seven accounts, Sky?
6884000	6891000	Well, keep in mind, I'm, yeah, and actually ActDeft actually named them all. He named them all.
6891000	6901000	The only one he missed, I have a professional account that I don't cross over into my, it has to do with stuff I do for my day job, so I don't cross the stream, so to speak.
6901000	6904000	So that's the seventh one you're missing from your list, ActDeft.
6904000	6910000	Good call, though. Wow, ActDeft knows all my Twitter accounts, I might be a little frightened.
6910000	6911000	Alright.
6911000	6913000	I think I have like four or five of them.
6913000	6923000	Yeah, I mean, you just, you know, you have, it's all the podcasts that I co-host. They're not all solely mine, but like, for example, Reading is Fundamental podcast.
6923000	6930000	Technically, John made that Twitter account, but I log into it because I do the Twitter portion of that show, so I have it on my phone.
6930000	6935000	So, you know, I didn't create all seven of those accounts, but I did create maybe four of them.
6936000	6937000	So, anyway.
6937000	6943000	Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about some Twitch changes.
6943000	6947000	You know, Twitch, more and more people watching Twitch, socializing on Twitch.
6947000	6950000	Pretty soon you're going to have friends on Twitch.
6950000	6959000	You know, I have to admit, maybe the chat room can help me out here because I'm having a hard time understanding how friends is different from the follows you have today.
6959000	6967000	I mean, you know, I guess right now on Twitch it's mutual following, but you aren't exactly saying, I'm friends with this person.
6967000	6982000	Like, I might follow somebody, but you could actually be friends with them now in this update that's going to be coming to Twitch, which means, excuse me, you'll be able to have 500 friends on a list, and it'll actually show you who is online, and you'll be able to whisper those friends with a click.
6982000	6991000	So, I'm assuming that's one of the big differences, because I could just follow somebody to see, like, when they're going live, but I can't necessarily communicate to them privately unless they're actually my friend.
6991000	6994000	So, that seems to be one of the big differences there.
6994000	7000000	The friends beta starts on April 22nd, so it just started during PAX.
7000000	7008000	Selected community members, including anybody who was at that town hall that happened at PAX East, and I guess they allowed people to sign up at their booth as well.
7009000	7014000	Since I wasn't at PAX East, I'm not in this program, but that's okay, I'm not really a heavy Twitch user right now anyway.
7014000	7019000	I always say I'm going to get in on it, and then I end up starting another podcast instead.
7019000	7024000	But anyway, Twitch director of programming, Marcus Graham, saying,
7024000	7028000	Friends is the latest social feature in Twitch's ongoing effort to help gamers connect with one another.
7028000	7036000	While Twitch always has been a great platform for broadcasters to connect with viewers, now viewers will be able to connect with each other as well.
7036000	7043000	And Jason in our chat room, who I know is a big Twitch person, was the guy that got me to go to TwitchCon last year, says,
7043000	7048000	Follows is for live notifications, Friends is for conversation.
7048000	7051000	That's a pretty good way to clarify it there, thank you.
7051000	7054000	So there you go, that's going to be coming to Twitch.
7054000	7059000	Maybe trying to take on Facebook messaging in a way, but with the gamer audience.
7059000	7065000	Because people, you know, they're logged into Twitch, they're right there, they've got their attention, very easy to send people messages.
7065000	7069000	So, as long as they keep the spammers out, I'm good.
7069000	7073000	But I'm assuming the friending has to be mutual, so that'll help quite a bit.
7073000	7075000	Alright, let's move on, Loki.
7075000	7085000	Alright, so, I guess I'm not very surprised by this, but it's another Five Nights at Freddy's game being announced, or teased.
7085000	7091000	There's a new series that's going to be starting at Sister Location.
7091000	7100000	And that's just being teased on Scott Cawthorn's webpage there for Five Nights at Freddy's.
7100000	7102000	And, yeah.
7102000	7108000	So I guess we'll see another Five Nights game coming, maybe with a different set of characters.
7108000	7115000	Yeah, maybe, because you know the whole Five Nights RPG was pretty bumpy, and he had some issues with that.
7115000	7119000	And we kind of talked about that in a previous episode, I don't want to keep kicking dirt on it.
7119000	7122000	But maybe he's like, alright, time to move on.
7122000	7128000	And the last Freddy game was supposed to be the last one anyway, the RPG thing was just kind of a side show, side project thing.
7128000	7136000	So, you know, I'm not surprised at all, he'll probably want to tie it to Five Nights at Freddy's without it necessarily being a Five Nights at Freddy's game.
7137000	7139000	It is a Five Nights at Freddy's game, though.
7139000	7140000	Hmm.
7140000	7145000	Because it says Sister Location, but very lightly above it says Five Nights at Freddy's.
7145000	7149000	Yeah, but if the last one was the last game, well, who knows.
7149000	7150000	Never say never.
7150000	7151000	Never say never.
7151000	7155000	It's like a horror movie spin-off thing.
7155000	7157000	I want to see the horror movie.
7157000	7164000	They're supposed to be making a horror movie that's got life, practical effects and everything.
7164000	7165000	I want to totally see that.
7165000	7169000	I have no interest, I don't really play the games, but I think that'd be awesome.
7171000	7173000	Some folks in chat over at live.vognetware.com.
7173000	7176000	Akdev says, more Five Nights, but not at Freddy's.
7176000	7178000	Kaijuta says, Five Nights at Betty's.
7178000	7179000	His sister.
7180000	7182000	I could see that, probably.
7182000	7183000	Five Nights at Betty's, why not?
7184000	7187000	Betty Boop becomes an evil killer in the middle of the night.
7187000	7189000	She kind of looks evil, so.
7189000	7191000	Yeah, she stabs you in the throat and boop boop boop.
7192000	7195000	It'll be based off the drawn together character.
7195000	7197000	Oh god, oh god.
7197000	7199000	She was, she was a mess.
7199000	7201000	What the hell would they call her on that show?
7201000	7202000	I love that show.
7202000	7203000	I don't, god, I don't even remember.
7203000	7204000	I don't remember that.
7204000	7210000	I know Xander was the role-playing and then the, um, the one that was the take on Josie and the pussycats.
7210000	7212000	God, I can't remember any of their names.
7212000	7213000	Yeah.
7213000	7214000	It was sad.
7217000	7218000	For a show that was so funny.
7219000	7221000	There was the princess, right?
7221000	7222000	Yeah, I remember that.
7222000	7225000	Then there was the Adam Carolla guy that was really fucking annoying.
7225000	7226000	Right?
7226000	7231000	Was he the, was he the Pikachu guy at the time?
7231000	7238000	No, the Pikachu one was like very, um, like was, like spoke Japanese or was supposed to be speaking Japanese.
7238000	7240000	I don't, I don't know who the Adam Carolla guy was.
7240000	7241000	Oh, he was the pig.
7241000	7242000	There was a talking pig.
7242000	7243000	Oh, that's right, the pig.
7243000	7244000	Yeah.
7244000	7245000	Cause he actually was a pig.
7246000	7247000	I don't know who that was.
7247000	7251000	I don't know if that was supposed to be a riff on the, the Acres cartoons from Garfield.
7251000	7253000	I think it was supposed to be like, uh, Porky Pig maybe.
7253000	7254000	Oh, good lord.
7254000	7255000	Jason knows them all.
7255000	7264000	Woldor, Toot, the name of the character was Toot, uh, Ling Ling, Foxy, Xander, Clara, Spanky, and Captain Hero.
7264000	7265000	Thank you, Jason.
7265000	7266000	I can always count on you.
7267000	7270000	Yeah, Woldor was, wasn't that the SpongeBob character or something?
7270000	7271000	Yes, that's right.
7271000	7273000	There was the creepy SpongeBob thing.
7273000	7274000	All right.
7274000	7275000	I got it.
7275000	7282000	And VXJXV says, Spanky Ham is a parody of crass internet flash animation cartoons, according to the show's creator.
7282000	7288000	Dear God, if they ever bring up who wants, if they ever bring back who wants to be a millionaire and I'm on it, Jason's gonna be my phone-a-friend.
7291000	7295000	Jason would be the guy smart enough to have the Google search up and ready when I call him too.
7295000	7296000	All right.
7296000	7298000	Uh, let's talk about esports.
7298000	7300000	Esports, it keeps growing.
7300000	7308000	A report out this week saying that the esports industry is supposed to be making a cool $463 million in revenue in 2016.
7308000	7310000	This is a report from PWC.
7310000	7314000	Uh, this is the financial services firm that was once known as PricewaterhouseCoopers.
7314000	7318000	That is a 43% increase from 2015.
7318000	7324000	Um, according to the PWC report, uh, League of Legends is the most popular game by viewership.
7325000	7334000	But 63% of viewers say that they're tuning in for first-person shooters, which is probably why you see Blizzard wanting to get in there with Overwatch and, you know, you see that grow.
7334000	7336000	Why Doom is suddenly coming back.
7336000	7337000	You know, all this.
7337000	7345000	Um, the women that were surveyed in the poll were more likely to describe themselves as involved in esports than the guys.
7345000	7346000	Interesting.
7346000	7349000	Esports may be a less male-centric area than people tend to think.
7350000	7355000	Uh, major outlets, of course, getting into, uh, the streaming and the esports.
7355000	7357000	Uh, Yahoo has an esports division.
7357000	7359000	There's gonna be that TBS Cable League.
7359000	7362000	Twitch, of course, trying to grow their own thing.
7362000	7367000	Uh, they are really trying to bring it up to a level where more traditional sports are at.
7367000	7377000	Uh, by the way, uh, NBA Commissioner David Stern has some words for people who, you know, do not agree with esports.
7377000	7379000	Of course it is a sport.
7379000	7383000	It fills arenas and stadiums, has an OTT network built on it.
7383000	7384000	Twitch.
7384000	7388000	And there is a robust market in team purchases that seems to be developing.
7388000	7400000	So, um, you at least have one, uh, champion in there and, you know, the NBA Commissioner is, uh, nothing to, uh, you know, scoff at when it comes to, uh, who knows what they're talking about when it comes to sports.
7400000	7401000	So.
7401000	7402000	Alright.
7402000	7404000	Um, let's move on.
7404000	7406000	Just, uh, I guess it's time for the mailbag, huh?
7406000	7408000	Shall we do the mailbag?
7408000	7409000	We shall.
7409000	7410000	Let's do it.
7410000	7411000	Uh, every week you guys email us.
7411000	7416000	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you send your emails.
7416000	7419000	And we pick our favorites and we read them live on air.
7419000	7423000	And unfortunately I don't have the, uh, theme ready tonight.
7423000	7427000	Uh, I am multitasking too much without dark soccer right here.
7427000	7433000	I'm having to multitask too much so we'll have to do without the theme tonight as I, uh, dive into the mailbag here and read a couple of emails that we have.
7433000	7434000	Uh, again our email address.
7434000	7437000	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.
7437000	7440000	Our first email tonight from Raginator.
7440000	7443000	This was actually sent for last week's show.
7443000	7448000	Um, but that was obviously canceled at the last minute so hopefully Raginator doesn't mind that we're going to read it tonight.
7448000	7449000	Hi folks.
7449000	7451000	It's your friendly neighborhood Raginator.
7451000	7456000	I just thought I'd write in just in case I'm unable to call in on Sunday for whatever reason or I forget what I want to talk about.
7456000	7462000	A seeming important issue had just occurred to me and I'm kind of surprised no one else has thought about the following subject as well.
7462000	7464000	It's the internet. Somebody probably has.
7464000	7470000	Um, as you three or four, if there's any guest presence this week, well, will you take two?
7470000	7478000	As you two already know, Steam, a service that I've become a huge fan of thanks to Rob, primarily deals with selling miscellaneous software games in their related DLC.
7478000	7487000	Also, as Rob has mentioned several times in the past, if Valve should go out of business or choose to discontinue Steam, they have what amounts to a big old kill the DRM button.
7487000	7488000	Great. No issue there, right?
7488000	7489000	Kinda.
7489000	7490000	Well here's the thing.
7490000	7499000	Aside from software, games, and DLC, they do sell some movies, albeit with a limited selection, and they do have an even more limited quantity of freebies.
7499000	7507000	Now the thing is, and from what I've seen as well, aside from two movies, free to play and indie game the movie, you cannot download these movies.
7507000	7508000	They're streaming only.
7508000	7517000	The thing is, at least other services like iTunes and whatever Microsoft is calling their service nowadays give you the choice of either streaming or storing your videos locally.
7518000	7528000	Now, should Steam be discontinued for whatever reason, or if there's a massive outage akin to what happened in PSN back in Spring 2011, what will happen with the streaming only videos that people may have bought?
7528000	7530000	Valve never addressed this specifically.
7530000	7537000	I know, I know, piracy's a concern, and I agree, but this seems more troublesome and restrictive than Sony's video DRM for PSN videos.
7537000	7541000	And I'm sure you all remember my rants regarding that whole diarrhea fest.
7541000	7542000	Wow.
7542000	7545000	But yes, I do remember the angrieness of the PlayStation stuff.
7545000	7546000	What are your takes on this?
7546000	7552000	This email was brought to you by my Steam account, home of 904 games and counting.
7552000	7556000	And it even included a couple Humble Bundle codes there at the end for us.
7556000	7557000	So thank you.
7557000	7559000	I will, I need to see what these are.
7559000	7562000	I have no idea what they are, so I need to see if there are things in my library or not.
7562000	7567000	Maybe I'll take one and give one to Loki or something, or give mine to Dark Soccer.
7567000	7568000	I don't know.
7568000	7569000	We'll figure it out.
7570000	7581000	As far as the question and the movies, you know, I really think that we're at a point where it's so far out that Steam would ever need to use the kill switch.
7581000	7589000	That I think the movies will be so dated by that point that I think most people probably aren't going to care, is the reality.
7589000	7605000	For the people that do care, they will probably do, if I were to guess, they would probably do some type of redemption thing where you could go in, buy request, and get a code to get the movie on another site that's still up.
7605000	7612000	A code to get it on Amazon, a code to get it on YouTube, or something to like convert your ownership to another site.
7612000	7620000	But I imagine they won't automatically give it to you. It'll be something that will be open for a 90 day window or something like that, and then it's done.
7620000	7623000	That's my thought on how they do it.
7623000	7628000	Loki, what do you think Steam would do with the movie situation if they ever shut their doors?
7628000	7633000	I don't know, maybe change those from streaming to where you can download them?
7633000	7638000	Yeah, maybe it'll be a thing where you can download it for up to 90 days and then it's done.
7638000	7641000	Or maybe as part of the Switch thing they'll change it.
7641000	7645000	Or maybe something you should be prepared for.
7645000	7653000	Maybe Steam would be ready to take the negative press and say, you know, we never said anything about the movies, unfortunately the movies will no longer be there.
7653000	7658000	Because it is so limited, they could probably cut their losses.
7658000	7665000	Like with how many people will be pissed off that they lost Indie Game the movie, they can probably cut their losses.
7665000	7670000	Because can't you get Indie Game streaming free other places at this point? Or am I crazy?
7670000	7676000	Well Netflix isn't exactly free, but isn't Indie Game the movie at other places that you can get at this point?
7676000	7679000	I think they have it on Humble Bundle.
7679000	7686000	Yeah, I sort of think they would allow you to convert it for a limited time, but not forever.
7686000	7690000	I really think if Steam is going to do the right thing in that situation, that would be the way out of it.
7690000	7693000	Bobby Blackwolf saying, I saw it on Netflix.
7693000	7699000	Of course Netflix stuff tends to come and go lately, unless it's a Netflix original. It kind of tends to come and go.
7699000	7704000	RageNator pointing out in chat as well that Indie Game the movie and free to play are on good old games.
7704000	7709000	And SHG100Matt saying, most of these are free or will eventually be free.
7709000	7715000	I really have a feeling that by the time Steam inevitably pushes the kill switch, it'll just be on YouTube.
7715000	7717000	For everybody.
7717000	7723000	But Kaijuto saying, the kill switch is never too far away. There's no such thing as too big to fail.
7723000	7730000	So maybe I shouldn't write it off so easily that the kill switch is still decades away. We'll see.
7730000	7734000	We do have another email this week from YYR.
7734000	7740000	Hello LR. This is essentially a love letter about Drinkbox Studios. And who is that?
7740000	7743000	I had no idea until a few short months ago.
7743000	7750000	Over the past few years, Drinkbox has done work for hire on a number of titles for Activision, Vicarious Visions, EA and several others.
7750000	7752000	But they've also released a few of their own games.
7752000	7758000	Guacamelee had been sitting on my Xbox One's hard drive for almost a year, acquired via games with gold.
7758000	7764000	That reminds me. I need to fucking get my copy of Sunset Overdrive on games with gold. I need to do that after the show.
7764000	7766000	Thank you for the reminder. Anyway.
7766000	7770000	Where was I? Ah yes. I finally decided to click on it. Guacamelee.
7770000	7775000	After finding out that it was a Metroidvania style game that I could play co-op with Amy.
7775000	7778000	As it turns out, Guacamelee was way more than just that.
7778000	7783000	It's one of the most well designed, perfectly executed games I've touched in my 30 plus years of gaming.
7783000	7788000	It has as little or as much exploration as you want, depending on your preferred playing style.
7788000	7795000	The combat system is a fun test of your skills and the enemy encounters are constantly switching things up so the combat doesn't get old.
7796000	7800000	The platforming is just right, blending interesting layouts with perfect controls.
7800000	7804000	Bonuses and hidden items are dangled behind tricky and satisfying challenges.
7804000	7808000	You discover a smorgasbord of abilities throughout the game, and zero of them are useless.
7808000	7812000	The level design is clever and thoughtful enough that it requires the use of each and every one.
7812000	7818000	And as the icing on the cake, the graphics are pleasing, the audio is fantastic, and the jokes in the script are actually funny.
7818000	7824000	I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre, and if you also enjoy fighting games, it was pretty much made just for you.
7824000	7829000	After playing through Guacamelee three full times, I decided to look at a Drinkbox's back catalog.
7829000	7832000	They've also released a couple more conventional platformers.
7832000	7837000	Tales from Space, about a blob, which is a two player co-op platformer for PlayStation 3.
7837000	7845000	And Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack, a one player platformer originally released for the Vita, but now available on several platforms.
7845000	7851000	I've started both, they feature simpler gameplay, but also ooze charm and feel pretty polished, especially the sequel.
7851000	7857000	The action and presentation are at the same high level as Guacamelee's, and I'm looking forward to spending more time with them.
7857000	7863000	I'm bringing all this up now because this Tuesday, April 26th, Drinkbox is releasing their newest game.
7863000	7871000	It's called Severed, and it follows the quest of a distraught one armed warrior wielding a living sword searching for her family in a world of nightmares.
7871000	7876000	It is entirely touch controlled, and is being released exclusively on PlayStation Vita.
7876000	7884000	This is the first time I've ever trusted a developer so much that I'm willing to buy their new game on day one without even a bit of gameplay footage.
7884000	7888000	And if you have a Vita, I'd encourage you to do that right along with me.
7888000	7895000	That is quite the love letter there. Enjoy, Aaron Yyr.
7895000	7901000	Thank you very much for that email. I have no problem with love letters to smaller studios especially.
7902000	7910000	Guacamelee is a fantastic game. It's a fun Metroidvania style game. It kind of has the fighting style instead of the shooting style, but I love the in-jokes.
7910000	7916000	There's so many memes that are referenced in the game. It's a very internet culture aware type of game.
7916000	7921000	There's a lot of great Metroidvanias out there on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
7921000	7926000	Xbox One, I believe you had told me about this too, although I know several other people had.
7926000	7936000	Ori and the Blind Forest, another excellent Metroidvania game on Xbox One at least, and PC that's worth your time if you haven't checked that out.
7936000	7944000	So I know we joke that, like, boy, Metroidvania games, they're everywhere these days, but a lot of them are really, really good and worth your time.
7944000	7949000	And, you know, don't write off the genre just because a lot of people are doing it.
7949000	7952000	Anyway, that's it for the emails this week. Again, you can send us emails.
7952000	7960000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com. But in the meantime, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.
7960000	7965000	We get a little angsty here at Orange Lounge Radio sometimes, so we're going to blow off some steam right now.
7965000	7994000	I have to be tired just because I've been trying to work on my game, which, actually, the thing that's kind of preventing me from working on the game, besides being tired, is I don't know, I still have kind of undecided how I want to look.
7994000	8008000	And because of that, I don't know where to begin. So I'm still deciding that. But I am incredibly tired, and, like, sometimes I'll actually sit down and start, you know, working on it, and I will literally pass out from being tired.
8008000	8016000	I will just fall asleep sitting down with my laptop. So it's just because I'm on a new work schedule starting this week.
8016000	8026000	So I'm starting at seven in the morning instead of eight, which one hour makes a difference, especially when your kids wake you up seven times during the night. So, yeah.
8026000	8037000	I guess, just, you know, obviously, FU to a lot of the things that were putting me in a mood this week. I'm sure you all can figure it out.
8037000	8047000	But, yeah, I just, you know, I have to snap out of it and move on, and I think I am for the most part, but it's just, I don't know, it hasn't been the best week.
8047000	8052000	So just looking forward to moving on and on to bigger and better things.
8053000	8066000	Alright, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki, one more story.
8066000	8085000	Yes, so Tatsuya Manami has stepped down as president of Platinum Games, and they haven't really said exactly what the reasoning was for that, but, you know, he's worked on quite a bit of projects, you know, through them, especially more recently.
8085000	8093000	Star Fox Zero, Star Fox Guard, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, which actually I'm very kind of looking forward to, because I do need to play that.
8093000	8104000	And then, of course, you know, they worked on, you know, some major games like Bayonetta, Mad World, and Vanquish. I love Mad World, to be honest, and I really hope we get a new game from that.
8104000	8109000	I really like the art style in that game. Plus, they had Chainsaw, and that was awesome.
8109000	8123000	Yeah, unfortunately, you know, a lot of people get very excited about Platinum Games, but it really does seem like some of their games kind of, like, hit-miss, hit-miss, so I guess they're looking for leadership that will hopefully ensure more hits-hits-hits than anything else.
8123000	8136000	You know, I could see them in a really awesome, like, Mega Man style game, because I know, like, Vanquish was really, their games are very fast-paced, and I think that would lend itself well to, like, a platforming action game.
8137000	8145000	You know, some tinfoil hatters think this is because of Star Fox's low reviews, because, you know, Star Fox has not been getting great reviews out there.
8145000	8152000	It just didn't look that interesting to begin with. I don't know, I'm kind of disappointed, but, yeah, I guess.
8152000	8164000	I know, I feel like the reception I'm reading on Twitter, which I tend to believe a little more than the critics, the reception on Twitter is a little warmer than I see the critics giving it, but I also have some serious Nintendo fanboys on my Twitter that will defend everything.
8164000	8168000	And so I have to take some of that with a grain of salt, too. You know what I mean?
8168000	8174000	I think it just, I don't know, it just maybe was a letdown, it's a little bit, I hear it's a short game.
8174000	8186000	Yeah. That part kind of bothers me, too. But, at the same time, it's not that short games are necessarily bad, because there are some very short games that I've still defended that are worth your money.
8186000	8194000	Look at Platinum's style of games, though. It's, like, action-packed and fast. That's kind of what I see there. Games are, like, you know, fast-paced.
8194000	8204000	Star Fox, it's kind of slow, you know, it's, I don't know, it's a slow, like, shooter game.
8204000	8212000	Like, can you imagine, though, if they really amp that up? Like, you're just darting through super fast, you know, blowing up shit and just, like, dodging through everything.
8212000	8221000	I mean, that'd be really cool and action-packed. This, I just don't see, I don't know. I haven't played it, so I don't know what I'm really talking about, but it just doesn't look that interesting.
8221000	8227000	Like, a new Star Fox game, I would think, like, man, I need to pick that up. But I'm just not excited about it at all.
8227000	8236000	You know, I, and maybe this is just me, and I know we're about to open up the phone line here after one more story. Maybe it's just me, and I even see people saying they want to talk about Star Fox Zero.
8236000	8246000	But kind of a question I'm posing out there, is it possible that the Nintendo NX news and everything that's out there about the NX is kind of starting to kill your passion for Wii U a little bit?
8246000	8256000	Where it's kind of like, bring on, just bring it on, bring on the next console, bring on what's next, because this feels like these are just all fill-in-the-gap types of things until the next console.
8256000	8271000	But, there's Zelda. That is worth mentioning. Yet, there is still this Zelda game that is hopefully going to be this tremendous swan song for the Wii U, yet a lot of people seem to think it's just going to end up being on both the Wii U and the NX at this point.
8271000	8277000	Yeah, I probably would see that. I don't know how a game of that scale could be on the Wii U, to be honest.
8278000	8290000	Let's see, going to some comments from chat from some people who have played Star Fox Zero. Wyland says, the controls aren't the great Satan that cry baby different, bad critics are making it out to be.
8290000	8296000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, Anarchy Reigns was interesting, but I wouldn't have bought it at full price.
8296000	8297000	Oh god, that game is terrible.
8298000	8310000	Dark Tetsuya says, the new controls take some adjusting, but once you get it dialed in, it's fun. TigerClaws noting, the reception of the game is more positive, most of the reviews just blame the controls.
8310000	8318000	Yeah, I did play Anarchy Reigns, did not like that game. That was probably the only Platinum game that was kind of a letdown.
8318000	8321000	Did Platinum do Wonderful 101 on Wii U?
8321000	8322000	No.
8322000	8324000	No, they did not. Just curious.
8324000	8332000	Alright, let's get into one more story here about a game that could have been. A game that was, oh no, chat is yelling yes, Platinum did.
8332000	8333000	They did?
8333000	8335000	They didn't do Wonderful 101. I thought they did.
8336000	8345000	I thought Wonderful 101 was not the game that people hyped it up to be. I was not as into it as other people were.
8345000	8356000	Which is fine, we're going to have video games, a serious business, we're going to have differing opinions sometimes, but that to me was not as fabulous as people made it out to be.
8356000	8371000	However, Bayonetta 2 is not praised enough. Like, I have a really bad feeling that game has not been played by as many people that need to experience it because that game is tits, everybody needs to play it, it's so good.
8371000	8380000	Anyhow, let's talk about another game that could have been, but it didn't. And that was a Guitar Hero MMO.
8380000	8390000	That's right, it was something that Activision was working on, but was apparently cancelled as all the hero games were stopped in 2011.
8391000	8403000	This was being brought to us by Unseen64, this is a website that likes to do these exposes on things hidden in games that weren't supposed to be there and dead games that never came to light.
8403000	8414000	They ran a little story on this whole thing. Hero World was going to be a platform that would have been accessible by web browsers that would tie together all of Activision's hero games.
8414000	8424000	It was conceived by Freestyle Games, who did DJ Hero, which makes me go, oh, then it was probably good. Because Freestyle Games always did the good ones in the series.
8424000	8433000	But the work on the project was actually done by Virtual Fairgrounds in Amsterdam, who had done some free-to-play MMOs before, like Club Galactic.
8433000	8446000	It was supposedly capable of rendering appealing visuals even on lower spec machines. The game would have automatically purchased extra servers during peak times and shut them off when not in use. Very interesting.
8446000	8457000	In Hero World, you can import characters from Guitar Hero and DJ Hero, or make new ones, and go on a journey to musical stardom. There would have been battle in turn-based dance-offs.
8457000	8465000	There was a complimentary Facebook app that was also in the works. You would build a venue in Hero World, hire console gamers to play shows there.
8465000	8479000	Hero World was supposed to be fully cross-platform on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii. The pitches to Activision went well. Hero World was planned for release, but then Hero got yanked. All of it.
8479000	8496000	Activision put the franchise on hiatus. Bummer. Unfortunately, it is mentioned that Freestyle also developed Guitar Hero Live, but they're saying that Activision is not totally pleased with the results. The game has failed to meet expectations.
8496000	8506000	Which is kind of a bummer, because Guitar Hero Live, I think, was the better music game that came out last Christmas. Bummer.
8506000	8514000	Anyway, Darktosuya in chat says, I guess they did have DJ Hero 3 in the works at one point.
8514000	8516000	Yeah, so disappointing.
8516000	8536000	Lame. Alright, anyhow, it's time to open up the Skype line. Let's get to it. 1877 GameOLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word. I got a feel for Freestyle games. I really hope they aren't closed or anything like that. I would be really devastated if that happened, to be honest.
8536000	8542000	Alright, our phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. Get to our first call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8542000	8544000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
8544000	8546000	Hey, Akdeft, buddy. How you doing?
8546000	8560000	Pretty great. Pretty great. Just a small tangent. Well, you said I participated in a tournament, a poking tournament. I got second again.
8560000	8574000	Hey, you know what? Second is still pretty good. That's nothing to scoff at. That's a very, very good placement. I would be very happy if OLR was the second podcast everybody listened to in a week.
8575000	8581000	That's true. But anyways, I want to talk about that. I want to talk about Star Fox Zero.
8581000	8583000	Please. Did you pick it up?
8583000	8599000	Yeah, I picked it up. I got it from Amazon. Pretty cheap, too. My verdict on it is the complaints everyone has about it are pretty much legit.
8600000	8610000	The complaints like the controls, the length of the game, and some other stuff. Yeah, I see it.
8610000	8616000	As for the controls, I played it a little bit yesterday with some friends. We were doing co-op.
8616000	8627000	And yeah, the motion controls are really awkward, though you can get accustomed to pretty quickly if you know what you're doing.
8627000	8640000	So it's not necessarily bad controls, but they have a really, really steep learning curve. So yeah, you have to get used to them before you can truly master the game.
8640000	8655000	As for the length, we beat the game last night. We started playing around 10pm and we finished, I want to say, a little bit after 2am.
8656000	8672000	So yeah, it's kind of a short game, but at the same time, I don't remember a Star Fox game being lengthy or being more than 5 hours long if you know what you're doing.
8672000	8696000	So this one being a little bit resembling Star Fox, the original from Super Nintendo, and also Star Fox 64. I don't see why it's that bad because at least you have some replayability with challenges, arcade mode, and it has tons of collectibles, too.
8696000	8706000	Now, the original Star Fox game, you could kind of go down different paths, too. So is it one of those things where you can play different configurations?
8706000	8718000	Not really. You have the map, and it's like the one in Star Fox 64, though it has some changes. But pretty much you go on a straight line.
8719000	8734000	It has some alternate routes, I will say. There's an asteroid field we didn't play, and there was another planet we couldn't access to either because you have to do certain stuff we couldn't do.
8735000	8749000	So at least you have those alternate routes, too. Though mostly you go on a straight line, and you can pretty much replay any stage immediately, too.
8749000	8768000	So it's not like you have to finish the game and play it again, so you can just pretty much go to any stage and play it whenever you want. Which I find it good, but some people may find that, uh, no, no, bad.
8769000	8775000	Well, do you think it's worth 60 bucks for me to get, or eh?
8775000	8794000	There's also Star Fox Guard. We just played like one game or two of that, and that game is also pretty fun. It's pretty much like Five Nights at Freddy's, but without the scariest parts.
8795000	8799000	Oh, well that's good, because the scary parts are, uh, yeah. You know how I feel about that.
8799000	8815000	Although you can get, frankly, because of so many robots that invade your map. But again, that's also a game that's being included with Star Fox Zero, at least on the physical side.
8815000	8835000	If you want to only get Star Fox Zero, the digital version I think costs less. I'm not sure, because I know there's a discount you get for Star Fox Guard if you buy Star Fox Zero digitally.
8836000	8855000	But, is it worth the 60 dollars for both games? Yes, it is. I'm pretty sure it is, and it's probably not really that innovative, per se.
8856000	8870000	But the game is fun. We had lots of fun yesterday, last night, with my friends. For us to play a game non-stop like that, it has to be good.
8871000	8881000	So, at least there's that. I don't know if there's a demo, I think not, but I would say at least try it.
8882000	8891000	Yeah, you never know. In a couple months, they might do the whole thing where, like, with platinum points, you can get a 15 or 20% discount too, because that seems to be the thing they're doing now. So, who knows? Anything's possible, right?
8892000	8893000	Yeah, hopefully.
8894000	8902000	Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to get some more calls. But, congratulations on your tournament placement again, and thank you for letting us know your thoughts on Star Fox.
8903000	8904000	Hey, thanks for having me.
8905000	8906000	You're welcome. Anytime. Take care, my friend.
8907000	8913000	Alright, we got, boy, it's lighting up tonight. Let's get to our, excuse me, our next call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8914000	8915000	Ledger Zaku here.
8916000	8917000	Hey, my friend, how are you?
8918000	8919000	Just coming back from PAX East.
8920000	8921000	Hey, how was PAX East since you went?
8921000	8937000	Compared to previous years, I mean, it's kind of like half and half, just because of, like, obviously, the big thing that isn't PAX related is the security beefed up in the con this year. Like, literally, people have to go through metal detectors or metal wands.
8938000	8939000	Really?
8940000	8941000	Yeah, they were doing a lot of thorough backsurges.
8942000	8943000	Interesting.
8944000	8946000	Did you have to bend over and cough to get into PAX East?
8946000	8957000	No, but I did have to, like, literally, you know, they didn't pat you down, but they did, you know, they either, you either went through a metal detector or you had the wand.
8958000	8959000	Huh.
8960000	8961000	They wanted you.
8962000	8974000	I want to say I've seen the wand done somewhere else, though. I want to say BlizzCon had it. E3, I feel like, had it at one point. I don't know, but, but I wonder, I wonder if somebody made a threat. Again, maybe they had to step up security. Who knows?
8974000	8978000	Or it could be that the Boston Marathon, I believe, is tomorrow.
8979000	8994000	Ah, could be. You know, and I, I don't know, maybe I don't want to go there, so to speak, but there's been a lot of toxic bullshit in gaming culture in the past year, and maybe they felt that necessitated the extra security. I don't know, I'm just, I'm speculating, that's all. Anyway.
8995000	9009000	Remember, this, Anime Boston had this a few, you know, a few weeks prior to PAX East, so because, because the state of Massachusetts controls the convention centers, it's under their, it's their call, essentially.
9010000	9013000	Yeah. Alright, well, outside the security, I mean, once you got in there, how was it?
9013000	9035000	Ah, it was, it was still pretty good. I mean, they're not, well, in terms of panels, I mean, I only went to, like, a few ones that I'm trying to remember, more or less, the ones I went to, but they, I only went to, like, maybe three or, yeah, maybe four panels throughout the entire, you know, throughout the entire weekend.
9035000	9061000	Like, it was that, it was to the point where, you know, maybe there were some good ones, but all the others were, like, I mean, the only good one that I did, that did go to was the Harmonix one, and the, and the speed run, the speed run one on Friday, where they were doing, like, the, you know, the, you know, the organization that does speed runs for charity, awesome games done quick, they were, they were there.
9061000	9082000	And they were basically teaching folks how to do, like, glitches for, you know, how to find glitches in games in order to do speed runs. But other than that, I guess the biggest draw for me was waiting in line to try the HTC Vive, which they had in the free play area. So, virtual reality was a big thing this year.
9083000	9084000	Did you get to try the Vive? Did you end up getting to do it?
9084000	9096000	Yes. It was, it was worth two and a half hours waiting in line, but I managed to do it. It was a lot more immersive than the first two Oculus riffs that I tried, you know, previously.
9097000	9119000	And it, it does feel like a lot. It does feel clear, and it does feel that immersive. Like, you're pretty much in there, and there's no nausea whatsoever, because it's, like, it's consistent. The performance is consistent, even for, like, something that isn't Oculus, that's, you know, that Valve was able to build with, with HTC's help, obviously.
9120000	9135000	But even then, it's like, I guess it's like, I guess both have their strengths, and I guess you still need a beefy computer anyways, just to, you know, just to jump on the VR bandwagon, which reminds me, I probably have to do upgrades very soon.
9136000	9155000	After parties were, were, were somewhat alright. I mean, the only good, you know, the only good ones that I went to were the, the Asus one that they had in the, in a museum not far from the, from the con. And they were just giving out light-up cups, and people were trying to take on, like, professional gamers in Counter-Strike.
9156000	9162000	Hmm. Did they, did you get your hands on any other games besides the VR? Like, any indie games or anything?
9162000	9164000	It was a lot of lines.
9165000	9166000	Of course, it's PAX!
9167000	9187000	Exactly, that's why it's so difficult, like, I barely bother with that at all, unless it's something I can grab my hands on that no one else has, it's almost, it's not even worth the effort, I mean, that's, I mean, the only thing I did play was, you know, classic, classic arcade area, obviously, can't leave, can't go without that.
9187000	9196000	But it's, as I said, because it's PAX East, it's almost, you know, it's really hard to get your, you know, having to wait to play things.
9197000	9198000	Yeah.
9198000	9212000	It's like, yeah, it's, it's not as convenient, like, you know, in prior years, and even then, the swag isn't as, you know, it's, it's not the same, like, as I remember it years ago when I came back with, like, full bags of swag.
9213000	9215000	And now you can stay home and watch it on Twitch.
9215000	9221000	It's even, yeah, it's even worse, like, like, you heard about what, you heard about what Twitch gave out at their booth, right?
9222000	9223000	Yeah, the beta stuff, right?
9224000	9226000	Um, BO stuff.
9227000	9230000	Oh, yeah, I heard about the whole deodorant giveaway thing, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did read about that.
9231000	9234000	I'm gonna snag, like, a couple of, I'm gonna snag a stick and some body wash.
9235000	9236000	Yes!
9236000	9237000	That's tongue-in-cheek, I like that.
9237000	9239000	I know, it's, it's, like, awesome, but yeah.
9239000	9244000	I think the whole hygiene thing has become such a joke, though, that most people are aware of it.
9245000	9252000	I mean, there's always gonna be a couple of individuals who did not seem to get the memo, but for the most part, like, I feel like a lot of people have gotten the hint.
9253000	9265000	Oh, yeah, I mean, obviously, the idea is to basically, you know, it's something that's known, but not really, you know, I wouldn't say taboo, but it's something that, you know, at this point, it should be common sense.
9266000	9267000	Yeah, I know.
9267000	9272000	It's common sense to bathe, and yet they're just rubbing it, you know, they're being savages by doing that.
9273000	9276000	But it's a con, and when you're drinking 24-7, sometimes common sense goes out the window, what can you say?
9277000	9283000	Yeah, but even then, I, even I, even in my hotel, I was able to shower and, you know, adhere to hygiene.
9284000	9292000	Unlike certain other individuals, you know, who are out there with neckbeards and, you know, beast bodies.
9293000	9294000	Alright, alright.
9294000	9295000	But yes.
9296000	9299000	Zaku, I'm going to let you go, because we're going to wrap up the show here pretty soon.
9300000	9304000	I do have one more thing. I manage to snag about 10 Rock Band 4 DLC vouchers.
9305000	9306000	Oh, nice.
9307000	9311000	For both platforms. If you want some codes, let me know, and I'll start doling them out.
9312000	9317000	Send me an Xbox One code, and then see if some of our live chatters maybe want the codes.
9318000	9319000	Alright.
9320000	9321000	Awesome. Sweet, thanks, Zaku.
9321000	9322000	Yep.
9322000	9324000	See, I didn't even have to go to PAX, and I'm getting free shit from PAX.
9325000	9326000	You're the man.
9327000	9328000	Alright. Take care, my friend.
9329000	9330000	Have a good one.
9330000	9331000	You too, bye.
9332000	9335000	Heck yeah! Free stuff from PAX. They didn't even go.
9336000	9338000	Alright, one more call. Hi, you're on Ornishong's radio. What is this?
9339000	9340000	It's the one and only Ranma.
9341000	9342000	Hey buddy, how you doing?
9343000	9346000	My shoulder hurts. I'm just sitting here relaxing with a tall blue moon.
9346000	9358000	Ah, nice. I would be enjoying a glass of wine right now, but sometimes I have to go get Alan at work late. It just kind of depends on how things are going, so I try not to drink during the show if I know there's a chance.
9359000	9360000	One sip won't hurt.
9361000	9366000	Yeah, but I'm not going to crack open the bottle just to have a sip, because Loki's not really a wine drinker.
9367000	9373000	Shane ain't here. Shane would drink the wine in a heartbeat. Jamie would have a little bit if she's here. I'm just going to have to save it for a couple weeks from now.
9373000	9383000	Let me tell you something. If Mako-chan lived on the west coast and was your next door neighbor, as soon as you pulled the cork, you two would be sipping winos right next to each other. You'd have someone to help you finish the bottle.
9384000	9390000	If Mako-chan fucking lived next door to me, it would be a goddamn sitcom non-stop here at this house and you know it.
9391000	9392000	Yeah!
9394000	9401000	It would be kind of similar to the Golden Girls or something. Or another one of those shows where the neighbor just shows up every episode. Like Married with Children.
9401000	9404000	I say Golden Girls meets Three's Company.
9409000	9411000	What are you saying? Are you saying I'm Jack?
9413000	9415000	I do not allude to anything, okay?
9416000	9419000	Are you saying that I'm faking the gay thing to get chicks?
9421000	9425000	But if people assume you're Jack, I tell you what Rob, you are one hell of a fabulous Jack.
9426000	9431000	Well thank you very much. John Ritter was an amazing person so I would take that as a compliment.
9432000	9438000	Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about sitcom dreams, but what's on your mind?
9439000	9453000	Actually, I just came back from a two day convention locally out here in Jersey and I actually filmed the game room. I don't know if you saw the video, but you would have shed a tear. You would have been so proud of it.
9453000	9466000	I didn't see the video yet because I saw it come through while I was setting up for the show, but I did see you tagged me in something and I kind of laughed because I was like, oh well Boston's got PAX East going on right now and you know Jersey's got a game room.
9467000	9477000	Yeah, but if you think about it, a lot of anime conventions nowadays don't have as many b-money or dancing music arcade machines.
9478000	9479000	Which is a shame.
9480000	9493000	Yeah, it's true. Anime conventions, I was like, you didn't go to Magfest because I went to Arcade Infinity back in the day and I had never seen as many music games in one place as I saw at fucking Magfest.
9494000	9499000	See, Magfest is his own little world because you know there's going to be those types of games everywhere.
9499000	9512000	Yeah, Magfest is just another category. But anyway, yes. Anime conventions, sometimes they have the b-money stuff. Like Faname does a pretty good job from what I remember out here on the West Coast.
9513000	9518000	But yeah, in the middle of Jersey, all the b-money, probably not something you see every day. But that's still pretty cool.
9518000	9527000	Yeah, it was a place called Tokyo at Games Attack, I believe. They're the ones that brought the machines in. I walked in, I was just like, my god.
9528000	9531000	Almost positive that's the company that does it for a lot of the cons out there.
9532000	9540000	Probably so. I mean, let's see, if I remember correctly, there was a DDR machine, it was JuBeat, two Taika no Tatsujin machines.
9541000	9548000	It's UBeat. We don't want to beat up friends in our Jewish community. It's UBeat.
9549000	9550000	You know where I live?
9551000	9552000	Not JuBeat.
9553000	9563000	God, I'm terrible tonight. There was a, I don't know, I can't call it Dance Masters, but it was like a dancing game that Konami put out.
9563000	9569000	It started, the main title is Dance, but I forget.
9570000	9572000	Dance Maniacs? Dance Evolution?
9573000	9582000	No. It was a newer dancing game, and it was sort of like playing Just Dance or Dance Central.
9583000	9584000	I swear it's Dance Evolution.
9585000	9586000	No, it's uh, yeah.
9587000	9588000	It's Dance Masters on the Kinect.
9588000	9589000	Anyway.
9590000	9598000	It might have been Evolution, but let's see, there was a pop music machine. Oddly enough, two Street Fighter V machines.
9601000	9604000	There was a table flipping game, and there was a long line for that.
9605000	9611000	That has become quite the thing at anime conventions now, that fucking table flipping game, which, don't get me wrong, it's fun, but...
9611000	9619000	And there was this title arcade machine. I couldn't figure it out, but it looked like it was sort of like an electronic crane game.
9620000	9624000	It was like three people, and you don't have time to hit the button for the crane to come down or something like that.
9625000	9626000	Interesting.
9627000	9631000	Well, so you had a good time at the convention. We'll hear more about it on an anime jam session this week.
9631000	9648000	Oh, yeah, definitely. I had a blast. It's like I said on Twitter, once a year, I get up at 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, grab my gear, and trek all the way up to Jersey for this convention, and spend 12 to 13 hours out there having a blast.
9649000	9650000	That's awesome.
9651000	9666000	I'm thinking about New York again. There was a big Ingress thing that's supposed to happen in Brooklyn over Memorial Day weekend. I was really thinking about it, but it's just a little too soon financially for me to do it, but I do want to see if there's going to be a con out there or something I might want to time it with.
9667000	9670000	But I'm trying to decide between that or Disney World.
9671000	9675000	Well, I might be able to get you to come out here. I mean, you do like Vegas, right?
9676000	9677000	Fuck yeah, I like Vegas.
9677000	9683000	Well, our local anime convention, Anime Next, is moved to Atlantic City.
9684000	9688000	Okay. Never been there. Never been there.
9689000	9701000	So you could go to the con and have a good time, and since a lot of the youngins are not allowed to go because their parents will let them go to the conventions in Atlantic City, there's nightlife and there are tons of casinos.
9701000	9706000	Alright, I'll look into it, but Disney World is also kind of winning right now, but we'll see. We'll see.
9707000	9712000	Hey, that con will always be there. I mean, Disney World, Disney World is straight up Disney. I mean, come on now.
9713000	9716000	Yeah, but you know, life is short. I gotta go, so.
9717000	9718000	Play hard.
9719000	9720000	Alright. Take care, my friend. I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.
9721000	9722000	You too, bro. Take care, man.
9723000	9729000	Alright. Bye bye. Always good to hear from Rama and all you guys that were calling in tonight. I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through. Our phone was lighting up solid all night.
9729000	9740000	But if you do want to send us an email, that'd be fantastic. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, or you could also tweet us. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Yeah, would love feedback in all sorts of ways.
9741000	9747000	We'll try to get some more of you on the show next week. And yes, we will be back next week. I'm done taking shows off.
9748000	9758000	Pray there's no horrible crisis. Loki, you can't get sick, because if you and Jamie are sick, I swear to God, I'm doing a solo Orange Lounge radio.
9759000	9768000	The Robbie Black Wolf show. And it won't be pretty. I'm not as talented as he is, flying solo. Alright, anyway.
9769000	9772000	So that's it. I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to get out there?
9773000	9785000	Yeah, I was gonna say they announced Borderlands 3's developments can be starting here pretty soon. Also, as part of some special DLC, they're gonna have some of the Battleborn characters available for Rock Band 4.
9785000	9794000	So be able to get those characters in there if you're playing Rock Band 4. That's it.
9795000	9808000	Alright. Well, that is gonna do it for this episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys again. I really can't thank you enough for being loyal to the show, sticking with the show through thick and thin.

9854000	9863000	A nice five-star review wherever you found this show would go a very long way in helping us out as well and sticking out amongst the pack of thousands and thousands of video game podcasts that are out there.
9864000	9868000	Time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. Loki, we'll start you. Your final thought.
9869000	9875000	I'm really going to try to work on my game this week. Hopefully I can catch up on sleep. I've been trying. I haven't been staying up that late.
9876000	9878000	Alright, good luck. I would love to see you make progress on that. That'd be awesome.
9879000	9880000	I would love to see my game make progress as well.
9881000	9889000	Alright, and my final thought for this week is I beat Miitomo this week. I didn't talk about it my gaming week, but I beat Miitomo.
9890000	9891000	I just saw that tweet.
9892000	9899000	I hit level 20 in both the personality or what do they call it? Social or whatever circle and I hit 20 in style. And so I got the super sparkle crown.
9900000	9909000	But yet I still feel the need to check it every day. Why? Because I read more interesting things on Miitomo than I do on Facebook. Sorry not sorry.
9910000	9919000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for being with us. We'll be back in seven days to talk about what happens next week in games with all of you guys.
9920000	9924000	So come on back in seven days. We'll do it all again. Until then, have fun and play nice.
