7000	14000	Who's the hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week we're showing our roots with this headline. The next version of DDR DDR Ace is coming to America this spring and summer to about half of all Dave and Buster's locations. There's plenty more video game news in store and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	43000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 637 for this April the 10th of 2016.
44000	56000	Welcome back. We were off last week but we're back here this week to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Assembled here in lovely Sacramento, California in our studio N7 with myself, Rob Roberts.
56000	64000	But you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And by my side, my lovely co-host over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64000	65000	Hi.
65000	66000	Hi, how are you Jamie Summers?
66000	67000	I'm well, how are you?
67000	78000	Good. I'm tired. I was like really, really, really tired because I've had a very busy weekend but I took a 20 minute nap before the show and I swear a 20 minute nap makes all the difference. I feel a lot better.
78000	80000	I went to bed at 3 and woke up at 2.
80000	81000	3 in the morning?
81000	82000	Yeah.
82000	83000	Oh my gosh.
83000	89000	Because I had the smart idea to make coffee to make up for the awful horrid coffee at Dad's Kitchen.
89000	90000	Uh-huh.
90000	95000	By the way, the food at Dad's Kitchen in Folsom, amazing. Their coffee, crap.
95000	96000	Just saying.
96000	98000	Just a tip for you locals.
98000	99000	So I made coffee.
99000	102000	We probably did get more local listeners thanks to yesterday so it's relevant.
102000	107000	Dan and I, we did stay up a little bit late just, you know, hanging out.
107000	108000	Yeah.
108000	109000	Doing stuff.
109000	110000	Cool.
110000	111000	Playing with Kat.
111000	112000	Alright.
112000	113000	And I'm still trying to get him on Miitomo.
113000	117000	I thought he was on Miitomo. I thought everybody was on Miitomo. We'll talk about that in a little bit.
117000	118000	He's resistant.
118000	124000	We'll talk about that in a little bit. But first, of course, I always have to introduce him as well here in studio by our side, our other co-host, Techmaster Loki.
124000	126000	Yes, he's one of the resistant ones.
126000	129000	Are you not on Miitomo? I thought you were. I thought I added you.
129000	132000	There's a me out there. Okay, here's the thing. Here's the crazy thing about Miitomo.
132000	137000	I get, like, this is going to sound so, like, cocky. I hate it. I'm sorry.
137000	141000	But I have so many friend requests in Miitomo that, you know, I'm just approving.
141000	144000	Like, if we're linked on Facebook or Twitter, I'm like, whatever, approve, approve, approve.
144000	149000	And one came through and I thought it was Twitter and it said, Matt, and I swear the icon looked just like you.
149000	150000	And I was like, oh, it's Loki.
150000	155000	And, like, it even tells you who it is once you go in it, but I didn't even look because I'm going through it so fast.
155000	157000	I thought you were, oh, I thought you were on it.
157000	158000	No.
158000	161000	Oh, well, shoot. Why the hatin'? Why the resisting?
161000	163000	That's not why the hatin', just not interested in doing it.
163000	164000	Yeah?
164000	170000	I have a feeling it's going to be one of those things that I'm going to get a million goddamn updates on.
170000	173000	And I'm like, no, I am not doing that shit.
173000	179000	Yeah, I had to turn it off on my phone because that first day, especially, I mean, the friend request thing has really died down.
179000	183000	But the first day, especially, like, I had the alerts on and I'm not even joking.
183000	189000	Like, every five minutes since I downloaded the app, like, it kept going off.
189000	190000	I'm like, shut the fuck up.
190000	195000	So, finally, I was able to figure out how to turn off all the little switches and now it doesn't annoy me.
195000	200000	Because, yeah, if you let it, it will be like, DarkSakura answered a question.
200000	204000	DarkSakura hearted one of your questions, you know, or some of that.
204000	207000	It's bad enough that, like, my Facebook and Twitter apps are starting to do that.
208000	211000	You know, there's been an update or what was it like?
211000	220000	I remember I used to get Facebook updates that I had, like, unread messages or something that are like unread notifications.
220000	225000	And the unread notification was another notification saying that I had unread notifications.
225000	228000	It was like notification ception or something like that.
228000	231000	Like, I really didn't have any unread notifications.
231000	236000	It just sent me one of those and they kept sending me another one and another one and another one.
236000	243000	Did you hear about all that crazy stuff, though, where I guess Facebook has yet another, like, hidden inbox or something of messages?
243000	244000	Oh, I know about that.
244000	246000	That's existed for, like, years.
246000	251000	I think they moved. I think at one point it was, like, unknown.
251000	253000	But then they, like, moved it or something.
253000	254000	Like, it's another place.
254000	258000	Yeah, because that's the one where if you don't know, you're not a friend to somebody, that's where it will go.
258000	261000	Or you pay the dollar and they get it in their inbox or whatever.
261000	267000	The hilarious thing is because I have my Rob Roberts name on Facebook, right?
267000	274000	So all my other inbox is is other people named Rob Roberts, I think, trying to figure out who has the account.
277000	281000	Because it's like, hello? And their name is Rob Roberts as well.
281000	283000	Oh, yeah, I had that before.
283000	285000	Which is funny because that's not my real name, but it might as well be.
285000	290000	I had someone, yeah, with my same name and they, like, tried to give me a joint group with the same people with the same name.
290000	295000	And I did for a while and I'm like, wow, all these people are losers. No thanks.
295000	298000	Come hang out with us. We all have the same name.
298000	302000	One of them was, like, extremely racist, like, somewhere in Ohio or something.
302000	304000	I'm like, nope.
304000	307000	It's like when your profile picture is, you know.
307000	308000	I love it.
308000	312000	It's, what's it, the Confederate flag that's...
312000	314000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
314000	316000	Woop woop. Red alert, red alert.
316000	318000	Aside from all the other posts that they made, yeah.
318000	322000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
322000	331000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
331000	337000	So if you are listening to us live, you can join our chat room and we can get your comments and feedback on the air.
337000	342000	In fact, Alan Alka will be talking about the Facebook hidden inbox saying,
342000	344000	I knew about the Facebook thing years ago.
344000	351000	I had three members of my estranged family trying to say hi to me that I didn't see until literally two to three years after the fact.
351000	353000	So, hmm.
353000	355000	Let's see, also some comments on Miitomo.
355000	360000	SHU100Matt saying, I'm not on Miitomo. I'm just so preoccupied with other things.
360000	364000	Also, I wonder how much it will be supported and if people will get tired of it.
364000	368000	VxChaseNextV agreeing that Miitomo's notification sound is pretty rough.
368000	370000	I can tell you if you can get tired of it or not.
370000	372000	Answer me one question.
372000	374000	So how are your Nintendogs doing?
374000	377000	Exactly, that's how this is going to go.
377000	381000	It's quite different than that though.
381000	383000	Yeah, it is different than Nintendogs.
383000	385000	I gotta say, okay, here's my thoughts on Miitomo.
385000	390000	All that stuff aside, and I guess admittedly I set the bar pretty low on Miitomo,
390000	399000	but I honestly think Miitomo is like ten times more interesting than Tomodachi Life was on the 3DS.
399000	403000	Remember all the hoop and holler about that game, especially because there was controversy and all that stuff?
403000	405000	I think Miitomo is a more interesting game.
405000	407000	Ten times zero is still zero, so...
407000	409000	Shut up.
409000	414000	But yeah, I think Miitomo is interesting from a social network perspective,
414000	422000	and it's kind of blowing my mind because I would not have expected Nintendo to create a somewhat interesting social network.
422000	426000	It's not going to replace Facebook, it's not going to replace Twitter, any of that,
426000	430000	but I will say this, tease all you want about the longevity of Miitomo.
430000	432000	What happened to Peach, y'all?
432000	434000	Remember Peach?
434000	436000	What happened to Peach?
436000	437000	That was a thing, right?
437000	439000	Peach was replaced by Petch.
439000	441000	What about Ello?
441000	442000	When was the last time y'all logged?
442000	444000	Remember when we were all going to quit Facebook?
444000	445000	I still get email from Ello.
445000	446000	Yeah, I get email from them too.
446000	447000	Oh, I get email this whole time.
447000	448000	I'm like, shut the fuck up.
448000	451000	Stop sending me email because they're like, please don't forget us, we're dying.
451000	454000	Remember when you hated Facebook and you made an account here?
454000	455000	Come back!
455000	457000	No, delete.
457000	462000	So, yeah, I think Miitomo has more legs than Peach and Ello.
462000	463000	I'll give it that.
463000	470000	I realize Loki's probably sitting there going, well, when you set the bar at half an inch off the ground, you got a lot of room to go.
470000	473000	But I think there is that at least.
473000	476000	I don't know if it's going to last months and months and months.
476000	477000	Probably not.
477000	483000	I think it's interesting that you have this whole like platinum coins thing and you can earn them in Miitomo
483000	489000	and you can earn them every day and they are going to turn into things where you can get like discounts on Nintendo games and stuff,
489000	491000	which is kind of neat.
491000	493000	Like it's the whole like achievement points.
493000	495000	Or unheard of because they don't discount their games.
495000	497000	Well, they do now.
497000	499000	You can get what, 50% off Holy World or whatever?
499000	507000	Well, I like though that it starts conversations and that they've actually led to some really interesting discussion.
507000	508000	Yeah.
508000	511000	So I've learned, I've actually met new people on there.
511000	513000	I've learned a lot about different things.
513000	519000	I found out that, like for example, that children have stronger taste sensitivity to bitter foods.
519000	522000	And that's why they don't like broccoli.
522000	525000	Was that like one of those like name an interesting fact that you learned today?
525000	531000	No, it was like name a food that you used to hate that you like now and I said Brussels sprouts.
531000	534000	But there's a scientific explanation.
534000	537000	What if I still don't like Brussels sprouts though?
537000	539000	Then you're not, then you're just sensitive.
539000	541000	I don't hate them as much as I used to as a kid.
541000	547000	But like Alan will say, we're going to have Brussels sprouts tonight and I'll still make that face that's scrunchie like.
547000	550000	That's because you're overly sensitive to bitterness.
550000	553000	Maybe because I am bad when you're made of bitterness.
553000	555000	What's left?
555000	559000	Going to chat over at live.vog network.com.
559000	561000	Act Def says me photo.
561000	562000	That's the app seller.
562000	568000	Okay, that's the little thing where you can actually put your me's in crazy situations.
568000	573000	But you can actually import pictures from your phone.
573000	578000	Which you can imagine has led to all sorts of hilarity and x-ratedness.
578000	582000	Or the me just covering up the x-ratedness enough.
582000	585000	I've been taking screenshots in other games.
585000	591000	So like I have my me hanging out in like the Kingdom Hearts game.
591000	592000	Okay.
592000	595000	The Kingdom Hearts X Unchained whatever.
595000	598000	Yeah, that's the other big cell phone release everybody's playing.
598000	604000	I tried to play that but it's like I want to download an update five minutes later.
604000	607000	4% done. I'm just like forget it.
607000	608000	It's kind of boring.
608000	610000	I got a million other things to do right now.
610000	611000	Jamie review. Kind of boring.
611000	612000	Kind of boring?
612000	613000	Kind of boring.
613000	614000	Alright.
614000	615000	The music's good.
615000	618000	Kind of boring, the music's good. There it is.
618000	622000	Dark Soccer, any other final thoughts on Miitomo?
622000	626000	I feel like it's one of those things like almost everybody played it this week.
626000	629000	Obviously there's going to be folks like Loki that are like no I resist.
629000	631000	I'm not resisting I just don't care.
631000	632000	I think there's a ton.
632000	640000	I'm sorry but like I have never seen a social network or a game explode that much in the first two days as much as I've seen Miitomo.
640000	642000	Just based on the frame requests I'm getting.
642000	643000	I like dressing up.
643000	645000	And I have Midna on my back.
645000	647000	I got the little black cat.
647000	649000	I like the little mini games. Those are fun.
649000	650000	Yeah the mini games are kind of...
650000	654000	Especially dropping your friends on their head and watching them go blah blah blah.
654000	656000	And it makes excite bike noises. Did you notice that?
656000	657000	Yeah.
657000	659000	When they bounce around it's all excite bike stuff.
659000	665000	So I will be curious to see and I think Loki that is a valid thing and I think it's something we're all wondering.
665000	668000	How are they going to keep Miitomo interesting?
668000	671000	Like what's going to cause us to load it a week from now?
671000	673000	Oh I remembered something else interesting.
673000	676000	Listening to all the Miis say fuck.
676000	679000	Yes. Your Miis will say fuck.
679000	682000	Like Nintendo doesn't censor that which I've got to give them a little bit of credit for.
682000	686000	But if you have friends who just aren't, you know, offended by that then whatever.
686000	687000	Whatever.
687000	693000	And I've seen all sorts of states of undress and people looking interesting.
693000	701000	What I don't understand is how you're able to send friend requests to each other without exchanging some sort of numeric code.
701000	705000	I have a serious answer for that. There's three ways to do it.
705000	708000	You can link your Facebook account. You can link your Twitter account.
708000	711000	And then once you do that it'll show you here's all your friends on Facebook on Miitomo.
711000	714000	Here's all your mutual Twitter followers on Miitomo as well.
714000	716000	And you can add people that way. I think that's the way most people did it.
716000	720000	Wow that's pretty cool. Why can't they do that on their stupid consoles?
720000	721000	Well.
721000	723000	I wish they did have friend codes though.
723000	727000	Maybe this is the thing that's going to happen for NX. Maybe.
727000	729000	Just give them a little credit.
729000	736000	Alan is asking about the QR code. That is just to import someone's Mii to use in photos.
736000	737000	Correct.
737000	748000	So that doesn't do the friend sharing. I wish that you could do friend sharing via QR or a friend code because I have people who actually are not on social media who play Miitomo.
748000	753000	The only other way you can do it. There's a thing called I think Bump. But you have to be in the same room.
754000	757000	Because it uses the GPS to figure out who's near each other.
757000	763000	So if you're near each other and then you tap the same symbol. It's like clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades. Like from a deck of cards.
763000	767000	You both tap the same symbol. Like syncing a Bluetooth or something.
767000	770000	And then it'll say okay here's all the people that have the same symbol and range.
770000	773000	It'll say nasties have been bumped. You're welcome.
773000	774000	What's that?
774000	776000	It'll say nasties have been bumped. You're welcome.
776000	778000	Nasties have been bumped.
779000	785000	Oh lord. Alright. Yeah so there you go. That's Miitomo.
785000	794000	So again the bar was low but I enjoy it more than I thought I would. I really do.
794000	800000	So I paid actual money for Tomodachi Life and now I'm kind of pissed off.
800000	805000	Like if Miitomo made me angry at anything it made me angry I spent money on Tomodachi Life.
805000	807000	Well that's something you're just going to live with.
807000	812000	Yeah that is. That's the consequence I'm going to have to live with. I'm just going to have to sit here and think about what I've done.
812000	813000	Perhaps you'll learn your lesson this time.
813000	818000	Never. Never. How many games are in your Steam library?
818000	819000	Plenty.
819000	821000	Have you stopped buying Steam games?
821000	823000	I haven't bought Steam games in a while.
823000	825000	I still have to finish Danganronpa.
825000	826000	Not to say they haven't shopped for them.
826000	827000	I've been so busy.
827000	830000	Like they're in there telling me I should play Project Egg Zone 2.
830000	836000	I'm like I don't have time. I still have to finish Danganronpa and I have stuff I'm being paid to do.
836000	839000	Speaking of Steam. So we've got two weeks to catch up on right?
839000	845000	I wasn't. We weren't here last week because I wasn't here last week so the Studio OLR was locked.
845000	849000	So Dark Soccer's at the front door. Let me in.
849000	851000	Actually I think she has a key but I digress.
851000	853000	I don't think I have a key anymore.
853000	858000	I was not here because Alan and I went to Tucson to visit some friends of ours that live there.
858000	862000	And we thought well there's also this Ingress event going on in Tucson.
862000	866000	Let's do a twofer. We'll do both. We'll get the most bang for our buck. We'll do the Ingress thing.
866000	871000	Which I'm not going to get into all the details about that because I know a lot of you don't play and that's fine.
871000	883000	But that was intense with so many people in one place playing the same game and yelling out like audibles from team to team.
883000	888000	Recharge! Recharge! Drop it! Drop it! They took it! They took it! Deploy! Deploy! Shield! Shield! Axle! Ultra!
888000	890000	People are just like what the fuck is going on?
890000	894000	Oh you should see the people that have no idea what they walked into.
894000	897000	Okay here's one funny story I'll tell that everybody can appreciate.
897000	902000	So one of the nodes that ended up being called a volatile node which means it was worth double points.
902000	905000	One of them was at a federal building.
905000	912000	Keep in mind which node did my team get assigned to? The federal building.
912000	915000	So we're all there on a Saturday. Now you don't have to go inside the building.
915000	918000	But it was right outside the building.
918000	922000	And it was a hot day so we were like we're just going to go stand under in the shade.
922000	924000	So we did. We all went and went and stand under in the shade.
924000	927000	And so we're all doing our thing. Deploy! Deploy!
927000	931000	We're being very careful not to use the words blow it up.
931000	935000	Because in the game that's what you fire little lasers you blow.
935000	939000	But we were very careful. Do not say the words blow it up.
939000	940000	Do the opposite of recharging.
940000	943000	Yes do the opposite of recharging.
943000	946000	So we were very very careful with the words that we used.
946000	948000	However there was still a security guard on Saturday.
948000	950000	And the security guard actually came up and said.
950000	952000	You know actually they were super nice about it.
952000	954000	Like they weren't like a douchebag security guard.
954000	958000	I think they were like hey I know you guys are doing like some weird game thing here.
958000	960000	I can see all the people around town.
960000	963000	But got to have you 50 feet away from the building or whatever.
963000	965000	You know so they were really cool about it.
965000	968000	But like okay. Niantic.
968000	973000	Maybe in the future don't fucking put volatiles at federal buildings.
973000	975000	On a Saturday.
975000	979000	So yeah I didn't but I didn't think about that.
979000	980000	It was just funny.
980000	983000	So that was Ingress in a nutshell.
983000	985000	But we went to Tucson.
985000	988000	And I will say a quick little aside about Tucson.
988000	990000	I don't know if we have any listeners there.
990000	992000	Besides you know my friends that live there.
992000	995000	But one of the days we were there we were walking around the street fair.
995000	997000	The 4th Avenue Street Fair.
997000	998000	Which you know had a ton of vendors.
998000	1002000	But right in that same area there was actually a pinball arcade.
1002000	1004000	It was nothing but pinball.
1004000	1007000	Well maybe like two maim type machines.
1007000	1009000	But most of it was pinball games.
1009000	1010000	And I was pretty impressed.
1010000	1012000	In fact I was like Dark Sakura needs to see this.
1012000	1015000	I'm sure she's probably seen all these machines at some point in her life.
1015000	1020000	But still to see them all in one place outside of a convention or something is still pretty impressive.
1020000	1022000	Did you happen to see the picture I put on Instagram Dark Sakura?
1022000	1024000	There was like a ton of pinball games in this place.
1024000	1025000	It was pretty nice.
1025000	1026000	I didn't find.
1026000	1027000	Yeah.
1027000	1028000	Yeah I didn't see it.
1028000	1029000	It was cool.
1029000	1031000	There was a lot of different games there.
1031000	1033000	So what did I play?
1033000	1035000	Oh I played a Star Trek machine.
1035000	1037000	Not the next generation but the original Star Trek.
1037000	1039000	But not the movie Star Trek.
1039000	1040000	So I played that machine.
1040000	1041000	I know that one.
1041000	1042000	Because I'm a nerd.
1042000	1044000	It's not a Gottlieb is it?
1044000	1045000	I don't remember.
1045000	1047000	It has the transporter animation.
1047000	1049000	Yeah I know what you're talking about.
1049000	1051000	It's like from like 83 or something.
1051000	1052000	Yeah it's definitely an 80's machine.
1052000	1053000	But it was fun.
1053000	1056000	So I played that and watched my friends play some other games.
1056000	1059000	So I was pretty impressed by that little pinball museum they had there.
1059000	1060000	So that is my gaming thing there.
1060000	1064000	But also my friends in Tucson owned a Steam Link.
1064000	1066000	And I'd never seen one before.
1066000	1068000	But my friend was playing.
1068000	1069000	Oh now I can't remember.
1069000	1070000	What's that game?
1070000	1074000	It was a Kickstarter game and it like just came out in the past couple weeks.
1074000	1075000	Pixel art style.
1075000	1077000	Zelda-esque but really really hard.
1077000	1079000	Somebody in chat will know what I'm talking about.
1079000	1081000	By the way it's Bally.
1081000	1082000	Okay thank you.
1082000	1085000	It's Red something I think is in the title.
1085000	1087000	So somebody in chat will know over at live.com.
1087000	1088000	You mean Hyperlight Drifter?
1088000	1089000	Is that it?
1089000	1090000	Hyperlight Drifter.
1090000	1091000	Yes that is it.
1091000	1092000	Hyperlight Drifter.
1092000	1093000	That is the game.
1093000	1096000	So I was watching him play that through Steam Link on the TV.
1096000	1098000	Because I guess he was running it on the computer upstairs.
1098000	1100000	And playing it on the big screen downstairs.
1100000	1103000	And I was kind of like huh this is kind of neat.
1103000	1105000	And I'm like so these things are only like 50 bucks?
1105000	1106000	Yeah.
1106000	1108000	Alright shit I'm going to get one.
1108000	1109000	So we bought a Steam Link.
1109000	1111000	So when I was teasing you about your Steam Library.
1111000	1114000	We were actually we bought a Steam Link and we were using that a little bit.
1114000	1116000	And yeah I was going through the library going wow.
1116000	1119000	I have all these games I don't think I've ever even touched.
1119000	1121000	But now I can play them on the Steam Link.
1121000	1122000	So that's pretty cool.
1122000	1124000	Okay I'm stupid it was Data East.
1124000	1125000	Hmm.
1125000	1126000	The pinball.
1126000	1127000	Oh I think.
1127000	1131000	No because Bally had the license and Data East had the license and Data East did I think the later one.
1131000	1132000	Yeah.
1132000	1133000	So sorry I didn't mean to.
1133000	1134000	Yeah.
1134000	1135000	I should know my pinball better.
1135000	1137000	Bobby Blackwolf says also got a Steam Controller.
1137000	1140000	I considered getting the controller I just didn't end up.
1140000	1142000	I was like nah I knew the Xbox One controllers worked.
1142000	1144000	So I was like eh that'll be good enough.
1144000	1146000	We had a Steam Link and we returned it.
1146000	1152000	Yeah I know you guys I remember because before we bought it you said you guys didn't care for it.
1152000	1154000	What was the negative?
1154000	1157000	Well I thought it was neat and Dan's the one who really played it more than I did.
1157000	1159000	I really didn't get a chance to.
1159000	1168000	But some of the games there was like way too much lag between our computers and because he was actually playing it off of my Steam Library.
1168000	1174000	And I wouldn't say that my computer is like well at least my gaming rig is probably the best that ever existed.
1174000	1179000	But when he tried to play like I think more advanced games there was definitely some lag.
1179000	1182000	And so he's just like yeah this.
1182000	1185000	He returned it didn't consult me but.
1185000	1187000	Well you can borrow ours someday maybe.
1187000	1190000	But well I.
1190000	1192000	Were you wired on that.
1192000	1193000	Or wireless.
1193000	1195000	I don't remember I think he did it wirelessly.
1195000	1199000	See we're wired on ours because we thought that might be a problem.
1199000	1203000	But since the rooms are next to each other we knew we could run a long cord around the wall and that's what we did.
1203000	1204000	And so it's wired.
1204000	1213000	And so I think that does make a huge difference because I can imagine if it's wireless you're going to get the stop and go and the things that come with wireless networking.
1213000	1214000	So yeah.
1214000	1215000	But wired is great.
1215000	1220000	So I've already made a decision though that I'm going to get a controller for my Apple TV.
1220000	1223000	Because you can get the DuckTales game on Apple TV.
1223000	1224000	Oh that's right.
1224000	1226000	It's actually getting a lot more games.
1226000	1231000	Yeah the whole like there there's just a ton of stuff that will broadcast to TV now I always get these pop ups on my computers.
1231000	1235000	Get the Nvidia Shield it will do because you know because I have the driver.
1235000	1242000	No I'm just like well yeah I know I'm like what do I need it for I have a steam link now like that literally I did I didn't even really need it.
1242000	1245000	I just was like well it might be fun and it's neat.
1245000	1247000	But yeah that's it.
1247000	1251000	So yeah that's why we didn't have a show last week I was out of town.
1251000	1256000	So we've been without a show for a couple weeks or just two weeks we've been one week without a show.
1256000	1261000	But we are back today and we'll continue to be throughout the next few weeks on Sundays.
1261000	1266000	No no shows off that we see in the future until like Labor Day weekend when I'm out of town in Atlanta Dragon Con.
1266000	1271000	So we have plenty of shows coming up for you guys over the coming weeks.
1271000	1279000	Which an interesting kind of aside you might remember a few weeks ago I was talking about that we were having issues on Stitcher.
1279000	1283000	And like Stitcher hadn't updated our show since like what like February or something.
1283000	1287000	Well all of a sudden I guess the backlog got caught up.
1287000	1292000	And I think what happened is I think enough people because somebody actually contacted us on Facebook going.
1292000	1294000	Hey I'm trying to get your show on Stitcher and I can't.
1294000	1299000	It's just like I'm kind of like in this place where it's like I'm so frustrated not obviously the feedback.
1299000	1303000	I'm not frustrated the feedback is completely valid I'm frustrated there's like nothing I can do.
1303000	1306000	I've pinged Stitcher I've tried to update our URL and all this stuff.
1306000	1311000	So I was like hey can you email Stitcher and tell them you miss us because it's kind of out of our control.
1311000	1317000	Well I guess that person did that and maybe enough people did that where finally it got updated so yay to that.
1317000	1321000	But yeah so at least there's that.
1321000	1328000	The people that thought our show just ended because they were listening on Stitcher at least got like eight more episodes.
1328000	1332000	So hopefully they didn't miss us as bad last week when we really didn't have a show this last week.
1333000	1338000	But I will remind everybody please please consider following us on Twitter.
1338000	1341000	Twitter.com slash OLR or Facebook.
1341000	1346000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio especially the Twitter because when we don't have a show we'll let you know.
1346000	1352000	Like you know and if this show heaven forbid were to ever end or stop.
1352000	1360000	We'll let you know on social media that hey the last episode is happening come show up and say goodbye.
1360000	1365000	You know we'll give you some advance we will do everything we can to give you advance notice.
1365000	1369000	And not just surprise you one week like gotcha we're gone forever.
1369000	1376000	So anyway Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the last episode of OLR is happening.
1376000	1380000	What some day some day but just not today.
1380000	1384000	I hope I hope you know this is the last episode for this week.
1384000	1386000	Yes it is.
1386000	1389000	This is the very last episode of OLR for this week.
1390000	1395000	Alright Dr. Suyin in chat says I won't know what to do with my Sunday nights at 6.
1395000	1397000	Oh God neither would I.
1397000	1399000	After doing this for what we're almost on 14 years.
1399000	1403000	There was a few months ago remember when I was sick.
1403000	1405000	We missed a show because I was like really sick.
1405000	1409000	Like I'm sitting here Sunday night going I have nothing to do.
1409000	1411000	Like I guess I'll play a video game or something.
1411000	1415000	Like I'm sick and there's no show and my life sucks right now.
1415000	1417000	Like what am I going to do on my Sunday night.
1417000	1421000	So believe me I understand how you feel.
1421000	1424000	One other thing I definitely want to talk about at the top of the show here.
1424000	1427000	And then we'll get into our gaming weeks and we have plenty of news and all that stuff.
1427000	1431000	But absolutely we have to talk about the event we were at yesterday.
1431000	1433000	So even though you didn't get an OLR last week.
1433000	1441000	We were broadcasting all day long yesterday from the SAC Indie Arcade Gaming Expo in West Sacramento.
1441000	1444000	And of course if you heard the last episode of Orange Andreo.
1444000	1450000	We already talked about the event at length because Gabe and Bree were here in studio during our last episode.
1450000	1453000	So we talked a lot about it and so the event actually happened on Saturday.
1453000	1455000	So we were broadcasting all day.
1455000	1459000	Although admittedly we didn't really have a lot to do.
1459000	1463000	But that's a good thing because the speakers were pretty much non-stop throughout the day.
1463000	1468000	So you were pretty much getting the speakers and we would chime in once in a while.
1468000	1471000	But there was just so much other talent there.
1471000	1475000	There wasn't a lot for us to do but kind of just make sure things were still moving.
1475000	1480000	But it just also is a testament to how smoothly run that show is.
1480000	1485000	And I got to say and I told this to Gabe and Bree and anybody I could.
1485000	1491000	Like the growth of the event from last year to this year was so noticeable.
1491000	1495000	Not just the venue. I mean and nothing against the space last year.
1495000	1499000	Because the Cafe Colonial they have been so supportive for the whole thing.
1499000	1502000	But the reality is it just outgrew that space.
1502000	1504000	And so they had to find a new space.
1504000	1507000	There would have been no way it would have fit in the old space.
1507000	1510000	But now they're in that West Sacramento Community Center.
1510000	1513000	Which was an interesting layout because we were joking on Bobby's show.
1513000	1515000	It's like, oh there's a room over here.
1515000	1518000	It's like the game board of Clue.
1518000	1522000	There's a room over here and there's a secret passage from the conservatory to the dining room.
1522000	1525000	Like there's just all this crazy stuff.
1525000	1531000	I was mentioning to Loki that walking backstage was like, it's like a secret passage.
1531000	1532000	It was.
1532000	1536000	And like I was sneaking out through doors and whatnot and yeah it was great.
1536000	1543000	So yeah and a big testament too to the West Sacramento, the community and the city that was putting that on.
1543000	1549000	Because I got to say you know we had dedicated help to making sure that OLR would get up and running.
1549000	1552000	And I got to be honest I'm not often used to that.
1552000	1554000	Not that I do these events every day.
1554000	1558000	But like somebody was dedicated to making sure, do we have everything we need?
1558000	1561000	Do we have the wired internet? Is our sound okay? Is all that stuff?
1561000	1568000	So the reason why when we went up at 10.15 and everything sounded great is because we had help from the venue right there.
1568000	1569000	Any questions we had they worked out.
1569000	1571000	They were like yeah run the wire through here.
1571000	1574000	The router's back over here and we can use your sound.
1574000	1575000	It was just awesome.
1576000	1584000	But anyway the event of course they had lots of indie games from developers here in the Sacramento area.
1584000	1588000	As well as some in the Bay Area and even I think somebody from San Diego was there.
1588000	1591000	And so there were all these local folks showing off their games.
1591000	1598000	And there was everything from tablet games to Wii U games to VR.
1598000	1600000	The Vive was there.
1600000	1603000	To someone creating their own system.
1603000	1608000	Yes. I think that was that 3D conceptual thing right? With the tic-tac-toe.
1608000	1609000	Yeah there was that.
1609000	1611000	And did you see what was right next to that?
1611000	1613000	The big like they would put the key.
1613000	1614000	I don't know what that was.
1614000	1618000	Okay so what that was, I think they were wearing a VR thing.
1618000	1623000	And they had gloves and boots strapped to them.
1623000	1626000	And it was like a, no they didn't have a VR headset on.
1626000	1628000	No they didn't have a VR headset on.
1628000	1631000	They were just dressed up like it and they would knock over like cardboard.
1632000	1634000	Yeah the game was You Are Godzilla.
1634000	1638000	And there was actual cardboard boxes that were set up on the ground.
1638000	1642000	And as you, like there were sensors in the boxes and as you would knock shit over.
1642000	1644000	Like it was doing stuff in the game.
1644000	1647000	Like it would be like combo and like all this stuff.
1647000	1653000	And I was like, okay I don't know what practical use something like that has.
1653000	1655000	Like that's not something you're really ever going to have in a house.
1655000	1658000	But boy is it a fucking great party game.
1658000	1660000	Like that was a lot of fun to watch.
1660000	1662000	And the kids were really into it.
1662000	1664000	But yeah they got suited up in this whole thing.
1664000	1666000	And were tearing down virtual buildings.
1666000	1668000	And I thought that was awesome.
1668000	1670000	So there was just so much creativity there.
1670000	1675000	But we were up in a theater room that was called the black box.
1675000	1676000	Because that's what it was.
1676000	1679000	It was a theater that's like the box type theater.
1679000	1681000	And the room was black.
1681000	1683000	In fact we joked during the day.
1683000	1685000	And I know this doesn't come out very well on radio.
1685000	1687000	But we kept joking about mood lighting.
1687000	1689000	That's because since it was a theater room.
1689000	1692000	For a lot of the day it was pitch black in there.
1692000	1695000	Except you'd have that lone spotlight shining from the ceiling.
1695000	1697000	That's supposed to light actors that are on the stage.
1697000	1699000	Which makes a lot of sense for the play.
1699000	1702000	But for the speakers it was a little like we were like sitting in the dark.
1702000	1705000	And I think even Loki was kind of like I'm falling asleep over here.
1705000	1706000	It's too dark.
1706000	1711000	So it wasn't good for me to like with as little sleep as I get in a very dark room.
1711000	1712000	Right?
1712000	1714000	With somebody giving a very soothing talk.
1714000	1718000	Like I had two Red Bulls and it still was not enough to keep me awake.
1718000	1720000	Like I gotta go downstairs or something.
1720000	1722000	Look the talks were awesome.
1722000	1724000	And props to all the speakers.
1724000	1728000	And this is nothing I didn't joke with Gabe and Bree about beforehand.
1728000	1729000	But I was like okay guys.
1729000	1731000	When you announced the list of speakers.
1731000	1733000	I was like okay this sounds cool.
1733000	1735000	But I don't know any of these people.
1735000	1737000	I was like can I get bio cards.
1737000	1739000	Because I don't know any of these people to introduce or whatever.
1739000	1741000	So I was like okay.
1742000	1744000	But they all gave great talks.
1744000	1746000	All of them gave great talks.
1746000	1748000	And I learned a lot myself.
1748000	1750000	And so I said at the end of the day.
1750000	1751000	I said okay.
1751000	1752000	You know what.
1752000	1753000	Not that I ever doubted you guys.
1753000	1755000	But considering I did not know those people.
1755000	1758000	A. I got to network and meet all those people.
1758000	1761000	And you know that was great networking opportunities and so forth.
1761000	1765000	Just to meet awesome people that do different things in the game industry and mingle with them.
1765000	1766000	But B.
1766000	1768000	Like all of them were prepared.
1768000	1771000	All of them had a great concept behind their talk.
1771000	1774000	And I felt like I even learned a thing or two.
1774000	1779000	So I was really honored that we could bring that to a larger audience at VOG Network.
1779000	1783000	I'm just sorry that probably more people didn't realize it was going on.
1783000	1787000	Because we only have so big of an audience here at OLR.
1787000	1791000	But I think gamers on a wider scale everywhere.
1791000	1796000	Could really benefit from hearing a publisher talk about what a publisher really does.
1796000	1799000	And why devs may want a publisher.
1799000	1801000	And what a publisher can do for them.
1801000	1805000	Because I think so many people pass opinions on companies like EA.
1805000	1807000	Konami and so forth that are publishers.
1807000	1810000	Without necessarily really knowing what a publisher is.
1810000	1811000	You know what I mean.
1811000	1814000	And we may or may not have been guilty of something like that.
1814000	1817000	I still argue that perception is.
1817000	1819000	I have a decent idea what publishers do.
1819000	1820000	Yeah but still.
1820000	1824000	Regardless of how educated or not you are on that.
1824000	1829000	It was still neat to hear it from somebody's mouth like that.
1829000	1834000	And it wasn't just some guy from EA or some big big publisher.
1834000	1837000	But it was I'm an indie publisher essentially.
1837000	1840000	So that was one talk in particular I thought was good.
1840000	1844000	There was another gentleman that talked a lot about biases that you have in developing games.
1844000	1848000	And it's not that you're a jerk or that you're intentionally out to be biased.
1848000	1853000	But it's just that your backgrounds lend to your perceptions.
1853000	1854000	There's that word again.
1854000	1858000	The way you may perceive certain things and what you might end up putting in your game.
1858000	1860000	So you have to be more aware.
1860000	1863000	So I thought it was just so much interesting stuff throughout the day.
1863000	1866000	So big big props to everybody involved with Sac Indie Arcade.
1866000	1871000	We are going to look at putting that out there as a podcast.
1871000	1876000	Getting those audio files out there for you guys so you can download that and listen to it later.
1876000	1879000	Because again I really would love to see more people be able to check this stuff out.
1879000	1882000	My brain just put two words together.
1883000	1885000	Audio files for audio files.
1885000	1887000	Yes. It's something like that.
1887000	1888000	Absolutely.
1888000	1890000	I tried to do the Periscope thing.
1890000	1892000	I actually did a Periscope.
1892000	1895000	Did that work well in a pitch black room like that?
1895000	1897000	Believe it or not yes because the slides came through.
1897000	1902000	Here's where it didn't work well because I never had a Periscope on the OLR account.
1902000	1905000	I couldn't get the name OLR even though that's our Twitter name.
1905000	1910000	So I got Orange Lounge Radio and I just assumed it cross posted to the OLR account but it didn't.
1910000	1915000	So I was wondering why like maybe one or two people were watching the whole time.
1915000	1922000	But it's because unless you were like our friend on Periscope right off the bat you had no idea that we were doing the Periscope.
1922000	1925000	So I did learn some little things like that.
1925000	1929000	I remember friending you on Periscope but for some reason I still got the notification on that.
1929000	1932000	Well I did it from the OLR account not my Rob Roberts account.
1932000	1934000	Well that's a mess.
1934000	1936000	Anyway.
1936000	1937000	So there's that.
1937000	1942000	So but anyway we had a great time and massive props to everybody involved.
1942000	1946000	And I look forward to working with the IGDA here locally on more things.
1946000	1951000	You know Gabe and Bree and we've all talked about we need to do this more than once a year.
1951000	1953000	And absolutely so stay tuned.
1953000	1955000	We'll do that more often.
1955000	1960000	But a big hello and thanks for checking us out to anybody who may have found us at the Sac&D Arcade Gaming Expo.
1960000	1964000	Hope you enjoy what you hear here at the Voice Geeks Network.
1964000	1969000	There's plenty of other podcasts and great shows out there that talk about all sorts of different topics.
1969000	1974000	Not just video games. We have shows on anime, shows on Power Rangers, shows on British television,
1974000	1979000	geek culture, trying new foods from crazy places and eating them.
1979000	1982000	Like there's just there's all sorts of shows on the network.
1982000	1985000	So you can check out the complete lineup at vognetwork.com.
1985000	1988000	But if you're new to Orange Lounge Radio just briefly the concept.
1988000	1993000	Loki Dark Soccer and myself we all met like 15 years ago.
1993000	1995000	Let that sink in for a minute.
1995000	2000000	We all met like 15 years ago playing Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade here.
2000000	2003000	And we used to play DDR on what Wednesday nights.
2003000	2005000	I think it was like the big DDR night.
2005000	2010000	And then we would go to the diner that was in the parking lot and we would talk about video games.
2010000	2013000	Because it was the one thing we all shared the one thing we all had in common.
2013000	2015000	We would talk about video games for a couple hours.
2015000	2016000	At one point we just had the idea.
2016000	2024000	Hey what if we like took the diner conversation and put them on the internet so we could have them with all the diners.
2024000	2027000	And that was pretty much what OLR ended up being.
2027000	2030000	So welcome to the show and hope you enjoy it.
2032000	2038000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase PICKLE.
2039000	2042000	Alright well we talked about a lot there in the opening.
2042000	2048000	But we do like to kick off all of our shows with a little check in on how was your gaming week.
2048000	2051000	And what types of video games have you been playing this week.
2051000	2053000	So Dark Soccer starting with you.
2053000	2054000	How was your gaming week?
2055000	2056000	It was alright.
2056000	2063000	I mean apart from having the expo yesterday which I played Mo & Go and a few other games.
2064000	2069000	I also played a little Danganronpa just a little bit.
2072000	2073000	What else did I play?
2075000	2077000	Some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.
2079000	2080000	And a lot of Ingress.
2081000	2082000	A lot of Miitomo.
2084000	2085000	Dragon Age.
2086000	2087000	Heroes of Dragon Age whatever that is.
2088000	2090000	And that Kingdom Hearts game that was boring but okay.
2091000	2092000	What is it?
2092000	2093000	What are you doing it?
2093000	2096000	You just run around killing things and going on these quests.
2096000	2097000	How do you control it?
2097000	2098000	Is it like a platformer?
2098000	2101000	Yeah well not really a platformer.
2101000	2103000	More like you just direct them where they need to go.
2103000	2105000	You swipe the screen to kill stuff.
2105000	2106000	It was just really boring.
2106000	2107000	Oh.
2107000	2108000	It's cute.
2108000	2110000	I really don't like the style.
2110000	2114000	I like the scenes and everything but I don't like the player characters.
2115000	2118000	Because the style doesn't look like Kingdom Hearts.
2118000	2124000	It looks like we asked some developer in Singapore to make this.
2124000	2125000	The game.
2126000	2127000	So don't waste your money.
2127000	2128000	Don't waste your time.
2129000	2130000	I mean it's free.
2130000	2131000	I think it's free.
2132000	2136000	It's free to download but I'm sure there's plenty of energy refills.
2136000	2138000	Yeah it's boring as fuck.
2138000	2139000	Don't worry about it.
2140000	2141000	Alright.
2141000	2143000	Act F points out it's a Theatrhythm style.
2143000	2145000	I knew it did kind of have a familiar look to it.
2145000	2146000	So it's like the Theatrhythm style.
2146000	2148000	See Theatrhythm though is actually a good game.
2149000	2150000	This.
2150000	2151000	Boring.
2151000	2152000	Alright.
2152000	2153000	Fair enough.
2153000	2154000	Everybody's entitled to their opinion.
2154000	2156000	I haven't played it yet so I have none.
2156000	2158000	Loki how was your gaming week?
2159000	2162000	I played quite a bit in the last few weeks.
2163000	2164000	Let's see.
2164000	2165000	I played.
2165000	2170000	They had new DLC come out for Lego Avengers.
2170000	2173000	So I played all three DLC levels that they had.
2173000	2174000	They had like the.
2174000	2176000	I'm trying to think who it was here.
2176000	2179000	They had the Ant-Man stuff so that was kind of cool.
2179000	2180000	And then.
2182000	2183000	The Masters of Evil.
2184000	2186000	So they had their group with Baron Zemo.
2186000	2189000	And then classic like Captain Marvel.
2190000	2191000	And so I played through those.
2191000	2192000	And they were okay.
2192000	2193000	I don't know.
2193000	2194000	It's kind of.
2195000	2199000	They had a level with like you know trophies and stuff you could get but.
2199000	2203000	It was kind of odd though like I still didn't unlock the trophies even though I got everything.
2203000	2207000	I think you had to get everything and finish the level at the same time.
2207000	2211000	Cause I was like oh okay well I got everything I'm gonna quit the level cause you still get credit for it.
2211000	2212000	But you know.
2212000	2214000	I guess that was the issue there.
2215000	2217000	And then I played.
2217000	2219000	You know cause shame on me.
2219000	2220000	I played Amplitude.
2221000	2222000	There was.
2223000	2226000	Some issue with how it was on the.
2226000	2228000	Sony online store.
2228000	2232000	And I may have exploited that to get it for free so I did play it.
2232000	2233000	It's alright.
2233000	2234000	I don't know.
2235000	2237000	Probably would have been pissed off if I had actually paid for that.
2238000	2239000	But it's alright.
2239000	2241000	It's a decent music game.
2243000	2244000	Then.
2244000	2245000	Let's see what else did I buy.
2246000	2249000	I just recently picked up cause I had watched.
2249000	2252000	I've been looking at all the stuff that they have like their.
2253000	2256000	The Sony store stuff with the different games that they're releasing.
2256000	2259000	Still thinking about purchasing Day of the Tentacle cause that looks awesome.
2260000	2262000	It is awesome cause I've played it before but.
2263000	2265000	I was like eh I just really want to buy it again just to play through it again.
2266000	2267000	Maybe still will.
2267000	2270000	But I saw Enter the Gungeon on there and I was like okay well what the hell is this.
2270000	2271000	Something that.
2271000	2273000	It's kind of a funny name.
2273000	2274000	They've got a pun in the name.
2274000	2275000	So I checked out the trailer.
2275000	2277000	I was like eh this is alright.
2277000	2278000	You know kind of cool.
2278000	2281000	But I kept reading reviews on it and like everybody was really.
2281000	2282000	Liking it.
2282000	2285000	So I said okay fine I'll go ahead and pick it up and.
2285000	2286000	Download it.
2286000	2288000	So I downloaded it last night and.
2288000	2291000	Oh my god it's a fucking awesome game.
2291000	2293000	It's just this like rogue-lite.
2294000	2296000	You know kind of Binding of Isaac type of game.
2296000	2300000	It's basically bullet hell but you're kind of running around like Smash TV and stuff.
2301000	2304000	And it's got awesome music and the art style and it's like really.
2305000	2308000	It's like cutesy and like strange I guess.
2308000	2309000	I don't know like.
2309000	2310000	All the.
2310000	2312000	The whole game is basically gun themed.
2312000	2313000	Gun themed.
2313000	2317000	So like you know you're entering the Gungeon which is this giant bullet.
2317000	2320000	And all the enemies are bullets and they're shooting guns.
2320000	2323000	That are like associated with their bullets and stuff.
2323000	2324000	And just.
2324000	2325000	I don't know.
2325000	2326000	And the weapons are ridiculous.
2326000	2327000	What was the name of this again?
2327000	2328000	Enter the Gungeon.
2328000	2329000	Enter the Gungeon.
2329000	2330000	And.
2331000	2334000	It's just it's really fucking hard though.
2334000	2335000	Like because it's bullet hell.
2335000	2337000	I mean there's like bullets all over the goddamn screen.
2337000	2342000	And you know where it takes good timing to be able to do well in the game.
2342000	2344000	And I've only played it a little bit.
2344000	2347000	I got to play to see two of the bosses so far.
2347000	2351000	One was like this pigeon type character with this minigun.
2351000	2354000	And then the Bullet King.
2354000	2356000	Which was pretty cool.
2356000	2357000	Because I was showing my son.
2357000	2359000	I was trying to explain the game to him.
2359000	2360000	So I just showed him that.
2361000	2362000	And then.
2362000	2363000	What else?
2363000	2366000	I played actual Minecraft last night on the Playstation 4 because it's been a while.
2366000	2367000	Nice.
2367000	2368000	And my son's played it a little bit.
2368000	2371000	So I was like okay I want to check out and see what's different.
2371000	2372000	And I'm like holy crap.
2372000	2374000	There's a lot of shit that's different on this.
2374000	2376000	So I played a little bit of that.
2376000	2378000	And what else?
2380000	2384000	A little bit of Ingress but not really that much because I've been trying to cut back on that.
2384000	2387000	Just playing on my way to and from work.
2387000	2388000	And that's about it.
2391000	2392000	I think that's everything.
2392000	2393000	God I don't know.
2393000	2395000	I'm sure I've played Fallout 4 somewhere.
2396000	2397000	Yeah.
2397000	2398000	I think that's everything.
2399000	2400000	Alright.
2401000	2404000	If that's it for your gaming week I'll talk a little bit about mine.
2404000	2405000	Although honestly I pretty much.
2405000	2408000	I talked about all the big stuff I wanted to talk about already.
2408000	2410000	You know with Miitomo and all that other stuff.
2410000	2414000	But there is still one big game I played this week that I have to talk about here in my gaming week.
2414000	2415000	And that is.
2415000	2418000	Quantum Break came out on the Xbox One.
2418000	2419000	Finally right?
2419000	2424000	The successor in many ways to Alan Wake from Remedy came out on Xbox One this week.
2424000	2429000	And I was looking forward to the game even though admittedly I didn't really know a lot about it.
2429000	2432000	Because they didn't really tell us a lot about the game.
2432000	2435000	Except for some of the motion capture and all this stuff.
2435000	2442000	So I played through at least the first little chapter and I think I'm about halfway through the second.
2442000	2447000	I should be a lot further but it's just been such a busy weekend and everything else going on.
2447000	2450000	That's really all I've had time to play.
2450000	2451000	But I gotta say.
2451000	2453000	I think it's awesome.
2453000	2455000	I think Quantum Break is so cool.
2455000	2460000	It's basically in the story it has to do with time travel.
2460000	2465000	And you kind of get stuck in a time thing where you can now manipulate time.
2465000	2469000	I'm overly stupidly simplifying it for the sake of time.
2469000	2472000	But you actually can.
2472000	2475000	The game itself is kind of like a shooter in a way.
2475000	2477000	Because you know you're bang bang.
2477000	2479000	You aim and you fire.
2479000	2480000	It reminds me a little bit of Mass Effect.
2480000	2481000	Kind of in that regard.
2481000	2482000	Like the way it controls.
2482000	2490000	But you can use cool little time bendy things to either protect yourself like with a time shield.
2490000	2493000	You can do a force time bubble on the enemies.
2493000	2495000	So you can shoot them with a ton of bullets.
2495000	2498000	And then when the force time bubble wears off all the bullets go through at once.
2498000	2501000	So you hit them all at once. That's kind of fun.
2501000	2504000	And you do all these force dashes and all these things.
2504000	2508000	So you got all these weird powers that are just explained through the magic of time.
2508000	2513000	But then the game also has this element where, and I'm sure some of you guys have heard about this.
2513000	2518000	Where there's actually a TV show that occurs.
2518000	2524000	So once you beat the first chapter you have to make a tell tale style decision.
2524000	2527000	That's all I'll say is that you have to make a decision.
2527000	2529000	Do you want to do A or do you want to do B?
2529000	2532000	And it's a big decision that's going to impact the game.
2532000	2534000	And once you make the decision it shows you.
2534000	2539000	Here's all your friends that chose to do the same thing as you and you're in this percentage of the users or whatever.
2539000	2544000	But that decision is going to impact the TV show that you're going to see.
2544000	2551000	And then you watch like a 20 minute Netflix style show that ties into the game that you're playing.
2551000	2557000	It's just this is somebody else's perspective instead of the main characters that you're playing for most of the time.
2557000	2559000	The TV show is here's somebody else.
2559000	2563000	But then that big decision is not the only thing that plays into the TV show.
2563000	2566000	There's other elements that will change the TV show.
2566000	2574000	For example in the very first level and since the very first level I don't consider this a spoiler and it's not really a huge element of the story anyway.
2574000	2580000	I found like a formula on the wall that my character finished basically writing out.
2580000	2587000	And it gave the little icon in a butterfly effect for those of you that have played Until Dawn.
2587000	2591000	A butterfly effectish kind of way where it says that's going to come back later.
2591000	2594000	So I finished the formula and it's like that's going to be remembered.
2594000	2600000	And then when I was watching the TV show there's this conversation that's happening between two characters where they go.
2600000	2603000	Yeah I found out when I came into work this morning that somebody had finished the formula.
2603000	2605000	Was that you? No.
2605000	2611000	So they're actually talking about something that happened in the game but it's happening in this seamless TV show.
2611000	2613000	So I have to admit okay that's kind of rad.
2614000	2619000	I don't remember seeing things like that until like way back in the day when it was like CD-ROMs.
2619000	2624000	And the movie files from the CD-ROMs that would play would change maybe depending on what you did in the game.
2624000	2629000	But this uses, get this, streaming. That's how it does it.
2629000	2636000	Is it streaming it all from online so that way the branching is all seamless for those types of decisions.
2636000	2638000	It's streaming like Netflix would.
2638000	2644000	Disclaimer though, if you have a shitty connection you can download the entire set of the movie files.
2644000	2649000	You ready for this? 72 gigabytes if you want to download the movies.
2649000	2655000	72 gigabytes. Maybe it was more. 72's the number that jumps in my head was at least 70.
2655000	2661000	So you can download the movies if you're worried about the streaming thing or you're worried about the loss of quality or something.
2661000	2666000	But I don't know how you're going to download 70 gigs worth of show if you can't stream it.
2666000	2668000	So just something to consider.
2668000	2673000	That's going to turn some people off I think what I just said.
2673000	2678000	But if you're using your Xbox One for Netflix, you're fine.
2678000	2682000	And I think a lot of you are using your Xbox One or your PlayStation 4 for Netflix.
2682000	2686000	So what I just said shouldn't concern you because it's essentially doing the same thing.
2686000	2694000	But I really like how the one plays into the other and I just think the game itself is a lot of fun to play.
2694000	2699000	What's interesting is that I've been reading reviews on it online and I really shouldn't do that.
2699000	2703000	But I can't help it sometimes because I want to know if other people are as enthusiastic about the game as I am.
2703000	2707000	And it turns out, no. The game is actually getting mixed reviews.
2707000	2714000	And some people are saying that the shooter is an okay shooter and the movie segment is an okay movie.
2714000	2718000	Well let me tell you from my perspective, I don't play a lot of shooter games.
2719000	2721000	Admittedly, it's not usually my genre.
2721000	2726000	I think that actually plays in my favor on why I like Quantum Break more.
2726000	2731000	And yes, you can set the difficulty in Quantum Break. I'm playing on easy mode. No shame in that.
2731000	2736000	No shame in playing in Bobby Black Wolf mode. I'm still enjoying the story. That's what I'm there for.
2736000	2742000	And I have not been super challenged in the game.
2742000	2751000	I've come close, I've had scary moments, but I feel like using the powers and everything, I still feel like I'm not just pressing A to advance the story.
2751000	2754000	I am playing a game here, even on easy mode.
2754000	2758000	So I enjoy the shooter well enough and I like all those time-based elements.
2758000	2764000	And I think the show, I don't know if I get all the reads on the show being a bad show.
2764000	2767000	I think if you're into the story, I think the show is good.
2767000	2774000	Is it a little low budget? Yeah, but it's way more than what we've ever had for a video game that I can recall.
2774000	2778000	It's on par with a Netflix or Amazon series, in my opinion.
2778000	2782000	It's fine. The budget stuff doesn't really worry me so much.
2782000	2788000	I don't get the reads on the whole fact that the budget looks really, really low budget.
2788000	2792000	Because I'm like, do you play video games? Because a lot of times movies look low budget.
2792000	2795000	Is it at the level of SimCity Action News?
2796000	2800000	Nothing will ever be at the level of SimCity Action News, unfortunately.
2800000	2805000	For those that have ever played the SimCity CD-ROM game, that is the best movie acting.
2805000	2809000	No, nothing. You can't attain the unachievable, Loki. It's just not going to happen.
2809000	2811000	But it's pretty darn good. It's pretty darn good.
2811000	2816000	I would actually say the acting is a little bit better than it is in the SimCity CD-ROM game.
2816000	2817000	So there's that.
2819000	2823000	Alright. Go into a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2823000	2826000	Kaijuto says, this game sounds like it's a ripoff of Timeshift.
2826000	2829000	Just get Timeshift for super cheap and you'll see it's the better game.
2829000	2833000	I would actually say it's more of a ripoff of Alan Wake and Max Payne.
2833000	2837000	But they can do that. Because those were Remedy's other games.
2840000	2844000	I really feel like the TV show element, you saw some of that in Alan Wake.
2844000	2848000	But they really took that to the next level with Quantum Break.
2848000	2853000	So that's why I think in some ways this game really is a successor to Alan Wake.
2853000	2857000	And it's important because TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.
2857000	2861000	Yes. Which is what the Xbox One was all about originally.
2861000	2863000	Now I'm starting to see that vision.
2863000	2867000	I have to admit, I think it's a pretty cool thing to watch.
2867000	2872000	And I'm very curious what happens in the show if I picked the other option.
2872000	2875000	Because I'll tell you what, again, I don't want to spoil anything.
2875000	2883000	But it's very obvious if I had gone the other way, a character would not be alive if I'd gone the other way.
2883000	2886000	That character is in the TV show.
2886000	2889000	So, what would have been different?
2889000	2893000	So it makes me curious enough to kind of want to go back and play again.
2893000	2895000	So, alright.
2895000	2897000	Let's see.
2897000	2900000	Over at, oh and this is interesting.
2900000	2902000	Kaizhudo continues over at Live.Vognor.com.
2902000	2905000	No, I would never buy an Xbox One. I said, it sounds like.
2905000	2912000	I would actually say, Quantum Break is an Xbox One exclusive worthy of your attention.
2912000	2918000	If you're on the fence, like, what exclusives does Xbox have that I can't get on PlayStation 4?
2918000	2921000	I think Quantum Break is one you ought to consider.
2921000	2924000	It's not going to be for everybody. It's probably not a game for Kaizhudo.
2924000	2926000	The Windows 10 version, right?
2926000	2928000	Yeah, but we'll get into that later in the show.
2928000	2931000	Because the Windows 10 version, there might be a couple problems there.
2931000	2938000	But, as far as the Xbox One is, between Rise of the Tomb Raider, Halo 5, if you're into that.
2938000	2942000	I really think Quantum Break is an exclusive that you need to consider.
2942000	2949000	Like, Quantum Break is a much bigger deal than Knack on the PlayStation 4.
2949000	2954000	And look, I love my PlayStation 4 and they've got a ton of great games over there.
2954000	2956000	But I'm just saying, some exclusives are no big deal.
2957000	2961000	Rise on the Xbox One, also not really something to scream and shout about, right?
2961000	2963000	To be fair, I'll name one of those.
2963000	2966000	Quantum Break is one worthy of your attention.
2966000	2969000	On Xbox One, I'm just saying. I believe it.
2969000	2972000	Alright, anyhow.
2972000	2975000	I was going to mention real quick, one thing I forgot to mention in my gaming week.
2975000	2976000	What was that?
2976000	2983000	So, PlayStation 3.5 came out, which means that you can stream to your PC.
2983000	2984000	Yeah.
2985000	2990000	I was super excited about that, because I was like, I'm all sweet, I'm going to stream to my laptop, it's going to be awesome.
2990000	2993000	It fucking sucks ass!
2993000	2994000	Does it really?
2994000	2998000	To be honest, though, it's probably not the PlayStation's fault, it's my fucking laptop's fault.
2998000	3000000	But it does not fucking work at all.
3000000	3001000	So you have to have a-
3001000	3002000	It is laggy as shit.
3002000	3004000	I don't have a wired connection on my PlayStation.
3004000	3007000	Oh, you're even- oh, that was the next thing I was going to ask. Are you running wired?
3007000	3012000	I mean, my laptop's not wired, so I guess there could be bottleneck there, but it was-
3012000	3015000	Yeah, especially if your laptop is not beefy enough, that's probably the bottom line.
3015000	3021000	I mean, I may try it again to wire it, because my router is just across the room.
3021000	3025000	I could do that, but I don't feel like I should need to.
3025000	3028000	Well, with something that intensive, wired is always going to be better.
3028000	3033000	But like, I don't know, I thought it would work just fine, because I thought I did that before the Vita, and it worked fine.
3033000	3035000	Maybe I was doing PlayStation 3, I don't know.
3035000	3038000	But yeah, it didn't work for me. I was disappointed.
3038000	3042000	I have not done- admittedly, I have not done that PlayStation 4 streaming thing yet.
3042000	3046000	I was going to try it, but honestly, I've just been super into Quantum Break.
3046000	3051000	When I do have time to sit on the couch and play a game, I want to play Quantum Break until I finish it, because I'm into the story.
3051000	3054000	But I'm curious about the whole PlayStation 4 streaming thing.
3054000	3060000	But I've done the Xbox One streaming thing to Windows 10, and I thought that worked really well.
3061000	3068000	I was playing, of all things, Dungeon Siege 3 a few weeks ago.
3068000	3073000	Because that was like the games for gold thing on 360 backwards compatibility.
3073000	3078000	So I was playing that on my computer, because I wanted to chat with Alan or something, so I didn't want to be on the couch.
3078000	3081000	So I was playing over the stream, and it was great.
3081000	3086000	Yeah, I'd be totally down with that, because I had a lot of games on Xbox 360.
3086000	3092000	I'd love to have them backwards compatible, but I don't have an Xbox One.
3092000	3096000	Apparently not a laptop strong enough to stream at, I guess.
3096000	3100000	Alright. Well anyway, we've got to move on and get into some news.
3100000	3103000	Some housekeeping tonight. I think I've pretty much already thrown everything out there.
3103000	3105000	I'll just reiterate. Please follow us on Twitter.
3105000	3109000	Twitter.com slash orange lounge- excuse me, Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
3109000	3112000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
3112000	3117000	And yes, Google Plus as well. Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
3117000	3121000	We need to get into some news, however. It's that time, so let's do it.
3121000	3126000	Getting into this week in news, because we missed a busy week last week, I'll tell you that much.
3126000	3130000	And then there's more going on this week, so we're going to try to at least cover what happened this week. Loki.
3130000	3138000	I do apologize in advance. I have some chest cold thing that is really making me very- it's difficult to breathe and not cough.
3138000	3141000	That's okay, these things happen. Oh, I should say this.
3141000	3146000	You remember everybody was saying a couple weeks ago that one of the- well, actually, you weren't here.
3146000	3148000	You've been gone for like a month, Loki.
3148000	3150000	Yeah, unfortunately. I had to put a door in last week.
3150000	3151000	Welcome back!
3151000	3153000	And then at Easter, and like-
3153000	3159000	Okay, so during the show last week, my mic was cutting out bad. Like, it was shorting, basically, the whole thing.
3159000	3163000	So, some people were like noticeably saying like, Rob, that mic is fucked.
3163000	3167000	So, I will say this. Hopefully, you all notice, I have a new microphone.
3167000	3169000	I did get a brand new microphone.
3169000	3172000	The guest mic has been replaced as well, because we have four mics in the studio.
3172000	3175000	Dark Soccer and Loki were fine, so I didn't replace theirs.
3175000	3180000	Plus, I felt a little better buying two at a time, as opposed to four.
3180000	3182000	So, I'll replace those two next.
3182000	3184000	But yeah, I am on a new microphone.
3184000	3193000	We actually used them for the first time yesterday, which was a really kind of crazy thing to do, because what if it was crappy?
3193000	3198000	But I just- I had the old mics just in case, but yeah, it ended up working out great.
3198000	3203000	So yeah, I'm on a new mic tonight, and hopefully sound better than I did a couple weeks ago.
3203000	3206000	So anyway, now we can get into some news. Loki.
3206000	3209000	Alright, so let's talk about rumors!
3209000	3213000	Everybody likes rumors. Well, this is apparently rumor regarding the new Zelda game.
3213000	3220000	Guess what? I know this is going to be shocking to you, but it's rumored to be coming out on the Wii U and NX.
3220000	3227000	Really? Because I didn't totally see this coming out on the NX, because it's been pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.
3227000	3236000	But this is- I guess the source of this is from Emily Rogers, who leaked I guess the existence of a new Paper Mario game on Wii U before they announced Color Splash.
3236000	3240000	And some of the things that go along with that.
3240000	3248000	Apparently not only is it going to be on both systems, but you may have the choice to play as either a male or female character in the game.
3248000	3252000	And that they're going to have voice acting for the other characters in the game as well.
3252000	3256000	Except for Link, who I guess is not going to talk.
3256000	3262000	So, neat I guess? I don't know, most modern games have that.
3262000	3271000	Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm sitting at this going, it's not a big deal, but some people on the internet, being the internet, want to make it a big deal.
3271000	3282000	But when I say it's not a big deal, I completely understand if you are the girl who wants to see more representation of yourself in games, and you want to be a female Link.
3282000	3291000	I'm not saying it's not a big deal there, I'm just saying that this option, this is Mass Effect to me, it's not a big deal.
3291000	3307000	And in fact, considering how well the internet responded to Linkle, if I'm the guy designing- I'm not saying that female Link is going to be Linkle, but if I'm the person designing the Zelda and going, wow, everybody loves Linkle.
3307000	3316000	Let's be honest, though, about Linkle, okay? I thought the character looked cool, but the way that she's treated in the game, it's ridiculous. She's a goddamn idiot.
3316000	3330000	I mean, seriously, the character's thing is she has a map and a giant compass, and her victory thing is that she fucking doesn't know her way around. She's getting lost all the time.
3330000	3333000	And she's like a bumbling buffoon.
3333000	3335000	Yeah, but I know men and women that get lost all the time.
3335000	3343000	I understand that, but like, you don't see the male Link, you know, just, I'm fucking lost. It's just like, ah, it's a stupid girl, ha!
3343000	3346000	So she has ditzy traits that male Link doesn't have in his world.
3346000	3356000	Yeah, I mean, she has badass crossbows too, but you know, it's just, it's not the same. Whatever, I mean, that's fine, but it's just, I think it's stupid.
3357000	3364000	I mean, I think Linkle, the way they portrayed her, is stupid. She could be badass, that's cool. Why can't she be badass? Link is badass.
3364000	3367000	When you see the pictures of Linkle with the crossbows, I'm like, okay, I'm here for that.
3367000	3374000	Yeah, exactly, I'm down, that's cool. But like, it's like, why put that last part in?
3374000	3380000	It's not, haha, she's bad at navigation? I mean, I don't get it.
3381000	3391000	Dark Sakura, as a, you know, person that's been following video games for a long time, from the original Legend of Zelda, and our female on the panel, I have to ask you what you think about this whole addition.
3391000	3393000	I'm the token girl.
3393000	3398000	I don't want to say token girl, but you are the girl on our panel, so yes, I need to ask your opinion.
3398000	3412000	I, I'm happy with the option to play a female character. I just wish that they would have been, yeah, a complete swap, the way that Fem Shop was, and then again, she was also designed first.
3412000	3426000	But, I would rather not have them be two entirely different people, or, I really don't like the, oh, the girl is lost and needs help trope, I hate that.
3427000	3429000	It should just be...
3429000	3438000	But we should be clear, just to make sure it's clear, with Zelda NX, this is all rumors anyway, and we don't know the portrayal is going to be the same as it was in Hyrule Warriors, so...
3438000	3447000	But I certainly would like to see a capable, if it's going to happen, I would like to see a capable gender swap.
3447000	3451000	Or just the same thing with lady acting.
3451000	3455000	I know Nintendo's will down this, because that means they're going to make one more amiibo for this shit.
3455000	3459000	Oh, that's what it's really about, Lo-fi.
3459000	3467000	This has nothing to do with representation, this is about, hey, how could we sell a female Link figure and a male Link, this is an extra amiibo figure for yourself.
3467000	3471000	What about Link, I mean, what about the color of his skin, I mean, you can have multiple colored Links as well.
3471000	3472000	There you go.
3472000	3475000	I mean, there is a potential for like 32 amiibos or something for this.
3475000	3489000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, well we don't know yet how they'll handle her if she's in Zelda U, so who knows, maybe she'll be on par with Link.
3489000	3499000	And why can't we just have the gender of Link be determined, can I have Ganondorf be a different gender, can I have Ganondorf be a sexy woman, is that an option on there?
3499000	3502000	I mean, does he have to be some evil dark elf troll thing?
3502000	3512000	Who knows, who knows. I believe, do any other genders, like when you pick a femshep versus an mshep, do any other genders of characters change in Mass Effect? I don't think so.
3512000	3513000	No.
3513000	3515000	No, but your love options change.
3515000	3516000	Yeah.
3516000	3517000	Which is a whole other issue, but anyway.
3517000	3529000	Well, there's some, I'm trying to find the artwork, someone did a very good gender swap Link, not a Linkle, but a gender swap Link, and I'm hoping to find that picture, so I'm going to put it in the chatroom.
3529000	3540000	Let's see, AkumaJP in chat says, bingo, at Loki, regarding the amiibo thing, and actf says, if they haven't announced a Linkle amiibo, I don't think they'll do it now.
3540000	3546000	Oh, come on, please, we're not going to do it now. No, they will.
3546000	3553000	Maybe not for Hyrule Warriors, but for wherever Linkle's next appearance is, perhaps.
3554000	3561000	Alright. Oh, you're pasting a picture in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com? Sounds good.
3561000	3563000	Alright, it's pasted.
3563000	3571000	Alright, well let's move on. Let's talk about another game that a lot of people want to know more about, and that is Final Fantasy VII, the remake.
3571000	3578000	And do you remember the controversy a few months ago when it was revealed that Final Fantasy VII's remake is going to be episodic?
3578000	3586000	And everybody was like, fuck that shit, because I'm not paying one disc at a time and all this other stuff, right? People were not very happy about that.
3586000	3594000	But there was some other folks that were thinking, well, wait a minute, with as much as they're going to have to redo in Final Fantasy VII,
3594000	3602000	there's probably going to be a lot more than there was in the PlayStation version versus what will be in the PlayStation 4 version.
3602000	3614000	And it turns out that is what essentially is being confirmed this week, is that Final Fantasy VII's remake, the episodic strategy, it's not going to necessarily be a one-to-one ratio.
3614000	3624000	In the new issue of Game Informer, each episode is a full-scale game on par with installments of the Final Fantasy XIII sub-series.
3625000	3634000	Interesting comparison there, and also a controversial one in some ways, because some would say that the Final Fantasy XIII series was unnecessary.
3634000	3643000	Some would say I would not be one of those people, although I would say XIII-2 was better than Lightning Returns, but that's, you know, whatever.
3643000	3653000	But anyway, so yeah, that's what they're going for, is that yes, it's episodic, but we're talking about like three full games, like Final Fantasy XIII was three full games.
3653000	3661000	So again, that and the latest Game Informer magazine, who I guess have talked to the folks behind it and have played a little more than the rest of us have there.
3661000	3673000	So I am still very curious to see what this looks like. I, come on, I practically, I don't want to say I grew up with this game, but this game like defined like my college years.
3673000	3682000	I'm going to buy this game pretty much no matter what. So, and maybe that just makes me the sucker, but I have a pretty good feeling that it'll be worth it.
3682000	3692000	It'll be worth it. Yeah, I think it'll be worth it. We'll give it a chance. We'll see how episode one plays out, and if it ends up being like Sonic 4 episode one, then maybe I just won't get the others.
3692000	3695000	But I have a pretty good feeling it'll be fine.
3695000	3700000	I think you go and play the whole Advent Children stuff too. I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.
3700000	3704000	Yeah. Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3704000	3727000	Well, I just had to laugh at this because someone had actually linked me the ad before, but Drumpf, because I refuse to say the idiot's name, the Republican presidential candidate, did, he tweeted a video that has footage and audio of him in the Mass Effect 2 trailer.
3727000	3743000	Now, his campaign didn't have anything to do with actually making the trailer, but I guess one of his fans did, but EA didn't like it and issued a DMCA takedown.
3743000	3761000	It's funny because some people think that this is an issue of fair use. However, EA's whole thing is that, and I'm going to read the quote,
3761000	3779000	So I wonder if this is something that's going to be listed as a true fan mashup or a parody, or if it's something that truly does negatively affect the image of the company.
3779000	3788000	I mean, if that jerk face was associated with anything I did, I wouldn't want his name on it.
3788000	3799000	You know what this really reminds me of, and regardless of how you feel about him, this just reminds me, and you see this all the time, this reminds me of the musicians where the politicians will use their song.
3799000	3808000	Like, didn't that actually happen with that same candidate? And I think it was Twisted Sister, of all people, who, man, Twisted Sister was awesome.
3808000	3812000	Born in the USA and Reagan was using it? And told him not to?
3812000	3818000	We're not gonna take it, right? And then Twisted Sister was like, please stop, or I'm going to sue you.
3818000	3828000	So really, it's like the same thing, except now instead of music, it's a video game, which I think says a lot about how far games have come.
3828000	3831000	Don't make me feel dirty playing Mass Effect 2.
3832000	3839000	Well, you know, you can't, you know what, some people are gonna make pornography out of Mass Effect 2, and, well, then again.
3839000	3840000	I'd watch that.
3843000	3850000	But maybe it's not the characters you want shipped, Dark Sakura. Maybe it's like, maybe Ashley gets with Garrus.
3850000	3851000	No.
3851000	3852000	Are you gonna let that happen, Dark Sakura?
3852000	3854000	It should be Garrus the Ride.
3856000	3857000	That's what they should call it.
3857000	3861000	Speaking of Garrus the Ride, no really, don't turn off, don't tune out, don't tune out.
3861000	3862000	Right.
3862000	3865000	That ride at Great America opens, like, in the next couple months.
3865000	3867000	I know, I need to go.
3867000	3871000	I can't believe I'm sitting here on the show saying this. We need to go to Great America.
3871000	3884000	I know, right? Well, you know, it's the same room that the seventh portal was in, which was literally the last time I'd been to Great America, was when we saw Margaret Cho, and I got flirted with by a cute lesbian in the bathroom.
3885000	3889000	Oh my god, how many, that was pre-OLR. That was a long time ago.
3889000	3895000	And I played Planet Harriers. And you saw, you remember how excited I was to find a Planet Harriers?
3895000	3896000	Yes.
3896000	3897000	And I don't even think it's there anymore, which is sad.
3897000	3904000	I remember that day very well. I was with one of my exes, the same person I was with when OLR first started, which was a long time ago.
3904000	3906000	And I wanna say that, I know Jessica was there.
3906000	3913000	And I remember that was the day when you said, you know, I love Dan, and I don't ever wanna, you know, be apart from Dan.
3913000	3917000	But if Dan and I do ever break up, I'm gonna marry Margaret Cho.
3917000	3920000	Yeah, I remember that.
3920000	3923000	That was like the day you made that decision.
3923000	3924000	That was the day.
3924000	3925000	You put a ring on it that day.
3925000	3926000	I put a ring on it.
3926000	3927000	A backup ring.
3927000	3929000	That Margaret Cho would be my backup wife.
3933000	3935000	Anyway, good times, good times.
3935000	3938000	I don't know, though. I've got, like, new backup wives.
3938000	3942000	Kaijito in chat says, is Mass Effect still a thing?
3942000	3948000	The week we were off, actually, some gameplay from Andromeda leaked.
3948000	3952000	Just a little bit, and I think it was like a pre-alpha build, so you probably shouldn't read too much into it.
3952000	3957000	But I think you'll hear a lot more about Andromeda out of E3 this year.
3957000	3963000	And I fully expect that it's gonna be one of the games that EA is pushing at their little satellite show.
3963000	3969000	Since I can't say that they're pushing at E3, because they're not there, but that EA is gonna push at their satellite show.
3969000	3975000	So, yes, I think there is still, I mean, who's to say if the new Mass Effect is gonna be any good or not?
3975000	3979000	But we're hoping. Here's hoping. Fingers crossed. Toes crossed.
3979000	3981000	All right.
3981000	3983000	SSJ-100 Matt in chat.
3983000	3987000	But would Margaret Cho pull over for coffee in our saga?
3987000	3990000	It doesn't matter, because I have Dan, and Dan is wonderful.
3990000	3992000	And Dan does pull over for coffee.
3992000	3994000	Dan does pull over for coffee.
3994000	3996000	After a lot of reminders.
3996000	3998000	Dan!
3998000	4000000	Dan, I need caffeine!
4000000	4002000	Dan!
4002000	4004000	I was so angry that day.
4004000	4006000	That day?
4006000	4008000	Oh, girl. Okay.
4008000	4010000	So you know how some people get hangry?
4010000	4012000	Hangry? Oh, that's me.
4012000	4014000	I get hangry.
4014000	4016000	I get caffeine angry.
4016000	4020000	Ask Allen. Ask Allen what happens if I don't go, or if I go without eating for like six hours.
4020000	4022000	I get caffeine angry.
4022000	4024000	Caffeine angry.
4024000	4026000	Hangry. I gotta use that more often.
4026000	4028000	I'm hangry!
4028000	4030000	Oh, goodness.
4030000	4032000	Let's see.
4032000	4034000	In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
4034000	4038000	Bonds006 says, Rob, don't read too much into it.
4038000	4042000	Hello, Rob. We gamers read far into anything game-related.
4042000	4044000	And from Lord Gabe.
4044000	4046000	Oh, that is true.
4046000	4048000	You know, today is
4048000	4050000	April 10th.
4050000	4052000	And April is the fourth month.
4052000	4054000	And if you take four and you subtract one and then you subtract zero,
4054000	4056000	you get three. Half-Life 3 confirmed.
4058000	4060000	Hmm?
4060000	4062000	Yeah, we definitely need to go to our next story.
4062000	4064000	Loki.
4064000	4066000	So, there's a brand new game being made by the
4066000	4068000	creators of Rust.
4068000	4070000	It looks very similar to Minecraft.
4070000	4072000	Like, a little too similar if you ask me.
4072000	4076000	But, it is a VR version of, like, a Minecraft type game.
4076000	4078000	Called Chunks.
4078000	4080000	And what's kind of cool about it, though,
4080000	4084000	is not only can you use, like, the Vive controllers sexually,
4084000	4086000	you know, build stuff in there,
4086000	4090000	but it has a roller coaster tool as well.
4090000	4094000	So you can actually, instead of just your typical mine carts and stuff like that,
4094000	4098000	you can pretty much just draw your own roller coaster.
4098000	4100000	Which is awesome.
4100000	4102000	Because we like, you know, roller coasters in VR.
4102000	4104000	Roller coasters in VR.
4106000	4108000	So, it's going to be coming out very soon.
4108000	4112000	I want to say on the 12th of April.
4112000	4114000	And they're going to be charging $19.99.
4114000	4118000	And it's going to be on early access for about two to four months.
4118000	4120000	Same $4.80.
4120000	4122000	Steam proper.
4122000	4124000	So the game is called Chunks?
4124000	4126000	Chunks.
4126000	4128000	I can't hope it has Chunk from the Goonies in it.
4128000	4130000	I'm afraid it does not.
4130000	4132000	No truffle shuffle?
4132000	4134000	No truffle shuffle.
4134000	4136000	Fuck this game. No, I'm just kidding.
4136000	4138000	It sounds awesome.
4138000	4140000	It looks pretty cool. I mean,
4140000	4142000	I'd pick it up if I had, you know,
4142000	4144000	a computer that could run VR in the Vive,
4144000	4146000	and all the things that would be essential.
4146000	4148000	Or if you actually had a Vive.
4148000	4151000	Because I don't know if you've been following Bobby Blackwolf on Twitter,
4151000	4154000	but apparently getting a Vive is a challenge in itself.
4154000	4157000	Or giving money to the Vive people is not a problem.
4157000	4160000	Getting that object to actually be delivered to your house
4160000	4162000	is apparently a bit of a challenge.
4162000	4164000	Well, I understand that. I mean, anything is a challenge with Valve.
4164000	4168000	I mean, how long we've been trying to get them to make Half-Life 3.
4168000	4170000	It's a challenge.
4170000	4175000	At least they're not shipping on, you know, Valve time.
4175000	4177000	Because you'd be fucked.
4177000	4180000	They've only sent out three Vives.
4180000	4182000	And you know what that means.
4183000	4187000	They're really far behind from their estimated delivery schedule.
4187000	4189000	Apparently. Apparently.
4189000	4191000	Well, let's talk more about Rust,
4191000	4194000	because Rust is another game from that same creator.
4194000	4197000	And I've got to admit, I've heard a little bit about this game,
4197000	4200000	but not a lot. But I know it's one of those open world survival games.
4200000	4202000	But I'm hearing that, like,
4202000	4204000	you get a lot of people that get really powerful,
4204000	4206000	and all they do is they pick on the lower people,
4206000	4208000	and it kind of takes some of the fun out of it,
4208000	4209000	is what I'm hearing about this game, Rust.
4209000	4211000	I don't know. I haven't played it myself.
4211000	4214000	That's just my perception based on other people I've talked to.
4214000	4216000	But I still think the concept sounds really interesting.
4216000	4218000	So I'm kind of wondering if you can have, like,
4218000	4221000	a more closed off world that's just you and your friends,
4221000	4223000	and you all agree to, like, not be dicks.
4223000	4226000	I don't know. If any of you guys have played Rust, you need to let me know.
4226000	4229000	But I thought this was very interesting about Rust,
4229000	4232000	is that earlier we had talked about Rust.
4232000	4234000	Actually, I don't know if we had talked about it here on the show.
4234000	4236000	But I know the news had come up previously that
4236000	4240000	the size of your penis in Rust
4240000	4242000	was directly tied to your Steam ID.
4242000	4249000	In other words, you had no control over the size of your penis in Rust.
4249000	4251000	I think it should be really connected to your Steam library
4251000	4253000	and the amount of games you have.
4253000	4256000	That's going to get people to buy more games.
4256000	4257000	I'm telling you.
4257000	4261000	A literal e-penis. A literal e-penis.
4263000	4265000	Well, but here's the thing now.
4265000	4269000	Here's the thing, is that although the talk was all about peni,
4269000	4273000	previously, here's the thing, now in the latest update,
4273000	4278000	Rust has also tied gender assignment to your Steam ID.
4278000	4281000	You will not have a choice if you are male or female.
4281000	4285000	And I am assuming, if you're going to ask that question about boobs,
4285000	4287000	because that's where you're going to go the minute you hear females,
4287000	4288000	right DarkSakura?
4288000	4290000	She's nodding.
4290000	4293000	That is probably also determined on your Steam ID.
4293000	4294000	I'm just going to take a lucky guess.
4294000	4297000	You probably do not get to really control any of those factors.
4297000	4301000	Well, I mean, what about the penis size on them too, though?
4301000	4303000	I don't know.
4303000	4308000	I have not played Rust myself to know how that all works yet.
4308000	4310000	But this is the interesting thing.
4310000	4315000	I read the letter from the developer about why they did things the way they did.
4315000	4320000	And it was very, very, like, I don't want to say it was shady,
4320000	4324000	because it definitely wasn't shady, but it was just very much like,
4324000	4329000	I don't give a flying fuck if you don't like this type of thing
4329000	4331000	in the way that it was described.
4331000	4332000	I kind of loved it.
4332000	4335000	I wholeheartedly agree with that opinion.
4335000	4340000	That really should be the developer's opinions.
4340000	4343000	Most developers out there should have that opinion.
4343000	4345000	Like, when people ask them to make changes to a game,
4345000	4348000	just like, I don't give a flying fuck what you want.
4348000	4349000	I made the game this way.
4349000	4352000	But conversely, if the developer wants to go,
4352000	4354000	I didn't think of that.
4354000	4358000	I have decided, based on that, I am making the decision to do this,
4358000	4360000	then that's fine.
4360000	4361000	You know what I mean?
4361000	4362000	But the buck stops with the developer.
4362000	4365000	Anyway, but here's the thing.
4365000	4367000	Gary Newman, the developer, actually said,
4367000	4370000	we're not taking the choice away from you.
4370000	4372000	You never had a choice.
4372000	4374000	A man's voice coming out of a woman's body is no more weird
4374000	4377000	than an eight-year-old boy's voice coming out of a man's body.
4377000	4379000	And then it goes on that the developer's blog,
4379000	4383000	oh, I've got to find, there was the best shade in here.
4383000	4385000	Where is it here in this dev blog?
4385000	4390000	Sorry, I know this is like terrible radio here.
4390000	4393000	Let's see.
4393000	4396000	We understand this is a sore subject for a lot of people.
4396000	4398000	We understand that you may now be a gender
4398000	4400000	that you don't identify with in real life.
4400000	4402000	We understand this causes you distress
4402000	4404000	and makes you not want to play the game anymore.
4404000	4407000	Technically, nothing has changed since half the population
4407000	4411000	was already living with those feelings.
4411000	4414000	And I was like, he does not give a fuck
4414000	4416000	if you do not like this change.
4416000	4418000	I got to give him props for that.
4418000	4421000	And that's a brilliant way to put it is that, you know what?
4421000	4423000	Other people, so it was great.
4423000	4425000	It was great.
4425000	4428000	And, you know, there's plenty of games that we play
4428000	4432000	where they happen to have a female lead like Tomb Raider
4432000	4437000	or Final Fantasy 13 or plenty of games out there,
4437000	4439000	but there could stand to be more, but there's plenty.
4439000	4443000	And it's not like, does that make you not want to play Tomb Raider?
4443000	4446000	Because you're missing out if you don't want to play Tomb Raider.
4446000	4448000	So anyway.
4448000	4451000	It's like all of those, you know, to quote Wil Wheaton,
4451000	4456000	the best word ever, whiny man babies who are complaining about Rogue One's lead.
4456000	4458000	Oh, yeah, that whole thing.
4458000	4461000	I still haven't watched that trailer. Am I on cool?
4461000	4463000	I haven't watched it either.
4463000	4466000	I'm interested in it though, but that's the best description,
4466000	4468000	whiny man babies.
4468000	4470000	Alright.
4470000	4472000	Moving on.
4472000	4474000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
4474000	4478000	Well, did you hear about the crap going on with Siege of Dragonspear?
4478000	4481000	Oh, that's the Baldur's Gate thing, isn't it?
4481000	4483000	Yeah, it is.
4483000	4485000	I have a Twitter account. Believe me, I've heard.
4485000	4490000	Well, to go ahead and tell, you know, explain to people what was happening,
4490000	4495000	there was a character named Mizana who is transgender.
4495000	4501000	And people were just flipping their shit about having a transgender character.
4501000	4505000	And then some people were going, oh, well, it has to do with the exposition in it
4505000	4509000	and that, you know, what NPC is going to give you their life story
4509000	4511000	and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4511000	4513000	Just going to throw that out there for these people.
4513000	4516000	There's probably a transgender character in your life somewhere
4516000	4518000	and you just don't know.
4518000	4520000	Just saying.
4520000	4524000	And I'll be honest, I think that it was a little bit shoving it in your face,
4524000	4526000	but I am happy there's a transgender character.
4526000	4528000	I mean, good.
4528000	4532000	It's more of one of those things that, and this is, I think, how it should be.
4532000	4539000	If there is a character that is not, you know, cisgendered hetero,
4539000	4541000	it should still be, so what?
4541000	4543000	That's what people are like.
4543000	4545000	It should be accepted as normal.
4545000	4547000	Go, huh, and moved on.
4547000	4549000	Because that is equality.
4549000	4556000	Giving, making a big deal out of it for the sake of making a big deal out of it,
4556000	4558000	that is not equality.
4558000	4559000	That's just how I feel about it.
4559000	4560000	However.
4560000	4564000	And just to be fair, for the trans people who happen to play this game,
4564000	4568000	that probably feels awesome to see, like, a representation in the game.
4568000	4569000	It does.
4569000	4570000	We heard a lot about that yesterday.
4570000	4575000	I know as a gay guy, when I see a gay romance plot in a video game like Mass Effect,
4575000	4581000	I'm like, I can't tell you how fucking happy it makes me that you and Kaiden,
4581000	4583000	as male Shep, can bang.
4583000	4587000	It makes me so happy, like, that that is an option that's available to you.
4587000	4589000	It's an option.
4589000	4591000	O-P-T-I-O-N. Option.
4591000	4597000	The thing about it is that, the way it was handled, it is, like, no big deal.
4597000	4599000	Because it's no big deal.
4599000	4602000	It's a choice that, I'm not even a choice.
4602000	4605000	It's, it's just how people are.
4605000	4606000	Yep.
4606000	4608000	And I like how that was handled.
4608000	4613000	You know, but I'm also like that with, you know, women's issues with,
4613000	4616000	I'll just won't go into that anymore.
4616000	4622000	So, but anyway, there was a lot of just online harassment going on toward Amber Scott,
4622000	4628000	who was the writer for, one of the writers for this series.
4628000	4630000	And, so Trent.
4630000	4640000	I'm sorry, I'm just going to take a lucky guess and assume that Amber is not being harassed because they didn't write enough on this character.
4640000	4645000	I'm going to guess that's probably not where the harassment is. Am I right?
4645000	4654000	Well, Trent Oster, the CEO of Beamdog, the developer, basically went and said that bullying isn't going to work.
4654000	4657000	And that being abusive isn't going to do anything.
4657000	4658000	And I'm going to read the quote.
4670000	4676000	So, and he said that, you know, he admits that the inclusion could be better.
4676000	4685000	In retrospect, we am reading the article, in retrospect, it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development.
4685000	4692000	This is a lesson that we will be carrying forward in our development as creators, and we will be improving this character in a future update.
4692000	4699000	Great. So, we talked about just a minute ago, developers should be able to do whatever they want.
4699000	4708000	And so, the dev says, okay, you know what, you gave us that feedback, and you know what, we're keeping the character the way that they are.
4708000	4714000	But, you know, maybe it was a little, like Darcy said, maybe it was a little too like blatant, so we need to develop it better.
4714000	4716000	So, we're going to give it a better story. Cool.
4716000	4728000	I'm just going to, I'm just super looking forward to the day where, and I'm not trying to make it sound like it's not an important issue.
4728000	4732000	But I'm looking forward to the day where it's not an important issue. Does that make sense?
4732000	4751000	When everything is taken in stride, when there is an acceptance to the point that it is just as accepted as a cisgendered hetero couple or person, that we have that same level of acceptance and equality for everybody.
4752000	4760000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I am anti-censorship. I demand you remove this offensive content from your game. Do not censor me.
4760000	4763000	It's a little parody there. Alright.
4763000	4765000	And I hope the way that I said that makes sense.
4765000	4775000	It does. It does. Anyway, let's move on. However, there's much more to talk about. In fact, we got to talk about what is actually going to be on the shelves in the gaming stores near you this week.
4775000	4777000	So, let's check out release dates, starting with Loki.
4777000	4781000	Well, on PlayStation 4, we have Ratchet and Clank. So, that's going to be coming out.
4781000	4787000	Dark Souls 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as PC.
4787000	4793000	And last but not least, Bravely Second and Lair on 3DS.
4793000	4797000	I have a feeling that's the one that a lot of people I know are going to be getting.
4797000	4801000	I still haven't played the demo for Bravely Second. I need to get on that.
4802000	4809000	So, alright. If that's it, let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out this week in Japan.
4809000	4813000	In Japan, on the 14th, we have Republique on the PlayStation 4.
4813000	4816000	Skullgirls Second Encore also makes its way to the PlayStation 4.
4816000	4823000	And Divinity Original Sin, excuse me, Enhanced Edition also on the PlayStation 4.
4823000	4830000	On the Wii U, nothing because Star Fox Zero isn't until the 21st, but at least you have that to look forward to.
4831000	4835000	On the Vita in the meantime, Skullgirls Second Encore is really the only release on the Vita this week.
4835000	4837000	It's a slower week on the Vita.
4837000	4842000	But on the 3DS, nothing. I'm kind of surprised to see that. There's nothing on the 3DS.
4842000	4848000	Terraria is the next release on the 3DS in Japan, and that is not until the 21st.
4848000	4852000	So, not as busy of a week in Japan, it appears.
4852000	4854000	Dark Sakura, how about Europe?
4854000	4865000	Very few things. We just have Dark Souls 3 on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and that's really about it until the following week.
4865000	4871000	Alright. We have just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4871000	4872000	But first, Loki.
4873000	4876000	Alright, so this is kind of disappointing.
4876000	4887000	The Studio Gaijin Games, which is, I guess, choice provisions in North America, has closed its San Francisco office.
4887000	4900000	Over the past few years, the game industry has changed so dramatically that a mid-sized studio operating as we have for the past several years just simply can't continue the same way.
4901000	4911000	And so, you know, they've unfortunately had to close their office. I didn't really see how many people were affected by that, but that still sucks.
4912000	4917000	Yeah, I didn't see the number of people either, and that sucks because that's a fun series of games.
4917000	4922000	But I guess things have kind of slowed down. Like, I don't know, what was the last bit game they put out?
4922000	4925000	I know there was Bit.Trip Runner 2, which was on, like, every platform.
4925000	4934000	And then they had that collection on PlayStation 4, because I know that was a big thing that came out of the PlayStation Expo that they had at the end of last year.
4934000	4945000	Well, their latest project was a game called Tharsis, and I guess it had some issues with that game, although they're saying that's not why the studio closed.
4946000	4955000	That's too bad. We never like to hear about layoffs in the industry, but hopefully the folks affected will be able to find work somewhere else relatively quickly.
4955000	4964000	Let's talk about another game. Oh, this is a game that's, like, on my Steam link thing, like, ready to play, and I really want to check this out, because so many people have told me I need to play Life is Strange.
4964000	4972000	And I really do want to get around to that, just, you know, time. But the folks that have played Life is Strange, there's a lot of hardcore fans.
4972000	4981000	In fact, some fans are going so far as to demand a sequel. Oh, by the way, they're not just demanding a sequel. Some fans went and made a Kickstarter for it.
4981000	4992000	That's right, there's a Life is Strange 2 Kickstarter, or was, I'll get to that in a minute. There was a Life is Strange 2 Kickstarter out there with the aim to raise $20,000.
4993000	5004000	This is, I guess, in an attempt to get the developer to notice that the fans are eager for the sequel, and they want to give the studio the funds that are needed for the project.
5004000	5018000	So, interesting, but it didn't last very long. The Kickstarter was shut down within minutes. No hours, but still, it was, like, not even a day, and the Kickstarter was taken down.
5018000	5029000	And you can probably imagine why. You can't really raise money for a game that's not yours, but regardless, it sounds like a lot of people want that Life is Strange sequel to happen.
5030000	5036000	Alright, and DungeonBuster in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, Life is Strange is so good!
5036000	5051000	AkumaJP, trying to explain why there's not a busy release schedule in Japan this week, saying everybody is still busy with Yokai Watch, oh, I forgot that came out in Japan, and DQM.
5051000	5057000	So, there you go. Meanwhile, we gotta get busy with a classic video game, Dark Sakura.
5057000	5058000	Going old school.
5058000	5066000	Alright, we're gonna go old school. We're gonna step into the gaming vault, where Dark Sakura finds the game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this out this week.
5066000	5079000	Between your indie games and your randomly generated penis sizes, you need to check this out. This was back in the day when you didn't have any of that online garbage and Kickstarter.
5079000	5082000	This is a classic. What is the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura?
5083000	5095000	Fantasy Zone The Maze. In Japan, it was just known as Oppa Oppa, which is, of course, the main ship character with cute feet and wings from the Fantasy Zone series.
5096000	5112000	It was originally an arcade game, and made it onto the Sega Master System as a home console release. Some people like to call it Fantasy Zone 3, but it really is kind of its own different game.
5112000	5120000	While the other Fantasy Zone games are called, quote, cute-em-ups, Fantasy Zone The Maze is a maze puzzler.
5120000	5130000	So, basically, it's kind of Pac-Man-like, but you collect coins as you go, and you spend them on weapons in different places in the stage.
5130000	5139000	And then you have to shoot down enemies. And the dot's going to turn red over time, and when it turns red, an enemy will spawn.
5140000	5145000	The only way you stop it is by passing through the dot, and then when you do, the process starts over.
5145000	5150000	And when you finish the stage, you get a certain amount of points at the end, depending on how long it took to complete the level.
5150000	5154000	There are also bonus stages where you collect coins in a limited time.
5154000	5161000	So you play as, um, two ships. Player 1 is the Oppa Oppa, and Player 2 is the Oppa Oppa.
5161000	5163000	So, um...
5163000	5166000	But Player 3 is the Oompa Loompa.
5166000	5167000	No.
5167000	5176000	The Sega Master System port and the original arcade version were in the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection for PS2.
5176000	5185000	Um, there's not really much else to say about that one. It's cute, it's novel, and it's Fantasy Zone, which means that makes it automatically a winner to me.
5185000	5189000	That's it. It came out in 1987. You're welcome.
5191000	5193000	So, that's it.
5193000	5201000	There it is. Fantasy Zone. The maze. It's Pac-Man-esque, but that would be way oversimplifying it. There's obviously more going on here.
5201000	5202000	Oppa Oppa.
5202000	5210000	And, uh, actually in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says, I recognize this song. It's on Taiko no Tatujin Vita!
5210000	5212000	Um, also, wasn't that just kind of a remix?
5212000	5215000	Well, it's just the remix of the Oppa Oppa music.
5215000	5216000	Yeah, which is...
5216000	5222000	Ah, guys, yeah. The main theme, right?
5222000	5223000	Yep.
5223000	5224000	A little remix there.
5224000	5231000	Uh, alright, so, uh, we're gonna take a quick break, but when we come back, we've got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news tonight.
5231000	5237000	Uh, some news on a Mega Man cartoon. One of Dark Soccer's favorite websites closing their doors. That's kind of sad, so we'll talk about that in the next segment.
5237000	5238000	I am pissed.
5238000	5247000	And then we're gonna talk about, uh, your calls as well. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.
5247000	5252000	Uh, we're gonna take a quick break. We'll be right back after this with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.
5259000	5267000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio. Live toni- Excuse me. Boy, coughs suck when you're doing live radio. Sorry about that.
5267000	5276000	Uh, we are live tonight with episode number 637 of our show for this April the 10th of 2016. Our show already in progress.
5276000	5283000	Back after the awesome Sack Indie Arcade event yesterday. Looking forward to hopefully attending more events, um, throughout the year.
5283000	5288000	Uh, I can mention that, uh, Dark Soccer and I, at least, we will certainly be back at GamerX this year.
5288000	5292000	Um, that has all been filed away and taken care of, so at least there's that.
5292000	5299000	Um, I'm- I know Bobby Blackwolf, myself, and I'm sure plenty of other people from VOG Network. I just don't know all who yet.
5299000	5304000	We'll also be in attendance at DragonCon, for those of you in the Atlanta area or really anywhere in the south.
5304000	5309000	Uh, cause everybody converges on Atlanta, uh, over Labor Day weekends, there's that as well.
5309000	5314000	Hopefully some more, uh, cons and things of that nature as well, um, to look forward.
5314000	5319000	I know there's one- another one that I'm gonna try and work on, uh, so we'll talk hopefully about that in the future.
5319000	5326000	But anyway, for now, we want to get back into some gaming news. We're gonna do some rapid fire news, starting with Loki.
5326000	5338000	Alright, so this is kind of a cool story, um, apparently this guy, uh, Peter Bryan reached out to Sony because he had problems with his DualShock 4 due to, um, his illness.
5338000	5344000	He has cerebral palsy, and because of that he had some issues when he would hit the touchpad, um, with his hand.
5344000	5355000	It's very sensitive, it would pause the game. So, Sony actually, um, created a custom controller that had, like, some tweaks to it.
5355000	5361000	Including dis- uh, dislabeling the touchpad and adding a new button to act as a touchpad.
5361000	5369000	I think that's pretty awesome that they went that far to take care of him. So, bravo Sony.
5369000	5383000	Um, if you actually played some of the Minecraft story mode, um, you'll be happy to know that the skins from the characters from that series, uh, from Telltale are actually available for free, temporarily.
5383000	5392000	So if you have the Pocket Edition of Minecraft, uh, for iOS or Google Play, or Windows Phone, or the Windows 10 Beta for those.
5392000	5402000	Or the Console Editions for Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, it is free for the first week. After that it's $3.
5402000	5409000	I did not see Wii U on there, so I'm not sure why they don't get the free version of that, so, that's kind of lame.
5409000	5416000	Because that's what my son plays it on. But hey, I'll download it for free. Because it's free. I like free.
5416000	5428000	Finally, uh, Bethesda, they have some more, um, details on their E3 2016 showcase. It's going to be on June 12th.
5428000	5440000	And on top of that they're going to have some, uh, extra things that are going to be part of that. Including a band that will be taking the stage at 9.
5440000	5453000	And then they're also going to have, uh, some other, some announcements and they're going to be showing, you know, um, some more stuff for Fallout 4 and, I don't know.
5453000	5463000	But, uh, yeah. And then I guess they're saying that the stream will be starting at 6.15 Pacific Time.
5463000	5476000	So much for OLR. Thanks Bethesda. Appreciate that. It's alright. E3 week always tends to ruin everything.
5476000	5485000	But we'll, we'll figure something out. I have some clever ideas for how we might accommodate this unfortunate situation. So stay tuned. That's all I have to say.
5485000	5495000	I'm just saying, I mean, I'm actually pretty excited because this week also, one of the things I forgot to mention, is this week they also do have the, um, the next piece of DLC that's coming out for Fallout 4.
5495000	5505000	And I'm pretty excited about that because the last piece wasn't that bad. This one you can add more stuff for, um, you know, building your settlements and everything. You can create traps.
5505000	5512000	You know that's all Alan, like, plays these days, right? He's played so much. I think he finally beat it, but he said there's still a bunch of side stuff he has to do.
5512000	5521000	Oh god, yeah. Because it's, you know, like Skyrim. I mean, I've been playing more of the story, you know, actual storyline in the game because I was doing all the side stuff.
5521000	5531000	I just kind of want to finish it. And I was going to start a new gameplay, or playthrough, but they've gotten rid of all my exploits and I'm not too happy about that.
5531000	5546000	Maybe when the mods come out and they can cheat again. Because that's half the fun. I mean, you spend all this time building yourself up, you know, I don't want to have to play through the whole thing again, grind for all that stuff. You know, that's not fun.
5546000	5558000	Well, let's move on and talk about Quantum Break on PC. You know, when I was doing my review earlier, I was talking about Quantum Break on the Xbox One, but I made an illusion of the fact that, you know, because some people said,
5558000	5572000	Well, Rob, when you say it's an exclusive, it's also on the PC. And I said, yeah, well, because there's some news this week that the Windows 10 version, it's a little rough. Apparently it has some frame rate issues. There's no quit game button.
5572000	5574000	That's ridiculous.
5574000	5581000	You know what it reminds me of? Do you remember when Final Fantasy 13 first came out for the PC? This really reminds me of a lot of the same complaints.
5581000	5587000	No, it's the fact that it doesn't have a quit button. Is that because, like, Windows 10 apps, you kind of drag and dump to the bottom of the screen?
5587000	5594000	I have no idea why it does not have a quit game button. But, yeah, apparently Nvidia hardware will also crash the game often.
5594000	5604000	The game will not run 60 frames a second on a 60 hertz monitor, even using an Nvidia Titan X. A frame rate matching the refresh rate on a user's monitor isn't possible.
5604000	5613000	Yeah, so, you might want to think about that before getting Quantum Break. This is probably just part of the growing pains with DirectX 12 API.
5613000	5620000	A lot of people also blaming with the Universal Windows platform, saying this is a disaster for UWP and it's already dead.
5620000	5625000	It's like games for Windows Live all over again.
5625000	5628000	History is repeating itself a little bit. Well, we'll see.
5628000	5635000	Hey, Loki was talking about Bethesda a minute ago. How about Doom? Doom is out in five weeks. Did you know that? The new Doom.
5636000	5641000	Obviously, if you want to go play classic Doom, go have a ball. But, new Doom is out in five weeks.
5641000	5648000	And, already, $45 worth of post-launch content is planned for Doom, because that's the day and age that we live in.
5648000	5656000	But, you can get a deal for 40 bucks. You can get a season pass. How about that? So, a little money off that.
5656000	5659000	Or, you can wait a year and play $40 for the whole thing.
5659000	5666000	Game of the Year edition. That's right. Or, even by the holiday on a Steam sale. You can probably get the Game of the Year edition.
5666000	5671000	Three premium multiplayer packs are planned for the months following launch.
5671000	5681000	The first one is scheduled for summer. It will have three new maps, one weapon, one playable demon, one armor set, a piece of equipment, new hack modules and taunts, customization colors and patterns.
5681000	5683000	So, this is for multiplayer online?
5683000	5692000	Yeah. So, if you don't have it, you don't get to use it. I'm assuming you'll see other people with those taunts and things, but, hmm.
5692000	5697000	Anyhow, yeah, $40 for the season pass if you want that.
5699000	5710000	Moving on, how about a story about Hideo Kojima? Because, you know, even though Kojima hasn't really done anything in a little bit since, you know, Metal Gear Solid 5 has been done and out there, and we all know what happened with P.T.,
5710000	5716000	it doesn't mean we don't stop showering love on the man who was done so wrong by Konami.
5716000	5724000	Hideo Kojima is going to be hosting a keynote presentation at the Develop Conference in Brighton, that's in the UK, and that will be later this year.
5724000	5732000	Joined by Mark Cerny from Sony, they're going to present a session called Industry Legends Discuss the Future, a conversation with Hideo Kojima.
5732000	5741000	That will be on July 13th, and Kojima getting an award, the 2016 Industry Legendary Award.
5741000	5744000	Well, they're letting him accept it now because he's not with Konami.
5744000	5750000	Yeah, he's allowed to make appearances at award shows now. So, congrats for Kojima.
5750000	5752000	Moving on, Dar Sakura.
5752000	5770000	Well, there is not going to be any more Rock Band 4, at least on PC. The crowdfunding campaign failed to meet its goal. It made only barely above 50%, so no, sorry.
5771000	5782000	Well, to be fair, they may find another way outside crowdfunding, but I still say there's a lot they need to conquer on consoles first, but we'll see.
5782000	5788000	Well, this face here, this is the bitch face of not caring. It's resting right now.
5789000	5800000	I'm kind of with you. Like, I just, I can't care about Rock Band 4 PC when I still feel, still feel like the Rock Band 4 we have on console is not what we were promised, but anyway.
5801000	5811000	Anyway, though this is better news, so guess what? We have new DDR! DDR ACE, and it's coming to Dave and Buster's. Some Dave and Buster's locations.
5811000	5824000	It's also going to be definitely running with the E-Amusement Network, and we don't know if they're going to be selling the passes or not, but hey, if they do, that will be awesome.
5824000	5837000	So it will be out Summer 2016. And then, David Hayter, speaking of being slightly bitter with Kojima and Konami.
5837000	5856000	So, he re-voiced Snake for a Ford commercial. This was part of this overdub video series, and this one is for the Ford Fusion SE.
5856000	5869000	And then, um, yeah. Sad. Why can't we have him back? He did have some kind of nasty things to say about Kojima.
5869000	5878000	Yeah, unfortunately, it was a messy divorce, unfortunately, but hopefully they can both find long, happy lives together just separately.
5879000	5884000	Alright, um, this is the part of the show where I would usually do the Foogle Question of the Week.
5893000	5900000	But I failed in asking a question, so we actually did not have a question posted to our Facebook and Google Plus communities this week. I apologize, that's on me.
5900000	5910000	Just because, again, I can't stress how busy I've been this weekend between the Sac Indie event yesterday. I actually went to a wedding this morning, and I certainly don't regret that whatsoever.
5910000	5920000	It was a beautiful wedding, and the cool thing about the wedding, I will say this, because this is the question I was thinking of doing. I was intending to ask this question, but then I had to turn around to show roll in like 45 minutes.
5920000	5932000	But, the question I was going to ask, my friends got married today, and they had a Star Wars themed wedding. And it was super fucking nerdy, and I mean that in the best possible way.
5932000	5943000	So congratulations, Amanda and Dan, even though I don't think you guys listen to the show, but your pals that I met you through probably do, because they are the hosts of GameBui.org, so I got to see them today for a little bit.
5943000	5955000	But I digress. So I went to a Star Wars themed wedding, and it was super cute. All the people in the wedding party had lightsabers, and they played the Star Wars music, and they encouraged people to dress up, and da da da.
5955000	5961000	So I was going to ask, because it also kind of made me think the Blu-ray was released this week as well for the new movie.
5961000	5962000	Our coffee arrived today.
5962000	5970000	Yeah. And I was worried. I asked this question already back in December, but I guess I didn't. I went back and looked at December's questions, but I didn't.
5970000	5975000	Because I would have thought I would have asked this when the movie came out, but I think we had an interview around the same week, so I didn't ask about it.
5975000	5987000	But I was going to ask, what is your favorite Star Wars video game? Because there's been a lot of Star Wars in video games. There's been a lot of really good Star Wars video games, and there's been other Star Wars video games.
5988000	6002000	But my question is, what is a favorite Star Wars moment in video games? So although I apologize to our Facebook and Google communities, maybe I can read at least a couple quick answers from chat if people want to let me know a favorite moment or game from Star Wars video games.
6002000	6007000	What about you guys here in studio? Sorry to spring this on you, but y'all are creative. DarkSagra?
6008000	6016000	I really liked the old school Star Wars arcade. I mean, I liked the newer one that they did in the early 2000s. I thought that one was pretty fun.
6016000	6026000	But I have to say though, one that came out not too long ago were the battle pods. And yeah, while those games usually make me motion sick, I have to say it was really fun.
6026000	6037000	So I would also like to give a big fuck you to all of the Super Star Wars, Super Empire Strikes Back, and Super Return of the Jedi for being hard as balls.
6037000	6039000	Those games are assholes.
6039000	6040000	They're assholes.
6040000	6041000	But they're awesome games.
6041000	6049000	Oh yeah, they're great, but they're hard as fuck. But I love the debug code, and you can just like speed through the level and see all the stuff that's funny.
6049000	6055000	I'll piggyback on that since I was also going to say the original OG Star Wars arcade game, the vector graphics.
6055000	6066000	I remember playing that shit when I was like seven years old in the sit-down cabinets at the Tilt Arcade at Sunrise Mall, which, shit, that hasn't been open since the mid-80s just to date myself a little bit.
6066000	6068000	But that game was the shit.
6068000	6075000	And when I go to California Extreme, which I think I'll actually get to go to this year finally. I haven't been in like five years. I'm so excited.
6076000	6081000	But when I go to California Extreme, I get so excited when I see that cabinet.
6081000	6085000	And the Empire Strikes Back too, but there's something very special about the original OG vector Star Wars game.
6085000	6089000	Which, by the way, some folks in chat are agreeing with that same answer.
6089000	6092000	Over in chat, over at live.vognetware.com, Dark Tetsuya says,
6092000	6095000	Gotta go with the Atari vector Star Wars game, arcade game too.
6095000	6098000	Brad from Pod Culture, our buddy over there on Monday nights, says,
6098000	6101000	Hands down the original arcade game.
6101000	6107000	Bobby Blackwolf says, Star Wars Galaxies spent way, way too much time in there right when it launched.
6107000	6112000	I think sometimes we forget, Star Wars has lent itself very well to a couple of large MMOs.
6112000	6116000	Some other people play The Old Republic as well. That's still going on.
6116000	6120000	Loki, what about you? I don't want to forget you. Star Wars game that you love?
6120000	6124000	I didn't really play that many of them.
6124000	6128000	The one that I love talking about connects Star Wars.
6128000	6132000	Because what the fuck were they thinking with that stupid dancing game?
6132000	6135000	I mean, come on. That is just fucking stupid.
6135000	6138000	But, yeah, I don't know. I didn't really play that many Star Wars games.
6138000	6142000	I played some of the Super Nintendo ones, and I don't know.
6142000	6145000	Do you want to hear about what an old grandpa gamer I am?
6145000	6150000	We were somewhere. Where were we? We were at a club or something. I don't remember what it was.
6150000	6157000	Oh, I think this was when we were in Tucson, actually, because I think my friends were there to overhear my old-ass grandpa gamer moment.
6157000	6163000	And this song came on, and I'm like, why are they playing this? Why are we at a place that's playing this?
6163000	6169000	They're playing the Han Solo song from Star Wars Connect, the I'm Han Solo, like that whole song.
6169000	6176000	And my friends are like, no, Rob, no, no. This is the original song. That was a parody of another song.
6176000	6185000	And this is the real song, Rob. I'm like, I have become that old man that's like,
6185000	6189000	I don't watch MTV. It's nothing but noise.
6189000	6197000	And apparently two new clips from Suicide Squad and Captain America Civil War.
6197000	6199000	Oh, boy.
6199000	6205000	Speaking of which, finally caught myself up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
6205000	6207000	Did you? I'm still behind.
6207000	6208000	Yeah, I watched all the movies I missed.
6208000	6214000	I still want to see Superman versus Batman. I don't want to hear it. Look, I fully expect it's probably going to be bad.
6214000	6219000	But I sat through Batman and Robin. I can fucking tolerate a bad Batman movie.
6219000	6222000	I can do it this way. It could have been a whole lot worse.
6222000	6223000	Yeah.
6223000	6225000	It could have been a Joel Schumacher movie.
6225000	6226000	Right.
6226000	6230000	Can you imagine a Joel Schumacher Batman versus Superman?
6230000	6233000	Fuck off.
6233000	6235000	Oh, man, that'd be amazing.
6235000	6240000	Kaijuto in chat says, best Star Wars game was Jedi Academy, hands down.
6240000	6243000	Alan Alchemy agreeing. I really love Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy.
6243000	6248000	Dungeon Buster saying Dark Forces 2 is also up there. Huge love for TIE Fighter.
6248000	6251000	Bob Coffey says rogue leader on GameCube.
6251000	6256000	S.G.O. and Hunter Matt says, I was a big fan of the Jedi Knight series, mostly Jedi Outcast.
6256000	6258000	Act F says, Star Wars Battlefront 2.
6258000	6262000	So a variety of answers there in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6262000	6265000	Sorry I didn't get all the answers there, but there's a lot of chat going on.
6265000	6267000	So, great. Thank you.
6267000	6271000	So thank you for filling in for my lack of asking the question on FUGL.
6271000	6276000	But in the future, our Facebook and Google Plus communities will have a question every week.
6276000	6278000	Don't forget to answer it.
6278000	6282000	Honestly, you know, I haven't played them yet, but I thought about purchasing them.
6282000	6286000	Probably the Lego Star Wars games would be pretty good as well.
6286000	6287000	Those are pretty good.
6287000	6291000	Yeah, I've heard pretty good things about those. I'm not seeing a lot of that in chat, but...
6291000	6294000	That and the Force Unleashed, those games look kind of interesting.
6294000	6296000	But I never got around to playing those.
6296000	6300000	All right. Well, let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.
6300000	6303000	All right. Let's see.
6303000	6307000	So, I don't know how excited I am about this.
6307000	6313000	But apparently, and I swear I didn't know they were even considering making this, but...
6313000	6316000	Hey, you know, we haven't gotten a new Mega Man game in a while.
6316000	6318000	But hey, let's make a cartoon series for it.
6318000	6320000	Why not?
6320000	6322000	So that's what they're going to do.
6322000	6324000	They're making a new Mega Man cartoon.
6324000	6328000	Apparently it was announced last year.
6328000	6335000	And it's being done with the creators of the Ben 10 cartoon.
6335000	6338000	And it's supposed to be coming out in 2017.
6338000	6342000	To coincide with the 30th anniversary of Mega Man.
6342000	6344000	Please don't suck.
6344000	6347000	And can we get a new Mega Man game that doesn't suck?
6347000	6348000	Yeah, I was going to say.
6348000	6352000	You know what would be awesome for the 30th anniversary of Mega Man?
6352000	6355000	A fucking game. That would be great.
6356000	6359000	Don't get me wrong. Anime has the potential to be cool.
6359000	6362000	You know, there's a lot of awesome tie-in anime out there.
6362000	6366000	But a game would be the bee's knees.
6366000	6368000	But with that.
6368000	6369000	Bee Man.
6369000	6375000	Just because something gets a series and then they go to make a game based off that series
6375000	6377000	doesn't mean it's going to be a good thing.
6377000	6380000	Especially off of an existing IP that people loved.
6380000	6382000	Like Sonic Boom.
6383000	6386000	And it just like was fucking stupid.
6386000	6389000	Please don't give Mega Man more friends.
6389000	6391000	He doesn't need more friends.
6391000	6397000	He needs more robots that have weird names associated with, I don't know, some gimmick that they have.
6397000	6399000	That he can absorb their powers from.
6399000	6401000	And that's it. That's really all you need.
6401000	6405000	Dartitsuyu in chat says, isn't there a Bee Man in one of the recent games, 9 or 10?
6405000	6406000	Actually now you say.
6406000	6410000	Like after the words left my mouth, I'm like, actually I seem to remember like a honeycomb level.
6410000	6415000	I would totally take though an Elmer Fudd Dr. Light again.
6415000	6418000	Because I'm going to kill Dr. Wiby.
6418000	6421000	I mean, it was so terrible.
6421000	6423000	Thank you, McManic.
6423000	6429000	Hey, did you guys play that Legend of Zelda browser game that was out for a hot minute?
6429000	6430000	I did.
6430000	6433000	You could play it in a browser, but it was like a 3D Legend of Zelda.
6433000	6435000	Dan played the crap out of that.
6435000	6440000	Yeah, not like Oculus Rift 3D, but like 3D pixel style Legend of Zelda.
6440000	6445000	And yeah, it was up and you could play it in a browser and guess what happened?
6445000	6451000	These things tend to do, we all know the punchline, Nintendo shut it down.
6451000	6453000	Although, you know, the creators took it in good spirit.
6453000	6457000	You know, they said, they said their quote, Nintendo has every right to protect their IP.
6457000	6459000	And they knew this result could potentially happen.
6459000	6463000	So they have no complaints and they even made some friends along the way.
6463000	6468000	So maybe some folks noticed what they did and might want to use, not saying it was necessarily Nintendo,
6468000	6473000	but anybody out there could have seen what they did and maybe want to put their skills to use somewhere else.
6473000	6477000	And to which after, you know, seeing all that, they're like, what's on the internet?
6477000	6479000	It's always on the fucking internet, bitches.
6479000	6483000	And that is also true. Once on the internet, always on the internet.
6483000	6488000	Because you know, there's that person who found it even faster than Nintendo that saw it and said,
6488000	6491000	you know, I bet Nintendo is going to take this down.
6491000	6493000	Right click, save as.
6493000	6495000	See you indeed. Bye-bye.
6495000	6498000	Yeah. So somebody's got a copy of it somewhere.
6498000	6501000	All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.
6501000	6508000	Well, this is what makes me mad and sad and other negative things that end in ad.
6508000	6512000	Game politics is one of my absolute favorite sites.
6512000	6515000	I get probably the majority of my news from it.
6515000	6529000	It goes into a lot of the video game stuff that I really look more into, which is the social, legal, ethical side of gaming culture.
6529000	6530000	I mean, pretty much.
6530000	6536000	These are all the things that affect life other than this game's crappy, this game's good, you know.
6536000	6539000	So they are closing.
6539000	6542000	And this is, this is the personal insult.
6542000	6545000	Not personal, but still, I'm taking it that way.
6545000	6549000	It's going down the day before my birthday.
6549000	6553000	Well, they're going to stop doing updates on April 18th.
6553000	6558000	And the contents will still be up for a while before it is taken down for good.
6558000	6566000	And the ECA, the Entertainment Consumers Association that owns the domain and the brand, this is their decision.
6566000	6576000	So if you want game politics to not die, if you want to see this stay alive, everyone should write in.
6576000	6580000	Well, Jamie, at least they didn't do it on your birthday.
6580000	6581000	Girl.
6581000	6588000	What do you, Bobby talked about this at length on his show tonight, and he pointed out that game politics changed hands a few years ago.
6588000	6597000	The guy that started it, and I remember the individual that started game politics was actually very prolific on the emerging podcast scene.
6597000	6600000	Because I don't know if we ended up in an article.
6600000	6606000	Like, I feel like in the early days of game politics, like we were quoted, like one of our shows was in an article or something.
6606000	6607000	Don't you remember that?
6607000	6610000	I feel like something happened along the, it was a long fucking time ago, okay?
6610000	6614000	But I, or he emailed us or something, I don't know.
6614000	6618000	But anyway, the guy who started it is not the same guy who's been doing it.
6618000	6623000	Like that, it changed hands quite some time ago, but that didn't bother you, Dark Soccer.
6623000	6630000	You were still, you weren't necessarily about who was behind it, but you were about like, this is the angle of the news and this is why.
6630000	6645000	Yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know, I think that we need stuff like this out there instead of just the more flashy stuff, does that make sense?
6645000	6646000	Yeah.
6646000	6658000	You know, like the drama of, you know, whatever Sony's doing right now, or, you know, this game has too much boob in it or something.
6658000	6669000	I think we need to see what goes on a little bit behind the scenes and the effect that games being such a big part of society now have as an effect in society.
6669000	6678000	We need to have exposure to this stuff because, you know, especially for adult gamers, this is what affects our day to day life.
6678000	6699000	What about the argument, just not that I necessarily agree with this, but just devil's advocate, what about the argument that Jack Voldemort's been disbarred, Leelanese in jail, the Brown vs. ESA, the Schwarzenegger ESA thing got thrown out of court, or sorry, it got, you know, Scalia actually was the one that wrote the report on that, that shut that one down.
6699000	6705000	What about the argument that we don't need it anymore because games are no longer the underdog that they were?
6706000	6710000	Except that I don't think that's quite the situation.
6710000	6720000	Is that I think that we do still have, maybe not necessarily the underdog angle, but there's still plenty of things that go on.
6720000	6725000	You know, for example, the whole, you know, bean dog thing with Baldur's Gate.
6725000	6733000	You know, clearly we do have still instances of harassment and social issues that need to be addressed.
6733000	6738000	I think it goes far beyond the, oh, video games are evil.
6738000	6749000	It goes into more of, I guess, more of an everyday angle, things that are going to have to reflect on the state of the world.
6749000	6757000	Like the other one about there about the Congressman Duncan Hunter, who...
6757000	6764000	Oh, yo, I didn't even put that on the show tonight, but, oh my God, Alan and I were talking about this in the car and having a laugh about it.
6764000	6774000	Because what, isn't he the big vaping Congressman that actually, what, he blamed his kid for $1,300 worth of Steam games in the library and all this stuff?
6774000	6781000	The 68 Steam transactions were put as, quote, personal expense to be paid back.
6782000	6789000	Yeah, the House Ethics Committee smacked him. He's under an investigation by the FEC right now.
6789000	6797000	So, but I mean, would you have known that? Would most gamers know that? Just reading EGM.
6797000	6800000	EGM came back, right?
6802000	6806000	Would they know this reading Game Pro or Nintendo Power?
6806000	6807000	They may have learned it on Twitter.
6807000	6809000	Pro tip, study.
6809000	6816000	Depending on who they follow. But anyway, no, I get your point because from, and the way I really feel, as much as, you know, I have to play devil's advocate on the show sometimes.
6816000	6823000	The way I really feel is that, okay, well, these things may not be an issue now, but it seems like whenever something goes wrong in society, video games will ultimately get blamed.
6823000	6829000	So the next time there's a shooting or something, we're going to be right back to where we were, blame the games. It always happens.
6829000	6836000	Well, I mean, and like, just to go over some of the important things. I mean, the issues that were brought up just in the very first page.
6836000	6843000	We have the Dragon Spear thing. We've got the Steam games that we just mentioned.
6843000	6849000	There's also IGDA criticizing Nintendo for firing Allison Rapp.
6849000	6858000	There's another one. There was the DMCA takedown of, you know, the Mass Effect Trump thing.
6858000	6868000	Lots of other stuff on here. I mean, that's just the first page and it's already a handful of really important information.
6868000	6887000	Things that are affecting, you know, everyday things, things that are, you know, speaking about not just the legal side of things, but how, and I'm not going to say ethics and reporting, but I'm going to say just general ethics in relation to how they apply to gaming and the gaming industry and the way people behave.
6887000	6889000	So it's lots of.
6889000	6896000	Well, Jamie, is it time to maybe start game politics to Electric Boogaloo led by Dark Sakura?
6896000	6898000	Is that, is that what, is that what America needs?
6898000	6899000	You know what?
6899000	6900000	What?
6900000	6907000	I just think that if I did my own version of, uh, and you know what I'm talking about?
6907000	6918000	Okay. If you have no idea what Dark Sakura is talking about, and I'm sure most of our audience probably doesn't give a shit, but I need you to try.
6918000	6924000	Go to YouTube. I need you to try. For Rob Roberts, I need you to try and embrace drag queens for a minute.
6924000	6936000	You need to go to YouTube and look up Katya and Trixie Mattel because they do a web series called, and I laughed so hard on the last episode.
6936000	6939000	I may have piddled.
6939000	6940000	I love it.
6940000	6943000	I have to explain Dark Sakura's in-jokes because it's just not fair otherwise.
6943000	6946000	So there you go. It's just referencing drag queens, everybody.
6946000	6949000	I know. And well, Dan blames you.
6949000	6950000	Good.
6950000	6951000	Good.
6951000	6952000	Good.
6952000	6955000	You're coming over tomorrow to see who's eliminated, right?
6955000	6957000	Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
6957000	6959000	Because I have it all on my Apple TV now.
6959000	6963000	Yes, I have. I have a season pass for season eight of RuPaul's Drag Race.
6963000	6974000	So anyway, if I did my own version of, uh, it would basically just be me bitching about people's behavior in video games in the industry.
6974000	6982000	How, I mean, I would have to dedicate like a part of the shit that I want to talk about to just how all of this relates to everyday life.
6982000	6990000	And then, you know, probably stuff about cosplay and bitches and, you know, and people that I don't like, I guess.
6990000	6994000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, why is it always going to come back to RuPaul's Drag Race?
6994000	6996000	I swear this is like the third week in a row.
6996000	6998000	I'm sorry. Is there a problem?
6998000	7000000	I don't see a problem anywhere.
7000000	7006000	You know why it has to keep coming back to Drag Race and why we're doing it because of you, really.
7006000	7008000	Because we know that you're going to bitch about it.
7008000	7013000	Yes. Dark Tetsuya, I'm actually just specifically for you, knowing that you are going to make that comment.
7013000	7017000	That is why we're going to mention Drag Race next week as well.
7017000	7019000	And probably the week after that.
7019000	7020000	And you know what?
7020000	7023000	And when I do it, I'm going to say, everybody take a shot in Dark Tetsuya's honor.
7023000	7024000	You know what, Dark Tetsuya?
7024000	7026000	Dark Tetsuya, I'll tell you when we're going to do it.
7026000	7031000	When we're going to leave off discussing it for one whole episode is when we get you in drag.
7033000	7043000	And I mean, shave the brows, shave the pits, get some padding, and we're going to Sephora.
7045000	7049000	That is when we will go an entire episode of not talking about it.
7049000	7050000	When we get you in drag.
7050000	7055000	William Murderface in chat says, Dark Tetsuya, you better sashay away now.
7055000	7060000	Look, we're picking on the guy who supported us for like 14 years, so come on.
7060000	7061000	So we're allowed.
7061000	7062000	Yeah, we're allowed.
7062000	7065000	Bobby Blackwolf says, Sky is narrowcasting at Dark Tetsuya.
7065000	7071000	Look, anybody who spent 14 years with this show, I'm going to narrowcast once in a while.
7071000	7073000	He just says, I can't.
7075000	7078000	I hope that's a can't even and not a traumatized I can't.
7078000	7079000	You're learning from this.
7079000	7083000	If you have learned the ability to can't, then you are getting somewhere.
7083000	7084000	All right, no.
7084000	7085000	It says that I dept.
7085000	7088000	We can't have RuPaul's Drag Radio because Rob already has reading as fundamental.
7088000	7089000	Yeah, that's true.
7089000	7091000	And who knows, maybe I will do my own version of...
7093000	7101000	All right, Loki, save us from this whirlpool, this pit of despair of Drag Race talk with another game story, Loki.
7101000	7103000	Yeah, let's talk about more rumors.
7103000	7104000	Woo.
7104000	7105000	Yay.
7105000	7107000	It's another NX rumor.
7107000	7108000	The only thing better.
7110000	7114000	And this is coming from a verified Reddit user.
7114000	7115000	That's right.
7115000	7118000	They've been verified as to what...
7118000	7121000	I don't know, but apparently here is the rumors that they have.
7121000	7125000	They have sources, trusted sources that have been verified.
7128000	7131000	So, it's supposed to be x86 architecture.
7131000	7135000	They're going to have some way to back up your data to Nintendo's servers,
7135000	7137000	like some sort of cloud saves or something.
7137000	7139000	Support for additional screens.
7139000	7142000	It can handle ports of current gen games.
7142000	7147000	And we'll be able to interact with smartphone apps or smart device apps.
7147000	7153000	And also using NX software will unlock my Nintendo reward points.
7156000	7157000	So, yeah.
7159000	7162000	And looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
7162000	7165000	Actf says, I trust the verified user, actually.
7165000	7168000	The moderator in the NX subreddit also runs the Amiibo subreddit.
7168000	7173000	SJ100Matt says, verified Reddit user is like a credible post on Neogaf.
7173000	7174000	You know what?
7174000	7175000	Here's the thing.
7175000	7178000	As much as we make fun of rumors, some are going to be true and some aren't.
7178000	7180000	That's what rumors are.
7180000	7183000	I think a whole shit ton, a lot of us,
7183000	7188000	fell for the whole mock-up of the controller thingy thing.
7188000	7191000	Okay, so we've all seen rumors gone wrong.
7191000	7194000	So if we're going to be a little skeptical of everything,
7194000	7196000	I think you all can understand why.
7197000	7198000	Right?
7198000	7200000	Are they rumors or trimmers?
7200000	7202000	And it doesn't really tell me anything about this.
7202000	7205000	About, like, what this device does.
7205000	7208000	Who gives a shit if I can unlock my Nintendo reward points?
7208000	7211000	If I don't want to buy this system, that's going to be completely irrelevant.
7211000	7213000	What exactly is this system?
7213000	7215000	But I guess we'll find out.
7215000	7217000	Yeah, thank God.
7217000	7218000	Thank God.
7218000	7220000	Two more months and we'll have these fucking answers
7220000	7222000	and no more of these goddamn NX rumors.
7222000	7224000	And I hope it's not like,
7224000	7226000	Huh. Okay.
7227000	7229000	That's different.
7231000	7233000	Dark Sakura, as far as this NX rumor goes,
7233000	7235000	are you going to toot it or boot it?
7238000	7239000	I don't know.
7239000	7241000	How much glitter is it wearing and does it have ankle straps?
7241000	7243000	Alright, moving on.
7243000	7245000	Let's talk about e-gaming.
7245000	7247000	And, you know, there's a lot of e-games.
7247000	7249000	There's a bunch of, like,
7249000	7251000	Heroes of the Storm stuff going on this weekend.
7251000	7253000	I see a ton of stuff on my feed.
7253000	7255000	I know. I've had friends that are there.
7255000	7257000	Aren't they doing stuff on ESPN2 again?
7257000	7259000	Yeah, they are.
7259000	7261000	Well, get this.
7261000	7266000	The British government is talking about an e-sports version of the Olympics.
7266000	7269000	The British government announced the very first e-games.
7269000	7272000	And, by the way, this is coming from the International Business Times,
7272000	7274000	which is a UK press source.
7274000	7277000	The British government has announced that the very first e-games
7277000	7279000	will be taking place every four years
7279000	7282000	and will act as the e-sports equivalent of the Olympic games
7282000	7285000	and take place in the host countries of every Olympiad.
7285000	7288000	So, meaning, this year will be in Rio de Janeiro,
7288000	7290000	which is where the Olympics are going to be, if you were not aware.
7290000	7292000	E-games is a non-profit organization.
7292000	7294000	There will be no prize money.
7294000	7297000	But, like the Olympics, it will use national pride and competition
7297000	7300000	to generate interest and draw in competitors.
7300000	7303000	And they're actually going to get the help of the International Olympic Committee.
7303000	7307000	So, although games are not becoming part of the Olympics,
7307000	7313000	games are now potentially running side-by-side-ish with the Olympics.
7313000	7315000	This is kind of a big fucking deal.
7315000	7316000	Like, I had to look at it.
7316000	7318000	I'm like, am I being punked right now?
7318000	7319000	Like, is this for real?
7319000	7321000	Because this is kind of a big deal.
7321000	7325000	So far, Brazil, Britain, the USA, and Canada have signed up for this.
7325000	7327000	They will have their own e-teams.
7327000	7330000	Each nation will be advised by the Olympic Committee
7330000	7337000	and the UKIE, the UK's video game trade body, to oversee the e-teams.
7337000	7341000	So, this is a huge step, I think.
7341000	7344000	It will be very interesting to see what comes of it this year.
7344000	7348000	I imagine it's not going to be as prolific and as out there as the Olympics,
7348000	7351000	but perhaps if you are running in the same circles now
7351000	7355000	that sees a lot of talk about Heroes of the Storm this weekend
7355000	7359000	on Facebook and Twitter and stuff with the competition that's going on now,
7359000	7364000	perhaps you are going to see a lot about this come summer or fall
7364000	7366000	or whenever they decide to do that.
7366000	7368000	I can't imagine they're going to do it at the same time as the Olympics.
7368000	7372000	That's just asking for trouble, but maybe a couple months after or what have you.
7372000	7375000	So, I think it's very exciting.
7375000	7377000	We will see.
7377000	7380000	I would love to go to one of these competitions.
7380000	7383000	Rio de Janeiro may be a little far for me, but where are they hosting?
7383000	7384000	Have they announced for 2020?
7384000	7386000	Isn't 2020 in Tokyo?
7386000	7387000	Am I crazy?
7387000	7389000	Where is 2020 in Japan?
7389000	7390000	Tokyo is in Japan, Rob.
7390000	7392000	I know that, but the Olympics.
7392000	7394000	Aren't the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo?
7394000	7395000	Hold on, I'll find out.
7395000	7396000	Okay.
7396000	7399000	Somebody in chat will probably find it faster than a Wikipedia.
7399000	7401000	Yep, 2020 is in Tokyo.
7401000	7402000	There's actdeft.
7402000	7404000	Now, that would be a lot of fun.
7404000	7409000	Akuma JP, make room on your couch in 2020.
7409000	7411000	All right.
7411000	7413000	Let's get to the mailbag.
7413000	7421000	Every week we read your emails, which you guys send to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7421000	7427000	And we will open up the mailbag and find that there are no emails this week.
7427000	7428000	Well, I will say this.
7428000	7433000	There was an anonymous email that was sent that had a bunch of stuff that was like, read me, read me, read me.
7433000	7437000	And with all my running around ragged this weekend and not get around to actually reading it yet.
7437000	7439000	And it also said, don't read this on air.
7439000	7440000	So, I won't.
7440000	7447000	But I'm just going to acknowledge I saw it and I'm ready to move on.
7447000	7451000	I am just ready to move on.
7451000	7454000	But you can send us emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7454000	7455000	Yeah.
7455000	7458000	But I will, I will give the benefit of the doubt and all that stuff.
7458000	7459000	I'm just saying.
7459000	7461000	There were very good points made in it.
7461000	7465000	And I would actually like to have a discussion with that individual just to discuss.
7465000	7467000	So don't, so don't be anonymous.
7467000	7468000	We're not going to bite your head off.
7468000	7469000	We want to know who you are.
7469000	7471000	We're not going to bite your head off because you have a different opinion.
7471000	7473000	And we're glad that you've listened to us for as long as you have.
7473000	7476000	I have a feeling it's somebody who already participates with the show.
7476000	7477000	Okay.
7477000	7479000	Just, I don't know, it's a wild fucking guess.
7479000	7483000	But if someone says that they want to, you know, not have their name right on air, that's fine.
7483000	7484000	Yeah.
7484000	7485000	We're good with that.
7485000	7490000	We're nice people, contrary to what you've read on Twitter or wherever.
7490000	7494000	Dark Sakura is like, eh.
7495000	7497000	All right.
7497000	7499000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7499000	7501000	So you guys have to send us some more emails for next week.
7501000	7504000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7504000	7507000	So let's get to the FUs of the week.
7507000	7532000	A few to the headache returning and not going away until like now.
7532000	7535000	So, yeah, headaches the worst.
7536000	7539000	So, Loki.
7539000	7550000	FU2, whatever chess cold thing I have right now that's annoying because it's just like uncontrollable coughing and hard to breathe.
7550000	7553000	And I got to go to the doctor probably eventually.
7553000	7554000	But I don't know.
7554000	7555000	I don't know what it is.
7555000	7557000	I hope it ain't contagious.
7557000	7558000	I don't think so.
7558000	7560000	But I also hope you're okay.
7560000	7561000	None of my kids got it.
7561000	7563000	So usually that's, you know.
7563000	7564000	That's a good sign.
7565000	7567000	My FU of the week goes to my back.
7567000	7570000	When I was, God, here I go, grandpa gamer again.
7570000	7575000	But when I was moving, you know, I had to move the OLR computer and all that stuff out of here myself yesterday.
7575000	7576000	Which is fine.
7576000	7577000	I'm not, you know, being a baby.
7577000	7580000	But I packed the sound board and the monitor in one of the suitcases.
7580000	7582000	And I guess I just picked it up wrong.
7582000	7584000	I wasn't using my knees enough or something.
7584000	7586000	I hurt my back.
7586000	7588000	And it hurt so bad yesterday.
7588000	7590000	But I had to push through for the event, right?
7590000	7592000	Because I didn't get time to get my show face on.
7592000	7598000	So, by the time last night rolled around, I was invited to go somewhere else last night.
7598000	7600000	And it was just like, I can't.
7600000	7602000	Because I just have to lie here and feel sorry for myself.
7602000	7605000	I need to lie here and feel like hot garbage for a while.
7605000	7606000	Is that the line?
7606000	7607000	Is that the character in Undertale?
7607000	7609000	He needs to lie there and feel like hot garbage.
7609000	7611000	That was me last night.
7611000	7612000	And my back.
7612000	7613000	So FU to my back.
7614000	7615000	Alright.
7617000	7618000	Moving on.
7618000	7620000	We just have a couple more stories for you guys.
7620000	7623000	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.
7623000	7626000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7626000	7627000	Thank you, ActDeaf.
7627000	7629000	It's Napstablook.
7629000	7630000	Because he naps.
7630000	7631000	Napstablook.
7632000	7633000	Alright.
7633000	7634000	Loki.
7634000	7638000	So, this is kind of a neat little thing that's been found.
7640000	7641000	So PunchOut.
7641000	7644000	Apparently the original PunchOut, or Mike Tyson's PunchOut.
7644000	7646000	It's been out for 29 years.
7647000	7651000	And apparently a Reddit user, Midwestern Housewives.
7653000	7654000	That's the name.
7654000	7658000	Discovered a little cue that's in the background.
7658000	7665000	A visual cue that tells you on when to be able to punch certain fighters in the game to knock them out.
7666000	7670000	And so, apparently there's this guy that's kind of like bearded in the background.
7670000	7674000	If you see him duck, that's the exact moment that you're supposed to punch them.
7674000	7676000	And then they'll be knocked out with one punch.
7677000	7680000	And I guess no one has ever noticed that until this time.
7680000	7682000	It's kind of like an Easter egg.
7682000	7686000	I thought that you could one-hit.
7686000	7689000	I remember being able to one-hit punch KnockOut Pissed Honda.
7689000	7690000	Well, yeah.
7690000	7691000	Yeah, you can do that.
7691000	7699000	But the thing is, to know when you're supposed to do that, that cue happens before he goes in to do whatever he has to do in order to do that.
7699000	7706000	I just remember as a kid, you look for the move he does, and you just kind of pray that you hit it at the right time.
7706000	7715000	Right, yeah. So before he does that move, that guy ducks in the crowd, and that's when you know it's done.
7715000	7720000	Yeah, I saw the video where you could actually see, because it was an 8-bit game.
7720000	7725000	So when we say, the guy ducks, it changes from one sprite to another, basically.
7725000	7728000	It's not the most fluid animation.
7728000	7731000	But yeah, it's still neat to find.
7731000	7738000	I mean, all this stuff aside, it's still neat to discover tricks and tips from a game that is so old, you know what I mean?
7738000	7739000	Exactly.
7739000	7740000	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
7741000	7746000	ActDef says, didn't this cue be discovered by speedrunners already?
7746000	7750000	DarkTetsuya says, this was neat. You really have to work for that.
7751000	7755000	Well, lastly tonight in our main news, I want to talk about Mario Maker.
7755000	7761000	Because a few weeks ago, there was talk that Mario Maker was mysteriously deleting levels.
7761000	7770000	And apparently, on the support page of Nintendo, there's now a bit of an explanation as to why levels are disappearing.
7770000	7772000	And the explanation goes like this.
7772000	7775000	We sometimes have to delete courses from Course World.
7775000	7778000	Below are cases where courses can be removed from the server.
7778000	7782000	And believe it or not, they do list low stars and plays.
7782000	7789000	After a fixed period of time, courses with low stars and plays will be automatically deleted from the server.
7789000	7793000	They don't say how many, they don't say what the threshold is, they just say low.
7793000	7799000	Which I'm assuming is sort of a CYA thing where they can just delete whatever and say, oh, it was low.
7799000	7805000	But I just, I still, I don't want to beat a dead horse because we talked about this already a month ago.
7805000	7816000	I'm not sure I understand when you have the power of the internet and a vast space where you can put all the Mario levels your heart desires in the cloud.
7816000	7818000	It's up in the cloud.
7818000	7821000	I don't understand why you need to delete something just because it's low.
7821000	7828000	Maybe if it's like, literally nobody has played it but the user that created it, maybe I could see that.
7828000	7832000	But since they won't tell me what the threshold is, I don't know what to do.
7832000	7840000	Well, whose fault is that? That only the creators played it because you have no goddamn way to share levels easily aside from that stupid code.
7840000	7852000	Oh, but you can go on the website and you put in a code on the website and add it to your queue and you go to the queue on Mario Maker and then you can look in the queue for the level you want to play and then play that level.
7852000	7855000	So fucking stupid.
7855000	7857000	It makes no goddamn sense.
7858000	7865000	Please, my god, it is the year 2016. Can you fucking do internet already?
7865000	7871000	I mean, seriously, we have another console coming out possibly later this year or next year.
7871000	7874000	Fix that shit right the fuck now.
7874000	7878000	I'm just gonna put that on a shirt. Can you fucking do internet already, Loki?
7878000	7880000	Comcast, too.
7880000	7884000	Can I put that as a bumper sticker on my car? Can you fucking do internet already?
7885000	7891000	Uh, the chat room. The chat room is diving for cover. It's a Loki rants on the alarm.
7891000	7894000	Also, now not just the low stars thing, bugs.
7894000	7901000	Courses that include bugs that were unintended by either the course creator or the developers will be deleted.
7901000	7910000	It's important that we remove levels with bugs quickly because letting these levels remain in course world can lead to negative outcomes for many players,
7910000	7917000	such as players experiencing levels in unfair ways that the original course creator did not intend or rewriting world record times.
7917000	7921000	And then lastly, requesting stars from other users.
7921000	7927000	Oh, sorry, one more after this, but courses that are explicitly asking for stars from other players will be deleted.
7927000	7932000	For example, using words like like, yeah, and the star symbol in their course names.
7932000	7935000	Please change the course name when saving a course that includes these words.
7935000	7940000	And lastly, of course, inappropriate content, offensive behavior, that whole type of thing.
7940000	7946000	You can't spell out, you know, cunt in blocks and expect that that level is going to stay up because that's inappropriate.
7946000	7948000	So don't do that.
7948000	7955000	Alright, so, uh, there you go. Those are Nintendo's official explanation of why they take down levels.
7955000	7962000	Which is interesting that they explain some of them so well, except for the low, which is the one that everybody's focusing on.
7962000	7966000	Like, okay, yes, bugs. We get the bugs. Yes, don't put fuck in your level. We understand.
7966000	7971000	But the low one is the one that, like, their explanation kind of sucks.
7971000	7975000	And I would like to know more about the thought process behind that.
7975000	7977000	But we'll take what we can get.
7977000	7981000	In the meantime, Skype line is open. If you'd like to give us a call to talk about anything we've talked about tonight,
7981000	7986000	anything we haven't yet talked about tonight that you'd like to bring up or whatever's on your mind, give us a call.
7986000	7994000	In fact, Skype really is the preferred method in the year 2016. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7994000	7999000	That same cell phone you used to call us could probably be used to use Skype, just saying.
7999000	8004000	In the meantime, I always like to check in with Loki at this point and say, hey, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
8004000	8005000	I don't know.
8005000	8007000	Um...
8007000	8009000	Yeah, we kind of used a lot tonight, right?
8009000	8012000	Yeah, I don't really have anything.
8012000	8013000	Yeah.
8013000	8019000	I didn't forget to mention that I attempted the Blade DDR a couple weeks ago. That didn't go well.
8019000	8022000	Oh, because you're old? Because I've had that moment, too.
8022000	8023000	Yes.
8023000	8024000	Yes.
8024000	8029000	Alright, let's get to the phones, because the line is ringing. Let's do it.
8029000	8031000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8031000	8036000	It's the one and only Ranma. How is everybody out there in Sacramento today?
8036000	8038000	Fabulous. Thanks for asking.
8038000	8042000	Except for this whole business where when we were talking about OLR going off the air earlier,
8042000	8045000	you were the first one to say, I get the time slot.
8045000	8051000	Well, have you forgotten the part where Anime Jam Session is the baby brother of OLR?
8051000	8053000	So, of course, we're going to call dibs.
8053000	8058000	Yeah, I know, I know, but we are going to continue to pick on you as well as siblings do.
8058000	8061000	And we will continue to blackmail y'all in return.
8061000	8063000	Alright, fair enough. What's up? What's on your mind?
8063000	8071000	I'm going to talk about this whole FF7 thing where people are, I guess, they're kind of losing their proverbial shit because it's going to be a trilogy.
8072000	8076000	Yeah, the whole episodic nature of the remake. What's your take on it?
8076000	8085000	Look, we know the story of FF7. We know that when they did the game, they didn't cover every aspect of it.
8085000	8091000	So, we know that's what they're going to do. They're going to try to go into detail on the entire FF7 lore.
8091000	8097000	And if we're lucky, they'll throw a nod at some of the spinoff titles such as Dirge of Cerberus.
8097000	8104000	I was going to say, besides it was a trilogy, there's Dirge of Cerberus, FF7, and Advent Children.
8104000	8106000	Crisis Core as well.
8106000	8113000	Yeah, and also, they did say they wanted to go into detailing as possible.
8113000	8118000	It's going to be more of an action RPG. Did they not say that?
8119000	8129000	No, and I agree with you. You can see that in the gameplay. You know it's not going to be the same game, and you can see that based on the gameplay.
8129000	8134000	But I think the other important thing with the whole FF7 thing, and let's get one thing clear.
8134000	8144000	If you're expecting a shot-for-shot remake, except it's going to be in high definition, if you're expecting the voice acting to be word-for-word the script that you remember from when you were younger,
8144000	8150000	you need to stop and prepare yourself for something different.
8150000	8160000	This is akin to them remaking a movie. A classic movie in a new day and age. For better or for worse.
8160000	8169000	Yes, because if it was shot-for-shot and word-for-word, I think an hour in, I'd turn the game off and walk away.
8169000	8183000	What I am looking forward to is the fact that it's going to be an action RPG, it's going to be more detailing, the voice acting is going to be amazing, and they're going to go probably into detail into the full lore of FF7.
8183000	8190000	Which I think is pretty cool. And they did say it was going to be multiple parts. I mean, not for nothing.
8190000	8208000	Yes, the game is going to be on a blu-ray disc that's 50 gigs. Can I tell you this shit right now? At least 40 of those gigs is going to be the graphical content anyway, and the rest is going to be the storyline, so they're not going to be able to fit everything in there, even after you install it onto the console.
8208000	8216000	I'm sorry, I love this zinger too much from our chat room. Bobby Blackwolf says, Final Fantasy 7 is going to be recast with all women confirmed.
8217000	8224000	Well, I mean, Takara Zuka is quite popular. I mean, look at the Sailor Moon musicals. I mean, come on.
8224000	8230000	But on a related note, can we talk about the most overrated movie from my childhood, by the way?
8230000	8231000	What is it?
8231000	8232000	Ghostbusters.
8232000	8245000	Okay, we're not going to go down that road. We're not going to go down that road. You're on my personal Facebook. You already know my opinion of what that is, and it's legitimate.
8245000	8251000	I'm sorry. I know I'm going to hurt some feelings. I know some panties are going to get bunched, but I just think...
8251000	8254000	I have Ghostbusters movies on laserdisc.
8254000	8262000	I kind of think it's an overrated movie. I'm sorry. I don't think it's that great. I think I could name 10 other movies from the 80s that I remember better.
8262000	8265000	We can start with Gremlins. But anyway...
8266000	8275000	If you're saying that Ghostbusters is overrated, I'm going to say that Legend of Zelda, the one for the N64...
8275000	8278000	Can I remember the name? Because I just bought it. Here we go. Overrated time.
8278000	8279000	Overrated time.
8279000	8282000	And my first mask. Both of those games were overrated as fuck.
8282000	8284000	Exactly! They were the...
8284000	8286000	Guess what? I agree with you.
8287000	8289000	Try again, asshole.
8289000	8291000	You're a dick.
8291000	8301000	Well, I will say... Wait, wait. Put that... Keyboard warriors, stop typing. Hold on, hold on. Here's the thing.
8301000	8308000	I've grown to understand more after time has passed why people feel so strongly about Ogreen of Time as they do.
8308000	8311000	Keep in mind... Walk a mile in my shoes for a minute.
8311000	8319000	I had to go from Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, to the Ogreen of Time.
8319000	8325000	And that whole 2D to 3D thing did not sit well with me and a lot of gamers of mine.
8325000	8327000	So anyway...
8327000	8333000	Okay, Brad from Pod Culture says Mass Effect is overrated. Now you're just trying to hurt.
8333000	8338000	I mean, not for nothing. I mean, he kinda has a point.
8338000	8342000	No, now you're just trying to be mean. Now you're just trying to be mean.
8342000	8346000	Come on, Rob. You kinda opened the door on that.
8346000	8354000	Alright, look, look. I didn't even get to say this. As much as I said all that stuff about the movie, two things.
8354000	8357000	The Stafe Puff Marshmallow Man is pretty rad. I'll give you that.
8357000	8360000	And the video game kicked ass.
8360000	8363000	And that's what I remember fondly.
8363000	8369000	And maybe that's why I feel the way I do, is that for me, Ghostbusters was never about the movie, it was about the game. For me.
8369000	8371000	But that's me.
8371000	8376000	Anyway, wow, we got from Final Fantasy 7 to Ghostbusters and it's all thanks to Bobby Black Wolf.
8376000	8379000	Somebody had to fire that shot.
8379000	8387000	I'm not the one that put the .357 in his hand. All I know is he had bullets.
8387000	8390000	Guns don't kill people, Rama. I kill people.
8391000	8398000	Oh, God. Now, now, now, now. You shoot like a stormtrooper, man. We're all gonna live. We're good.
8398000	8402000	Alright, I am now removing you from the program.
8402000	8407000	No, did you have anything else? Oh, seriously, did you have anything else you wanted to get out there before we let you go?
8407000	8412000	Oh, no, no. I just want my thoughts on the whole FF7 thing. People just need to calm down, enjoy it.
8412000	8417000	You're gonna get more of the lore and questions are going to be answered.
8417000	8421000	And if that's not enough, go fuck yourself.
8421000	8425000	I mean, really. These companies are giving, they're doing what they can.
8425000	8431000	If that's not enough, you can just go make your own opinion, have your own little fart circle, you know?
8431000	8437000	And then be like, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah. And then they'll be like, you know what, you're wrong, here's a middle finger, have a nice day.
8440000	8442000	Hey, no, I'm right.
8442000	8445000	And if you don't like it, go fuck yourself.
8446000	8449000	I'm gonna put that on my car, too.
8449000	8453000	I'm gonna get pulled over by all the cops. Anyway.
8455000	8462000	I agree. Everybody needs to calm their tits. The game isn't even, like, we don't even have the first gameplay demo of the game.
8462000	8466000	Everybody needs to calm down until we actually get to play the game. And then we can start to make decisions.
8466000	8474000	I will say this, though, as a bit of an aside, because again, this is the week we were gone, but the Final Fantasy XV demo...
8474000	8475000	Yeah, that was pretty good.
8475000	8477000	I don't know how many of you guys checked that out, but...
8477000	8479000	I forgot the mention I played.
8479000	8483000	Wait, wait, wait, FFXV, you mean Bros in the Hood? Okay.
8483000	8487000	No, this is more like, it's Kingdom Hearts, but it's not Kingdom Hearts.
8487000	8493000	Yeah, right? I was like, oh my god, I'm playing Kingdom Hearts 3, especially the level with the bricks and all that stuff.
8493000	8501000	But when I saw that trailer, I cackled when I saw the theme song was Stand By Me for, like, the four dudes on the bro trip, right?
8501000	8506000	But then I also had feels, because I'm like, oh my god, Florence and the Machine? Like, that woman is fucking perfect.
8506000	8509000	They're gonna totally poke a dead dude.
8509000	8512000	Brofancy XV.
8512000	8519000	That's gonna be one of the first battles, you know what, teaching you the battle system and everything?
8519000	8525000	It's gonna be a dead dude, your weapon's gonna be a stick, you're gonna have poke. Or run.
8526000	8533000	If you have not seen the gif of the dudes in the car, is Sephiroth trolling alongside them? I don't know. I don't know.
8533000	8545000	I'm willing to give the game a chance. Alan Alchemy in chat says, if the remake isn't up to snuff, they can just go write 500 more pages of fanfic, making it how they want it, like they've been doing since 1997.
8545000	8551000	Exactly! Alan Alchemy, he nailed it. That's exactly what it is. There you go.
8551000	8553000	There's a reason why I keep that man close.
8553000	8558000	As long as we can get some Haddaway in the car, and get them all head bobbing.
8558000	8560000	Has somebody done that YouTube yet?
8560000	8563000	I think, probably. Internet, don't let me down.
8563000	8566000	I'm pretty sure that's probably in existence already.
8566000	8568000	Rom, I gotta let you go to free up the line.
8568000	8572000	If it's not a YouTube video, give it a year, it'll be an anime con.
8572000	8575000	Awesome. Can't wait. Front row seat. Alright, take care my friend.
8575000	8577000	YouTube, bro. Bye. Bye.
8578000	8583000	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8583000	8586000	We're getting another call, coming in right now. Let's get to it.
8586000	8588000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8588000	8589000	Hey, Rom!
8589000	8591000	It's Marissa, isn't it?
8591000	8594000	Yes, it is. How you doing?
8594000	8596000	Good, these are my favorite phone calls. What's up, Marissa?
8596000	8597000	Marissa!
8597000	8599000	Hi, kids! How's it going?
8599000	8602000	Good. It would be better if you were here, but I understand.
8603000	8611000	Yeah, dammit. I have a nicer car, but now I only get 22 miles a gallon, so it's very painful to look at that drive.
8611000	8614000	Travel and six hour drive. Well, what's on your mind?
8614000	8615000	I'm sorry?
8615000	8617000	What's on your mind?
8617000	8625000	I was calling to say hello. I guess you weren't able to make it to WonderCon this year, but that was a blast. That was a lot of fun.
8625000	8630000	Hopefully, you're gonna come down. I'm gonna just invent a convention for you guys to come down for.
8630000	8638000	I love that idea. And actually, a friend of mine, a really good friend of mine, Victoria, was that, for those of you that listen to guys on the show, she was on episode four.
8638000	8652000	I'm gonna call it fanfic, because I've actually written fanfic in my head where you and Victoria are friends, because you were both at WonderCon, and you probably even saw each other.
8652000	8656000	She was dressed as some Disney princess every day. No, she was dressed as the-
8656000	8657000	She was Lottie. She did Lottie.
8657000	8661000	She did Lottie, she did the wench from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. And that's my favorite.
8661000	8662000	The redhead.
8662000	8663000	The redhead.
8663000	8672000	Marissa, if you come to Disneyland on my- I should say California Adventure on my birthday, or for my birthday, which is- I'm gonna be there on May 1st, so I won't be on the show, Rob, sorry.
8672000	8675000	Just tell all the listeners where to find you.
8675000	8679000	But Victoria will be there, and you two can meet, and the world can explode.
8679000	8680000	I would love that.
8681000	8698000	You know, actually, I do think I saw her, because I had another friend who was cosplaying as Ariel when she had legs, and there was, like, Disney princess or Disney-related people taking pictures, and the obligatory, you know, redheaded cosplay, so I dug out the Jessica Rabbit outfit, although I did not wear that on the subway. I brought a change of clothes.
8698000	8701000	That would have made for some interesting stories, though.
8701000	8709000	Now, Victoria has done a Jessica Rabbit at Rocky Horror Picture Show, so you guys have, like, a thing. You have the Jessica Rabbit thing.
8709000	8713000	If you have enough bust and red hair, like, you know, you have certain options of, you know-
8713000	8715000	Really? Because I haven't tried yet, but maybe I should.
8718000	8736000	I also thought of you two because I mentioned a certain program, I don't know if you're familiar with, I probably shouldn't, like, crap on them, but I was going to a comedy show, and I guess that they made the front room, which didn't used to be a room, at the place where all the stand-ups were going to see.
8736000	8750000	I know if anyone here knows Mike Polk, Jr., he does a lot of stuff on YouTube, I love him. All of a sudden we're sitting in the main room, and they're playing video games, and 40 minutes, like, into it, we realized, this isn't that the other show is running long, this is the show.
8751000	8766000	And I was like, oh my God! I thought of you guys, though, because although they have a large amount of success, it was not entertaining, and I wasn't being like, you know, like, Grandma, I don't understand these kids and their video game shows. No, it wasn't, you know, witty or entertaining.
8767000	8786000	You know, like, your ability to project, you know, to play video games in a comedy club, that's funny, but I mean, that's a fun idea, but you still have to, you know, be entertaining. So, that was, I guess that's the new craze of entertainment right here, like, you have a successful enough channel, you know, you rent out the various venues.
8786000	8799000	There's always gonna be that thing that so many people are into, like a TV show or a movie or something, and you're that asshole sitting in the back corner going, I don't get it. Like, literally the phone call we just took, Marissa.
8800000	8820000	Well, yeah, it's funny, because I'm not like one of those grandmas, because I know so many people that complain about Let's Plays and things like that, and I enjoy them, and I see why you like to share that experience. I see why when you have your friends together, and you're playing video game challenges together, you know, why that can be funny, but if you actually got, like, a bunch of really good comedians together, or even you guys, you're so funny, and did the same thing, it would be entertaining.
8820000	8836000	But nowadays, it's just like if you have an impressive amount of metrics, you know, and followers, that, like, the actual part of being entertaining doesn't matter. It's like one of those things where people are there taking pictures of themselves at the event to impress their friends more than the event.
8837000	8844000	I personally believe this, and not everybody agrees with me, but I really feel like the best Let's Plays are where the video game is secondary.
8845000	8848000	Yeah, you still have to have an interesting perspective, yeah.
8848000	8861000	Yeah, the video game, it's like an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway, where the video game is just kind of the device, it's that prop, but it's really the funny people and the personalities that make it great.
8862000	8872000	Which actually makes me think, I would love nothing more than for, like, Ryan Stiles, Colin Mockery, Wayne Brady, and Greg Proops to, like, have a Let's Play channel.
8873000	8875000	Like, how is that not a thing?
8875000	8883000	Well, you know that somehow Patton Oswalt, given that he is so certifiably, you know, geeky himself, he somehow has to slip in there who's lying credit or not.
8884000	8885000	It's true.
8886000	8887000	His channel would be awesome, too.
8888000	8889000	That would be awesome.
8890000	8892000	That would be hilarious. I'm gonna go see him this week, too. Yay, we love Greg Proops.
8893000	8895000	Yeah, well, give him a big hug for me, because that man is awesome.
8895000	8905000	Marissa, I swear I'm gonna find a reason to come to LA soon. You know, a lot of people have been saying I should go to DragCon, because that is, like, the week after Dark Soccer's gonna be there.
8906000	8908000	In fact, I'm kind of surprised she didn't push her whole trip back a week to go to DragCon.
8909000	8910000	What? I didn't even know.
8911000	8912000	Yeah, RuPaul's DragCon is gonna be-
8913000	8914000	I can't take Dan to that, though.
8915000	8916000	Well, you could.
8917000	8918000	I want Dan to be there for my birthday thing.
8919000	8920000	But anyway-
8920000	8925000	I'm glad you have to, and I was talking earlier about taking the subway and how I didn't want to wear my Jessica Rabbit outfit, you know, because you don't have to worry about parking.
8926000	8930000	That is a day where I would want to just sit and watch people on the subway. That would be an interesting day.
8931000	8939000	What I'm trying to do with the new job, I don't have as much time off, because it's a new job. Like, my last job I was at for 14 years, so I had a lot of time off available by the 14th year, right?
8940000	8947000	So this new job, I don't have a lot of time off right now, but I'm trying to save pretty good, so that way in the coming years, I'll have a little extra time to do more,
8947000	8952000	Hey, let's go to Disneyland this weekend, type of trips, because right now I have to plan everything in advance.
8953000	8954000	Okay, well yay!
8955000	8961000	Alright, well Marissa, my dear, I'm gonna let you go so we can get one more call and then probably wrap up the show.
8962000	8969000	Okay, so maybe now I can actually eat and maybe bathe myself, since I've had this brief respite in between playing Stardew Valley, so that's good. Thank you.
8970000	8971000	Oh my god, are you obsessed with Stardew Valley?
8971000	8981000	Actually, I was, like, my boyfriend was wondering if he was gonna have to have an intervention until the latest update, my computer's a piece of crap. Made it too slow.
8982000	8992000	For what it's worth, Marissa, you're not alone. Like, Stardew Valley is like the new Minecraft, Five Nights, it's the new indie darling that people are obsessed with.
8993000	8994000	The first step is that you have a problem.
8995000	8996000	I get it.
8997000	8998000	Thank you so much.
8999000	9002000	Marissa, my dream is that we're gonna do a Let's Play someday for Stardew Valley. That's my dream.
9003000	9005000	Yes! We must make this happen.
9006000	9007000	Alright.
9008000	9009000	Alright, take care, my dear.
9010000	9015000	Alright, that is the lovely and talented Marissa calling us there on the Skype line, we'd love to hear from her.
9016000	9023000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, I'll give it just a minute there to see if any more calls creep in there.
9023000	9032000	While we wait to see if any calls come in here at the last minute, I just want to express again my jealousy of Dar Sakura getting to go to Disneyland, or excuse me, California Adventure.
9033000	9035000	But no, you know what, it's your birthday, you earned it.
9036000	9037000	Well, yeah, cause, you know, I grew.
9038000	9042000	I'm a little sad about your party, but I understand, don't get me wrong.
9043000	9049000	Well, that and, like, only, like, eight people said they could make it, and then I had another, like, feud to say they couldn't.
9049000	9052000	Girl, it only takes one person to make a party, and he's sitting right here.
9053000	9054000	Well, but I'm still gonna...
9055000	9056000	I can't come. I'm sorry.
9057000	9061000	I figured we could maybe do something on the show next week instead.
9062000	9065000	We could, we could look at doing something like that, we could get a cake, would Becky make a cake?
9066000	9068000	Becky, if you're listening, make me a cake!
9069000	9071000	Actually, that's super rude of me to volunteer her like that, but...
9072000	9073000	I volunteer Becky for stuff all the time.
9074000	9078000	For what it's worth, when I think of yummy cakes, I think of Becky, so take it as a compliment.
9079000	9083000	That's it. Becky, your nickname now forever and ever is gonna be Tasty Cakes.
9084000	9086000	Sorry, I do have a last minute story real quick.
9087000	9090000	Fine. We were gonna talk about cake, but we were gonna talk about a story.
9091000	9092000	Hey, I'm putting this train back on the rails, so...
9093000	9094000	Sorry, go ahead.
9095000	9102000	So, there's a company called Precision Syndicate LLC, and they're a gun manufacturer, and yes, they made a handgun that resembles a Nintendo Zapper.
9102000	9108000	Okay, I don't like that you're bringing this up for Dark Sakura's birthday, because you know she'll be like, I want a gun.
9109000	9110000	It's pretty awesome, actually.
9111000	9112000	No, I don't want a gun.
9113000	9115000	No, it does, I, as much as...
9116000	9117000	Maybe the Nintendo-themed Glock.
9118000	9119000	That is a Nintendo thing, but yeah.
9120000	9121000	But I don't want a gun.
9122000	9125000	You all know how I feel about guns, but when I do look at that Nintendo gun, I'm like, okay.
9125000	9135000	You know what surprised me, actually? Because we get advertisements for a gun store nearby, and they sell handguns and assault rifles.
9136000	9144000	And I was like, dude, their guns are the same price as airsoft guns. Airsoft guns cost the same amount of money as a real gun.
9145000	9146000	What the fuck?
9147000	9148000	That's what I wanted to know.
9149000	9151000	Guns are accessible, what can we say?
9152000	9154000	I guess it's all the ammo that you have to pay for as well.
9155000	9156000	BBs are a lot cheaper.
9157000	9161000	That's true. Alright, well sadly the phone does not appear to be lighting up, so I'm going to go ahead and shut it down.
9162000	9166000	But if you do have anything you want to tell us for consideration in a future episode, please feel free to email us.
9167000	9170000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to participate with the show.
9171000	9175000	Thanks again to all you guys who have listened to the show tonight. Thanks to everybody participating in our chat room.
9176000	9181000	Thanks to everybody listening to us on podcast land or streaming radio, wherever it is that you're listening to the show.
9182000	9183000	Thanks for supporting the show.
9183000	9192000	Thanks again. I can't say this enough, and I don't even know if they'll hear this, but I just want to say thanks again to Gabe and Brie for including us as part of the Sac Indie Gaming Expo.
9193000	9200000	Yesterday was a fantastic thing. It was really truly an honor to be a part of it, and who knows, we may have even got some new listeners from that whole thing.
9201000	9207000	Actually, I can say this. I think I'm okay to talk about this. We met another local podcast there.
9207000	9212000	We met the guys from Video Game Bang, which, by the way, I still love that name.
9213000	9221000	And we are talking about Crossover Weekend. So, we're going to go there and they're going to come here. That's going to happen at some point.
9222000	9229000	And it's going to be neat because, you know, they're very, and if you heard their panel, you know, they're kind of different gamers than we are.
9230000	9235000	They play different stuff and they're into different things. When the Pokémon questions came up, they looked at us.
9235000	9242000	But then there's certain things I'm sure that they're into that we would go, huh? So, we're going to have a fun weekend whenever we get that planned.
9243000	9244000	That'll be in the coming weeks, so that'll be fun.
9245000	9249000	Alright, but in the meantime, we've got to shut it down for this week. Thanks again, everybody, for listening.
9250000	9254000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, as I always say, tell a friend or two or twenty about the show.
9255000	9261000	Help us spread the word. This is a show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't get the voices out there if they're not out there listening to it.
9261000	9266000	So, your word of mouth and your referrals, your reviews on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.
9267000	9270000	Those five-star reviews go a long way and we really appreciate each and every one of them, so thank you.
9271000	9277000	If you take thirty seconds right now to write a nice five-star review, it would go a long way and we'd really, really appreciate that.
9278000	9283000	Meantime, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Loki, good job after a month off.
9284000	9285000	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9285000	9292000	I hope to work more on my game. It's just been really tired when we get home.
9293000	9298000	So I sit there, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to totally work on it. And then I watch YouTube videos instead, so.
9299000	9307000	I'm trying not to do that. I'm trying. It's just not happening. Brain doesn't want to do what I want to do.
9308000	9317000	I have like a mental block right now. It's like I have, I'm rewriting, because I went back to my original project that I started, like the first, first project that I was starting.
9318000	9325000	And I'm redoing everything on it. But I haven't worked on it so long, I don't know where to start, and I need to redo it all again.
9326000	9330000	So I kind of have to figure out how I need to redo it so it actually works better. And that's taking time.
9331000	9333000	You can do it. I believe in you.
9333000	9337000	Alright, Dar Sakura, your final thoughts tonight? Two things. Number one.
9338000	9340000	Number one, I regret that burrito.
9341000	9342000	That was a big burrito.
9343000	9344000	That was a fucking huge burrito.
9345000	9346000	But it looked like a delicious burrito.
9347000	9349000	It was the only thing I've had to eat today other than oatmeal.
9350000	9358000	I had a burrito in Tucson. I just wanted to share. You know, I never eat burritos. I was so fucking hungry after that Ingress May.
9359000	9360000	And you put something big, thick and meaty in your mouth.
9361000	9362000	You know it, girl.
9363000	9374000	After six hours in the sun, while I was hungover, after seeing, thank you very much, drag queens, the night before, playing Ingress for six hours in the sun, I was like,
9375000	9377000	Alan, I want a fucking burrito.
9380000	9381000	I'm proud of you.
9382000	9383000	Number two.
9384000	9385000	Uh.
9391000	9396000	I know you are not a big fan of the video thing, but I swear to God, we need to look at doing something like that.
9397000	9399000	That's what, well, funny that you mention that.
9400000	9405000	I, the thing that I kept trying to talk to you about yesterday, that was it.
9407000	9410000	So, we have to talk about it.
9413000	9418000	Alright, my final thought tonight is my back is being a jerk again.
9419000	9423000	So, I think I'm gonna do what I did last night and vegetate to MMOs and feel sorry about my life.
9424000	9425000	Oh, and feel like garbage.
9426000	9427000	Are your lovely lady lumps too lumpy?
9428000	9432000	My lovely lady back, apparently, are my humps in my back.
9433000	9435000	You know what, I don't want to think about that.
9436000	9437000	We're out of here. Goodnight everybody.
9438000	9439000	We will see you in seven days. We'll do this all over again.
9439000	9445000	Have a great week. We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Goodnight.
9469000	9471000	See you next week.
9499000	9509000	Thanks for watching!
