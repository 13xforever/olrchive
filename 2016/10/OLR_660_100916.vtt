00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
This week, we're back from another round of conventions as we wind down the year, and

00:17.000 --> 00:20.440
how better than to come back to the imminent release of PlayStation VR with a healthy lineup

00:20.440 --> 00:21.440
of launch titles.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.480
We'll give you the wrap-up and the rundown of this and plenty more news, and it all starts

00:24.480 --> 00:27.500
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.500
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.500 --> 00:34.740
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.740 --> 00:36.420
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.420 --> 00:42.820
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 660 for this October the 9th

00:42.820 --> 00:44.700
of 2016.

00:44.700 --> 00:49.420
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live here from Sacramento, California, where we are

00:49.420 --> 00:53.360
headquartered and here with me in studio as he is every week.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.100
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.100
Hello.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.100
How are you?

00:57.100 --> 00:58.100
I'm good.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.100
Good.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.100
I heard your Twitter got hacked today.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.100
What's up with that?

01:01.100 --> 01:02.100
I don't know.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.100
That was weird.

01:03.100 --> 01:10.420
Yeah, there's some account posted on my thing, and I was notified about it like a few minutes

01:10.420 --> 01:11.420
later.

01:11.420 --> 01:12.420
What were they spamming?

01:12.420 --> 01:15.420
I don't know.

01:15.420 --> 01:20.180
It was like trying to lure someone to click the link with sexy pictures, but honestly,

01:20.180 --> 01:24.060
from my standards, it wasn't sexy enough.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.500
There was no boobies there.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.300
I mean, there is lingerie and that's classy, I guess, but I'm not classy guy.

01:30.300 --> 01:36.420
So you know, if someone's going to hack it, then I better see like full frontal.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.420
Come on.

01:37.420 --> 01:40.440
You wasted all this time to hack the password or something.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.140
And this is what you put up there.

01:42.140 --> 01:43.140
Come on.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.140
Don't waste my time.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.020
I mean, that's just it's stupid.

01:46.020 --> 01:50.020
But you you were on it and you fixed it, but that's you said you had to factor off on your

01:50.020 --> 01:51.020
account, right?

01:51.020 --> 01:52.020
Yeah, I had it.

01:52.020 --> 01:57.060
I turn it on whenever they add stuff like to the social networks, I always turn on like

01:57.060 --> 02:01.540
day one, like or whenever I first hear about it, that that's supposed to make your account

02:01.540 --> 02:02.620
like an iron fortress.

02:02.620 --> 02:03.620
So that right.

02:03.620 --> 02:08.060
And well, it was weird, though, because when I went to go and change the password, it was

02:08.060 --> 02:09.060
off.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.060
Two Factor was off.

02:10.060 --> 02:12.360
So I was like, well, weird.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.120
So they could, you know, most of the time with these Twitter hacks is that these just

02:15.120 --> 02:19.420
social engineering or they even go to the extent of like cloning your phone and logging

02:19.420 --> 02:23.580
in with your mobile, which they didn't do that with mine, because why would you do that

02:23.580 --> 02:24.580
with mine?

02:24.580 --> 02:25.580
Really?

02:25.580 --> 02:26.980
I mean, come on.

02:26.980 --> 02:27.980
That's just stupid.

02:27.980 --> 02:33.500
But yeah, I saw a log in attempt also on the VOG Minecraft one as well, which is also that

02:33.500 --> 02:37.420
would just be absolutely pointless since I don't use it anymore.

02:37.420 --> 02:38.900
So who cares?

02:38.900 --> 02:39.900
All right.

02:39.900 --> 02:43.260
Well, I'm glad you got everything fixed on your account and you took down the not so

02:43.260 --> 02:45.100
sexy pictures that somebody posted.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.100
Yeah.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.100
I, you know, it was disappointing.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.660
I mean, just.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.660
Yeah.

02:50.660 --> 02:54.860
Oh, anyway, not here tonight, of course, still on a break from the show Dark Sakura, but

02:54.860 --> 02:58.220
we will be hearing from her later and during our classic game of the week, thanks to the

02:58.220 --> 03:00.900
magic of radio, Dark Sakura should be joining us.

03:00.900 --> 03:04.680
We're hoping she's going to be able to join us for a tape show in November.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.740
So still a little ways out, but we miss Dark Sakura, but thankful she can still be on the

03:08.740 --> 03:11.920
show, at least in part through the classic game of the week.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.620
Coming up tonight on the show, we have an interview.

03:13.620 --> 03:18.840
Very excited to welcome Ryan from Retro Dreamer Studios, which is making the game Monsters

03:18.840 --> 03:22.160
and Monocles available right now on Steam Greenlight.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.060
Loki and I played this game like for the first time a couple of years ago.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.060
Yeah, a couple of years ago.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.060
Yeah.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.060
One of the SAC Indie arcade events.

03:28.060 --> 03:31.500
But this is, you know, and you might think, oh, Indie game means, you know, I'm not going

03:31.500 --> 03:35.180
to see a lot of it out there, but that's quite not the case with this game.

03:35.180 --> 03:39.340
I mean, not only is it on the Steam early access, but they have announced they're going

03:39.340 --> 03:40.540
to be on PlayStation four as well.

03:40.540 --> 03:44.500
And there's a lovely cut trailer that PlayStation has on the official channel and everything

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
coverage on it.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.500
Yeah.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.500
The media and stuff.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
And so it looks, I mean, it's a good game.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.860
It was good a couple of years ago, so excited to welcome Ryan here live in about 20 minutes

03:53.860 --> 03:54.860
or so.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.100
And if you guys have played the game and have any questions, or if you haven't played the

03:57.100 --> 04:00.380
game, you still have questions, you'll be, you'll be able to ask those live in our chat

04:00.380 --> 04:04.520
room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

04:04.520 --> 04:08.540
Eastern at the voice of geeks network, vog network.com.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.380
And if you are listening to our show, you can participate live, uh, with our chat room,

04:12.380 --> 04:14.260
live dot vog network.com.

04:14.260 --> 04:17.940
And if you guys could do me a favor tonight, I know there's a lot of stuff going on in

04:17.940 --> 04:19.580
the real world outside this show.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.220
Um, thank you guys for choosing to, uh, listen to OLR live tonight or in podcast form.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.820
You know, I appreciate you every either way, but since I do have to read comments on the

04:27.820 --> 04:31.940
fly, uh, try not to fill up the chat room with talk about politics tonight.

04:31.940 --> 04:36.100
Uh, there's other, you go to Twitter politics, there's politics going on.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.940
Don't worry about it.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.980
Is the orange fair going to say some weird stuff again, because I'm totally down with

04:41.980 --> 04:42.980
that.

04:42.980 --> 04:43.980
Here's, here's the thing.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.500
Next week on, is it next week or the week after I've checked our calendar, but I think

04:46.500 --> 04:48.060
it's next week on OLR.

04:48.060 --> 04:52.420
We actually have cat president developers that game are on the show.

04:52.420 --> 04:56.380
Uh, so, um, and I'll, I'll check the calendar during the break tonight and double check

04:56.380 --> 04:57.380
the week.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.760
Um, but politics will be permissible when we're talking about president cap.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.020
That's the only time you can, uh, break that rule.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.020
So thank you guys.

05:05.060 --> 05:10.220
Uh, but we do have, uh, some on topic comments here in chat, uh, from Bobby Black Wolf saying,

05:10.220 --> 05:14.160
uh, it might've been an authorized app that hacked.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.380
So if you had like something tied to your Twitter, that was the next thing I was gonna

05:17.380 --> 05:18.380
look at.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.380
Right.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.380
Yeah.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.760
I think it's always a good idea to clean that stuff out once in a while too.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.920
And the biggest offenders are those fricking quiz apps like, and I don't know if you even

05:27.920 --> 05:29.100
know I don't do that.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.460
Some people do like the whole, what, which, which one of the mean girls are you?

05:33.900 --> 05:38.660
If it did any of that, that would be Facebook because you know, that's where you're taking

05:38.660 --> 05:39.660
quizzes.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.660
I don't do that on Twitter.

05:40.660 --> 05:43.300
Twitter is pretty lean, but some of that shows up on Twitter.

05:43.300 --> 05:48.020
I know I've used some of those like track who follows and unfollows you on Twitter just

05:48.020 --> 05:53.740
because you know, if a lot of times people follow to inflate their number account or

05:53.740 --> 05:56.260
their, their follower numbers and they immediately unfollow.

05:56.260 --> 06:00.420
So I do use one of those programs to kind of like catch those people cause I'm pretty

06:00.420 --> 06:02.060
good about following people back.

06:02.060 --> 06:05.920
If you're just a spam bot, I'm not interested in following celebrities.

06:05.920 --> 06:12.100
Some celebrities that I like, you know, on TV and stuff, but if they post a lot or repost

06:12.100 --> 06:16.580
or, you know, forward a lot, I kind of have to take them off.

06:16.580 --> 06:19.780
And then going to another real world thing I want to address here real quick before we

06:19.780 --> 06:20.980
get into some games.

06:20.980 --> 06:25.180
Tiger Claw in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, the whole week with Hurricane

06:25.180 --> 06:27.100
Matthew was uneventful for me.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.980
You put on the hurricane shutters and anticipating the storm only to find out it never touched

06:30.980 --> 06:31.980
down in South Florida.

06:31.980 --> 06:34.300
I'm very thankful that didn't have an effect on you.

06:34.300 --> 06:40.060
I really hope our listeners in Florida have similar stories to what you have.

06:40.060 --> 06:43.660
So you know, I was thinking of y'all this week cause I know we've, we've got a few listeners

06:43.660 --> 06:48.140
in Florida and that were in the area that could have potentially been impacted.

06:48.140 --> 06:52.180
So I'm really, I'm hoping you all have stories like Tiger Claw out there.

06:52.180 --> 06:55.860
So yeah, stay safe you guys.

06:55.860 --> 07:00.020
So anyway, I think, I think we want to start off tonight by getting into some of the news

07:00.060 --> 07:05.060
from last week that we missed, um, with our kickoff topic tonight.

07:05.060 --> 07:08.140
First off though, let me just kind of ask Loki with no, with no show last week.

07:08.140 --> 07:11.300
I mean, I'll talk about gamer X here in a minute, which is where I was at, but how was

07:11.300 --> 07:14.220
your, how was your weekend off with no show last week?

07:14.220 --> 07:19.700
It was never a weekend off, but it was just, um, I just went and played Ingress.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.220
I was going to do something like normally like when I have a night off like that, I'll

07:23.220 --> 07:26.980
try to go see a movie or something, but there wasn't anything good playing at all.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.820
And it was just, no.

07:28.820 --> 07:33.460
Um, so I decided that I was going to probably just play Ingress and I had actually more

07:33.460 --> 07:36.500
than I wanted to do, um, but I just didn't get it done.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.980
So I hung out with some of the people that are around here and, um, played a little bit

07:40.980 --> 07:43.100
Ingress on my way home and that was it.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.780
Surprisingly that went, the time went by really fast, so.

07:45.780 --> 07:46.780
Good deal.

07:46.780 --> 07:47.780
But yeah.

07:47.780 --> 07:48.780
Um, yeah.

07:48.780 --> 07:53.300
Uh, well I was at gamer X, uh, this is the fourth year of gamer X. Dark Soccer was there

07:53.300 --> 07:54.300
with me.

07:54.300 --> 07:59.060
We were staffing the vog table, uh, cause we were a, uh, what do they call the intro

07:59.060 --> 08:00.060
level sponsor?

08:00.060 --> 08:01.060
Like eight, eight bit sponsor.

08:01.060 --> 08:04.340
I think we were, uh, voice East network was, so we were there.

08:04.340 --> 08:08.940
Uh, also our pals, uh, captain spike and first make slide kick from game buoy were there.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.420
X differ from guys on a show is there.

08:10.420 --> 08:13.420
So there was, you know, a few shows on our network were represented there at gamer X.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.740
Uh, and if anybody is listening to OLR for the first time, because they met us at the

08:16.740 --> 08:17.740
table.

08:17.740 --> 08:18.740
Hello.

08:18.740 --> 08:19.740
And thank you for checking it out.

08:19.740 --> 08:20.740
Really appreciate it.

08:20.740 --> 08:21.740
Um, real quick.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.720
Our show was friends that came together.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.520
We all used to play dance, dance revolution and music based games at the arcade.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.960
And there was a real sense of community that was built around that.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.400
So we kind of took that community outside the arcade onto the internet and that that's

08:34.400 --> 08:38.380
the community that's kind of continuing today, even though we don't necessarily focus on

08:38.380 --> 08:39.920
music games per se.

08:39.920 --> 08:44.000
Um, we certainly, you know, still have a great love of video games in general, especially

08:44.000 --> 08:47.040
niche things that other people miss out on.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.500
Sometimes we really love here.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.400
So that's, that's what all ours all about.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.540
But uh, with gamer X, you know, um, gamer X is a smaller convention.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.680
There's a big focus on panels.

08:56.680 --> 09:01.560
They do a lot of panels on things like diversity and visibility and, you know, sometimes it's

09:01.560 --> 09:06.240
about kind of justifying why there needs to be a gamer X sort of thing, which, you know,

09:06.240 --> 09:10.560
I totally understand as a gay gamer myself, representation and all that is important.

09:10.560 --> 09:14.440
It's really great to see people like yourself in video games.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.400
And that's why it's great that we have all these video games to kind of let you, you

09:17.400 --> 09:19.640
know, do, you know, Bioware games are infamous for this.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.280
They kind of let you do the game that you want to do.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.080
Um, so they, they run a lot of panels and they also, it's not just that, but also kind

09:26.080 --> 09:31.400
of encouraging people to develop because one of the great ways to have representation in

09:31.400 --> 09:36.960
gaming is to encourage more minorities to develop, get out there, make a game.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.440
Um, you know, it's, it's, I know I've had struggles of my own and making a game in the

09:42.440 --> 09:47.240
past, but if I had the time to really sit down and do it, I could make a game.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.920
Loki's been trying on and off over years to make it mentally, I've just not been able

09:50.920 --> 09:52.360
to focus on anything.

09:52.360 --> 09:56.200
It's really frustrating, but if Loki can do it, you can do it.

09:56.200 --> 10:02.400
And so I'm trying, I'm, I just, there's, there's a really big theme about just trying to get

10:02.400 --> 10:07.000
more minorities to participate in, uh, the game making process.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.080
I'm not just talking about gays, I'm talking about, you know, non-binary individuals, transgender

10:13.080 --> 10:17.160
individuals, um, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, you know, I'm talking about

10:17.160 --> 10:22.640
like the gamer X is, uh, really speaks to, I think a lot of different minorities out

10:22.640 --> 10:23.640
there.

10:23.640 --> 10:28.280
Um, and you know, again, I hate that this has to be said, but I feel like it does.

10:28.280 --> 10:33.680
The goal is not to eliminate the white man, the straight white man from video games.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.680
That is not the goal.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.760
Uh, the goal is to add more.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.760
That's what it is.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.760
You just, just add more.

10:40.760 --> 10:45.960
So, um, yeah, I, I feel like it's always the first thing I hear when there's a, you know,

10:45.960 --> 10:49.440
talk about gamer X is where's the straight white man game making expo.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.920
And it's like, you're, you, you aren't unwelcome from gamer X.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.760
Um, they, you know, if you bought a ticket, you get in, um, and you, and you agree to

10:57.760 --> 11:02.440
follow the rules about no harassment and all that stuff, which any con would have anyway.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.440
Back to the game.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.680
So there's a lovely expo hall and we were in this hall and they had some bigger companies

11:07.680 --> 11:11.280
where they're like Intel, which was doing this fun little like photo session.

11:11.280 --> 11:15.640
And, uh, they had some indie games, uh, that were running on Intel hardware that you'd

11:15.640 --> 11:16.640
see at their booth.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.960
Oculus was there, which we talked about a little bit on last week's show, which was

11:19.960 --> 11:24.000
in, or last time we did a show, which was interesting because of, you know, Oculus was

11:24.000 --> 11:27.800
going through their own struggles in the news, um, a couple of weeks ago, but they were there

11:27.800 --> 11:32.360
and they were showing off, um, you know, and I don't think any of the personalities with

11:32.360 --> 11:33.600
Oculus were there.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.760
Um, you know, you certainly weren't going to see Palmer lucky or Zuckerberg or anybody,

11:38.760 --> 11:44.300
you know, they have their team that goes out and does these demos.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.480
So they were there and, you know, so a lot of people got to try Oculus for the first

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
time, which was cool.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.320
Um, let's see who else was like showing a game that was there.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.080
Um, blizzard was doing their job recruitment thing again.

11:55.080 --> 11:59.560
So, um, but there was a lot of indie developers to some of the same people I'd seen the year

11:59.560 --> 12:03.500
before were coming back and they were either showing their game was about to be released

12:03.500 --> 12:07.200
or they were working on a new game now and they were kind of showing that again.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.280
So that was pretty cool.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.160
But um, I had a really good time, you know, it's just, it's just, it's just a fun show

12:12.160 --> 12:16.640
and a great crowd and it's just a very different vibe from a lot of other gaming expos.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.160
Like actually something about gamer X just feels really relaxed and chill to me.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.780
Like there's just something about it where I, it could just like, if I could just kind

12:25.780 --> 12:30.160
of put my finger on why I really like a con like gamer X, they did a thing called the

12:30.160 --> 12:33.440
gamer X slumber party on Friday night.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.680
And all it was was they just took one of their tiny rooms and it was just a chill space.

12:38.680 --> 12:43.560
It was just chill and I loved it because, and it was nothing, it's nothing disgusting

12:43.560 --> 12:45.360
or dirty or awkward or anything like that.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.540
It was just come hang out with nerds.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.800
And some guy was like, I ordered pizza, there's pizza in the back if you want some.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.840
And I actually met like a ton of new people just going to this thing and just chilling

12:53.840 --> 12:55.840
out and everybody was just really cool.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.800
And you know, the, we could instantly bond over nerdy things that we had in common.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.800
And yeah, it was just kind of, I didn't really experience something like that at any of the

13:02.800 --> 13:05.200
other cons I've been to, not to knock the other cons.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.080
There's great things I take from every con, but that was something that felt very unique

13:09.080 --> 13:10.080
to gamer X.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.380
So yeah, it did a lot of great networking with that.

13:13.380 --> 13:16.200
Big thanks to anyone that came out to our panel on Sunday.

13:16.200 --> 13:20.120
We had kind of a smaller room so we couldn't fit a lot of people in there, but I had a

13:20.120 --> 13:23.680
good time and I felt like the panel was well received by the group in there.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.420
And there was a lot of people in there who weren't actually listeners of any of our shows.

13:27.420 --> 13:31.560
They were just kind of curious about podcasting and all that and what it is.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.980
So yeah, hope, hope some folks decided maybe they want to start their own show or, or enjoyed

13:35.980 --> 13:36.980
what they heard here.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.360
Um, so there was that.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.640
And then, uh, gamer X teams up with magfest and they actually had a lot of classic games

13:43.640 --> 13:44.640
there.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.640
They had a whole little arcade with DDR and the star Wars arcade game.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.160
I got to play a little bit.

13:49.160 --> 13:53.320
And um, one night until they closed, cause they had to close convention center space

13:53.320 --> 13:54.320
around midnight.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.760
Um, I was playing super Mario world.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.320
So you want to hear something funny completely off topic here.

13:58.320 --> 14:02.880
Um, so I just realized, or found out the other day that they've opened a classic arcade in

14:02.880 --> 14:03.880
Sutter street.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.440
You're locally in Folsom.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
Really?

14:06.440 --> 14:07.440
Yeah.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.840
Like classic, like old school, like a coin op type place, like a coin op type place.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.840
Hmm.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.840
I thought that was weird.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.840
Yes.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.840
It's like the Sutter street arcade or something like that.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.840
Huh?

14:16.840 --> 14:17.840
Check that out.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.840
Yeah.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.240
I just told some friends to go to coin up this, man, retro games are making a comeback,

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
but that's, that's okay.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.240
Who doesn't love retro games?

14:23.240 --> 14:27.840
I just thought it was interesting to see like an actual arcade opening up.

14:27.840 --> 14:32.840
Um, our pal Bobby Black Wolf is in chat saying, I forget there are people that still have

14:32.840 --> 14:34.360
never heard of a podcast.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.560
Um, yeah, you know, there was a lot of people at gamer X.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.940
I kind of ran into the same thing.

14:38.940 --> 14:43.360
So I know, uh, Bobby was at siege, which was a, like a game developer conference type of

14:43.360 --> 14:44.600
thing in Georgia.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.040
He was there this weekend.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.320
Um, and I was finding the same thing at gamer X.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.660
I was kind of thinking in the back of my mind, like, well with NPR and stuff, everybody's

14:52.660 --> 14:56.580
probably heard of a podcast by now, but no, I found there was a lot of people.

14:56.580 --> 15:01.100
I was kind of having to explain it to like the concept of what it is and why we do it.

15:01.100 --> 15:06.040
Um, for me, I find that a lot of people, and this is what's getting harder and harder.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.860
A lot of people kind of want to know why would they listen to a podcast when they have YouTube

15:09.860 --> 15:14.700
and Twitch these days, which is an interesting issue that our podcasting community is facing

15:14.700 --> 15:22.540
because YouTube has videos that people recorded a while ago that you can watch as well, whereas

15:22.540 --> 15:25.460
we record audio that you can listen to.

15:25.460 --> 15:26.460
Right.

15:26.460 --> 15:27.460
And we're live.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.460
We're fortunate enough to be live.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.220
I mean, there's a lot of podcasts that aren't live that are still worth your time.

15:30.220 --> 15:35.060
Um, but you know, I also kind of tried to solve the thing that sometimes you, you, you

15:35.060 --> 15:37.820
can only have so many of your senses distracted.

15:37.820 --> 15:40.700
Like when you're watching a YouTube or something like that, that's, that's typically all of

15:40.700 --> 15:42.220
your senses being used at once.

15:42.220 --> 15:48.000
But when you're doing a podcast, you can still, and I know I've had people say the weeks that

15:48.000 --> 15:52.240
we don't do OLR, I'm bored Monday at work, which is a huge compliment to me.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.880
Um, but they say, I'm, I listen to you guys at work while I'm doing my data entry job

15:55.880 --> 16:00.920
or my, you know, coding job or whatever it is because they can look and think and type.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.760
You know, it's just the podcast only takes one of their senses.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.020
So that's, that's kind of one way I try to kind of put the podcasting out there is that

16:08.020 --> 16:14.200
sometimes you can't completely devote yourself to entertainment, but you can be entertained

16:14.200 --> 16:15.200
while you're doing other things.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.360
That's like saying, why listen to the radio when you can watch videos on YouTube?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
Yeah, I know.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
I know.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.360
Right.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
But it was interesting.

16:22.360 --> 16:27.560
But, um, I, I, you know, these are, it's, it's one of those things where like, these

16:27.560 --> 16:30.360
are things that I wouldn't hear from our audience.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.840
If I was only to listen to the feedback from the, from the, from our audience, none of

16:34.840 --> 16:37.280
them are going to say, why should I listen to a podcast?

16:37.280 --> 16:38.280
Or what?

16:38.280 --> 16:39.280
Cause they're already listening to a podcast.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
Right.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.280
So these are the things that I get to hear.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.440
Cause you'll crash your car if you're watching a podcast.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.920
So, uh, anyway, um, so yeah, uh, that was, that was gamer X.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.240
Uh, it was a good time, but really chill three days.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.700
The only kind of downside was that the last day, and they know this and there was really

16:57.700 --> 17:02.480
nothing they could have done about it because they announced their expo long before the

17:02.480 --> 17:09.860
NFL announced their schedule and the hotel where gamer X was at, was at the Hyatt, literally

17:09.860 --> 17:13.800
across the street from Levi's stadium where they had the super bowl this year.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.840
Uh, so now the 49ers play there and they were having their, I think it was their first game

17:17.840 --> 17:19.320
there against the Cowboys.

17:19.320 --> 17:22.880
Um, and I wouldn't have known that normally, but it was everywhere.

17:22.880 --> 17:27.720
Uh, so, uh, they were playing their game there and I didn't realize how many people come

17:27.720 --> 17:32.140
to the hotel across the street from the stadium to watch the game.

17:32.140 --> 17:34.720
And so their bar was completely taken over by football people.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.720
Yeah.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.960
I thought that was weird too.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.960
You're almost there.

17:37.960 --> 17:38.960
Keep going.

17:38.960 --> 17:39.960
I don't know.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.080
So I don't know, but it's like, I'm almost like I'm right there.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
Maybe so they can go home.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.440
Maybe they can go join in the tailgate parties or something with the Niners loss.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.360
So I don't know what parties tailgating would be nice.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.360
Yeah.

17:51.360 --> 17:57.080
But anyway, uh, it was, unfortunately it caused some conflict and uh, I heard that a slur

17:57.080 --> 18:00.280
got hurled at somebody, uh, which isn't very nice.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.880
Um, but I did think it was kind of interesting because, um, when the football fans on the

18:04.880 --> 18:09.000
lower level would cheer and they would go, yeah, well, you know, whenever the, uh, things

18:09.000 --> 18:12.300
would score the tabletop gamers were on the mezzanine.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.680
So like the second floor.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.800
So somebody that, and this all happened while the OLR or the VOG network panel was happening

18:18.800 --> 18:19.800
in the room.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.860
Um, so we didn't see any of this like happening until we walked out and it was already going

18:24.860 --> 18:25.860
on.

18:25.860 --> 18:29.760
So what would happen is that the, the dude bros would cheer on the first level whenever

18:29.760 --> 18:32.340
something happened in the football game and they go, yeah.

18:32.340 --> 18:37.460
And then everybody up on the second floor, yes, they started, everybody just started

18:37.460 --> 18:39.740
going yes.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.820
And it was like, I died laughing the first time I heard that.

18:42.820 --> 18:46.900
So that became the, it was like the, the dueling cheers that would go back and forth.

18:46.900 --> 18:51.100
And I just, I, I like cried from laughing so hard when that was going on.

18:51.100 --> 18:57.840
So, um, you know, it's unfortunate that the safe space that gamer X tries to create got

18:57.840 --> 19:02.920
punctured a little bit with a very angry drunken individual that said something that they really

19:02.920 --> 19:06.220
should not say at a convention dedicated to this.

19:06.220 --> 19:11.620
Um, but you know, I felt otherwise they did the, the gamer X folks did the best job they

19:11.620 --> 19:14.300
could making lemonade out of lemons, so to speak.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.520
So anyway, uh, so that was, uh, yeah, that was, that was gamer X.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.780
I had a really good time.

19:19.780 --> 19:23.660
Uh, anyway, uh, we're just a few minutes out from my getting Ryan here to talk about monsters

19:23.660 --> 19:24.660
and monocles.

19:24.660 --> 19:27.980
So, um, I'll do the last week's news here in a minute, perhaps.

19:27.980 --> 19:32.100
Um, uh, let me get to some comments from chat here as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

19:32.100 --> 19:37.220
Uh, Alan alchemy and chat says it was totally out of gamer X's control too.

19:37.220 --> 19:39.620
They can only police their own people in area.

19:39.620 --> 19:40.620
Yeah.

19:40.620 --> 19:45.340
And I think most people realize that I think everybody that attended gamer X realizes that

19:45.340 --> 19:48.500
nobody faults the staff for that, but it's just one of those.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.820
It still sucks kind of situations.

19:50.820 --> 19:55.940
And we, as soon as our panel was done and as soon as the expo hall closed, we realized

19:55.940 --> 19:57.980
the game would be over in about 30 minutes.

19:57.980 --> 20:00.980
So we hightailed it the fuck out of Santa Clara and drove home because we didn't want

20:01.060 --> 20:02.060
to be stuck in that traffic.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.060
Oh God.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.060
No.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.060
Uh, and it was already getting pretty bad.

20:05.060 --> 20:08.820
So, you know, cause they, for some stupid reason, they narrow it down to one lane.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.600
I think it's because that way they can keep the light green the entire time.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.580
I don't know, but it was just, Oh my God.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.660
So I couldn't imagine trying to leave there at like four 35 o'clock when it was going

20:16.660 --> 20:17.660
to get really ugly.

20:17.660 --> 20:21.100
So I felt bad that I couldn't really see gamer X through till the bitter end.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.940
So that wasn't really fair to them, but I did have to work on Monday.

20:23.940 --> 20:28.660
So anyway, um, let me quickly ask Loki, how was your gaming week before we give Ryan a

20:28.660 --> 20:29.660
call here?

20:29.660 --> 20:30.660
Well, it was brief.

20:31.340 --> 20:35.580
I played basically ingress and um, but I did actually play console game.

20:35.580 --> 20:39.820
I played cluster trucks, which I've been looking for this game coming out for quite a while

20:39.820 --> 20:40.820
now.

20:40.820 --> 20:43.660
Uh, it's from a new developer named Landfall games.

20:43.660 --> 20:48.900
And the premise of the game is basically that you're hopping on the back of trucks to the

20:48.900 --> 20:52.020
finish line and there's a lot of obstacles in the way.

20:52.020 --> 20:56.980
So trucks can be, you know, they're just kind of on their own AI, but there's like, you

20:56.980 --> 21:02.540
know, giant hammers, lasers, moving platforms, jumps, all sorts of crazy shit.

21:02.540 --> 21:06.500
And it's just kind of jumping from one to the other and it gets really hard and it's

21:06.500 --> 21:08.700
really fun cause you can get going pretty fast.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.460
It's a very speed run centric games.

21:11.460 --> 21:12.460
Yeah.

21:12.460 --> 21:15.020
You were recommending this to me before the show saying if I like super meat boy, I probably

21:15.020 --> 21:16.020
get it right.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.020
Yeah.

21:17.020 --> 21:21.380
I mean, maybe it's not as hard as super meat boy, but it's definitely, you know, challenging

21:21.380 --> 21:25.820
and fun because you die a lot, but it's like, you know, there's some cool stuff that happens

21:25.820 --> 21:26.820
too.

21:26.820 --> 21:29.020
Um, and you get power ups and stuff like that.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.020
So I'd highly recommend that.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.540
It's on PlayStation four and PC right now.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.340
I bought both because I was going to play the PlayStation four version and my wife wanted

21:36.340 --> 21:38.500
to watch TV and I was like, dammit.

21:38.500 --> 21:45.180
So I'll buy the steam version and then ended up watching TV because I'm weak.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.140
It's just that Grey's Anatomy is just so addictive.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.340
I've played through quite a bit of it.

21:48.340 --> 21:53.900
I'm in like the seventh stage or seventh world, I guess, and each world has like 10 levels.

21:53.900 --> 21:58.980
So that's seven out of 10 or seven out of eight levels that worlds that they've got.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.240
So it gets really challenging though.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.900
Like my least favorite, but most challenging was laser world because there's one level

22:05.900 --> 22:09.500
like literally in the beginning you're like, ah, fuck.

22:09.500 --> 22:13.620
Cause it's just all you see when you first start is all these lasers in the sky and they're

22:13.620 --> 22:14.620
all swooped down.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.620
You're like, ah, shit.

22:16.620 --> 22:18.300
Just dodging lasers like crazy.

22:18.300 --> 22:19.820
Sounds like that scene in resident evil.

22:19.820 --> 22:21.020
That doesn't sound pretty at all.

22:21.020 --> 22:22.020
So yikes.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.020
All right, cool.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.300
All right, well, uh, I'll tell you about my gaming week a little bit later, but, uh,

22:26.300 --> 22:31.100
we want to make sure we get, uh, Ryan here on the show who's, uh, from retro dreamer

22:31.100 --> 22:35.980
and is, uh, one half of the team making the game monsters and monocles.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.740
And I believe we have Ryan on the line now.

22:37.740 --> 22:38.740
You there, Ryan?

22:38.740 --> 22:39.740
I'm here.

22:39.740 --> 22:40.740
How are you doing?

22:40.740 --> 22:41.740
Hey, good.

22:41.740 --> 22:42.740
Welcome to orange on radio.

22:42.740 --> 22:43.740
Thanks for having me.

22:43.740 --> 22:44.740
Hey, no problem.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.740
It's always nice to support.

22:45.740 --> 22:46.740
You know, we're an indie podcast.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.100
We like to support indie developers and it's even sweeter when the indie developer happens

22:50.100 --> 22:54.300
to be pretty much your neighbor because you're, no, it's great.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.420
And it was great to meet you guys out at indie arcade.

22:56.420 --> 22:57.420
Oh, was that like two years ago?

22:57.420 --> 22:58.420
Yeah, it was two years ago.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.900
That was a, that was the first time we got to play monsters and monocles.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.580
I've been making this game too long.

23:03.580 --> 23:07.540
Okay, well, first off, before we get into the history of the game, let's talk a little

23:07.540 --> 23:09.060
bit about what the game is.

23:09.060 --> 23:12.500
So for those that don't know what monsters and monocles is, what's the pitch?

23:12.500 --> 23:15.140
What's what's, what's the game in a nutshell?

23:15.140 --> 23:16.140
Sure.

23:16.180 --> 23:21.540
So a very kind of classical, like frantic top down twin stick shooter very much inspired

23:21.540 --> 23:23.020
by like old arcade games.

23:23.020 --> 23:29.860
You've got your gauntlet, you've got a smash TV is four player co-op, both local and online.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.820
And it's a procedural game.

23:31.820 --> 23:36.580
So the levels, the objectives, the loot and stuff is different each time you play.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.460
It's kind of, kind of the, the core of the game right there.

23:39.460 --> 23:43.540
And we just launched an early access about two months ago and we're working on trying

23:43.540 --> 23:45.380
to do monthly content updates.

23:45.380 --> 23:49.620
And I think we probably about six to nine months of content update planned before we're

23:49.620 --> 23:50.620
done.

23:50.620 --> 23:51.620
Oh, wow.

23:51.620 --> 23:52.620
That's a, that's pretty impressive.

23:52.620 --> 23:53.620
Yeah.

23:53.620 --> 23:54.620
We got a long way to go.

23:54.620 --> 23:57.740
Um, you know, it's a, it's a, we're at a great point.

23:57.740 --> 24:01.060
Like we're, like we're, we're so happy to see that people are enjoying the game and

24:01.060 --> 24:04.940
where it is now, but like knowing where we want to take it versus where it is now, like

24:04.940 --> 24:07.980
I can't wait to start getting more and more of the content and then people getting to

24:07.980 --> 24:09.100
see that stuff.

24:09.100 --> 24:12.500
So, and if you guys want to check out monsters and monocles for yourself, it is available

24:12.500 --> 24:14.020
on Steam early access right now.

24:14.020 --> 24:19.420
You can also check out the website monstersandmonocles.com and at least like, you know, it's a radio

24:19.420 --> 24:22.580
show so I can't show you a game play, but at least check out, there's like a bunch of

24:22.580 --> 24:27.340
YouTubers that have been doing the, the preview on the Steam early access that are showing

24:27.340 --> 24:28.340
off the game.

24:28.340 --> 24:31.500
So at least check it out cause it's got a, it's got a pretty cool little art style to

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
it.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.500
Yeah.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.500
Yeah.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.500
I know.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.500
And we're a two man team working on the game.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.620
I do all the programming and Craig does all the art and I absolutely, I adore Craig's

24:39.620 --> 24:40.620
art.

24:40.620 --> 24:43.620
It's one of the reasons we ended up working together is like, I've always loved the work

24:43.660 --> 24:46.860
that he's done and I jumped at the chance to get to do a game with him.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.300
So yeah, you guys are kind of like a retro look, like a, like a 16 bit kind of to me

24:51.300 --> 24:52.780
is kind of the look of the game.

24:52.780 --> 24:55.860
But you, you, it's like a steampunk theme game, right?

24:55.860 --> 24:56.860
Yeah.

24:56.860 --> 24:57.860
Yeah.

24:57.860 --> 25:03.180
Victorian steampunk instead of a rope, like we've been calling it a gentleman mic and

25:03.180 --> 25:07.300
you know, it's like, it's, it's very much a silly kind of lighthearted game.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.940
Like there are no serious overtones or themes to it.

25:09.940 --> 25:12.060
It's very like fast paced fun.

25:12.060 --> 25:18.460
Like we have a crumpet cannon and we have a dog in a smoking jacket and Baron Von Dogface

25:18.460 --> 25:21.500
that you can play as, as a character.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.900
It's very much just kind of like a lighthearted, like jokey game.

25:23.900 --> 25:26.940
Like if you could have told 12 year old me, like make your ultimate arcade game, it would

25:26.940 --> 25:28.340
ended up a lot like this.

25:28.340 --> 25:29.340
That's awesome.

25:29.340 --> 25:30.860
So where, where, and well, that kind of leads into my question.

25:30.860 --> 25:34.540
So, so how long has this big game been in development and where, where the heck did

25:34.540 --> 25:35.640
this idea come from?

25:35.640 --> 25:37.300
How was this game born?

25:37.300 --> 25:43.080
So we started development in January of 2014.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.700
So it's a little over two and a half years now.

25:46.700 --> 25:51.980
And Craig and I had been wanting to make a game together for ages and it just had never

25:51.980 --> 25:52.980
really worked out time-wise.

25:52.980 --> 25:57.460
Like I was doing a job, he was, he was working on another project and it never lined up until

25:57.460 --> 25:58.460
then.

25:58.460 --> 26:02.060
And so we sat down and said, what's a, what's a short game that we can make in like six

26:02.060 --> 26:04.120
to nine months?

26:04.120 --> 26:07.600
And two and a half years later, here we are.

26:07.600 --> 26:13.240
You know, and for us, the genesis of it was we loved the arcade growing up and like going

26:13.240 --> 26:16.460
to the arcade with your friends, like with a stack of quarters, playing a game together

26:16.460 --> 26:18.200
and just having a blast.

26:18.200 --> 26:22.080
And it was that kind of gaming experience we really wanted to recapture with Monsters

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
and Monocles.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.880
But times have changed and technology has changed.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.640
Like we don't live near each other.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.640
Craig lives down in LA.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.640
I live up in Davis.

26:29.640 --> 26:36.280
And it was, you know, how can we recreate those experiences with what we have available?

26:36.280 --> 26:39.600
Even though we, you know, we're at a different stage in our lives, we both have kids now,

26:39.600 --> 26:41.000
we don't live near each other.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.680
And so, you know, kind of focusing on fast gameplay that you can jump in and out of,

26:45.680 --> 26:51.520
you know, that, that kind of quick, like, like focused, focused missions and stuff instead

26:51.520 --> 26:56.760
of these long, like kind of more narrative, narrative structured games, you know.

26:56.760 --> 27:00.600
If I'm playing online, you know, long term, our goal is to be, he could jump into the

27:00.600 --> 27:02.960
game and play with me for as long as he can manage.

27:02.960 --> 27:07.520
And then if he has to go, he has to go and I can keep playing, you know, and, and we

27:07.520 --> 27:10.600
can enjoy the time that we have together when, when we can play.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.000
And, you know, when I want to play, want to play solo, I can do that too.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.320
That's pretty cool that you can kind of drop in and out like that.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.460
That's, and that's, that, that does remind me a lot as well of like, like you compared

27:19.460 --> 27:22.040
to Gauntlet earlier and Gauntlet was a lot like that.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.840
You could just kind of walk up, join in and then, you know, when you inevitably die, because

27:25.840 --> 27:27.800
Gauntlet was designed to go through your quarters.

27:27.800 --> 27:28.800
I'm sorry.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.800
That game was...

27:29.800 --> 27:30.800
It was.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.800
Player, player needs food badly.

27:31.800 --> 27:32.800
Yeah.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.920
There was like the built in mechanism that you would die after a certain amount of time.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.920
So yeah.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.920
No.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.160
And I mean, that was, I mean, that was arcade designed in a nutshell, right?

27:39.160 --> 27:43.440
Like it was, it was designed to take your money at a constant rate.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.440
So we don't do that.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.440
That's good.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.440
It's just the one price.

27:46.440 --> 27:49.440
You give us 15 bucks, the game is yours forever.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.440
Awesome.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.360
And that includes these content updates, right?

27:52.360 --> 27:56.860
Are you, are you planning DLC or is all this stuff that you're doing like free add-ons?

27:56.860 --> 27:58.480
We're not talking about any DLC at this point.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.320
I mean, we're still in early access, like all the stuff that we're doing now, we still

28:01.320 --> 28:03.880
consider a base part of the game.

28:03.880 --> 28:10.520
And you know, we're also working on allowing people to mod the game as they see fit.

28:10.520 --> 28:15.040
So you know, I'd love to get to the point where people can add new guns, new enemies,

28:15.040 --> 28:21.000
new maps, if they want to be really ambitious, you know, and how much people kind of want

28:21.000 --> 28:24.740
to get involved with that, you know, it's going to scale, like adding a new character

28:24.740 --> 28:29.120
would just be basically drawing the art for the character and editing a data file or two.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.720
And then, hey, all of a sudden, you've got a new character that you can send to other

28:31.720 --> 28:34.920
people or put up on Steam Workshop.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.960
Okay, that's going to be awesome that you open it up to modders, I mean, there's going

28:38.960 --> 28:39.960
to be awesome stuff.

28:39.960 --> 28:43.320
And then there's going to be, you know, CD, humor, weird stuff, too.

28:43.320 --> 28:49.160
But yeah, I mean, you know, I assume that the first thing that's made is a gun that

28:49.160 --> 28:50.160
shoots a penis.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.200
I'm just expecting that to happen.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.360
It seems to happen whenever you open up mod support.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.040
I might just do it as the example to get it out of the way.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.120
Yeah, you might as well just do the dildo gun.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
Just get it out of the way.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.120
This is true.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.000
What is that they have in Saints Row, the giant purple dildo bat or whatever?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, the dildo bat.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I mean, it is true.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.120
Yeah, we always talk about the TTP of a game or the time to penis.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.120
Yeah.

29:14.120 --> 29:19.800
No, it's, but you know what, I mean, I grew up as a PC gamer and I loved like kind of

29:19.840 --> 29:20.840
getting into the data files.

29:20.840 --> 29:25.480
Like I got my start in making video games by going and messing with the games that I

29:25.480 --> 29:26.480
had purchased.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.160
You know, I couldn't afford developer tools and this was before the days of like Linux

29:30.160 --> 29:31.800
and free compilers and all that stuff.

29:31.800 --> 29:36.320
So I got my start by like finding these files and like mucking with them and seeing how

29:36.320 --> 29:37.880
it changed the game.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.080
And that's really important for me.

29:39.080 --> 29:44.840
Like if I can get one kid into video games by he mucked with my game and said, hey, maybe

29:44.840 --> 29:45.840
I can do this too.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.960
Like that would be like mission accomplished for me.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.480
That would be the best thing ever.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.720
Are there other games on your resume that you've done?

29:51.720 --> 29:55.680
I saw that Retro Dreamer had done some like mobile development, but are there?

29:55.680 --> 29:58.400
So this is my first game with Retro Dreamer.

29:58.400 --> 30:03.400
I've been making games professionally for 12 years now.

30:03.400 --> 30:08.760
And I started in mobile and did mobile for a long time, like even before the iPhone and

30:08.760 --> 30:11.480
stuff.

30:11.480 --> 30:16.480
And then from there, the iPhone took off and all of my work was basically on the iPhone.

30:16.520 --> 30:24.200
So I worked for companies like N.G. Moco, which is now DNA, Electronic Arts, and some

30:24.200 --> 30:29.000
other big companies too, doing contract work and making games for them.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.620
After a while I ran away screaming and said, maybe I'll be an indie developer.

30:32.620 --> 30:33.620
And now here we are.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.620
You know what's interesting?

30:34.620 --> 30:37.820
We hear that story a lot from indie developers here on this show is that like half the indie

30:37.820 --> 30:42.440
developers kind of were starting on like as indie and then the other half are like, well,

30:42.440 --> 30:46.200
I used to do the big studio development and I ran away screaming and wanted to do my own

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
thing.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
Yeah.

30:48.200 --> 30:53.760
I mean, it's studio work, it's really rewarding in some way because you're usually working

30:53.760 --> 30:57.520
with an amazing group of people and they really are amazing because they're all like you.

30:57.520 --> 31:01.120
They got into games because they wanted to make them and they know a ton of stuff and

31:01.120 --> 31:05.560
it's super inspiring, but it's definitely a grind, especially when it's not your idea

31:05.560 --> 31:07.280
that you're making.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.500
So indie is a great alternative for some folks.

31:11.500 --> 31:16.860
Tell me a little more about how this creating a game across a great distance works because

31:16.860 --> 31:19.420
that's kind of fascinating to me is that, you know, you guys have been working on this

31:19.420 --> 31:23.820
game for a while and you do it across this great distance of, you know, you being in

31:23.820 --> 31:27.460
Northern California and your other developer being in Southern California, and that's,

31:27.460 --> 31:28.960
you know, that's a good eight hour drive.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.880
You guys can't just meet up for lunch to toss around ideas.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.420
But I think that's pretty cool because for people out there that might be thinking about,

31:36.420 --> 31:39.340
I want to make an indie game, but I need a little extra help.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.300
That help doesn't necessarily need to be in your own hometown.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.340
You're developing kind of across these great distances.

31:44.340 --> 31:45.340
How does that work?

31:45.340 --> 31:46.340
Yeah.

31:46.340 --> 31:48.880
I mean, we use tools that, you know, just everybody else uses.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.640
We use Slack for day to day chatting.

31:51.640 --> 31:56.500
We used to use Skype, but Skype wasn't reliable for us, so we stopped using that.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.500
And Slack has been great.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.560
We just have a chat room up 24 seven.

31:59.560 --> 32:03.220
If Craig's working on a new enemy or a new monster, he'll just drop images in and I can

32:03.220 --> 32:05.380
see them being comment back and forth.

32:05.380 --> 32:08.980
And it's, you know, it's kind of like a persistent conversation, you know.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.780
It doesn't matter the time of day.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.500
If I have an idea, I can paste it in there.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.060
I can tell him that I've pushed a new build up to Dropbox.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.060
Well, now Steam.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.780
We don't use Dropbox anymore.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.100
And he can check it out.

32:19.100 --> 32:23.480
And you know, if he's working on new art or a new map or something, he can drop in there.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.100
And that's just kind of our back and forth.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.100
That's pretty cool.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.100
Yeah.

32:27.100 --> 32:32.020
And then, you know, besides that, once you're greenlit on Steam, you can push builds of

32:32.020 --> 32:33.060
your game whenever you want.

32:33.060 --> 32:37.740
So that's been great for us for kind of staying in sync on what's in the game and what's not.

32:37.740 --> 32:41.060
And yeah, besides that, you know, Craig does all the art.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.060
He gives it to me.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.060
I integrate it with the game.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.020
And then design is an iterative process.

32:45.020 --> 32:46.820
We've had multiplayer in from day one.

32:46.820 --> 32:51.420
So we can play the game together and hop on Skype or some other voice chatting thing and

32:51.420 --> 32:55.860
talk about what we like, what we don't like, and take notes and kind of go from there.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.820
So one thing I've been very curious about.

32:57.820 --> 33:03.660
So Loki and I first got to play your game at the Sac Indie Arcade event in 2015, right?

33:03.660 --> 33:04.660
Not this year, but last year.

33:04.660 --> 33:07.000
So we got to play the game at that event.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.500
And at the time we played it, we thought, oh, this is going to be out real soon.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.440
This looks like a finished product, but you're still kind of working on it.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.760
And I think, and the reason why I ask is I think a lot of games kind of go through this

33:17.760 --> 33:22.120
is that you might play it, I mean, you might even play a big AAA game or something at E3,

33:22.120 --> 33:24.940
and it still doesn't come out for, you know, a good year and a half or whatever.

33:24.940 --> 33:30.240
So what have you been doing to your game since it felt so playable to now?

33:30.240 --> 33:31.240
I don't know.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.120
No, we've been doing a lot.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.760
So there have been a few big things that kind of slowed us down.

33:38.760 --> 33:45.880
First I had a new baby, so that definitely took some of my time.

33:45.880 --> 33:52.760
And on the game side of things, we've had networking in from day one, but the game engine

33:52.760 --> 33:56.400
that we use, Unity, they added a whole new one.

33:56.400 --> 34:01.120
But as part of adding the new networking stack, they completely deprecated the old one, which

34:01.120 --> 34:05.360
means we've marked this for removal at some point in the future.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.320
We haven't announced when we're going to remove it, but we're going to remove it, and of course

34:08.320 --> 34:12.140
that's what we had used to build it all up at that point.

34:12.140 --> 34:13.920
And so we had to make the call, well, what do we do?

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
Do we move to this new system?

34:14.920 --> 34:16.360
Do we move to our own system?

34:16.360 --> 34:20.400
And so there was a lot of testing there, and we eventually made the call to write our own

34:20.400 --> 34:25.640
networking stack directly on top of Steam's feature list, and that was probably a good

34:25.640 --> 34:29.400
four months of work right there.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.880
And then besides that, we've been polishing the game.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.720
We really spent a lot of time changing the core mechanics.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.440
We weren't happy with the core game feel.

34:39.440 --> 34:44.360
And in a game like this, where it's an arcade-y thing, there's nothing to hide the gameplay

34:44.360 --> 34:45.360
behind.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.600
If there's something in the gameplay that's not working, it's going to stand out like

34:48.600 --> 34:51.840
a sore thumb from the very first moment, and it's going to keep annoying you the whole

34:51.840 --> 34:53.700
time you play.

34:53.700 --> 34:57.040
So we stripped the game back to core principles.

34:57.040 --> 35:02.800
I think we cut it down to like two guns in one map and three enemies for about, I'd say

35:02.800 --> 35:04.480
about five months.

35:04.480 --> 35:11.240
And we tweaked how much damage do guns do, how fast do they fire, how do they affect

35:11.240 --> 35:17.000
player movement, how fast does the player move, how fast do enemies move, and just fine-tuning

35:17.000 --> 35:20.840
each and every little piece and how they interact with each other until we were at a point where

35:20.840 --> 35:23.400
we thought, yes, this works.

35:23.400 --> 35:27.600
And to be honest, that's something we probably should have done to begin with, but it's tough

35:27.600 --> 35:30.680
when you have these shows that you're going to, because you want to promote the game and

35:30.680 --> 35:32.160
kind of build awareness.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.840
You polish to the point where you say, this is something we can take to a demo and people

35:35.840 --> 35:37.440
are going to have a good time with it.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.160
But that doesn't necessarily mean that those underpinnings of your game are solid enough

35:41.160 --> 35:43.240
to build the entire game around.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.600
And that's kind of where we got stuck.

35:45.600 --> 35:49.400
That's a very interesting thing to think about, I think, for a lot of people, is just how

35:49.400 --> 35:52.200
much has to go into balance with the game.

35:52.200 --> 36:00.800
Because if, like you say, a gun is too overpowered or something, that core mechanic is broken,

36:00.800 --> 36:03.960
people aren't going to bother to play to the fourth or fifth level to see all the cool

36:03.960 --> 36:05.720
art that you have later in the game.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.720
Yeah.

36:06.720 --> 36:12.900
And weapon balance in particular is a minefield because our launch is a great example of that.

36:12.900 --> 36:19.160
We had a gun, the auto-stake launcher, which is basically like a crossbow that shoots vampire

36:19.160 --> 36:25.280
killing stakes, but the auto is the upgraded version of it and it shoots it super rapidly.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.080
And it cooled down.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.120
We have this overheat mechanic where, for more powerful guns, since we don't have ammo

36:32.120 --> 36:35.360
in the game because we don't want people dealing about ammo and like, can I shoot, can I not

36:35.360 --> 36:37.880
shoot, we wanted people to shoot as much as they want.

36:37.880 --> 36:42.240
So instead of doing ammo, we have this overheat thing where a powerful gun will eventually

36:42.240 --> 36:48.040
overheat and you have to flip to your other gun for a little bit while it cools down.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.280
And the auto-stake launcher was set to cool down a little too quickly, and so people realized

36:52.280 --> 36:55.280
that they could basically just spam it and it trivialized the game for a lot of people

36:55.280 --> 36:59.120
who realized that, and they could just fly through the content.

36:59.120 --> 37:06.520
And that was one gun out of 25, I think, and we just missed that one value and it trivialized

37:06.520 --> 37:09.080
the game for a lot of people.

37:09.080 --> 37:15.640
So that's getting fixed, actually that's been fixed, that was fixed in the last update.

37:16.400 --> 37:21.800
But yeah, it's so easy to just make one wrong change that kind of throws everything out of whack.

37:21.800 --> 37:28.040
Wow, okay, that's so important, I think, too, to look at that balance and everything.

37:28.040 --> 37:32.800
And I think when, you know, you and your co-developer might play this game over and over and over

37:32.800 --> 37:36.280
and over again, and even these internal, you know, these companies that have war developers

37:36.280 --> 37:39.080
might play it internally over and over and over again, and they're still not going to

37:39.080 --> 37:42.680
come up with that scenario that your users might come up with.

37:43.240 --> 37:48.960
And it's funny because you mentioned how much time we play, some of the people in our Discord

37:48.960 --> 37:54.680
server for the game give me trouble because I'm now at about 1400 hours of time played.

37:54.680 --> 37:58.400
I played the game a lot, but it's so easy to miss stuff, especially when you play a

37:58.400 --> 38:02.440
game as much as we do, you just end up building these assumptions into your mind and you miss

38:02.440 --> 38:03.960
stuff that other people see.

38:03.960 --> 38:08.000
Right, I bet that's dangerous is that you start to assume because you just kind of know

38:08.000 --> 38:09.600
the inner workings of the game.

38:09.600 --> 38:13.560
You know, I think that it's so important to get new people to play the game and see

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
their reactions.

38:14.560 --> 38:19.200
So that's part of the reason why you do different expos and things, right?

38:19.200 --> 38:22.840
Like you did the Sac and the Arcade event where we saw you, but you were recently at

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
PAX, right?

38:23.840 --> 38:24.840
Yeah, absolutely.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
And PAX was amazing.

38:25.840 --> 38:30.600
PAX is, I love small shows, local shows, because it's a great chance to kind of connect with

38:30.600 --> 38:33.600
people more than you can at a big show.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.000
But the big shows are so amazing, too, because people come from all over.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.280
And this show was really special to me because it was the first time we'd had a show since

38:41.280 --> 38:45.440
the game had launched, and I was actually meeting people who bought the game and enjoyed

38:45.440 --> 38:49.320
the game and came up to tell me about it, and that just meant the world to me.

38:49.320 --> 38:54.040
As a small developer, if I can give players any advice, if you really like a game, reach

38:54.040 --> 38:57.920
out to the developer and tell them if they're an indie developer, because it means the world

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
to us.

38:58.920 --> 39:03.420
We don't hear it very often, but when we do, it makes our day.

39:03.420 --> 39:09.100
So having that show and having people come up to me, I was on cloud nine all four days.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.340
It was fantastic.

39:11.340 --> 39:16.380
So they could send that love digitally via Twitter at MonsterMonocles, right?

39:16.380 --> 39:20.300
Yeah, or my personal one is at rje.

39:20.300 --> 39:23.940
I will see either of those pretty much 24-7.

39:23.940 --> 39:27.140
You must have got on the Twitter bandwagon early, like me, because you have a three-letter

39:27.140 --> 39:29.140
name and I have a four-letter name.

39:29.140 --> 39:33.380
Yeah, one of my friends mentioned it to me, and I made an account and then just let it

39:33.380 --> 39:37.620
sit there for probably three years, and then I was like, oh, maybe I should actually check

39:37.620 --> 39:39.260
Twitter out.

39:39.260 --> 39:40.780
Convenient.

39:40.780 --> 39:45.160
We actually have a live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and people of course

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
can ask questions.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.980
We have a good question here from RageNator in our chat room I want to ask you here.

39:49.980 --> 39:54.460
Are there any games that you look to as being inspirational, or to put it another way, is

39:54.460 --> 39:59.180
there a game or games that in your mind are the epitome of how a game within a genre should

39:59.180 --> 40:00.180
be made?

40:00.180 --> 40:01.180
Wow, that's a tough question.

40:01.180 --> 40:05.700
Yeah, those are almost two separate questions, too.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.300
Are there games that have really inspired you with Monsters & Monocles?

40:08.300 --> 40:11.580
I guess you talked a little bit about the retro arcade stuff, right?

40:11.580 --> 40:12.580
Gauntlet?

40:12.580 --> 40:18.740
Yeah, specifically within the context of Monsters & Monocles, I would say shooters and co-op

40:18.740 --> 40:21.260
games from the arcade.

40:21.260 --> 40:25.700
The most direct comparison, like I said earlier, were Gauntlet and Smash TV, just in terms

40:25.700 --> 40:29.700
of pace and style and thematics and stuff like that.

40:29.700 --> 40:34.580
But I mean, you could look at other arcade games, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-op

40:34.580 --> 40:42.140
was one of my all-time favorite gaming experiences in the arcade.

40:42.140 --> 40:47.220
I think it's hard for the second part of that question to talk about the epitome of a game

40:47.220 --> 40:51.980
within a genre, because I feel like that's going to be a very personal thing.

40:51.980 --> 40:57.580
For me, I think I'd have a really tough time picking a game.

40:57.580 --> 41:03.260
Maybe open-world games, like I adore the Yakuza series from SEGA, but that's a very

41:03.260 --> 41:07.940
specific niche thing that I apparently love and nobody else in America does.

41:07.940 --> 41:14.780
No, well, he's in Canada, but one of the guys that helped with our website, or helped, back

41:14.780 --> 41:19.060
when we first had done it a long, long time ago, loves Yakuza and always keeps me updated

41:19.060 --> 41:20.340
on what's going on with that series.

41:20.340 --> 41:21.340
So you're not alone.

41:21.340 --> 41:22.900
Oh, it's the best.

41:22.900 --> 41:31.220
It's such an interesting series to me, and I could talk for hours about it, but I won't.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.220
Look at this.

41:32.220 --> 41:33.340
You're winning tons of points in our chat room.

41:33.340 --> 41:36.780
Tigerclaw says, big points for mentioning Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Dungeon

41:36.780 --> 41:40.460
Buster said, holy shit, a fellow Yakuza fan, yeah, it's really the best.

41:40.460 --> 41:42.420
Hey, there's three of us, all right.

41:42.420 --> 41:45.620
You guys should start a club.

41:45.620 --> 41:49.420
The first one on the PlayStation 4 that's coming out is coming out in the States in,

41:49.420 --> 41:52.180
I think, January, and I'm clearing my calendar.

41:52.460 --> 41:53.460
I'm going to play it to death.

41:53.460 --> 41:54.460
I can't wait.

41:54.460 --> 41:58.460
I just want to point out, he threatened to do this in a tweet before the show, too, that

41:58.460 --> 42:00.300
he was going to derail this with the Yakuza chat.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.300
Look what happened.

42:01.300 --> 42:06.100
Hey, it's not nearly as bad as it could be.

42:06.100 --> 42:10.260
I haven't gotten to any of my theories about how that game is put together, but it really

42:10.260 --> 42:13.380
is a fascinating series that I think more people should check out.

42:13.380 --> 42:18.060
All right, fair enough, and it's one of those things where it's like, there's so many games

42:18.060 --> 42:19.420
and just not enough time.

42:19.420 --> 42:20.420
Oh, geez, yeah.

42:20.660 --> 42:25.780
I mean, just this week, I think I bought four games and I played one of them.

42:25.780 --> 42:29.260
I don't know how I'm going to, like, this is my Steam backlog problem in a nutshell.

42:29.260 --> 42:31.140
I have so many games I want to play.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.460
And I don't know if you're as big of a fan as I am, but can you imagine that right now

42:34.460 --> 42:37.460
is the time we were supposed to be playing Final Fantasy XV as well?

42:37.460 --> 42:38.460
Oh, my God.

42:38.460 --> 42:43.620
Well, yeah, and then the World of Warcraft expansion came out of nowhere, and I had completely

42:43.620 --> 42:49.140
forgotten I had pre-ordered it, and then I lost about 60 hours of my life to that.

42:49.340 --> 42:50.980
It's fantastic, by the way.

42:50.980 --> 42:51.980
I agree.

42:51.980 --> 42:52.980
I agree.

42:52.980 --> 42:59.460
Yeah, and God, yeah, and there's just so many, like, you know, when we talked about launching

42:59.460 --> 43:04.460
the game, we tried to find an empty week on the calendar where there wasn't a ton of great

43:04.460 --> 43:06.600
stuff coming out, and that week doesn't exist anymore.

43:06.600 --> 43:11.060
There's amazing stuff coming out every week of the year, and it's mind-blowing to me.

43:11.060 --> 43:13.840
There's never a better time to be a video game fan.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.700
There's just an embarrassment of riches.

43:15.700 --> 43:18.620
Yeah, and this week especially, we're going to talk about it a little later in the show,

43:18.620 --> 43:24.340
but PlayStation VR this week, I mean, that is going to blow up PlayStation with, I think,

43:24.340 --> 43:26.180
there's something like 40 new releases this week.

43:26.180 --> 43:29.740
Yeah, and I'm so sad I didn't get a pre-order in on time.

43:29.740 --> 43:30.740
I missed it.

43:30.740 --> 43:34.980
Oh, no, we're going to talk about that a little later in the show, about where we're standing

43:34.980 --> 43:38.660
on the VR right now, but let me go back to Monsters & Monocles a little bit.

43:38.660 --> 43:42.700
Funny enough, since we brought up PlayStation, I just kind of want to ask you, like, I noticed

43:42.700 --> 43:47.220
that there is, it's out there that you guys are working on a PlayStation 4 version.

43:47.220 --> 43:50.740
I know I've seen the trailer on the official PlayStation account.

43:50.740 --> 43:54.500
Are you guys talking at all, any type of time frame for when that's going to happen?

43:54.500 --> 43:58.900
So it's definitely a ways off, it'll be next year sometime.

43:58.900 --> 44:03.340
We need to finish the Steam version before we can bring it over to PlayStation.

44:03.340 --> 44:08.420
We can't do early access on the PS4 like we are with Steam, so we need to get all the

44:08.420 --> 44:13.900
content in and kind of have that blessed 1.0 version and be out of early access on Steam,

44:13.900 --> 44:17.060
and then that's the version that will come over to PlayStation.

44:17.060 --> 44:21.780
I'm hoping it'll be very close to the time that we do the 1.0 on Steam.

44:21.780 --> 44:26.140
The game is up and running on the PlayStation already and has been since, god, for over

44:26.140 --> 44:32.420
a year now, and Sony let us show it at PlayStation Experience last year, which was another fantastic

44:32.420 --> 44:33.820
show that we got to do.

44:33.820 --> 44:34.820
Oh, cool.

44:34.820 --> 44:39.900
So yeah, no, we're really excited about the PlayStation version, especially for the local

44:39.900 --> 44:40.900
co-op mode.

44:40.900 --> 44:45.460
We've had local in from day one for people who prefer to play that way.

44:45.460 --> 44:52.860
But PC gamers, we've noticed local co-op doesn't get a ton of use, it's much more online.

44:52.860 --> 44:58.020
But I feel like with friends and family, local on a console is kind of where the heart and

44:58.020 --> 44:59.020
soul of local is.

44:59.020 --> 45:01.700
So I'm really excited to have a console release too.

45:01.700 --> 45:04.940
And was that hard to get involved with PlayStation?

45:04.940 --> 45:09.820
Because for an indie developer, the fact that you guys are a two-man team, getting invited

45:09.820 --> 45:12.180
to PlayStation Experience, that's a pretty big deal.

45:12.180 --> 45:18.420
Yeah, PlayStation Experience was amazing and definitely a bit out of the blue.

45:18.420 --> 45:21.180
But Sony has been an amazing partner.

45:21.180 --> 45:24.660
And the amount of outreach they've done over the last few years to indie developers has

45:24.660 --> 45:25.660
really been amazing.

45:25.660 --> 45:31.900
And again, especially if I kind of look back at where things were when I started 10 to

45:31.900 --> 45:37.700
12 years ago, if you wanted to get into console development, you needed to have an official

45:37.700 --> 45:43.620
company that had its own building, you needed to have a security setup for dev kits and

45:43.620 --> 45:44.620
stuff.

45:44.620 --> 45:51.220
And then dev kits, you were talking $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 just to get started.

45:51.220 --> 45:58.180
And then if you wanted to ship anything, there was no digital, so you had to find a publisher.

45:58.180 --> 46:01.460
Consoles, just like everything else, has gotten easier and easier, and I think we're better

46:01.460 --> 46:02.460
off for it.

46:02.460 --> 46:06.500
I think we've seen a wider variety of games than we've ever seen before, and that can

46:06.500 --> 46:12.460
very much be attributed to the walls being lowered and them being more accepting of smaller

46:12.460 --> 46:13.460
teams.

46:13.460 --> 46:19.340
Well, Ryan, I'm going to wrap things up here because we've taken plenty of your time tonight.

46:19.340 --> 46:22.100
I really appreciate you joining us here on the program, though, but I really want to

46:22.100 --> 46:26.060
wish you continued luck with the continued development of Monsters & Monocles and the

46:26.060 --> 46:29.220
monthly content things you guys are planning over on Steam.

46:29.220 --> 46:33.740
And again, if you guys are interested at all, if this sounds like this kind of old-school

46:33.740 --> 46:40.180
arcade game, Smash TV meets procedural generation meets steampunk jokes and stuff, if that sounds

46:40.180 --> 46:43.820
up your alley, I really encourage you guys to check it out on Steam Early Access right

46:43.820 --> 46:44.820
now.

46:44.820 --> 46:46.980
Somebody posted the link in the chatroom earlier, so there you go, and those of you listening

46:46.980 --> 46:51.220
on the podcast feed can find it with one easy search, I'm sure.

46:51.220 --> 46:54.540
It would be very hard to forget a name like Monsters & Monocles.

46:54.540 --> 46:58.740
Ryan, anything else you want to plug here real quick before we let you go?

46:58.740 --> 47:01.580
No, you know what, that's it.

47:01.580 --> 47:05.660
And just thanks so much for having me on, let me chat about the game a bit.

47:05.660 --> 47:09.540
If anybody has any other questions about the game and didn't get them in tonight, feel

47:09.540 --> 47:13.620
free to hit me up on Twitter at R-J-E.

47:13.620 --> 47:16.580
And yeah, if you check out the game, I hope you have a blast.

47:16.580 --> 47:17.580
Is that a pun?

47:17.580 --> 47:18.580
It is now.

47:18.580 --> 47:19.580
All right, excellent.

47:19.580 --> 47:24.380
Ryan, thank you so much for taking the time out to join us here at Orange On Radio.

47:24.380 --> 47:27.740
Best of luck with the game, really look forward to the continued patches and the eventual

47:27.740 --> 47:28.740
PS4 release.

47:28.740 --> 47:29.740
Thanks guys, have a good one.

47:29.740 --> 47:30.740
All right, take care, buddy.

47:30.900 --> 47:31.900
All right, bye-bye.

47:31.900 --> 47:32.900
Bye-bye.

47:32.900 --> 47:37.740
So Ryan with Retro Dreamer, talking about Monsters & Monocles, thanks to him for taking

47:37.740 --> 47:38.740
the time out.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.740
That's great.

47:39.740 --> 47:41.300
You can tell he's just a gaming fan, too.

47:41.300 --> 47:44.860
And obviously he has his things he's passionate about, which might not even necessarily be

47:44.860 --> 47:47.140
the same genre he's developing in right now.

47:47.140 --> 47:53.940
Like I don't think I see a lot of Yakuza necessarily in Monsters & Monocles, although Dungeon Buster

47:53.940 --> 47:58.020
says in our chat, says a great interview and good luck.

47:58.020 --> 48:00.500
Also please put in a Yakuza themed Easter egg.

48:01.260 --> 48:02.260
You never know.

48:02.260 --> 48:03.260
You never know what might happen with that.

48:03.260 --> 48:04.260
There you go.

48:04.260 --> 48:08.540
All right, well, moving on, getting back into some news, well, let me talk about my gaming

48:08.540 --> 48:09.540
week real quick.

48:09.540 --> 48:12.120
So I already talked a little bit about GamerX, but I want to talk about some of the video

48:12.120 --> 48:15.940
games I was playing this past week, which, like Ryan, I was also playing that new World

48:15.940 --> 48:21.100
of Warcraft expansion, but Final Fantasy XIV got a patch this past week, so I was checking

48:21.100 --> 48:23.100
that out as well.

48:23.100 --> 48:26.680
Actually it feels like it was this past week because I was gone and GamerX was actually

48:26.680 --> 48:29.340
two weeks ago, so I was checking that out as well.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.460
So here's something else I've been playing.

48:31.460 --> 48:36.300
So do you remember how we kept telling the listeners, we said if they actually announce

48:36.300 --> 48:38.740
the NX, we'll do a show, right?

48:38.740 --> 48:43.060
Obviously that didn't happen because we didn't do a show, but I would say the number two

48:43.060 --> 48:46.060
thing on the list happened last week.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.760
What was the number two thing?

48:47.760 --> 48:50.220
Lost Odyssey became backwards compatible on Xbox One.

48:50.220 --> 48:51.700
Oh yeah, that's right.

48:51.700 --> 48:58.180
So you know I was excited about that, so I've been playing some Lost Odyssey on Xbox One,

48:58.180 --> 49:01.300
and I've got to say that game has aged pretty well.

49:01.300 --> 49:04.500
For as old of a game as it is, it holds up really well.

49:04.500 --> 49:07.460
Looks great on Xbox One.

49:07.460 --> 49:11.580
I remember one place that that game got razzed in the early days, especially in the review,

49:11.580 --> 49:13.260
was the loading times.

49:13.260 --> 49:14.940
Well think about this now.

49:14.940 --> 49:17.340
It's now on your hard drive.

49:17.340 --> 49:21.540
And I guess you could install games back during Lost Odyssey, but I want to say there was

49:21.540 --> 49:24.980
something like, it wasn't recommended for the multi-disc games or something.

49:24.980 --> 49:28.220
I seem to remember that being a thing back in the day.

49:28.220 --> 49:31.800
But anyway, you can install it to the Xbox One drive, and I feel like some of the loading

49:31.800 --> 49:35.420
times for battles and stuff aren't as bad as they were.

49:35.420 --> 49:40.660
So interesting, maybe some of that stuff has even been improved upon a little bit.

49:40.660 --> 49:44.560
So I've been able to play very far into the game, but yes, thank you to everybody who

49:44.560 --> 49:48.860
tweeted me the day that that was announced, which was conveniently the day that I was

49:48.860 --> 49:49.860
leaving to go to GamerX.

49:49.860 --> 49:54.960
I didn't get to check it out until I got back, but yes, I definitely got in on Lost Odyssey

49:54.960 --> 49:57.080
and was playing that and checking that out.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.600
So very, very, very, very happy about that.

49:59.600 --> 50:02.960
And there's also other backwards compatible stuff that popped in this week.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.920
Puzzle Quest 2, which was cool, Bejeweled 3, like just some random...

50:06.920 --> 50:10.080
Yeah, there was some PopCap stuff that was actually on there for free.

50:10.080 --> 50:17.720
I'm not sure if that was a glitch or something, but like Bejeweled 2, 3, I want to say, was

50:17.720 --> 50:23.720
it Feeding Frenzy 1 and 2, and then something else.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.840
Oh no, I didn't catch any of that when it was...

50:25.840 --> 50:28.600
Well, I'd also bought all those games on 360, so...

50:28.600 --> 50:33.440
Right, yeah, I think I owned quite a few of those as well, and I don't have an Xbox One

50:33.440 --> 50:35.960
yet, so who knows.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.320
But anyway, it was really cool to be able to revisit Lost Odyssey, and yes, I was very

50:39.320 --> 50:43.020
excited when they announced that and getting to go visit that.

50:43.020 --> 50:46.120
So yeah, if you haven't played it yet, now's a great time to go visit it.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.120
Although, I had heard...

50:47.120 --> 50:50.800
I don't know if this was changed, but I had heard you actually still can't buy it digitally,

50:50.800 --> 50:51.800
which kind of surprises me.

50:51.800 --> 50:52.920
I don't think you can.

50:52.920 --> 50:53.920
It's weird.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.920
So you gotta go find a used copy somewhere, which you can find them, but I think they

50:56.920 --> 50:59.680
got smart and they started jacking up the prices.

50:59.680 --> 51:00.960
I was at a local store.

51:00.960 --> 51:01.960
I was at the local...

51:01.960 --> 51:02.960
I was at Dimple.

51:02.960 --> 51:07.080
They were charging $19.99 for it, and I was like, dang, this thing must be scarcer than

51:07.080 --> 51:08.080
I thought.

51:08.080 --> 51:11.360
I don't think they're that savvy, but yeah.

51:11.360 --> 51:16.200
Anyway, so yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.

51:16.200 --> 51:22.280
I think that was between being at a convention and everything, that was a lot in my week.

51:22.320 --> 51:27.400
So let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week, since we never got around

51:27.400 --> 51:29.240
to that particular kickoff topic.

51:29.240 --> 51:34.720
So some of the things that we had missed last week, the Japanese NES Classic was announced.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.000
Did you hear about that?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.280
Yeah, the Famicom one.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.280
The Famicom one.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.880
So they are getting some different games.

51:40.880 --> 51:43.840
So they are not getting some of the things that we're getting, and I don't have the list

51:43.840 --> 51:50.240
of what they don't get, but they are getting Yie Ar Kung Fu, Solomon's Key.

51:50.280 --> 51:55.200
They are getting the Japanese version of River City Ransom on theirs, which is pretty cool.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.760
So yeah, NES Open Tournament Golf.

51:57.760 --> 52:00.080
So they're getting their own cool little...

52:00.080 --> 52:01.560
It's almost worth the import, maybe.

52:01.560 --> 52:02.560
I know, right?

52:02.560 --> 52:03.560
I wonder if that would work on...

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
I don't see why not.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.560
It's HDMI.

52:05.560 --> 52:06.560
HDMI, yeah.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.600
Yeah, that's a good point.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.280
Those might be fun to import.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.280
Hmm.

52:10.280 --> 52:12.360
You bring up a good thought there.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.400
So that was big news.

52:14.400 --> 52:19.480
I guess the Lost Odyssey news, of course, that I already touched on, was a pretty big deal.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.640
Neo Geo titles are coming to the PlayStation 4 Arcade Archives.

52:22.640 --> 52:26.360
I don't know if you guys are following that series on PlayStation 4, but that's where

52:26.360 --> 52:30.040
you can get Bubble Bobble, Gradius II, Mighty Bomb Jack.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.600
They have some old-school 80s classics in here.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.280
Well, now they're going to get Neo Geo games.

52:34.280 --> 52:38.640
They've announced Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, going to be coming to PlayStation 4.

52:38.640 --> 52:43.800
If only they had that wrapped into some sort of classic arcade-type thing, you know.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.840
Let's see.

52:45.880 --> 52:51.560
Also, uh, Bit.Trip Runner 3 was announced, so that series is going to be continuing.

52:51.560 --> 52:56.200
Is it so hard, like, I know this is like something that, they've done different games like this,

52:56.200 --> 53:01.360
but can we get, like, a remaster of, like, the old San Francisco Rush or something like

53:01.360 --> 53:02.360
that?

53:02.360 --> 53:08.040
Or, like, because those games look like dog shit on, you know, everything, because at

53:08.040 --> 53:09.920
the time, that's all it could do.

53:09.920 --> 53:14.200
But nowadays, like, I don't necessarily want them, like, to make new stuff because the

53:14.200 --> 53:18.080
new Rush games aren't that great, but the old ones are great, so let's just, I'm sure

53:18.080 --> 53:20.040
they can update everything and just keep the same tracks.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.640
What the hell does that have to do with Bit.Trip Runner?

53:21.640 --> 53:23.640
I don't know, we were talking about classic arcades.

53:23.640 --> 53:28.520
Alright, well, I'm excited about Bit.Trip Runner 3 because I love the first two.

53:28.520 --> 53:31.400
The second was a huge, like, step up from the first two, and the first was pretty good

53:31.400 --> 53:35.000
as it was, so that will be very, very interesting.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
And for those of you that are playing Stardew Valley, you're going to be able to get divorced

53:39.000 --> 53:42.040
in Stardew Valley now, so if you don't like your spouse, you can fix that.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.040
That's new in Stardew Valley.

53:43.080 --> 53:46.680
Well, that's a lot better than the previous way, which was throwing her into a combine,

53:46.680 --> 53:47.680
but, you know.

53:47.680 --> 53:52.960
Do you remember Firewatch, that indie game that had come out on PlayStation 4 not that

53:52.960 --> 53:55.880
long ago, and I think they just released on Xbox One recently?

53:55.880 --> 53:56.880
Yes.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.680
Firewatch has sold one million copies.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.320
They're going to make a movie out of it, apparently.

54:01.320 --> 54:06.680
That's kind of random, but I could, I can kind of see it, like, you know, it was a game

54:06.680 --> 54:08.720
that was very driven by story.

54:08.720 --> 54:11.560
I don't, I mean, it's going to be interesting.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.880
Is it going to be a scary movie?

54:12.920 --> 54:14.320
Like, what are they going to do with it?

54:14.320 --> 54:16.520
I haven't played the game, so I don't know what the story is.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.320
I'm curious about that.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.920
That'll be interesting.

54:19.920 --> 54:23.120
So that is some of what you missed last week.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.920
Obviously, we can't fit everything in, but those are some of the things that caught my

54:25.920 --> 54:26.920
eye.

54:26.920 --> 54:32.040
Before we get into this week's gaming news, I want to mention we will be here live next

54:32.040 --> 54:33.040
week.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.240
We will have an OLR live next week.

54:34.240 --> 54:39.880
However, I'm going to be running in really late, as I'm going to be gone this weekend.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.160
This is convention time of year, Loki.

54:42.160 --> 54:44.160
I'm going to be gone this weekend as well.

54:44.160 --> 54:47.000
I'm going to be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest in Las Vegas.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.160
So I will be there for the convention Friday, Saturday.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.720
So I fly back on Sunday.

54:51.720 --> 54:53.920
Thankfully, Vegas is only like an hour and 15 minute flight.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.920
So it's really short flight.

54:55.920 --> 54:59.960
But I fly back and I get home at like one o'clock.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.440
So I'm going to be cutting it, which I know it sounds like a lot of time, but it's really

55:03.440 --> 55:06.840
not when you consider that I have to drive back from the airport and you know, all that

55:06.840 --> 55:07.840
stuff.

55:07.840 --> 55:09.840
So Loki is going to take care of producing the show next week.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.960
So I'm not as worried about that, but it's, it's, you know, we're going to be cutting

55:12.960 --> 55:14.160
it a little close next week.

55:14.160 --> 55:17.760
So I just, you know, kind of, kind of letting you guys know that we may get a late start

55:17.760 --> 55:20.200
if anything weird happens with the flights.

55:20.200 --> 55:23.200
But hopefully that won't happen.

55:23.200 --> 55:29.560
We will also not have a live show, Veterans Day weekend, which is going to be November

55:29.560 --> 55:30.760
13th.

55:30.760 --> 55:33.120
There will not be a live show.

55:33.120 --> 55:39.480
However, as a lot of you are highly anticipating the 666th episode on the show scheduled to

55:39.520 --> 55:45.120
take place the next week on 20 November, we will be doing something that we can actually

55:45.120 --> 55:46.120
number as a show.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.720
So we'll probably tape earlier in the week.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.720
We've done this before.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.880
We'll tape on like a Tuesday or Wednesday night.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.480
And then that'll be our show for the week so that we don't lose the numbering.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.600
And we can still bring you episode 666 on 20 November, which by the way, I still have

55:57.600 --> 55:59.640
no idea what we're doing or how I get.

55:59.640 --> 56:00.880
Now it's just a thing.

56:00.880 --> 56:04.120
Now it's just a thing that we have to do to do episode 666 on 20 November.

56:04.120 --> 56:07.880
So we'll, we'll be figuring that out in the next month.

56:07.880 --> 56:10.920
I am going to Chicago.

56:10.920 --> 56:15.240
Just the planets and stars aligned in just the right way.

56:15.240 --> 56:17.360
They're doing a big Ingress thing in Chicago.

56:17.360 --> 56:21.520
And usually I would not spend all this money to fly out just to play a stupid cell phone

56:21.520 --> 56:22.520
game.

56:22.520 --> 56:26.040
But it's like, I haven't really spent quality time in Chicago.

56:26.040 --> 56:30.000
I went to, I went to anime, oh shit, I forget the name.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.760
I'm going to get such shit for that.

56:31.760 --> 56:34.480
Anime Midwest something happens there.

56:34.480 --> 56:37.640
I forgot the name because it's been like 10 years since I was there.

56:37.640 --> 56:41.560
I didn't see anything but like the hotel and like a little piece of downtown when I

56:41.560 --> 56:42.560
was there.

56:42.560 --> 56:45.120
So I get to spend some proper time in Chicago and I have some friends that live there.

56:45.120 --> 56:49.880
So thanks to my buddies that used to do the show Koopa Club and I know some more people

56:49.880 --> 56:51.680
just from the internet that live there.

56:51.680 --> 56:54.640
So it's kind of one of those things where it all lines up where I get to visit all those

56:54.640 --> 56:59.560
folks and then also see, get to play some Ingress out of it at the event.

56:59.560 --> 57:03.200
So but because of that, we will not be here live that weekend.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.720
So just so you guys know.

57:05.280 --> 57:09.080
Yes, and Wardle King says 666 still on November 20th.

57:09.080 --> 57:12.920
Yes, we will do whatever we have to do to make sure that that happens, even if we have

57:12.920 --> 57:17.160
to put out something really short as episode 665.

57:17.160 --> 57:18.160
You know what?

57:18.160 --> 57:22.200
After 600 plus episodes, we've earned it if we want to call a 20 minute show a show.

57:22.200 --> 57:24.800
All right.

57:24.800 --> 57:26.040
That's our housekeeping stuff.

57:26.040 --> 57:29.120
Don't forget to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

57:29.120 --> 57:31.880
We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.640
Let's get into what's been going on in the news this week.

57:34.640 --> 57:35.640
Loki.

57:35.640 --> 57:36.640
All right.

57:36.640 --> 57:42.920
So apparently the Washington State Gambling Commission has issued a warning to Valve to

57:42.920 --> 57:48.640
basically telling them, hey, you guys have to stop users from using Steam to, you know,

57:48.640 --> 57:56.680
gamble Counter Strike Go skins or else, you know, basically.

57:56.680 --> 58:02.760
I want to say there was a lawsuit against them for that, but somehow they it got dropped.

58:02.760 --> 58:08.880
But yeah, apparently, you know, it's there's quite a bit of money in it.

58:08.880 --> 58:14.560
It says that and I hardly I don't believe this number real quick.

58:14.560 --> 58:20.040
I mean, they basically according to, I guess, estimates from some e-sports betting report,

58:20.040 --> 58:24.960
they're seeing that Counter Strike Go Lounge has made approximately one billion dollars

58:24.960 --> 58:31.320
in skin gambling since January 1st and August 1st death.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.080
That's not there's no way.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.640
I'm sorry.

58:34.640 --> 58:40.680
There's maybe one million in magic money that doesn't fucking exist, but I'd one billion

58:40.680 --> 58:42.000
dollars in real money.

58:42.000 --> 58:48.520
No, no, I'm sorry that that's there's no fucking way.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.520
I mean, I don't know.

58:49.520 --> 58:53.600
I don't really know if Valve is necessarily responsible for that, because, I mean, they

58:53.600 --> 59:02.560
do facilitate you buying stuff and, you know, you can trade it and sell it on their store.

59:02.560 --> 59:06.560
It's just mainly a third party site that's kind of exploiting them to do gambling and

59:06.560 --> 59:07.560
stuff.

59:07.560 --> 59:10.560
So I don't really know how much control they have over other than, you know, banning those

59:10.560 --> 59:12.060
sites.

59:12.060 --> 59:18.800
But I mean, I mean, as long as they don't make the situation worse by, I don't know,

59:18.800 --> 59:22.760
say introducing something else that could be sold and gambled for.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.800
Oh, wait, but they just did.

59:24.800 --> 59:31.880
So yes, they're actually bringing monetized limited use sprays to Counter Strike Go.

59:31.880 --> 59:33.280
That's right, graffiti.

59:33.280 --> 59:36.680
So you can earn them in your weekly drops.

59:36.680 --> 59:42.600
You can buy them on the Steam Marketplace or purchase a community made graffiti box

59:42.600 --> 59:45.720
with the proceeds of the sale being shared among community artists.

59:45.720 --> 59:52.580
All right, I don't know if you can trade the, I assume if you're buying them in the marketplace

59:52.580 --> 59:54.260
you can probably trade them.

59:54.260 --> 59:56.180
Yeah, most of that stuff you can trade.

59:56.180 --> 59:59.620
I mean, there's parameters around when you can trade and what kinds of accounts can do

59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.500
it, because that's been exploited an awful lot.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:06.180
But you know, for the average user like you and me who are playing games, you know, the

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.020
way they're intended and so forth, yeah, you can probably trade that stuff.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:14.460
I don't know who'd want to use it, but people will buy stuff like that.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.460
They will.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:19.660
Well, and so with that, you know, that just means that's one more thing that could be

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.180
possibly thrown on that market.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.620
I don't know, it's like, I don't, I think the whole gambling thing is stupid.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:32.260
Yeah, I mean, that seems like that could be a pretty big deal that could have some big

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.540
fallout if that, you know, if Valve is found to be facilitating this type of thing, because

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.540
I guess I just never thought of the gambling.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.180
The reason they're saying they're facilitating is because they have the, I guess, the APIs

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.560
in place where you can, you know, read Steam, you know, information about Steam accounts

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.300
and stuff like that through a website.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.900
And then also they facilitate, you know, the trading and stuff.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.780
They have that back end for it.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:00.860
But I mean, it's websites using like a creative way to kind of, you know, game the system,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:01.860
I guess.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.140
And this is like that YouTube guy who is running the company on the side.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:10.220
Yeah, it's basically, so the way they kind of have it, from what I understand, they have

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:16.060
basically like an escrow account that, you know, takes the skin in and then you would

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:21.340
gamble, you know, takes the skin from everybody that's participating or gun or whatever.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:27.220
And then you're gambling, basically you pay money or pay using that skin to gamble in

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:33.240
a raffle to win something else that's more valuable, I guess.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.740
And so that's how they're supposed to be gambling.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.940
I mean, it's, it is gambling, but it's just kind of, I don't know, I mean, who's it really

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.940
hurting?

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.060
That's what I want to know.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:47.300
Like kids, are kids doing this because kids don't have any fucking money.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.300
I mean, and...

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.580
Well, they have mommy and daddy's wallet and they know how to find numbers.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.900
Mommy and daddy are fucking dumb if they're, you know, basically saying, okay, spend whatever

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:55.900
you want.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:02.300
I mean, and like, is it, you know, is it like people that are, you know, have an income

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.140
that are just dumb and betting on this stuff?

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.340
I mean, like, who's this really hurting is what I want to know.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.780
I mean, I just can't see that there's that much money in that.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:15.820
I mean, if a gambling site is making a billion dollars off this, allegedly, and then how

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.300
much money, then Valve should be just fucking rolling, no wonder there's no fucking Half

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.380
Life 3, they're rolling in fucking money.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.540
I just don't, I don't believe those numbers.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.020
Does that, does that, could that billion count when money goes in and out and back in type

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.020
of thing?

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:35.520
Like how when people win a $50 jackpot in Vegas, but they put the money right back in,

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520
you know, that type of thing.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.700
It's kind of like the money counts multiple times because it's going out and in the machines.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:45.860
I just, I mean, I don't believe those numbers.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.180
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Raginator says some people will gamble on

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:54.980
virtually anything, including when or where a farm animal shits, sadly enough.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:59.540
Yes, but that's usually for charity.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.980
People will bet on Mugen, right?

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.420
The I guess it's all fake currency.

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.540
Yeah, that's all the bet and that's just fake.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.260
I mean, that's just fake.

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.260
It's not money.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.820
Somebody's probably made it money.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.300
No, it's just, it's, it's for fun.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.580
You just go on there and you try to guess which character is going to win and then you

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580
never get it right.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580
At least in my case.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.580
All right, well, we'll shift topics.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.460
Back to the salt mines.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:26.060
We're going to shift topics here and talk about a big change that's happening in gaming

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.060
this week.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.740
Um, and uh, you know, I don't know if people will be betting on this or what have you.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.980
I bet people are going to be betting on, is it going to be successful or not?

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:40.020
But the only one that stands to win or lose money would be Sony, the makers of PlayStation

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.020
VR.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.020
That's right.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:46.460
I say gaming's changing this week because it's going to be the first console VR that

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:47.460
is being released.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.380
And that is happening this week is what the, the Thursday, the 13th is when this is happening,

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.380
right?

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.500
Um, what's pretty impressive about this is that there are a ton of games that are going

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.820
to be released, uh, the same day as the PlayStation VR.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:07.540
A partial list, Batman Arkham VR, Battlezone, Eve Gunjack and Eve Valkyrie, Harmonics Music,

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:13.860
Harmonics Music's VR game, Hatsune Miku Project Diva X, uh, Job Simulator, Super Stardust

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:20.260
Ultra VR, PlayStation VR Worlds, Rez Infinite, Rise of the Tomb Raider Blood Ties, Playroom

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.620
VR, Thumper, Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.300
Um, so that's just a partial list.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:30.300
I mean, there is a ton of games, uh, that are being released this week with the PlayStation

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.300
VR.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:35.180
Now, some of these will require the PlayStation VR, but not all of them do.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.860
For example, Rez Infinite doesn't require the PlayStation VR.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.980
It's just, you know, it's going to be a totally different experience.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.980
Yeah.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.980
With the VR.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.900
So we've been talking, Loki and I, about the PlayStation VR and that we have both, uh, pre-ordered

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:47.900
the device.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900
Yeah.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.220
I pre-ordered it, was it, I want to say almost a year ago at this point.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.220
Yeah.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.220
I feel like...

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.220
No, no, no.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.220
It wasn't a year.

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.220
It was in March.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.220
Yeah.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.220
It was in March.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.220
It was the day.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.220
It was like GDC or something around there is when they kind of did their big announcement.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.140
Yeah.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.140
And that's when I first went up on Amazon and that's when I pre-ordered my PlayStation

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.420
VR as well.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:09.380
So, um, are you looking forward to Thursday and the arrival of your PlayStation VR?

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.420
No, cause I've already canceled my pre-order.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.420
Oh.

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.420
So you canceled your pre-order.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.420
Why?

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.420
Why'd you do that?

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.220
I canceled my pre-order because one, it was expensive and I, it would really strap me

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.900
as far as money's concerned.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:25.580
Two, I didn't think I would get a lot of use out of it, seeing as I have a Gear VR for

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:31.380
my phone and I have an Oculus Rift DK2 that I don't really use.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:36.940
I kind of wanted a nice consumer headset because that would have been, you know, a lot nicer.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:42.660
But also I was kind of worried with all this, you know, PlayStation Plus stuff or not PlayStation

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:48.820
Plus, PlayStation Pro stuff that, you know, are these games going to actually play well

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.820
on this system?

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.740
I mean, I guess it's supposed to, but what exactly is that going to, you know, mix in

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.740
with it?

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:55.740
And it's just, I don't know.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:06:00.300
And I just was kind of worried that that wasn't going to be, it wasn't going to, it's going

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:06.540
to be just kind of an okay system, but really is it worth me dropping $400 plus money for

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540
games?

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.540
And that's a lot of money.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.540
I could buy an Xbox One and games for that.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.540
I mean, seriously, why, why would I do that?

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.540
And what would I get more value out of?

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.900
Probably another game console versus PlayStation VR.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.740
And on top of that, then after I canceled it, the, you know, the embargo came up for

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.580
people talking about the system and I got to watch the live streams from Giant Bomb

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.580
and stuff.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:32.300
And it only confirmed what my worries were that it's a hot mess.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.300
Really?

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.300
Yeah.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.700
Like the move controllers work about as good as the move controllers used to.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.860
I mean, they're just not very good at tracking.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:48.040
The graphics themselves are okay, but you know, it was caught, there was serious issues

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.940
with the camera tracking where your head was.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:56.940
It was just like, it literally was bouncing around like crazy and it was just, the controls

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:00.300
weren't as good as like, if you're playing on a Vive or something like that, it wasn't

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.300
as accurate.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:07.060
And just, you know, if I'm going to drop that kind of money on a headset, I'm going to pick

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.060
up something.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060
I want something that's going to be good.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.060
And come on.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.500
And knowing what this trend, what they're doing nowadays with stuff, this is going to

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.500
release now.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.820
And in a year or two later, there's going to be a better one.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.900
So why am I going to waste my time being an early adopter?

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.620
Haven't I learned anything from the Kinect, the move, the blah, blah, blah.

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.580
I mean, I know I've learned my lesson.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:27.580
I'm not going to do it.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.660
I still want to play some of that stuff because it looks fun, but is it worth five hundred

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.660
dollars? No.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:41.260
Well, I'd love to tell you what I think of my PlayStation VR that I had preordered, but

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.860
I independently came to the same conclusion you did this week and I canceled my PlayStation

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.020
VR preorder a few days ago.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.300
And I think what it is, I think you kind of hit the nail on that.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:59.380
Well, it was money is a huge component and it's the fact that, you know, I can use this

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.500
money to do a last minute trip to Chicago.

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.860
And so it's kind of one of those things where do I necessarily need to be an early adopter

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.580
on this? And I think that's what it kind of came down to for me is do I need to be the

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:15.180
person that has this first at this price level when I'm kind of unsure of what the future

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.220
holds. And I think something you said hits the nail on the head, which, you know, I'm

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.900
sure Sony diehards would tell me I'm wrong on.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:28.020
But I, I do have extreme reservations about them releasing this and the pro in the same

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:33.940
year. It's an extreme amount of mixed signals with, you know, what is this thing going to

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.060
do that the pro can or cannot do?

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:42.780
I just I honestly, as a consumer, as a gamer fan who, you know, I'm fortunate enough to

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.820
have money that I can spend on games, but I don't have all the money in the world.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.940
I just I can't justify this and the pro, not that I don't want, you know, VR to be

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.220
successful. I think it's going to be successful.

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:59.380
I hope it is. I'm not sure if I hope Sony's platform is successful, but I want it to I

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:03.580
don't want it to fail at all. I feel almost bad canceling it, but I shouldn't.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.300
I've got always hundreds of dollars.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:11.260
Right. And I'm always wary, though, of third party or third party like of accessories

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:16.860
release after the fact, because look at like the support that even like move in 3D

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:23.140
more when they're pushing 3D, like all their games are supporting 3D and like the move

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.940
controller and stuff. And they even have a stupid looking gun thing that you could get

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:29.140
for it. It was supposed to be the better way to play these games.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.140
And that just fucking fell off the table like, oh, no, we're not supporting it anymore.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.460
And then they bring back the move controllers to use with this because, oh, it's easy.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.740
We don't have to develop anything else.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.460
It's just it's old tech and it just it worked OK.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:46.260
I like the move controllers, but I'm worried that it's not going to be up to snuff for,

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.180
you know, playing a VR game like this.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.220
And it's just. I don't know, I just can't see in all these games that are coming out or

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:57.700
just seems like they're experiences, they're like shorter games.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:03.620
I mean, I don't really want to play like this tech demo of something, you know, for Final

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:10.540
Fantasy and for, you know, Tomb Raider and for Batman and all in like was it, you know,

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.020
Battlefront or something like that.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.380
It's not going to be a Battlefront game.

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.900
It's going to be kind of something different.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.060
No, I don't want to play all these little experiences.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.380
Five hundred dollars is not worth tech demos.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:25.060
If I want to play that kind of tech demo shit, I will get a fucking better computer and a

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.140
Vive or something, because then I could download tech demos for free and I can buy

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:33.260
shit on Steam, which is probably way cheaper than the shit that they're selling.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.700
Forty, you know, the sixty dollars per game.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.740
No, I am not paying that kind of money.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.740
Yeah, and I think I started to see the dollars add up with especially when you start to

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.900
see how many games are coming out and so forth.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.820
It's kind of like, whoa, I'm going to be paying for the PlayStation VR and then pay for

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.140
this and this. And it's interesting because probably what even a month ago and I

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:56.940
probably even said it on the show in my mind, I think when they announced the pro, I was

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.820
kind of in my mind, I was like, OK, I'm going to keep the VR and I'm going to cancel the

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:05.940
pro. But now, like, I don't know, I can't really pinpoint where the switch in my mind

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.060
happened, but I think the opposite is going to hold true.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.420
I think I will end up keeping the pro and I think I am going to end up getting that

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.020
system. But I'm not I kind of want to wait, wait and see where the VR is in a year.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:20.300
I want to see if this really does kind of become like the next must have thing in

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:24.780
gaming or if it is kind of more like the even with the pro, I would just hold off on

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.260
that because, like, I think that.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.820
I need to see what exactly what enhancements I mean, they're talking stuff, but like, I

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.980
don't know what the enhancements are going to be.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.300
I feel like especially considering what I might be able to get selling my current

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.580
PlayStation 4 to kind of upgrade it, I feel like it's a it's it's a smaller investment.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.260
It's only probably a couple hundred dollars at the end of the day, as opposed to five

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.740
hundred plus dollars for the VR.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.940
Does that make sense? I guess so.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.460
That's that's kind of where I'm at.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.740
Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says nothing wrong with a

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.860
wait and see approach.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:03.820
Act Def says PlayStation VR will be worth it, but right now you probably don't need it.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.180
Yeah, I mean, I went gung ho when Kinect came out.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.260
I went gung ho when like all these systems came out and it was fine.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:15.020
I had fun with them. But like in the in the end, it's just like, why did I waste all

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.740
that money on it? Why did I spend so much money on this stuff?

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:24.700
Like, I don't know, like I just I still feel that compulsion to buy it.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:28.940
Yeah. Yeah. No, I even though like even though I've seen is kind of shit and even the

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:32.980
reviews have been just kind of like I want to say Game Informer, give it like a C minus

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.900
and like people are just like, oh, my God, you know, this is a mess.

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.860
And they even like just watch the giant bomb stream.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.220
They have like four hours where they're playing around with it.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:44.140
Just watch it. I mean, you just seem like, holy shit, this is what they're fucking

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.380
releasing in this state.

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.340
It's just. I don't know.

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:53.020
I mean, yeah, it's interesting, because I hadn't even seen or heard any of that when I

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.020
finally made the decision.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:59.660
Well, and in the interest of disclosing something else that I kind of ultimately

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:04.140
helped me be at peace with my decision, my pal Shane is keeping his preorder.

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.220
So when you know that your good buddy who's over at your house at least once, if not

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.780
twice a week, ended up buying it, you're like, you'll bring it over and I'll get to

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.300
play it at some point.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:20.340
It looks nice. I may end up instead, you know, I saw that they announced a new the one

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:23.380
of the first phones that's going to support that dream thing.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:30.900
The so the new VR, it's not really a headset, it's like lenses and stuff for.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.420
So there's the Google Pixel.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:38.180
I may upgrade my phone and do that instead, because none of that necessarily need new

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.500
phone. But I mean, the payments aren't that expensive.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.740
And a nice new phone would be nice, I guess.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.300
And then I can see what VR looks like on that.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.460
I think the screen was at 4K or something.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.220
I mean, that'd be pretty sweet, you know, on a phone.

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.180
But yeah, yeah, I don't know.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.940
Maybe that might be the route to go or nothing.

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:03.140
I mean, my phone's fine. The other thought I was like, I should rebuild my DDR pads.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:06.020
I've been wanting to do that for a long time now.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:09.660
In fact, I'm actually in the point where I'm gathering all my notes because I had it

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:13.900
before fucking Windows decided, hey, we're going to crash and erase everything.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:20.260
I had actually sketched out a new pad design I was going to make and then it went away.

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:23.860
But I have all my notes on paper, so I'm going to put that digital again.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.340
All right. So, you know, it's it's it's a weird place.

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:31.580
I wish the PlayStation VR a lot of success, but I just kind of want to take a wait and see

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.860
approach where it's going to be any year.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:38.220
And I really feel like, unfortunately, the throwing the pro into it really muddled a lot

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:43.020
of and it caused all these questions about is it going to be the best here or am I going

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.260
to end up having to buy both, which is a lot to ask in a year?

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:49.660
I just I think the reality is that muddled the message way too much.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.300
Like, here's the thing, even like with the pro and stuff like that, it's like, am I going

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:57.220
to drop money on another console and what are my gains really on that?

01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.220
Or could I buy a new PC?

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:03.660
Because like like even like games and stuff, we're going to talk about a little bit later,

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.220
just like dealing with, you know, issues.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.020
I mean, PCs have their issues, too, with like some of these ported games.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:14.460
But like, am I going to just I can buy a lot of these console games, like even like No Man's

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.420
Sky was like, oh, I got to get PS4 for that.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:22.220
They had on Steam. And then in the end, it's like, OK, I was anticipating that.

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:26.620
I mean, it's like there's not a whole lot that you like, especially like PCs sounding

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:32.340
really good because now I can get my No Man's Sky and I can get my Forza Horizon three.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.780
Why do I need two consoles?

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:38.900
I can just have a PC, which funny enough, you would have thought that I would have been

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:40.780
all over Forza Horizon three this week.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:44.380
But I just, you know, with with the traveling and with having other stuff to play right

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.820
now, I just I haven't jumped on that bandwagon right away.

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.220
I thought I would have been all about that.

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:53.340
I probably won't end up buying Forza Horizon three until after I'm back from Vegas, honestly.

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.340
So I have a month break between weekend trips.

01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:03.100
So but anyway, yeah, so I I'm going to I will probably end up holding onto the pro.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.300
I'm going to pick that up this year.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.340
And then next holiday, I'll evaluate VR.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.660
I want to see if it's still supported in a year.

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.420
I want to see kind of what they're talking about.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.860
Microsoft does, because they're going to have their system.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.740
And who knows? By then, VR support.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.220
Yeah, because we don't know if Microsoft's going to win.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.620
We know they have AR, but we don't know if they're going to do VR.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.460
So it'll be interesting.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.860
Well, they talked about like their system would support VR.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.780
So. Let's see what they do.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.260
I mean, let's see. Oh, and maybe we'll see what the annex is by then.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.220
Maybe they'll have an announcement by that.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.140
We were going to do so good and not even bring up an X tonight.

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.900
And there you go. There you go. You be quiet.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.140
All right. Well, I'm just let me put it this way.

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:43.820
Here's here's my my parallel with the annex.

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.660
And this is because like look at like we didn't know.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.740
Yeah, I had more about this, but like it's like we didn't really know too much about

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.300
like PlayStation VR until now.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:59.780
And and I just think we're just going to be disappointed because we're making up in

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.020
our head what it's going to be.

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:05.980
And what they have is probably not as exciting as what we're imagining it to be.

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:10.580
This all being said, I will be buying and playing the ever living shit out of the

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.780
Rez Infinite just just so we're clear.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:17.460
Some of these games that don't require the VR, I will still be buying and playing the

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.420
crap out of and starting with Rez.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:23.380
So just to be clear, this doesn't change my love of Rez whatsoever.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.260
All right. Let's let's move on to some more news.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.780
Loki. All right.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.340
So Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:37.380
Guess what? There's still going to get mods on PlayStation 4.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:43.620
But there's a little bit of a catch with that.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.500
So mods are going to be coming.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:51.980
So first, the mods, I believe, are coming to Skyrim, ironically, first.

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.620
And then later on, they're going to be coming to Fallout 4.

01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:03.180
The main issue, though, that's going to differ between the what's available on PC and

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:08.740
Xbox versus PlayStation 4 is PlayStation 4, you will not be able to use external assets.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:14.580
So you're only going to be able to use the assets that are on the disk or digital copy

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.300
or whatever. So you're not going to have like, you know, reskins or, you know, new

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:24.860
models, you know, lightsabers, that type of stuff that's not going to be available to

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.900
you. But, you know, all the other stuff that tweaks and, you know, other tweaks that

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.580
they have available, those could be something that you'll see.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.100
Is this to try to prevent nudie mods?

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.180
No, this is I think to get around their weird compression and formats that they have to

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.660
have their external stuff in.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.580
It's still disappointing, but I'll take it.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.940
Does that mean I'm going to buy Skyrim on PlayStation 4?

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:53.780
Probably not. If I get an Xbox one, I'm fucking buying it on that.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.620
I'm just excited.

01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:01.180
At least they're getting some type of mods on PlayStation 4, because we were looking at

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.220
exactly something's better than nothing.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.060
I'll take something. I don't really need the reskins and stuff like that.

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.820
I mean, honestly, from what I had on PC, I didn't have a lot of things that changed the

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.940
model. So I think some of the stuff was kind of cool, like the dubstep gun and stuff like

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.460
that. And of course, you got to put the nudie mods in there, too.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.420
I mean, because because we're all children.

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.700
So, I mean, that's fine.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.100
And, you know, I am a little disappointed that we're not going to have the Macho Man and

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.740
Randy Savage dragons in Skyrim on console.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:37.580
But, you know what? Once again, this is where PC fucking this excels versus the goddamn

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.180
consoles. All right.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:44.900
Well, then how about some really, you know, highly anticipated games being released on PC

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.420
such as Final Fantasy 15, Final Fantasy 15?

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.660
Some folks have been asking, is this going to come out on the PC?

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.940
And in fact, the co-director of the game, Hajime Tabata, has said that if they are to

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:02.980
develop a PC version of the game, it's going to take at least a year, probably more than a

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:08.500
year. And this is in an interview with a Spanish website called Vida Extra, which, you

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:13.540
know, is floating around out there and being translated and so forth, saying that on that

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:18.060
hypothesis, not talking about something real, just an idea, something like this would take

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.180
us more than a year.

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:23.860
We should work to adapt the engine, which is very laborious, and from there develop its

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.980
course. And this is a little bit of a changing course from what was said back in April

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.860
where they were saying they were going to take a good, hard look at bringing Final Fantasy

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:35.420
15 to PC after it was launched on consoles.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.220
But, you know, now that's going to be a huge amount of development time.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.500
But imagine the ways people would just mod Final Fantasy 15, you know?

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.980
Well, I don't think it's necessarily a worry of modding.

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.740
I'm just surprised it's going to take them so long, being that these platforms are now

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:51.820
kind of very similar to the PC in the first place.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:55.740
I'm just surprised. I thought development time would have been shortened because of

01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.460
that. But I don't know.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.580
Yeah, you would think it would have been a shortened development time, but apparently,

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:06.340
yeah, they say it's going to take a year to do that.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.940
So whatever. Got time.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:13.980
You still got to wonder if maybe it will depend on how well Final Fantasy 15 sells on

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:18.060
consoles if they want to invest those resources to develop for PC or not.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.100
I think it's going to sell fine, but I think it'll sell fine, too.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.380
We'll see. But anyway, Loki.

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:31.980
All right, so there's going to be some Pokemon Go updates, actually, I think.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.420
I'm not sure when these are going to be happening and if they've happened.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.820
No, not yet. So they're going to be doing some tweaks.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.260
They're going to be improving the gyms.

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:46.100
So now when you're going to train your Pokemon on gyms, you can actually take up to six

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.740
Pokemon because before, you know, when you battle a gym, you choose six, and when you

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.580
train, you only choose one, which is kind of odd.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.940
Then also what's going to be nice is the medals that you earn right now, which are

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:00.260
pretty just kind of pointless.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.580
They're actually going to have a point pretty soon.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:07.940
So any medals you earn for, like, say, catching the same type Pokemon or walking a

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:13.100
certain distance and stuff, they'll give you perks to basically improve stats to

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:18.580
catching Pokemon, make it a little bit easier to capture Pokemon or increasing the

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:23.300
odds of capturing the same type or rare ones or whatever the case may be.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.700
And they were saying that the medals you get for catching a certain amount of Pokemon

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:31.860
will affect the capture rates of their type.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:36.620
So like, you know, if you get poison type or something, it'll make it easier to catch

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.100
poison type Pokemon or something like that.

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:41.420
Well, that'll be good for folks who feel like it's too hard to capture things right

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:41.700
now.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.500
Well, dude, yeah, I think some of the stuff that happened, like some of these

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.380
Pokemon, it's just really silly.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:50.660
Like, you know, I've gotten Pikachus or whatever.

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.540
That'll be like CP 31 or something like that.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:57.300
And I throw I mean, it's bright green on the ring.

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.460
It's like, OK, this should be an easy capture.

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:05.340
I do a spin balls, you know, it's a perfect throw and it's like, fuck you, I'm escaping

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:05.980
and I ran away.

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.260
It's like, what the hell is that?

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:12.420
It's like I'm not going to waste a more powerful ball to catch this weak ass Pokemon.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:16.540
I got to admit, though, ever since I got the accessory, I've been playing more.

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:21.500
I finally hit level 20 and I'm damn near level 21 in Pokemon Go because I evolved a

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:24.940
bunch of shit today because I've been getting so much Pidgey candy and Rotata candy from

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:29.500
just catching the shitty mon with the little app that I have or I'm sorry, the little

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:31.100
physical device that I have.

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:35.340
So I've been playing more of Pokemon Go thanks to that thing, I got to say.

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.940
And the crappy thing about it, though, is that I run out of pokeballs, the regular ones

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:45.180
so fast that actually I do only use great and ultra balls to capture Pokemon on the

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.420
phone now because I need all my regular stuff to use my device.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:52.820
Otherwise, I end up in the shitty position that I was in when I was at gamer X and I

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.740
actually have to buy more pokeballs, which sucks.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.940
Yeah, exactly what they would want you to do.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.260
Yeah, I know, I know I won't do that again.

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.460
I promise I won't have to stick again.

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.860
I just have to do a quick note for the live listeners while I'm showing that we are

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.660
streaming right now.

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.500
We're going up and down with the live stream and unfortunately is completely out of my

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.100
control.

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:17.020
It's some type of error I've not seen before on Winamp where it's saying it's hanging on

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.060
the receiving authorization response.

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.020
So unfortunately, this is on our server host side, which, you know, things have been

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.700
running pretty smooth for the past few months.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.900
I wonder if the inclement weather out there is fucking things up or something, but it's

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:30.700
unfortunate.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.380
You mean the hurricane doesn't push those packets even faster?

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.620
That's not how it works?

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.300
Shush.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.980
But yeah, unfortunately, that is happening live.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:43.340
But we're still recording everything for the sake of the podcast, folks.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.180
So, you know, we've been talking a few stories here.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:49.020
So we're just going to keep recording it for nothing else to say a podcast.

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.340
I apologize to live listeners.

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.260
But again, like a lot of live things, there are just some situations that are out of my

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:55.420
control. And this is one of them.

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.940
It's not our Internet's working fine here in the house.

01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.420
And, you know, there's no weird anomalies on our websites or anything.

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:04.020
And I show it just went down again and then reconnected there.

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.060
So it's that sucks.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.900
What can you do? I may be during the Classic Game of the Week, if this is still happening,

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.940
I'll go do a quick recycle of our Internet, see if that helps.

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:16.340
But unfortunately, I kind of doubt it.

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.500
I really think this is on our server side right now.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.100
So there you go.

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:24.540
All right. For now, though, before we get to the Classic Game of the Week, we still have

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.620
some more news. And I want to talk about Bloodstained, right?

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:33.820
This is the highly anticipated Kickstarter that, you know, it's not Castlevania, but

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.900
wink, wink, it's going to pretty much be Castlevania.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.540
Well, in more of a sense than Mighty No. 9, it's not Mega Man.

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:46.180
But anyway, so Bloodstained was pushed back to 2018.

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:50.060
That was some news that came out is that they're pushing Bloodstained back to 2018, which

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.420
is anyone surprised?

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:52.900
Nope, didn't think so.

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:58.580
But what does this mean for the Wii U and the Vita ports of the game?

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:03.980
Because by 2018, is the Wii U really going to be a thing anymore?

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.100
I mean, if they keep pushing back this NX thing, maybe it will be.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:11.420
But, you know, this brings up a very interesting question is that at the time they did

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.100
this Kickstarter, they probably figured that the Wii U and the Vita versions were very

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.540
important, but now not so much.

01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:20.260
Right. So, yeah.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:26.740
So there was some questions posed to Koji Igarashi about the Wii U port and so forth.

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.140
And he said, yes, it's a complicated problem.

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.940
As timelines move on, certain pieces of hardware become irrelevant.

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.140
However, this was a game that was backed by people and we made promises to listen to

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.540
them. They're the people that gave us life, so to speak.

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:43.700
Any sort of change that we do or are considering that goes outside the scope of the

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:48.300
promises we've made must be done with lots of explanation, care and done with lots of

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.300
back and forth with them to see what options we have.

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.980
So in other words, he's kind of saying that, you know, we kind of promised it on the Wii

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.020
U, so we have to deliver it on the Wii U.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:01.060
But if we hear from our backers that this again, my interpretation is if we hear from

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:04.820
our backers that they would be OK with us moving that to Nintendo NX or, you know,

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.860
whatever that system ends up being, then we'll do it.

01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:10.540
So it'll be interesting to see what develops with that.

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:14.580
I think a lot of people may have backed this because it was going to Wii U.

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:19.140
You know, there's been a lot of Nintendo fans that want to see more software on Wii U.

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:22.820
So I know there's a lot of people that backed Shovel Knight, that backed, you know, some

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.460
of these other games to get the Wii U ports to happen.

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.460
So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out if they choose to

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:35.580
cancel the Wii U release, although I would think if they promise it for NX, then it's

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:41.700
going to be OK. Or even better, if NX is straight up backwards compatible with Wii U's

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:45.940
digital library. I know, I know, it's a stretch.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.780
However, who knows? Who knows?

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:52.220
But if that could be a thing that maybe, you know, it would work on both.

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.500
I hope that's a thing.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.780
That would be awesome.

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.540
I purchased all digital on the Wii U.

01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:59.500
Yeah, of course, I'm very much expecting.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.740
We don't know how fucking networking works.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.780
And so we can't tie our stores together.

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:06.900
We'll see. We'll see. We'll give them a chance.

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:13.020
No offense, and that's not even necessarily a Nintendo thing, because, you know, there's

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:17.260
been a lot of, no, actually, no, I think there's only a Nintendo thing now that I think

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:18.860
of it. Yeah, fuck them.

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.540
All right. Moving on, a few more stories here before we get to the classic game of the

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.140
week. Loki.

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:31.420
Speaking of fucking them, Digital Homicide, the wonderful shovelware developer who was

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:37.580
suing Steam users for negative reviews or comments left about their games, they have

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:44.340
decided to drop their suit, probably because they basically said that they are requesting

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:50.940
to dismiss the matter since, I guess, it's a function of financial inability, even

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.140
though they said that they believe their case was strong.

01:28:53.140 --> 01:29:02.060
Yeah, as Alan Alchemy in chat says over at live.vognetwork.com, what a shock.

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.300
Yes, I'm so surprised.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.100
We're going to die from that surprise.

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:11.340
Yeah, so good for them, I guess.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:18.420
Well, let's move from talking about that studio to an awesome studio, and that is Jackbox

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.540
Games, who's been on this show a couple of times.

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:22.980
They were here for Jackbox Party Pack 1.

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.580
Jackbox Party Pack 2.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.380
And guess what's coming out real soon?

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.540
Jackbox Party Pack 3.

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.580
And there is a release date that has been announced for that.

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:36.940
October 18th is when the Jackbox Party Pack will be out on all of the different platforms

01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:41.580
that it's scheduled to come out on, except Xbox One, which comes out on the 21st of

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:45.220
October. That's probably because the whole staggered kind of Xbox One stuff happens,

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.540
usually happens on like Thursdays.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:50.780
So anyway, it's just a few days late on Xbox One that probably won't matter in the big

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.620
scope of things.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:56.500
Jackbox Party Pack, again, several party games that you'll be able to play with smart

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:01.860
phones, things that are designed for streaming as well, which is a thing that they've

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.220
embraced. And they talked about that on some of their previous interviews.

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:08.780
The games that will be included in the Jackbox Party Pack, Quiplash 2.

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.460
So the sequel to that game.

01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:12.020
But that's the only sequel.

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.780
The other games are going to be all new.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:18.100
Trivia Murder Party is the next game that they're doing.

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:18.700
That's awesome.

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:22.740
That's a deadly quiz show where you match wits with a trivia obsessed killer.

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.660
So that'll be fun.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:25.020
I love that.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:25.740
I love that.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:31.300
There's also one called Gespionage, which they're saying is the data mining guessing

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.620
game. That looks like it'll be fun based on the previews.

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:35.860
T-K-O.

01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.020
That's T-E-E-K-O.

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:43.380
It is a T-shirt game where you battle your custom T-shirts to the death.

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:47.460
So it sounds like you make custom T-shirts and then they battle each other, like probably

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.820
a voting type thing that a lot of the Jackbox Party Pack games do.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:57.380
And then lastly is a game called Fakin' It, where one of your friends is hiding something

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.100
in this game for tricksters.

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:01.900
I'm assuming it's probably like one of those like two truths and a lie type of games.

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.340
So that will be in the Party Pack as well.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.500
Only one controller required for navigating menus.

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.420
Otherwise, everything is played on mobile devices and tablets and so forth.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:16.340
There's an audience mode for streamers, allowing 10,000 people to participate with some

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.300
of the games as well.

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:18.860
Yeah, I know.

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:20.180
I love Trivia Murder Party.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.740
That's the best name out of all those.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.260
So that'll be a lot of fun. So good luck to our buddies over at a Jackbox game with the

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:27.140
release of that.

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:30.980
I mean, I understand with broadcasting stuff live and stuff like that, it's too bad they

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:35.340
don't have like TV shows like that where you can play like 10,000 people at once, like

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.340
actually live.

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.980
Oh, you mean like one versus 100 like they used to have on Xbox 360?

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.260
Yeah, I'm talking about like, you know, like a TV show on TV.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.180
Not necessarily.

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:47.100
You know.

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.300
Oh, like something.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.140
Oh, didn't they try to do it?

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.460
Wasn't there that Seacrest hosted thing on NBC, the million dollar...

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.060
What the hell was it?

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.660
Oh, I've already lost interest.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.660
All right, but you'll be picking up the Jackbox Party Pack, right, Loki?

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.140
I haven't picked up the other ones.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:05.580
Probably not.

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:05.900
What?

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.020
I don't play with a lot of people, so yeah.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:11.060
You'll probably play it at somebody else's house.

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:13.180
It's like I'll play the PlayStation VR through Shane.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.540
Because he'll bring it over here.

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:15.140
So you'll play...

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.780
I'll try the VR when he brings it over.

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:18.660
All right.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:22.860
Anyway, let's travel back to a simpler time when we weren't...

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:23.260
We didn't...

01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.740
We couldn't play games on our mobile phones.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.220
In fact, we probably didn't even have mobile phones at all.

01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:31.220
Our phones were still stuck on the wall and you had to have a cord.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.020
We're going to take a trip to memory lane with our...

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:34.420
What are you talking about?

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:36.580
I play games over my phone all the time.

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:39.820
Oh, is that like calling the weather or the...

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:40.780
No, it's a modem.

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:41.980
Oh, yeah.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:42.380
All right.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.260
Tricky trick.

01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:43.580
All right.

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.220
Modems were the only way to do it.

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.540
It's the classic game of the week.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.020
And thanks to the magic of radio.

01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.540
Here she is, everybody.

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.660
Dark Sakura.

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:56.780
Hi.

01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:57.660
How are you?

01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.660
Full of orange chicken.

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:00.780
Yes.

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.420
Thank you for going to Panda Express.

01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.260
I appreciate that.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.180
That's what I do.

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:04.780
That's right.

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.380
So I'm going to take a moment to enjoy the fried panda.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:09.580
The Dark Sakura got me from Panda Express.

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.340
And you're all going to check out this week's classic game of the week.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.260
Yay.

01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:14.860
Dark Sakura.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:17.020
What did you pick for the kids, boys and girls?

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:20.700
I picked a game that I wanted to buy at gamer X.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:22.620
It was 176 bucks.

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:23.700
176 bucks.

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.020
And I think I already have a copy.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:31.780
Lords of Thunder, specifically the really awesome version that

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:34.380
came on the PC Engine duo.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:35.580
Listen to this music.

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:37.860
I want to rock.

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.260
Isn't that great?

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.100
It's pretty great.

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:41.740
It's totally a product of its time.

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.780
Um, in Japan, it was known as Winds of Thunder and it was a shoot

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:49.740
them up by Hudson's Loft and Red Entertainment.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.780
Lords is so much more metal.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.460
Right.

01:33:53.980 --> 01:34:01.220
At any rate, um, it came out for the Turbo Graphics, uh, duo, um, in 1993.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.580
And it also was ported to the Sega CD in 1995.

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:12.260
Um, the Turbo CD version came out on virtual console, um, in February, 2008.

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:17.620
And the game itself is an unofficial followup to Gate of Thunder.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.660
And as you can tell, it's got a pretty bad-ass rocking soundtrack.

01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.260
It's metal as fuck.

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.220
We don't talk about Gates on this show.

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.820
Oh, Gates of Thunder.

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:29.380
Oh, that's fine.

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:29.780
That's fine.

01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:30.980
Okay.

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.380
That's fine.

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:32.940
Girl.

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:40.940
Anyway, the game is, uh, about an evil God and his dark generals that get

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:48.740
woken up and fuck shit up in the world and inherit this armor from your ancestor

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:54.580
Drack, the legendary knight Duran, goes off to defeat the army, not want a grandpa

01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.100
Drack.

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.140
It's the ancestor.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:03.820
Might not be his grandfather, but anyway, you select, uh, this, uh, the stage.

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:07.180
You actually get the first six stages and you can select them kind of like how it

01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.580
happened in Thunder Force Three.

01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:13.420
Um, and then you pick one of four armors to use that gives you different

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.580
shots and different bombs.

01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:21.460
Um, the game itself is great, especially the Turbo version.

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:25.220
The Sega CD version was kind of considered a bit of a weak sauce

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:31.860
translation, um, even though, uh, it was fairly close to it.

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:38.380
It's basically the Sega CD really needed shooters and, uh, Lords of Thunder was

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.940
a really, really good shooter to have on it.

01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:43.540
It just was dated by the time it came out.

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.060
I think it came out like two years later.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:52.220
Um, but if you've got the virtual console version, you'll have the

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:56.420
Turbo graphics version and it is far superior of the two.

01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.060
It's just such a good game.

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.940
And really it's just standard shooter fair.

01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:02.580
Wow.

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:06.900
I don't know why all of a sudden in the middle of the video, do they do that on

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:10.380
YouTube now, they just play ads for other stuff right in the middle of the video.

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.820
I don't know because I have ad block.

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.820
That's ridiculous.

01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.260
I thought this computer had it too.

01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:15.900
It's red.

01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.700
There's a particular ad block for Google.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:18.820
Well, that's embarrassing.

01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:19.980
Or for YouTube.

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.060
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:21.780
Bring back the metal.

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:22.940
Thank you.

01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:23.940
We want our butt rock.

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:30.100
Uh, anyway, well, since I've been completely derailed, my bad.

01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.220
And there's only the two versions of this.

01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.300
We'll go ahead and put the nail in the coffin for Lords of thunder.

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:37.580
Get it.

01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:38.140
Yeah.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:38.860
Coffin.

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:45.780
Okay.

01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:46.260
All right.

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:46.820
There it is.

01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:52.020
Your classic game of the week, Lords of thunder, but only on the Turbo.

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.100
Well, the Sega version's okay.

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:56.460
Not the Sega, not the Sega CD.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.500
Fuck Sega CD.

01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:58.940
Throw it in the garbage.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.220
I have one.

01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:00.900
Burn it.

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:01.860
I have two of them.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:02.740
I have three of them.

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:03.340
Technically.

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:04.500
You know what would be metal?

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:05.220
I have a CDX.

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:06.260
Destroy one of them.

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.340
But they're expensive now.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:12.060
I'm not so metal that I'm not frugal.

01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:13.460
All right.

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.260
Lords of thunder is your classic game of the week.

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:18.660
Thank you, dark Sakura.

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.740
Have a rocking day.

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:20.580
You're welcome.

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:21.300
And I will.

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:40.260
So while we were out last week, some other news that they announced was that they're going to be bringing over a game to America that has been out in Japan since like 2011.

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:43.980
It's been out in Japan for five years and we're finally getting it.

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:45.700
It's not a video game though.

01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.540
It's a trading card game.

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:54.540
The Final Fantasy trading card game will be coming out here in the States on October 28th, 2016.

01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:55.420
So that's pretty exciting.

01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:58.220
The first set coming out called Opus One.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:00.260
It has 216 cards with it.

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:07.980
Apparently there's also going to be some other decks available at launch, including Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 10 and Final Fantasy 13 starter sets.

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:12.260
And of course there will be booster sets because that's how trading card games work.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:24.420
So all the cards feature designs by Yoshitaka Amano, Tetsuya Nomura, Akihiko Yoshida, there will be standard and premium foil versions of it.

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:29.260
So if you want to see how this game works, there's already some YouTubes that are going out there.

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.260
Square Enix is putting some stuff up on the YouTube about how to play the game.

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:38.020
And I got to admit as a Final Fantasy fan boy, this sounds like something I might want to learn how to play.

01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:38.980
It looks pretty cool.

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:45.860
Do you know of any other games you can think of that would translate well to a trading card game, Loki?

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.140
Do you think there's any other series you'd like to see become a trading card game?

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.100
No, I can't really think of anything.

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.780
Surprisingly, there's not really...

01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:01.420
I actually know it would be kind of fun or kind of cute, but I don't know how they would play.

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:05.340
But Enter the Gungeon, I'd like to just because the art style is pretty awesome.

01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.140
I'd love to see that.

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:06.580
Yeah.

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:06.980
Yeah.

01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:07.380
All right.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.780
Yeah, I don't really know.

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:12.260
I like this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.540
Act Def says, I use STAB on Aerith.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.900
Maybe that'll be a move you can actually do in the trading card game.

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:19.340
I don't know.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.540
I like retro stuff, so it would always be cool to see.

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:24.700
I want to see the Guardian Legend become a trading card game.

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:25.580
All right, that might...

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.980
That may not work so well.

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:27.700
How does that work?

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:28.940
I don't know.

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.100
How does the game work?

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.660
Two phases, shoot and explore.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.900
Doesn't necessarily have to be a complex card game.

01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.980
No Man's Sky, the collectible card game.

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:39.020
Oh, there you go.

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.980
You're on a planet and there's stuff there.

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:45.180
You leave the planet.

01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:46.540
And some of the cards are just blank.

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.100
This planet looks exactly like the other planet.

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.620
Or there was a card here that we've removed from the deck.

01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:57.940
Every week that you play, you have to remove two cards from your deck

01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:59.740
permanently because some features got eliminated.

01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:02.380
I like that.

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:05.700
You've now achieved the worst score possible on Steam.

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.820
All right, I'm just kidding.

01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.940
Dungeon Buster is quoting me there saying,

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:13.380
wow, I'm just throwing a little unnecessary shade.

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:13.620
Come on.

01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:16.620
Actually, the concept of No Man's Sky and exploring play...

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:18.460
Actually, that would, I mean, all seriousness,

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.500
actually kind of make a cool trading card game, I think.

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:22.340
You know, I'm sure, please.

01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:25.380
I'm sure there's got to be other space exploration card games

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:26.860
that are out there and plenty.

01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:30.220
I'm just not as well versed in the tabletop side of things,

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.020
but I'm sure I've seen something like that before.

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.140
So, you know, but something that, you know,

01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.700
kind of branded with that No Man's Sky stuff.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.340
Or how about we do Day of the Tentacle?

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.940
You can have the three different timelines

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.820
and then you do stuff and it affects the other timelines.

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.740
Well, anyway, regardless,

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:47.620
I'm looking forward to the Final Fantasy trading card game.

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.980
I don't usually get super into trading card games.

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.060
You know, I used to play Magic back in the day,

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.980
but not so much anymore.

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:57.860
But Final Fantasy, you know, I got a weak spot for that series.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.060
So I'll check that out.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.660
Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.980
and quickly touch on a few other things that happened through the week.

01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.740
OK, so I remember correctly,

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:09.380
I think, wasn't TwitchCon going on at the same time as GamerX

01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.060
or something like that?

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.380
TwitchCon was the exact same weekend as GamerX in a different city.

01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.260
It was in SoCal in San Diego this year.

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.420
Right, so one of the things that was announced

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:22.180
shortly around there was that Twitch Prime is going to be a new thing.

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:26.860
It's a premium experience that is included with Amazon Prime.

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:31.500
And so with that, you get a free game or a free game loot every month.

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:35.500
So, cool, I guess.

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:38.380
I mean, since you are paying for Amazon Prime,

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:41.180
it's nice to get more and more things with it.

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:45.460
Along with, it looks like with Twitch Prime,

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:49.700
you can also, let's see here,

01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.740
get ad-free viewing.

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.900
So that's kind of nice.

01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:59.740
And exclusive emotes and chat badge.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.300
And one free channel subscription every 30 days.

01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:08.220
That alone is going to be huge for the economy on Twitch,

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.860
because there's a lot of streamers that make a secondary income off,

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.020
or even maybe primary income for some people,

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.580
off those subscriptions.

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:21.500
So the fact that many people like myself already have Amazon Prime.

01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.900
So for me, this is really a something for nothing for me,

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.620
even though, yes, I know it's not nothing

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.460
because I'm paying yearly for Amazon Prime.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.260
And this is going to be an excuse for them to jack up the price again.

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.940
However, I enjoy Amazon Prime enough

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:39.340
that I would have renewed it with or without this.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.660
So the fact that this is going to be a part of it too is cool.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.660
And so this will allow me to throw free money every month at a streamer.

01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:50.940
And maybe someday if I stop doing so many podcasts in a week

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.300
and do more streaming, it's something that could be benefit me too,

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.860
is that some folks could subscribe to my stream

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.460
and kick money back that way.

01:42:58.460 --> 01:42:59.940
So that's huge.

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.460
Yeah, so I was really happy to hear this news.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.060
I think a lot of us were waiting to hear,

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.660
you know, what's going to come of this Amazon marriage.

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.100
Is there going to be a Twitch Prime?

01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:13.500
People were asking that the very first day this was announced.

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.780
So that's pretty cool.

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:19.180
So Oculus, during their Oculus Connect keynote,

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:23.260
they had revealed that the Oculus Touch controllers

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.180
are going to be coming out this year.

01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:28.780
Looks like December 6th, and they're going to cost $199.

01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:31.700
Along with that, they're include two games,

01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:34.580
including VR Sports Challenge and The Unspoken.

01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:38.620
You know, and I remember that like Oculus,

01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:41.620
one of the things that they were touting is that they were cheaper than the Vive,

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:43.900
but not anymore.

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.300
Not with this.

01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:49.580
I mean, you kind of need this for the experience, and that's expensive.

01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:52.740
I mean, I guess that is an advantage

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.540
that PlayStation VR has, too bad their controllers are shit.

01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.580
So they need to come up.

01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:59.460
No, seriously, all they need to do is fix the camera issues

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.940
where it can't track you very well.

01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:02.740
That can be done with a firmware update,

01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:06.100
and come up with a new controller, new motion controller,

01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:07.340
and then I'll be on board.

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:11.980
All right, well, moving on to free games.

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.580
Maybe you don't want to pay that type of money for your gaming rig,

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:16.020
but if you want something free,

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:19.180
you can get Beyond Good and Evil free on the PC,

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:22.140
but you do have to have a Uplay account.

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:23.780
But I think most people have that anyway,

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:25.980
because they probably got convinced to sign up for one

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:27.740
through one of the other Ubisoft games.

01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:30.980
But you will be able to get Beyond Good and Evil free on PC.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.460
That is free from October 12th, so that's going to be this week.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.740
Yeah, so they're one game free a month thing that they've been doing.

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.860
Yeah, so that's pretty cool.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:41.140
So some other games that were released,

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.500
Prince of Persia, Sands of Time, Splinter Cell, Rayman Origins, The Crew,

01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:47.700
Beyond Good and Evil is this upcoming month.

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.100
And some people, this is like one of their favorite games ever made,

01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:53.020
and there's always those rumors about a sequel.

01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.380
So I think some folks will be excited to check that out,

01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:59.420
and maybe some folks that missed that the first time around.

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:02.980
Also, Street Fighter V is chugging along.

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.740
Now the people have calmed down a little bit.

01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.580
Now they have story mode in the game.

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.860
But some other extras are going to be coming to Street Fighter V,

01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:13.380
including Halloween costumes and stage updates

01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:15.860
to go for the month of October.

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.220
The costumes will be available for $4.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:19.780
That will be 10 different colors there,

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:22.980
and the special Halloween stage can be purchased for $2

01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:27.380
or 40,000 fight money, which I'm assuming is the in-game currency.

01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:30.020
I haven't played a lot of Street Fighter V, admittedly.

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.140
So they were able to do that at New York Comic-Con,

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:34.340
which I think happened this past weekend.

01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:36.100
They were able to try that out.

01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:38.540
And then the exclusive content is going to be available

01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:42.380
from October 11th this week through November 29th.

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.700
And then that's it.

01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.380
It is limited time stuff.

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:49.220
So if you are wanting to get your Halloween on, check that out.

01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:54.180
That is a Ghostly Ryu, a Franken-Nash, and a Wolfman Nakali

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:58.140
are the different costumes that you can check out.

01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.420
Supposedly, though, Street Fighter V not the only game

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.940
that's getting Halloween costumes.

01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:06.300
Overwatch also going to be getting some spooky loot boxes.

01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:09.620
I'm assuming this is going to be very similar to their...

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:12.340
They didn't call it the Olympic event, but it was the Olympic event,

01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:15.380
the Summer Games event or whatever they're doing.

01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.980
This was leaked from the Xbox store.

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.980
There's a screen that got snapped that's floating around the internet

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:24.300
that shows that you can purchase Halloween loot boxes.

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.780
So, yeah, probably something that is going to come out

01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.420
with some new Halloween skins for the characters

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:34.820
and probably some poses and things like that as well.

01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:39.820
Also, something that has been noted is that the box art

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.140
contains the skull logo, a purple skull logo,

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:45.700
that is often associated with Sombra,

01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:48.380
who's supposed to be the next rumored hero in the game.

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:51.700
It was actually rumored to be the first hero announced for the game,

01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.100
even though they did Anna instead.

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.820
And Blizzard has also been said somewhere else

01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.220
that the next character for Overwatch is coming sooner rather than later.

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:02.820
So it could all be lining up,

01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.020
or it could just be a typical Blizzard misnomer.

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.100
But who knows? That could be coming very soon.

01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:11.540
It should be noted, though, that BlizzCon is not too far away.

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.940
I think it's the first weekend in November.

01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:16.340
So I don't think they would hold off the Halloween stuff

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.300
till early November. That doesn't make sense.

01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:20.700
But wouldn't it be great if they would come out at BlizzCon

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.860
and say, there's a new character in Overwatch today?

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.460
That might be a big thing. So who knows?

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:29.420
We'll see. Halloween events in different games.

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:30.460
Enjoy them.

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.820
Meanwhile, let's take a look at the new things

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:34.860
that will be arriving in stores this week.

01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.700
Loki, what about in the US? What's in stores this week?

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.500
There's a lot of things coming out of this week.

01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:41.220
So let's start off with 100-foot robot golf.

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.700
That's coming out in PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:45.580
Oh, God, it's all the PlayStation VR games.

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.340
Oh, here we go. Get a book.

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:50.060

01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.500
Dragon Quest Builders on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.620
That was that kind of Minecraft-type game.

01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.940
Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour

01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.860

Looks like Roost on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:18.900
Rise of the Tomb Raider 20-year Celebration

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:21.260
on PlayStation 4.

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.260
I guess that's the PS4 version of it,

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:25.340
because didn't we not get that?

01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:26.940
Wasn't that...

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:29.060
Because Rise of the Tomb Raider never came out on PlayStation 4.

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.140
Yeah, it's going to be, though, now with the...

01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.220
Yeah, this week.

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.820
And then Valkyrie Drive Bikuni.

01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.100

01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:51.460
Manus Burn Racing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.180
And then your VR games.

01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:56.060
Ace Banana, Batman Arkham VR,

01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.340
Battlezone VR, Drive Club VR,

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:00.220

01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.660
Hustle King's VR, Job Simulator,

01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:08.180
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,

01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:10.700
Loading Human, PlayStation VR Worlds,

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:14.580
Rigs Mechanicized, Combat League.

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:18.500
And then, of course, Sports Bar VR,

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.820
Super Hypercube, Super Stardust Ultra VR,

01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:25.020
The Assembly, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,

01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.140
Wayward Sky, and World War Tunes.

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:29.940
Those are all PlayStation VR.

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:32.060
On PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4,

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:34.500
we have Resident Infinite, Roller Coaster Dreams,

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.260
and it looks like Thumper.

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:39.340
That's also on PC as well.

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:42.060
And then Shadow Warrior 2 on PC.

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:47.540

Farah Bell on PC, Mac, and Linux.

Also, Manuel Samuel is going to be coming out on Xbox One.

01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:02.660
And then yet another toys game

01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:04.620
that's going to be coming out one week from today,

01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:08.140
and that's Skylanders Imaginators.

01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:10.460
That's on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:15.780
Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:17.140
Busy.

01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.860
Yeah, it is very, very busy.

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.140
Did you get through it all? Is that it?

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:21.860
That is it.

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.300
All right, let's go over to Japan.

01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:27.060
And Japan is also getting the PlayStation VR this week,

01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.100
so it's causing a few things to come out with that.

01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.700
Although my list is not as extensive as the one Loki has,

01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.620
but I know there's a lot of digital releases,

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:36.140
and my list doesn't capture all the digital stuff.

01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.940
But what we do have coming out in Japan this week,

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.460
of course, PlayStation VR.

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.860
Also, there are some games as well on PlayStation 4.

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.340
Rigs Machine Combat League is out.

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:46.620
We also have PlayStation VR Worlds.

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:49.460
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens randomly in there,

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:52.260
even though, of course, that's not necessarily a VR game.

01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:54.780
Rise of the Tomb Raider is also out in Japan this week,

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.300
and that's kind of the highlights from the list that I have here,

01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:00.380
but those are all things that you can expect in a physical form.

01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:03.380
Again, this list is not going to capture anything that is digital.

01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:06.940
In Japan, Paper Mario Color Splash is out this week,

01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:09.700
as well as Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens.

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:11.820
So we got the color splash here in the US,

01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.340
looks like a little early, compared to Japan.

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.900
So that is out this week in Japan.

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:17.860
On the PlayStation Vita,

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:20.140
the Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens is out there as well.

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.740
A game called Plastic Memories in regular and limited edition,

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:27.100
and Kangoku-to Mary Skelter in regular and limited edition.

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:29.980
And lastly, on the 3DS this week,

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.260
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens.

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:35.380
Otherwise, a slow week on the 3DS, a very, very busy week.

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.780
Next week, however, was some new amiibo coming out

01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:40.500
and a Mario Party game.

01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:43.220
So Mario Party Star Rush, specifically.

01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:46.180
So that is the Japanese in stores.

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.220
How about UK?

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:50.700
So there's Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary World Tour

01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:53.020
on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:56.420
Gears of War 4 on Xbox One and Windows 10.

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.300
And then here they lie on PlayStation 4,

01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:01.340
even though this is a mobile game,

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:04.180
I just thought that the name that they have listed on here is hilarious.

01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.820
Really Bad Chess.

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:08.860
That's on iPad and iPhone.

01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:11.700
A Resident on PlayStation 4.

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:18.180
Let's Sing 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Wii.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.900
That's kind of surprising.

01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:23.500
And finally, Emergency 2016.

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:26.460
All right.

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.820
Busy week releases all across the globe,

01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:31.780
but especially with the PlayStation VR, certainly.

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.140
Let's get to the mailbag.

01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:35.180
["The Orange Lounge Radio"]

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:41.660
Every week, you guys send us emails.

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:43.860
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:47.140
is the place to send us an email if you are so inclined.

01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:49.420
And we read emails on this show.

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:52.340
Usually after a break, we come back to an empty mailbox

01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.300
because people go...

01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:55.300
They don't email us because they know there's no show that week,

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.380
and then they don't email us because there was no show during the week.

01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:01.860
But we did get one email this week, so we will read that email now.

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:04.140
And it's from our pal, Ragenator, who says,

01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:07.100
Hi, guys, it's Ragenator yet again with a last-second email.

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:08.180
What time did he send this?

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:11.220
Oh, my God, he sent this during the show at 6.30.

01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:12.620
Well, lucky you.

01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:15.620
All right, anyway, I can't think of a timely subject for this email,

01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:17.740
so instead, I will pose this question.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.940
Suppose that for whatever reason, you're filthy, filthy, filthy rich

01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:23.820
to the point where even Bill Gates would say, damn.

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.460
Now, with that being said, if you could create your idea,

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.140
a geeked-themed man cave...

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:30.980
Why has it got to be a man cave?

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:31.900
I get what you're saying.

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:35.100
Where space and money are no object, what would you do?

01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:36.940
For me, I'd do the following.

01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.620
The man cave would be in the basement, and to get down to the man cave,

01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:42.580
you would go down a slide and land in a ball pit.

01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:45.300
One area would have a custom-made, one-of-a-kind,

01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:48.060
thousand-inch 32K 3D TV...

01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:49.380
Dude, those don't exist.

01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:50.820
With a 7.1 sound system...

01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:52.260
That's why it's custom.

01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:54.300
And every console hooked up to it,

01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:58.540
plus a top-of-the-line PC that would even make NASA's computers jealous.

01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:02.020
I'd also have one of those speaker systems that look like retro jukeboxes

01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:05.180
with built-in lights set up to play all my music.

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:07.980
In another area, I'd have two of every arcade game

01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:10.260
and pinball table ever made set up.

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:12.140
How big is your basement, dude?

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:14.940
Plus stuff like skeeball and other arcade favorites.

01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:18.460
In a third area, I'd have an actual in-home pizzeria.

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:21.860
Throughout the basement, I'd have tons of gaming posters,

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.220
80s and 90s pop culture posters,

01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:28.500
for example, Beavis and Butthead, Nick cartoon posters, etc., on the walls.

01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:30.900
Plus, I'd have enough decorative lighting around

01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:33.220
to make Spencer's gifts jealous.

01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:36.180
That email there from our pal, Raginator.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.940
So, what would you do with a limitless budget?

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:41.540
What would be in your man cave?

01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:44.620
Or will man cave, Loki?

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.860
I don't know. I mean, it's just...

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:48.940
What's the point of having a man cave at that point?

01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:52.900
Just buy, like, make your own family fun center

01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.420
or something like that, or just a theme park.

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.380
I mean, like, I guess...

01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.740
I'm gonna answer this for Loki.

01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:00.780
Loki's dream man cave would have a passcode

01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:02.900
that his wife and kids don't know.

01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:06.220
No, that's not true at all.

01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:07.260
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.140
I wouldn't need to lock my wife out.

01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:10.180
She just wouldn't want to come down there.

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.220
That's fine.

01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:13.180
And, you know, she can have whatever she wants.

01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.220
That's fine.

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:15.820
My kids is just...

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:18.140
Yeah, it wouldn't matter.

01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:20.700
I always drive by, like, on my way to work and stuff.

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.260
I see these, like, somewhat, not high-rise buildings,

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:25.900
but, like, you know, just several stories, tall buildings.

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:30.260
I'm like, wouldn't it be fun just to fill that full of, like, game stuff?

01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:31.180
So, something like that.

01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:33.540
I'd just buy a building and fill it full of game stuff.

01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:36.580
Or open up, or, hey, if I want to make some of that money back,

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.500
even though I have a limitless amount of money,

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:42.740
it would be nice to open up a really kick-ass, like,

01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:45.740
arcade fun center thing with, like, ridiculous shit

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.060
that you only see in, like, Japan.

01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:50.900
You know, like, those indoor ski slopes and fucking, you know,

01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:54.020
beach and all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.420
But mainly arcade games.

01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:00.180
Yeah, I feel like if I had that type of budget, I would want...

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.900
I'd make the most kick-ass laser tag game on the face of the goddamn earth.

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:06.340
There you go. You're gonna bring back Qsar.

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:07.380
I would buy that shit.

01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:10.620
You're gonna combine every old Qsar that went into...

01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:13.060
out of business into one super Qsar that you're gonna run.

01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:14.220
It would be a super Qsar.

01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:15.260
I love that.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:17.060
Committed reality super Qsar.

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.100
Ah, there you go. Now that's a low-key idea.

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:20.140
I like that.

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.180
That is a low-key idea.

01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:24.140
Let's see, for me, yeah, I'm kind of in that whole part of...

01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:26.820
I don't know if I would want that all in my house,

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:27.900
because that would be...

01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:30.140
I mean, admittedly, to have all that stuff in your house

01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:32.260
would kind of be a little lonely.

01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.900
You know, I mean, not to sound like all depressing,

01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:37.300
but it's like, you know, okay, so I could enjoy all this,

01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:39.740
but it would be really boring to not be able to enjoy it with other people.

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.900
I mean, obviously, Alan lives here. He'd be able to enjoy it too.

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:45.540
And obviously, I would have friends over now and then,

01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:48.580
but maybe this is like the super cheesy side of me or something.

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.620
But I would want...

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.940
Like, if I had that time of space and set up and so forth

01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:55.060
to set up this arcade that's like fun all the time,

01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:58.500
I would want kids who can't have fun all the time

01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.020
to be able to experience that as well.

01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:03.860
So I would want a space where responsible,

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:07.180
well-behaved and parented children...

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:10.380
When I say parented, I mean, you know, disciplined,

01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:11.940
you know, that type of thing.

01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:16.420
Kids that have good fucking manners could come and play machines

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:18.580
and aren't going to wreck them and be ridiculous.

01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:21.660
Even if they wreck them, you can have a fleet of people to repair shit.

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:22.700
It wouldn't fucking matter.

01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.500
I want a place where kids are not going to bully other kids.

01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:27.940
That's why I don't want those kids there.

01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:29.180
I'm not so worried about the machine.

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:32.540
Somebody's going to spill a soda on a machine and it's going to suck,

01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:34.980
but I don't want those kids that are going to bully the other kids.

01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:40.180
I want it to be a place where people can have fun and that type of thing.

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:41.380
Is that cheesy?

01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:43.460
But I swear to God, it's my honest thing.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:48.860
It's like I would be so bored if I had all that in my house alone.

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:51.140
It's like, you know, you hear about the crazy rich people

01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:52.580
that live in a castle up in the...

01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.740
Like Enya, right?

01:57:54.780 --> 01:58:00.180
Enya lives in a fucking castle in the middle of God knows where

01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:03.340
and then the United Kingdom somewhere, if even that.

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:06.380
She lives in a castle with, what, cats?

01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:09.460
And her giant quill pen that I'm sure she uses to write her songs.

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.300
Like, you know, she's...

01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.980
Wouldn't it be a little boring eventually?

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:14.820
I don't know.

01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:16.540
So is that a cat-soul?

01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:22.020
Maybe I just opened a cat cafe.

01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:22.740
Cat cafe.

01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.140
That would be enough for me.

01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:26.900
All right, so anyway, there you go.

01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:31.700
Sorry if that's cheesy, but those are the answers to the questions that we got.

01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:34.580
So if you want to send us cheesy questions, you sure can.

01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:37.420
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:40.140
is the place where you can send your emails.

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.660
So we got a few more stories for you guys

01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:45.260
before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.740
But first, Loki.

01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:51.220
All right, so, you know, you may remember a few years ago,

01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:53.100
there was...

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:57.060
Was it Lizard Squad was like a little hacking click or whatever

01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.140
that would just do your ass shit.

01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.260
And they would not be allowed in my arcade.

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.860
Yeah, they were responsible for, I guess,

01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:06.340
or they claimed responsibility for DDoS attacks

01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.740
against Xbox Live and PlayStation Network in 2014.

01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:13.460
Well, apparently, they have been convicted

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:17.140
for over 50,000 counts of cybercrime,

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.260
including harassment, fraud, and data breaches.

01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:24.980
So apparently, they were two 19-year-olds.

01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:27.220
And yeah, they were charged,

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:32.500
and I guess the charges carry a 10-year maximum sentence in prison.

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:37.740
Well, bye.

01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.540
Somebody's got to get punished for this.

01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:41.780
You can't... These are crimes that you're committing,

01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.660
and you don't get to just get away with them scot-free.

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:47.540
So have fun in the slamma.

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:52.340
Yeah, so apparently, they were both under Lizard Squad and Poodle Corp.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:57.380
And I guess they even had hacked Taylor Swift's Twitter account.

01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:00.740
And what else?

02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:04.780
They had conspired with other members of Lizard Squad

02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.460
to run cyber attacks for higher websites,

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:11.500
trafficking stolen payment card accounts.

02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:16.980
Well, it's probably they're being made an example of a little bit,

02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:19.860
but that's what has to happen to deter other people from doing it,

02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.980
because it shows that, yes, they will do something about it.

02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:28.500
So I hope they can catch a few more of these folks that do this shit,

02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.420
and show that you can't get away with it.

02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:32.380
Anyhow, shifting gears here a little bit,

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:36.900
let's talk about something that Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox,

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:38.940
was talking about bad reviews this week.

02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:42.420
And he kind of dropped a truth bomb on some people.

02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:44.980
And this was in an interview that he was doing this week,

02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:47.900
where he was discussing about the ReCore,

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.700
because ReCore was a game that came out recently.

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.460
And now ReCore has an average score of 63% on Metacritic.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:55.900
And here's a quote from his interview.

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.940
I think there are certain reviews that are written more to get clicked on

02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:03.820
than they are to actually accurately reflect the quality of the game,

02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:06.220
and that kind of bums me out.

02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:09.140
On the reviews, honestly, I thought some of the reviews were a little harsh

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:11.300
in their terms of the view of the game.

02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:14.300
I didn't try to tell anybody that it was a 10, speaking about ReCore.

02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:17.140
I think we knew, as with any games, that there are certain things,

02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:19.500
if we started from the beginning and we knew what do we get,

02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:22.060
there's a couple things we would have done slightly differently.

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:25.140
But then he goes on to talk about Forza Horizon 3,

02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.740
where, you know, he was talking about Forza Horizon 3

02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:30.020
and the scores that that's getting, saying,

02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:32.020
we're very proud of how the game ended up,

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:35.420
and I think 7, 8, 9, like anywhere in there, is fine.

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:39.660
3 or 4, I mean, somebody gave Forza Horizon 3 a 4,

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.900
and that's when he said, I think there are certain reviews

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:43.500
that are written more to get clicked on

02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:46.460
than they are to actually accurately reflect the quality of the game,

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:47.860
and that kind of bums me out.

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:51.820
And I thought that was a pretty darn good truth bomb

02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:54.100
he kind of dropped on people, is that, you know,

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.980
there's people that write some click-baity shit out there,

02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:01.100
and we've certainly accused certain journalistic websites out there

02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:04.860
of this in the past, and I'm sure that this is still going on, right, Logie?

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:07.740
Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a lot of these sites

02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:10.780
that are a little harsh or whatever, especially if you read the reviews

02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:13.180
and the reasons that they give for it, sometimes they're a little,

02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:17.860
like, political, you know, it's just, it's silly stuff.

02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:21.100
But to be a fair counterpoint, I mean, you know,

02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:24.060
if a group of 100 people play a game,

02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:26.420
there's gonna be somebody that doesn't like it,

02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:28.180
for whatever weird reason, right?

02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:32.660
I mean, like, even Rotten Tomato movie reviews and stuff, you know?

02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:34.980
I mean, there's gonna be people that love it,

02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:38.660
but there's always gonna be that one in a crowd who doesn't like it.

02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:40.860
Like, I'm sure this has happened to all of you.

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:43.860
Haven't you seen a movie that you hated,

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:46.140
that everybody else, like, lost their shit over,

02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:48.180
and you're like, why is this movie that good?

02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:51.460
That's why you just find reviewers, like, that you kind of align with

02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:54.740
as far as what their tastes are versus what your tastes are,

02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:59.060
and then kind of go off of that, or go off of, you know,

02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:02.100
just even, like, some of these playthroughs and stuff

02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:03.820
when they do previews and stuff, and just judge it

02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.540
based off of what you're seeing on there, and...

02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:08.260
Are you saying you have to review reviewers?

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.180
Not necessarily.

02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.460
Just don't, like, if, I mean, obviously, if you're reading the reviews,

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:18.260
don't just go by the score, find out what made them come to that conclusion.

02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:20.580
And if their reasoning is kind of ridiculous,

02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:23.540
then you can, you know, make that judgment based on that,

02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:27.260
because some people don't like certain types of games,

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.660
and for whatever reason, those people, they have them review those games,

02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:33.460
and I don't know.

02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.820
I can only assume that because that would have been

02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:37.860
such a dumb decision in the first place,

02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:40.660
you know, to have somebody that hates a genre review that genre,

02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:42.860
that they're really doing it just to clickbait,

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:46.700
but, or they're just that dumb, editorially.

02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:48.940
Going to Tigerclaw in our chat room, saying,

02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.620
you can't take Rotten Tomatoes seriously, though.

02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:54.260
Even if movies get bad reviews, and you end up loving it,

02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:57.340
it's just a critic's opinion, but your own opinion matters more.

02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:58.900
You know, and I think he's bringing up a point,

02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:02.100
and this happens a lot with movies, is that there's movies that critics hate,

02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.700
and it's usually comedies, right?

02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:06.020
The critics usually hate them, but, like, you know,

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:10.980
the Joe average movie viewer might like it a lot more,

02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:13.700
and especially, like, genre movies, too, right?

02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:16.500
Right, and, well, and I think also, a lot of these reviews,

02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:18.500
especially when it comes to games, it's not necessarily,

02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:21.380
you kind of have a preconceived notion of whether you're gonna like a game or not.

02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:24.540
It's more of, like, is it functional?

02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:26.460
You know, if the game is glitchy as shit,

02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:31.300
or if it runs poorly, or it's just, you know, controls terribly,

02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:36.100
I mean, that's gonna play into it a lot, versus, you know,

02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.340
oh, this game, I didn't like the graphics in it, or something like that.

02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:42.340
You know, well, you'll know based off of watching, you know, the trailers,

02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:44.900
and the, I mean, I don't know, you're gonna have an idea

02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:47.540
of whether you like it or not, and, you know,

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:50.780
also maybe wait and see how it is,

02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:53.900
or if you don't want to purchase something, rent it,

02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:54.900
and try it that way.

02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:58.380
Oh, my God, the way, we've always fucking done it back in the days

02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:00.660
when there's actually rental places.

02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:03.780
I mean, there's Redbox now in the US,

02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:06.820
but I'm sure there's some place you can rent something,

02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:11.740
maybe even Gamefly, to try a game out before you want to buy it.

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:13.060
ActDeft in chat says,

02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:15.820
you don't judge something solely based on reviews.

02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:17.580
Yeah, and that's, I think that's really important.

02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:20.180
Kind of the gamers have to take some onus for this, too,

02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.340
is that you can't do 100% of your judgment on reviews,

02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:26.300
but this is where live streaming, I think, has really stepped in a lot,

02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.740
is that I think there is a lot of people to kind of watch other people play games,

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:31.300
and make a decision based off that.

02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:33.780
It's just an extension of what we probably did as kids,

02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:35.260
where you would want to buy a video game

02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:36.460
because you went over to your friend's house,

02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:39.340
and you played it over there, and you won it at your house.

02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:42.540
Akayjudo in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:45.660
Movies, music, games, books are all subjective.

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:47.900
I never listen to critics or gamers.

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:50.100
I know what I like and what I don't.

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:54.700
So, good feedback on this topic there.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:57.180
But, you know, I just thought that was very interesting

02:05:57.220 --> 02:05:59.300
that, you know, the head of Xbox went so far

02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:01.900
as to kind of call out clickbait in that regard.

02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.180
Thought that was very interesting.

02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:04.340
Anyway, a few more stories for you.

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.460
Loki.

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:06.780
All right, so this is kind of interesting.

02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:08.100
I'm not sure what's gonna come of this,

02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:12.100
but I do like the developers, so...

02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:17.260
PewDiePie and also the developer,

02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:20.020
or one of the designers of Goat Simulator,

02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:23.420
Armin, I'm gonna try to pronounce his last name here,

02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:26.140
Ibris, I butchered that.

02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:29.340
Anyways, Armin, we'll just go by his first name,

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:32.780
one of the designers there, and I follow him on Twitter.

02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:36.740
So they're actually collaborating to develop some games.

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.020
So the first game they're gonna release

02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:42.340
is a mobile game called the PewDiePie Tuber Simulator,

02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:46.140
where you actually play as a YouTuber.

02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.620
And I know they have similar games like this

02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:50.700
on Steam already, so I'm kinda curious to see what it is.

02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:54.100
But basically, you know, they're saying that,

02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:56.980
you know, as far as a partnership,

02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:58.860
there's comedy's huge entertainment,

02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:01.780
but it still fills in its infancy in the game industry.

02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:04.300
Felix and I would like to work on changing that.

02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:05.860
So they're looking to make funny games,

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:09.740
and Goat Simulator's pretty funny.

02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:12.500
Yeah, I'd be curious to see what happens.

02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:15.060
Yeah, it's a weird partnership, but I'm with you.

02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:17.140
It's like, well, the developers of Goat Simulator are really,

02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:19.980
you know, that was a hilarious game, so, you know.

02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:24.500
Yeah, it's silly. I mean, I don't know.

02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:26.100
Can't be that bad.

02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:29.140
How bad can it be? Famous last words.

02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:32.380
All right, anyway, last tonight before we open up the Skyplines

02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:35.420
at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, some more Twitch news.

02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:37.660
This actually, I think this came out after TwitchCon.

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:40.540
I don't think this was something they actually unveiled at TwitchCon,

02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:44.940
but this is, you know, we've seen this develop before.

02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:47.100
You remember that whole bit system that they had

02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:50.940
where you could actually tip live streamers in bits,

02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:53.620
which would turn into real-world money, basically?

02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:56.140
I think it was like, I don't know, it was 10 cents or 1 cent per bit

02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.180
or something like that.

02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:00.100
Well, it was announced this week that you will be able to,

02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:03.260
if you don't wanna actually spend money on Twitch,

02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:08.420
even though now with Twitch Prime, Twitch can be ad-free for you,

02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:14.460
if you want, you can watch ads on Twitch to earn bits.

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:16.540
Kind of similar to, like, mobile games, right?

02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:17.580
Yeah, mobile games do that a lot.

02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:19.940
Yeah, you watch an ad and you earn some of the in-game currency.

02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:20.980
And I'm fine with that.

02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:23.700
Yeah, that's kind of interesting. It's not mandatory, I suppose, right?

02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:26.220
So if you sit through a 30-second interactive ad,

02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:29.380
you can earn some bits, and they're slowly rolling this out.

02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:32.740
You can still choose to purchase 100 bits for $1.40.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.980
So I think it must be 1 cent for each bit that you do there.

02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.980
But now you can earn the bits by watching a sponsored video

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:40.780
or perhaps doing a survey.

02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:44.500
They say that this will typically reward users with 5 bits,

02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:46.420
but some offers will be worth up to 100.

02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:49.300
I imagine the more interactive ones that are surveys and stuff

02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.260
will probably reward you more.

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:53.780
Or sign up for such-and-such website and all this.

02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.180
It'd be very interesting to see.

02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:57.300
I hate any of those apps.

02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:59.580
It's not mandatory, so it's interesting.

02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:02.060
Yeah, it's not mandatory, but, like, for example,

02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:05.700
Tap My Katamari, or not Tap My Katamari,

02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:09.020
the Katamari, oh, it was Tap My Katamari.

02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.060
That's what you're thinking of.

02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.500
Yeah, OK. Tap My Katamari, that was the...

02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:14.180
OK, yeah, Tap My Katamari, they tried...

02:09:14.220 --> 02:09:15.220
Cookie Clicker Katamari.

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:16.980
Cookie Clicker Krem... Yes, thank you.

02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:22.020
So that game, they added that right before I saw playing it,

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:26.780
all these offers you could do to earn in-game currency and stuff,

02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:28.660
and none of them fucking worked.

02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:31.220
Like, you go to a website and answer some survey questions

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:32.780
and shit like that, and it's like,

02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:35.140
yeah, there'll be a short delay before when that says

02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:36.900
credit to your account.

02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:39.220
Two weeks later, still fucking nothing.

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:41.180
So that kind of shit, I don't like.

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:45.460
Watching the video's fine, because that shit at least works.

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:46.180
I mean, that's kind of cool.

02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:48.020
But every time I hear about this tip system,

02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:52.140
it just, it reminds me of, like, those fucking adult chat rooms

02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.700
where you're, like, tipping the people that have sex on camera

02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:55.660
and shit like that.

02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:59.540
It's just, like, that's where they should have the ads.

02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.340
Get free money for that shit.

02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:05.340
But, like, tipping people, like, pennies, you know,

02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:06.380
it's kind of silly.

02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:10.620
And it makes me wonder, though, if we stream this show on Twitch,

02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:12.740
not that we would ever leave VOG or whatever,

02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:15.260
but if we were to, like, stream this show on Twitch,

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:18.580
could we actually get people throwing their bits at us

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:20.580
and use that money to buy new mics?

02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:21.820
Show us your bits.

02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.820
Show me them bitties!

02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:28.140
Show me your naughty bits.

02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:29.900
Oh, man, there's so many puns.

02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.460
So many puns with this.

02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:35.460
Anyway, this is, I guess, is opening up in the U.S.,

02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:38.340
so it's something that you can participate in here in the U.S.,

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:39.860
where our show is based.

02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:42.540
But you can use the bits in any chat channel

02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.180
that has the cheering enabled,

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:46.740
which I don't think cheering is enabled for everybody yet,

02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:49.740
but they are looking at expanding that to more users in the future.

02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:52.620
So, yeah, very interesting how this is developing,

02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:54.940
and probably more and more people are going to get in

02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:56.700
on streaming this video game stuff.

02:10:56.740 --> 02:11:00.260
So, very curious to see how that unfolds.

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:03.180
Anyhow, it is time to open up the Skype line

02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:06.060
at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:08.740
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:09.900
Kaijuto in chat says,

02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:12.780
Fuck those bits, but if peeps want to use them, that's cool.

02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:14.700
Yeah, I guess the cool thing is,

02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:17.660
at the end of the day, this really doesn't affect

02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:20.260
the, you know, content itself or whatever.

02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:21.860
None of it's mandatory.

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:26.580
Although, you got to worry that there might be some streamers out there

02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:28.900
that are going to be like, they're going to hold their streams hostage,

02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:32.540
where it's like, I'm not going to do anything unless I get a thousand bits.

02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:34.420
So, exactly like those adult chat rooms.

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:37.060
Yeah, but yeah, I'm not going to show my boobies

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.500
until I get so much, you know, money or whatever.

02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:40.660
But then I would think,

02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:42.540
but see, I think there would be a trade-off for that,

02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:44.100
because if you do that,

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:48.420
it's very easy to just go find something else on Twitch.

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.860
You know what I mean?

02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:51.260
But sometimes they have a nice rack,

02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:52.740
and so you stay there.

02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:58.540
Anyway, again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:00.140
If you want to give us a call,

02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:03.540
and we can talk about anything we've discussed in our show.

02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:05.980
No, but it's silly to hold your channel hostage

02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:07.980
for what is literally pennies.

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:09.460
Yeah, literally pennies. Yeah.

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:13.220
And does the streamer get that full penny,

02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:14.500
or do they get like a fraction of the penny?

02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:18.940
Well, because it costs $1.40 to get 100 bits,

02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:20.940
that's where Twitch is getting their money.

02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:24.180
Because you're buying $1 in currency for $1.40.

02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:25.180
Yeah, that's where it's coming from.

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:26.340
Anyway, our phone is going off,

02:12:26.380 --> 02:12:28.540
so I do want to get to some of the calls.

02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:30.660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:31.820
Hey, this is Marcus.

02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:33.300
Hey, Marcus, how you doing?

02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:34.940
I'm doing fine, thanks.

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.420
Saw you at GamerX, actually.

02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:38.180
I remember running into you there.

02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.060
Thank you for coming to the panel. I appreciate that.

02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:40.780
Yeah, it was great.

02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:42.620
Hope you had... And thank you for the ribbon.

02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:43.980
Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:45.540
So, how many ribbons did you get?

02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:47.780
A ton. They're all in the backseat of my car still,

02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:48.860
because I had to...

02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:50.460
It was... I had it on the gear shift,

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:51.420
and it was getting in the way.

02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:52.340
But there's a ton.

02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:53.700
I walked out of there with a ton of ribbons.

02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:57.580
I actually... I ended up getting a special guest ribbon,

02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:59.420
and I can't tell you how,

02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:00.620
but I got a special guest.

02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:02.860
It was like my coup de grace at the very end,

02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:05.020
was I was actually a special guest of GamerX

02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:07.020
for the last two minutes of the show.

02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:08.700
So, that was exciting.

02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:09.460
Yeah, if you didn't see that,

02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:11.260
if you're not following me on Twitter,

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.220
there was, like, people had these ribbons,

02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:14.180
was like the big thing this year,

02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.060
and it wasn't just the con itself,

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:19.100
but, like, you know, certain booths had ribbons,

02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:20.980
certain cosplayers had ribbons,

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:22.540
and I was like, nobody told me

02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:24.020
this was gonna be a fucking ribbon party.

02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:25.580
I would have had some VOG ribbons made.

02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:26.660
Why didn't I know this?

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:29.060
So, that is the lesson learned.

02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:31.500
Between Dragon Con and GamerX,

02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:34.340
I am fucking getting some podcasting ribbons made.

02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:36.020
That's the lesson I'm learning from these,

02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:37.700
because I like ribbons.

02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:39.540
But anyway, my goal was to collect them all.

02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:42.540
And even some of the organizers for GamerX

02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:44.420
saw my lanyard and were like,

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:45.660
you have a lot of ribbons.

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:47.340
And I was like, gotta catch them all.

02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:48.060
It'll make them laugh.

02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:49.260
So, anyway.

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:50.300
Anyway, sorry, Marcus.

02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.540
What did you call in to talk about tonight?

02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:55.660
Well, I actually wanted to call to talk about PlayStation VR.

02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:56.940
Yeah.

02:13:56.980 --> 02:13:59.980
So, I also am one of those people, you know, pre-ordered it

02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:02.060
the minute it went up.

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:05.580
Been wondering about that pre-order ever since.

02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:09.540
It's really tough right now.

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:12.540
I mean, the text reviews I've read,

02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:15.820
from what I saw, they looked really positive.

02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:17.940
At least the scores were pretty high.

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:21.660
But I know Loki mentioned that Giant Bomb streamed

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:24.060
for like a bunch of hours, PlayStation VR.

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.740
And it was like a mess.

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:28.140
And I watched that stream too.

02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:31.180
And I almost, you know, tipped it over for me.

02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:32.540
It's just, it's like,

02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:38.180
what was happening was, it was beyond anything.

02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:40.940
I have a Oculus Rift.

02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:42.540
I also have a Gear VR.

02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:44.060
Those are fine.

02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:46.820
But what I saw on that stream was just like,

02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:51.980
extreme nausea, just like, it would be so bad.

02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:56.660
But so many reviews never mentioned anything like this.

02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:59.540
So it was like, what was happening with Giant Bomb?

02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:02.020
Some people have suggested, oh, they just set it up wrong.

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:05.300
But I mean, they had other games there before,

02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:07.820
previously, Super Hypercube, et cetera.

02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:09.540
I don't see how you really set that up wrong.

02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:11.940
Yeah, I know, I think they set it up fine,

02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:13.660
because they had people there before

02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:17.540
with Super Hypercube, et cetera, on PSVR in the same setup.

02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:18.860
And it ran just fine for them.

02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:21.020
But it was just this stream now

02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:25.140
with their new review units in, it was a nightmare.

02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:27.740
But I have seen some other negative feedback out there,

02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:29.180
not just Giant Bomb, but you know,

02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.940
after I canceled the VR already,

02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:32.820
I saw like another review on it

02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:34.540
that was kind of negative in nature.

02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:35.940
But you know, what's interesting, Marcus,

02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:38.780
we just had this conversation here in studio about reviews

02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:41.260
and how much can you trust reviews, right?

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:43.980
So, yeah, I think most of what I've been seeing

02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:47.140
has been kind of just average to kind of like,

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:50.100
eh, you know, maybe it's not the best thing.

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:52.220
Like, I know Game Informers was kind of,

02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:54.540
it was the sea mines that they gave it.

02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:56.700
I'm trying to think of what other reviews I read.

02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:59.620
But yeah, I mean, I just kind of go by

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:00.900
what we're seeing in the stream,

02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.740
because I think the Giant Bomb one,

02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:05.460
I wouldn't, I think that they're pretty competent

02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:07.260
as far as setting something up.

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:09.500
If they are having trouble setting it up accurately,

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:10.980
then I would assume that the end user

02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:12.300
is going to have trouble setting it up,

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:14.300
then if that's going to be the case.

02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:17.980
So I would take what their experience was during that.

02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.620
It's not necessarily even a setup.

02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:23.780
It was just, even the tracking on it is very obvious

02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:25.860
that it's not tracking that very well.

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:27.220
Well, let me ask you this, Marcus,

02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:30.260
because you sound like a VR enthusiast, you know,

02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:33.020
because you already have what, Gear VR and Oculus.

02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:35.540
So you've already kind of put your feet in the water,

02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:37.900
so to speak, so I think that already puts you

02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.380
on a different perspective, necessarily,

02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:40.780
than where Loki and I are.

02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:43.540
But have you actually played PlayStation VR?

02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:45.540
Have you gone to one of these Best Buy things

02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:47.980
or some type of event where you can try it?

02:16:48.020 --> 02:16:50.540
Yes, I've played it.

02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:53.700
I got to play it at E3.

02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:56.340
You know, pretty nice setup there.

02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:00.140
But I had, you know, previously I've had no problems with it.

02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:03.940
It's been fine. It's a really comfortable headset.

02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:05.300
I can't say, you know, the quality of the games

02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:09.620
are what I was looking for, but I thought it was just fine.

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:13.100
So I don't know, could something have happened,

02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:16.860
like, between the development units and these retail units?

02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:19.060
Because it's like, I don't,

02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:21.060
I never experienced anything like that.

02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:23.100
And it's kind of wild.

02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:25.220
I'm not sure I would let one stream

02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:26.580
have such an impact either.

02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:28.380
I mean, you know, with as much as people

02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:29.620
enjoy Giant Bomb or whatever,

02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.100
I'm not sure I would let one stream

02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:32.300
sway my decision with that.

02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:33.940
Yeah, that's true. I'm just scared.

02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:37.180
Like, you know, it does require really good setup or whatever.

02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:41.860
And what it is, it's a $600 decision, right?

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:42.380
Yes.

02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:44.500
I mean, that's ultimately what's making all of us nervous.

02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:45.860
And what made myself nervous is, like,

02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:49.420
this is a $600-plus decision.

02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:51.980
I mean, okay, you could argue, well, I don't have the move.

02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:54.900
So it would be a $600 decision, basically.

02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:57.660
You know, and on top of that, the price of games.

02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.620
And so, yeah, that's, you know,

02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:03.340
am I wanting to pay $600 to be an early adopter on this?

02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:06.140
And I think I finally came to the conclusion that,

02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:10.100
no, I want to spend $600 to go to Chicago and see my friends.

02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:13.500
And I will wait and maybe get the VR next time.

02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:14.620
Yeah.

02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:18.220
I mean, I guess I'm fortunate enough to be able to, you know,

02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:20.660
not make this decision be like a make or break.

02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:23.500
Like, I need, you know, this money for rent or something.

02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:26.540
I can afford it, even though it'd be kind of gross

02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:28.340
if it's like a crap product.

02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:33.260
But I think at this point, I'm still going to get it.

02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:39.900
Um, so I don't know, I'll probably call in after I've played it, you know.

02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:42.100
Oh, totally. I totally wouldn't care for our listeners.

02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:44.420
How wonderful or awful it ends up being.

02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:46.860
You know what, I mean, if I had the disposable income,

02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:50.700
you know, if it, like, if that kind of money wasn't such a big deal,

02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:54.780
yeah, I probably would still pick it up anyway just to try it.

02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:57.820
But because I figure a lot of that stuff's going to be patched out eventually,

02:18:57.860 --> 02:18:58.940
I would hope.

02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.220
But I just don't.

02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:04.860
But at the same time, don't necessarily prepare for disappointment either.

02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:06.740
Although, I guess if you put the bar low,

02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:09.300
then you're only going to get your expectations exceeded.

02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:11.820
But look at the, you know what, you're going to need to play ResVR.

02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:13.060
That's going to be fucking rad.

02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:16.100
Like, you know, but, you know, I finally had to answer that question

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:17.980
that a lot of people have been asking me.

02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:20.860
Is ResVR worth $600, Rob?

02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:23.900
And for me, it's like,

02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:27.740
yes, but just not today.

02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:31.060
So that's where I ultimately ended up.

02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:33.300
Yeah, you know, I'm going to get it.

02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:34.980
We'll see how it goes.

02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:38.220
All right. Well, I look forward to hearing from you again next week

02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:42.260
or the week after to tell me all about what I'm missing out on.

02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:43.180
Yeah, sure.

02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:46.220
All right. Marcus, anything else before we let you go?

02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:47.180
No, that was really it.

02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:50.020
You know, just wanted to share my stress, I guess.

02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:51.740
No, I hear you. We're all feeling it right now.

02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:53.020
This is the time.

02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:55.380
All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:59.860
But again, great to see you at GamerX, and we'll see you next time.

02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:00.500
Sure thing.

02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:01.700
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:02.020
Bye.

02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:03.060
Bye.

02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:06.180
All right. Wow, we have a surprising number of calls lighting up the line tonight.

02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:08.020
I figured all the politics out in the world

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:11.860
and just the fact we have a lower turnout than usual tonight would have scared people off.

02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:13.540
But that is apparently not the fact.

02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:15.740
So hello, you're on Orange Noms Radio. Who's this?

02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:17.180
Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.

02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:19.940
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. How are you?

02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:21.380
I'm Peachy Keen.

02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:23.700
Good to hear from you. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:26.180
Well, everybody likes cats, right?

02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:28.060
Of course. Who doesn't?

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.180
And y'all like clicker games?

02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:31.620
Yes.

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:32.980
Cat clicker game for you.

02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:35.300
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.740
On Android and iOS.

02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:39.780
This is the one you texted me about earlier in the week, isn't it?

02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:40.780
Oh, yeah.

02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:46.540
Luckily, I've been so distracted, I haven't had time to fall down this kiddie hole.

02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:48.100
Yeah, it's a rabbit hole. I did kiddie hole.

02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:52.700
I haven't had time to do that yet, so I'm a little scared of this.

02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:54.620
But what is this, Brad?

02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:57.700
It's pretty appropriate. It's PolitiCats.

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.140
PolitiCats. What are you doing, PolitiCats?

02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:06.900
You're a cat, and you campaign, and your tapping is your votes.

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:09.900
And the more you tap, the more votes you get.

02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:13.020
And it's just frickin' ridiculous.

02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:18.260
Oh, my God, there's these power-ups, and you go from, like, being town treasurer

02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:22.100
to county commissioner all the way up the ranks.

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:25.500
So I guess you can get president, but eventually it ramps up.

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:28.780
So you can go all the way from a mayor in a small town in Alaska

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:30.740
all the way to the vice presidency?

02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:36.460
Pretty much, yeah. And you can see rest from the litter box.

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.100
Do they put tongue-in-cheek jokes like that in the game?

02:21:39.140 --> 02:21:40.620
I would hope so.

02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:44.860
There are power-ups, there are endorsements that you can get,

02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:50.740
and one of them is catty-purry.

02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:53.900
Yeah, so you can get these different cat pun celebrity endorsements.

02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:55.620
Okay, I like that.

02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:58.700
Is this a free game, or where's the money made in this game?

02:21:58.740 --> 02:22:02.260
There are some in-app purchases you can get, typical gems and stuff,

02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:07.060
but I've been playing it for about a week now and haven't had to put in a cent.

02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:09.580
Gotcha. Are you still playing that nonstop night tour?

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:11.140
Did you finally give up on that?

02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:13.540
In theory, I'm still playing it,

02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:17.940
but I've been distracted with this damn political cats game.

02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:22.140
It's tough when they put cats in it. It makes it very hard to resist, isn't it?

02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:26.700
Oh, yeah, there's all kinds of different cats that you can choose from,

02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:31.180
starting out, and if you want to pay an extra three bucks, you can unlock Garfield.

02:22:31.220 --> 02:22:33.260
Really? They have licensed cats?

02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:35.020
They have one licensed cat.

02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:39.700
Garfield, that's awesome, and you too can hate Mondays and enjoy lasagna.

02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:42.060
And there's little crap that you can unlock for the cat,

02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:47.180
like glasses and hats and stupid little furry wings and bubbles and all that kind of crap.

02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:49.700
Can you get nurble, though?

02:22:49.700 --> 02:22:53.140
Not yet, but there is a little gray, heavy type cat.

02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:54.180
Okay. All right.

02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:56.060
You have to pay money to get rid of nurble.

02:22:58.420 --> 02:22:59.860
I'm waiting for Simon's cat.

02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:03.020
If that shows up, I'll pay a couple of bucks for Simon's cat.

02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:05.380
No love for a fucking Heathcliff, unfortunately.

02:23:05.420 --> 02:23:08.020
Oh, that's just a Garfield ripoff.

02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:11.220
Oh, hey, but it had a way better theme song.

02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:13.260
Maybe so.

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:15.780
All right, so PolitiCats, I will definitely check that out.

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:20.220
Hey, before I let you go, I know you're a big fan of the Forza Horizon series,

02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:24.060
and I've been very slow to pick that up just because it's been a crazy past couple months,

02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:26.380
but are you enjoying Forza Horizon 3?

02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:28.700
I am. I am a lot.

02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:33.940
I was lucky enough to be gifted a copy by someone who will remain aimless.

02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:37.380
But yeah, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

02:23:37.420 --> 02:23:43.420
It's actually the first digital game, full digital game that I've got.

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:46.460
And fortunately, it's one of the Xbox Anywhere's,

02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:50.300
and that's how I found out that my video card isn't compatible.

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:51.340
Don't.

02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:54.460
Well, yeah, I need a DX12 compatible,

02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:58.460
but who needs it when you can stream from the Xbox app?

02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:01.260
That's true, when the Xbox app works, right?

02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:03.900
Yeah, the latest update broke it.

02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:07.020
I haven't had that problem yet, but then again, I don't do that streaming a lot,

02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:11.900
but I was going to try streaming some Lost Odyssey to my PC so I could play it over there.

02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:15.060
So I'll have to see if that will still work or what's going to happen.

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:21.180
Unless you're on the insider preview program stuff, probably not.

02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:24.580
But because I'm stupid, like being on the cutting edge of stuff,

02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:29.340
yeah, I think it's just the latest insider preview up there that broke it.

02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:31.020
I don't think I'm on that insider preview.

02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:34.380
And I've played, like when Dungeon Siege 3 came out on Games with Gold,

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:38.380
I played a lot of that on my PC through the streaming.

02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:40.300
So that's cool, yeah.

02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:44.340
I actually do a lot of streaming, even though it's just me and the cats.

02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:48.620
But I actually, because I'm in here in the studio so much,

02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:51.820
do most of my gaming streaming from the Xbox to the PC.

02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:55.340
Yeah, same thing. It's weird because Alan and I don't usually end up in our living room together,

02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:57.260
but like we're in the office together all the time.

02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:00.500
So sometimes if like, you know, I want to hang out and, you know, we're kind of doing it,

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:05.180
I'll play on my PC streaming from the Xbox sometimes, just a little easier.

02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:08.700
Plus the multi-monitor setup goes a long way because I can stream on one monitor

02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:11.580
and still kind of keep an eye on emails or whatever on the other.

02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:18.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, well, I was going to try and play for so while I was listening to the show.

02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:20.380
But it broke.

02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:22.540
I'm like, okay, fine, I'll listen to O.R.

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:26.060
All right. All right. Well, Brad, my friend, I'm going to let you go.

02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:26.540
All righty.

02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:31.020
But thank you for calling into the show and check out Pod Culture here on the networks

02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:34.540
Monday at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:35.820
All right. Later on, guys.

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:37.020
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:37.420
Bye.

02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:38.700
Bye.

02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:41.940
All right. We'll try to squeeze in maybe one more call here before we wrap up tonight.

02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:42.780
Let's get to it.

02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:44.740
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:45.940
Hey, what's up, man? It's Kaijuto.

02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:47.860
Hey, Kaijuto, my friend. How are you?

02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:48.420
I'm all right.

02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:52.140
I just want to say that first caller, what was his name again?

02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:53.180
Marcus.

02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:55.620
Yeah, him and I do sound exactly like each other.

02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.700
I've been going back and forth with them in the chat room.

02:25:57.740 --> 02:26:00.180
I don't know if you guys agree, but I think they sound a lot alike.

02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:01.860
I think you should have them on at the same time.

02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:05.660
I hear some similarity, but I don't think it's as...

02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:08.340
I mean, especially because of the quality of their connections.

02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.500
I don't know how it comes out over them, but they have very different...

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:14.260
I'm not saying one's bad or the other, but they just have a very different sound through the connection.

02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:16.900
But maybe that isn't as apparent on the internet radio.

02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:18.420
Yeah, I don't know.

02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:23.180
But anyway, I'm just calling to say I am absolutely excited about PlayStation VR.

02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:29.900
I haven't been really paying too much attention to the reviews and who hated it, who liked it.

02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:37.140
I saw some people, like regular people, not anyone affiliated with Sony or anything like that.

02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:39.620
And I mean, people have been falling in love with this thing.

02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:42.140
I didn't even know I wanted PlayStation VR.

02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:43.940
Like, I wasn't like that in the VR.

02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:47.380
And I started watching these people experience it on YouTube.

02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:50.660
And I'm like, all right, I got to go into a best spot and I got to try this out.

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:53.540
And man, I was I was floored by this thing.

02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:57.220
This thing was so much fun, so amazing.

02:26:57.660 --> 02:26:58.620
I definitely want to get one.

02:26:58.660 --> 02:26:59.340
I was disappointed.

02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:02.700
I called my local GameStop and they were already sold out.

02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:04.980
But I'm in good with the people there.

02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:12.380
So they were like, you know, they have a 48 hour policy that if somebody doesn't pick up their preorder in 48 hours, then it goes up on the shelf.

02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:17.500
So they were like, you know, if somebody doesn't happen to pick up theirs, they'll inform me.

02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.660
But I'm pretty much set for VR.

02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:22.260
Like, all I really need are those motion controls.

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:23.620
I already have the camera.

02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:25.140
Of course, I got the PlayStation 4.

02:27:25.580 --> 02:27:27.020
So I'm all set, man.

02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:30.540
Whenever I could get a hold of one of those, I definitely want to get into it.

02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:31.540
I don't care about the wires.

02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:37.100
I never I've always been a wire person, so it doesn't bother me having all the wires around it.

02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:39.900
I mean, it's it's a great it's a great headset.

02:27:39.940 --> 02:27:40.860
It's a great feel.

02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:46.940
I haven't tried Oculus or Vibe or anything like that, but I didn't even notice this thing was really on my head.

02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:50.860
Like, you feel a little bit in the center of your head, but it's very relaxing.

02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:54.740
Like, I know people are talking about, well, not with the PlayStation VR, but with other stuff.

02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:56.780
They're like, you know, you get neck cramps up and stuff like that.

02:27:57.100 --> 02:28:02.060
Like, I can see myself playing this thing for at least I don't play games for that long anyway.

02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:08.020
I could see myself playing for like maybe the length of a movie, like an hour and some change, and then I'm done.

02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:12.780
You know, like, I don't feel like my neck is going to get tired or I'm going to get dizzy or sick or anything like that.

02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:22.780
Very interesting that you were really sold on is funny because I was I was telling the first caller, Marcus, you know, I was asking if he'd actually tried it in person.

02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:27.060
And it's very interesting that you were really sold, it sounds like, on that experience.

02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:32.300
Like, it sounds like you kind of didn't know how you felt, but once you tried it, you were like, yep, I'm jumping in day one.

02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:35.220
Yeah, they didn't have the move controllers.

02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:37.500
I just played with the PlayStation.

02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:38.500
I tried out the demos.

02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:39.820
I did the shark thing.

02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:44.740
I actually knew there was a shark in it, but still didn't think I was going to react the way that reacted to the shark.

02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:47.020
Like, it still scared me, like, whoa.

02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:49.940
Because for me, it was the whole scale of it.

02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:56.260
It's like, you know, I fooled around with the, you know, with the phone, VR, porn, VR, all that stuff.

02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:03.580
To me, to me, it felt like a view master, like I look at the view, you know, it's cool.

02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:07.900
I can look around, I can see stuff, but it's like a panoramic view master for me.

02:29:07.900 --> 02:29:14.260
But this thing, like, I feel like I'm small in this world, like whatever is supposed to be big, I'm smaller than that thing.

02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:19.660
Whatever is supposed to be small and that, you know, like I was literally the size of those things, which that totally like blew my mind.

02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:25.100
Like, it totally tricks your brain into thinking that you're really in these places, you know, and it's weird.

02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:26.980
Like, when you take it off, it's completely weird.

02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:29.980
Like, when I took it off, it was like, I literally felt like I came out of the matrix.

02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:33.260
Like, yeah, it's crazy.

02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:43.740
Alright, well, that's, I would also be curious to hear from you in a couple weeks and see if you felt it was worth what you put down for it and, you know, what you kind of walk away with from the experience.

02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:45.180
Yeah, I can't wait.

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:57.260
Like, I definitely, another reason I want to get on it quick is because I'm a little worried that maybe after two years, like when they bring the price down, they might give you like more of a gimped version of the headset and I want that particular headset.

02:29:57.260 --> 02:30:03.620
You know, I don't want like a watered down gimped version with, you know, you know, lesser whatever the hell they always do with those types of things.

02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:07.780
So, I think this is the type of thing that you want to be an early adopter of.

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:10.380
Alright, fair enough, fair enough.

02:30:10.780 --> 02:30:13.820
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call and your insight.

02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:14.660
Yep.

02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:15.860
Alright, bye bye.

02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:19.820
Alright, that's gonna do it for our calls tonight.

02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:21.060
We're gonna go ahead and wrap it up there.

02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:25.180
But if you didn't get through, please consider sending us an email because you heard how empty the mailbag was.

02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:28.860
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:31.540
Loki, I didn't catch, is there any last minute stories tonight?

02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:32.300
No.

02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:40.420
Yeah, there wasn't really, I mean, to be fair, it was kind of a slower news week than usual, probably with the looming releases ahead and everything like that.

02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:41.740
So, a little bit quiet.

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:47.020
But we'll probably pick up again as we start to get into the very, very, very busy month of November.

02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:54.940
Next week, I'll be coming fresh from Vegas, and we'll be able to talk about Final Fantasy XIV a little bit and how that was, seeing that firsthand.

02:30:55.140 --> 02:30:55.780
Who knows?

02:30:56.060 --> 02:31:04.420
You know, last year, one thing I was critical of about the event was that they could have used it as an excuse to show off some of the other Final Fantasy stuff.

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:05.220
So, who knows?

02:31:05.220 --> 02:31:07.420
Maybe they'll show off a little Final Fantasy XV on the side.

02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:07.820
We don't know.

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:08.260
We'll see.

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.620
But I'll be coming fresh from that event.

02:31:10.860 --> 02:31:13.340
We'll talk about that and whatever else happens in the news next week.

02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:20.540
Before we wrap things up here in studio tonight, I do want to thank everybody for downloading OLR or listening to us live, however you checked out the show.

02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:23.420
Please remember to help us spread the word about the show.

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:26.220
A little word of mouth goes a long way in getting the word out.

02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:29.860
And yeah, we really appreciate all you guys.

02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:36.700
If you want to leave us a five-star review somewhere on a site like iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show, that goes a long way as well.

02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:41.620
But, you know, telling a friend or two about the show is definitely, definitely the best thing for us.

02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:45.220
So, with that being said, final thought time.

02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:47.860
Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:52.780
Um, no, I just, I don't know.

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.300
We forgot to do FUs of the Week, but that's not a big deal.

02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:56.260
Oh, oops.

02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:58.220
Yeah, I totally did forget to do FUs of the Week, didn't I?

02:31:58.220 --> 02:31:58.740
That's all right.

02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:01.940
Um, I guess I'm having a pretty good week, all things considered.

02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:03.540
So, I'm eating FUs of the Week.

02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:08.980
Um, yeah, I guess I'm, I'm still going to try to work on my game.

02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:13.740
At the same time, I'm working on designing DDR pads because I really want to build some new ones.

02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:17.140
Um, this week's been basically just cleaning out the house.

02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:21.940
So, I've cleaned up a lot of my cord messes that I've had that my wife has been annoyed by.

02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:23.380
So, I did that.

02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:27.100
Um, yeah, I really am just trying to work on it.

02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:38.260
Just, like, I literally get home after putting the kids to bed and it's just, it takes an immense amount of focus to be able to work on my laptop while the TV's on.

02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:43.260
And then after my wife goes to bed, just an immense amount of focus to stay awake.

02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:47.060
And that's just not, I'm not winning that battle.

02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:49.140
All right.

02:32:49.180 --> 02:32:54.780
Uh, well, my final thought tonight is I'm really excited to go to Vegas next week, see some friends I haven't seen in a long time.

02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:57.260
And, uh, geek out over Final Fantasy 14.

02:32:57.660 --> 02:33:03.940
Uh, excited for other conventions coming up as well, including MagFest, uh, in, uh, January in DC.

02:33:03.940 --> 02:33:05.060
Looking forward to heading to that.

02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:08.460
In the meantime, um, a shameless plug for my Twitter.

02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:10.860
Follow me on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E.

02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:12.740
I've met a lot of really rad people on Twitter.

02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:16.820
So, uh, as long as I figure out that you're human, I'll usually follow you back.

02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:19.620
Uh, so yeah, uh, appreciate all those follows.

02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:21.340
And I guess, I guess that's it.

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:22.060
We're done.

02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:23.060
We're out of here for the night.

02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:28.020
So, uh, we will see you in a week's time here with another episode of OLR.

02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:28.900
Have a great week, everybody.

02:33:29.140 --> 02:33:29.700
And good night.

02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:33.060
