Orange Lounge Radio
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
Tonight, after complete silence, some tweets rock Hello Games
And are you ready to wait until 2017 for more info on Nintendo Switch?
All this and more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 663
For this, October the 30th of 2016, my name is Rob Roberts
Joining you live from our studio to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
And with me this week, say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki
Hello
Hi Loki, how are you?
Fine
So, Halloween's tomorrow
Yeah
Are you going to be taking the kids out for trick or treating and all that?
Yes, I will be
What are you dressing up as?
I'm not dressing up as anything
What? Have you got that? Are you too old for Halloween? Is that what's happened?
No, I just overdid it last year, so I'm not doing anything this year
Oh, you overdid it last year?
Yeah, because I stayed up for 24 hours straight to make that Lego Deadpool costume
That's right, I remember that, oh yeah, okay, so you earned your year off
Yeah, so I'm taking the year off
But unfortunately, no tingle, 14 years in a row
I wanted to get one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes that are the rage on the internet
I see a lot of those, yeah
So that would have been fun
I think I saw some picture of an inflatable T-Rex riding a T-Rex at some, like, theme park or something, I don't know
That would be funny
That would be hilarious
You mentioned real quick, I mean, you might be gonna talk about this in your gaming week, I suppose, but I'm gonna bring it up now
You mentioned you were at a social gathering last night
As, you know, the interesting thing with Halloween being on a Monday this year
There was Halloween parties Friday night, Halloween parties Saturday night
There's probably some Halloween parties tonight
And then there's actual Halloween on Monday
So, I know you went to a social gathering and you were doing the PlayStation VR
How was that received in a party type setting?
It's alright, I mean, there was some people that wanted to try it
Mostly the people that have already tried it before
Xtafur got to try it for the first time
So, of course, the first one you had to have him play was Kitchen
Which is Resident Evil 7, basically
I don't know why they call it, I guess Kitchen was the working name before they revealed it
The Kitchen demo, but that was funny, watching him jump
I didn't make it, like, five seconds to that demo
Like, the very first gory thing that happened, I noped the fuck out of that demo
I did
And then I set up Rush of Blood
Which you've really been raving about that game
Yeah, I love that game
So, we played, or I had
Was it Flocko Jones play
It was one of the levels in there
With, like, a witch thing that, like, fires crows at you or something
And so there was a few moments, like, there was
That's also the one that has, like, kind of the Silent Hill type room
Where there's these mannequins that will
You look away from them, they move
Yeah, that type of thing
So, that was funny
Just watching him, you know, jump at all the jump scares and stuff
Yeah, I don't like jump scares, I don't do it
Well, I always find them hilarious
It didn't necessarily scare me, I just kind of laugh at them
It's kind of fun
Fair enough
But it's a fun game, though
Alright, well not joining us tonight, of course, Dark Sakura
She is still on leave from the show
But she will hopefully be, actually, I think we're going to hear from her
In a couple of weeks
I know she's planning on being here for episode 666
And we're going to be taping 665 in advance
And I think she's going to be here for that
So, yeah, we'll have Dark Sakura back in the studio real soon
I know she misses you all, but her aim is improving
But if you are listening live, of course
You should join us in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
Even though Bobby was also off tonight
Halloween is just throwing everything off
Just throwing off everybody's rhythm
But a big hello to those of you that are in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
Stoppy, I think, talking about work on Monday
Saying in chat, I have some co-workers who are going to dress up
News to me, I thought they were dressing up as something all year
Yeah, they're trying to find an apartment
I'm not even that young, but it's a bunch of older people
And they always want to like, okay, the whole floor is going to do a theme
I'm like, fuck that
Because it's always some lame ass theme
Like, you know, the last time, last year it was
Oh, we're all going to dress up like celebrities
I'm like, fuck that, I'm dressing up as Lego Deadpool
Which is sort of a celebrity
Sort of a celebrity
But this year they're doing like 80s musicians
I'm like, no, no
I'm not going to do it
Hey, you can't talk until I introduce you
Let's say hello
We have some other folks in the studio
So I should probably introduce them
Because clearly they have something to say
So we have a couple other people joining us tonight
I'll start over here because this guy's here every week
So he's nothing special
Say hello to Shane, everybody
He's joining us here
I'm not holding up my mic near my mouth
Shane is protesting but not holding the mic near his mouth
Well, then I can't ask you about your shiny collection
And supposedly, what, you got to 100 shinies, right?
Yeah, I got to my 100 shinies
What was your 100th shiny that you got on Pokemon?
What was it?
Hello
I'm thinking
You don't know?
I would have thought this was a landmark occasion
That you would celebrate
But it was like days ago
So, I'm trying to remember, I got that
You know the old saying, you never forget your 100th Pokemon
It was some sort of fished-up Pokemon
I know that much
Oh, so you did use the fish trick
Yeah, for the last three I did fishing
I was just like, screw it, I'm going to do that
Okay, okay
Alright, so we'll just say Magikarp
Because you don't know
No, it wasn't a Magikarp
I already had that
It wouldn't have mattered
Alright, well congratulations
Congratulations on a 100 shiny Pokemon
Thank you
I'm not sure what else to ask you about
Solidarity is our guest
Nope, that's fine
Alright, so I'm brand new to the show
Has never been here in studio before
But I know it's been listening for a little while
Say hello everybody, welcome to the show tonight
JD?
Hi there
Hi, how are you?
Pretty good
Good, welcome to the show
Thank you
So, video games, you play them, right?
I sure do
Good, you're at the right place
But you, we were talking a little bit beforehand
Because I was asking if you'd played like Thumper on PlayStation 4
But you don't really own new consoles, right?
You're still rocking the classics?
Yeah, I mean, I keep up with stuff on Steam
So when stuff goes on sale, I pick things up
But yeah, I mean, my most recent consoles are a Wii and a PS2
So, so old school stuff?
Yeah
A little bit, at this point it's old school stuff?
I mean, it's weird to me to think of it like that
But yeah, it is
So do you consider yourself more of a PC gamer then
If you're keeping up with stuff mostly on Steam?
Yeah, I mean, I also, I play Guild Wars 2 a lot
So that's definitely a current title
But yeah, I would say the new stuff coming out, I'm a PC gamer
Okay, nice
Which is pretty much safe at this point
Because most of the games that come out nowadays that are worth getting are on PC
That is really true
You know, well, Microsoft has their whole thing with, you know, Xbox One
And like Windows 10 is like one platform, basically
And you buy a game one place, you get them on both
So I mean, you know, what, like Forza Horizon 3 you should be able to get on PC, right?
I just, I'm behind, I still haven't picked up that game
I almost did today, Shane tried
Yeah, there was a lot of like deals trying to be made, but
Okay, so here's the problem
I'm at Target, which is having the whole buy two, get one free video game thing
And for some reason, Shane has decided that I need to take advantage of this deal
I don't know what he gets out of it, but he's just
I was just bored
He's just decided he wants to watch me drop $100 on video games
So
It'd be like $120 plus tax, because games are $60
Fine, fine
But here's the problem, is I wanted to get, I was like
Alright, I'll get Forza Horizon 3, that's obvious
I'll get that one, because I need to get that still
I'll get Skyrim Special Edition, why not? I'm curious enough
Yeah, I would be all over that on Xbox One
I'm kind of hesitant on PlayStation 4
Well I do have an Xbox One, and so I'd probably pick it up over there
Just because of the whole modding situation
So okay, fine, those two, but then I couldn't figure out a third game that I want
Right, that I didn't already have
Now that's the problem guys, it's the one that I didn't already have
Because you could say, oh Civ 6 just came out, well I already bought that
I bought that before the sale happened
And usually, you know, I'm pretty good to myself
When a new game comes out that I want, I get it
So I didn't really have three games in the backlog to get
World of Final Fantasy?
Shane had suggested that, but I'm sorry
That demo did not sway me on the game
And even when we were watching people play it on Twitch, I wasn't feeling it
I'm not feeling World of Final Fantasy, I'm sorry to say
I'll be all over Final Fantasy 15 when that comes out
But that's not part of the sale, so that's an issue isn't it?
Over in chat at live.fognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy says
Shane, spend money, give me your credit card, Skye
No, yeah it sometimes goes like that
Well actually it was JD that came up with a brilliant idea on how to make this work
JD suggested, well why don't you buy the two games
And then get that third free game and then sell it to Shane
And I was like, okay, I'm liking this idea
We'll split the cost
And then they had a fight about how to split the cost, so it didn't happen
Then we had a fight about how to split the cost
Because Shane was like, hell yeah, I'll take a free game
And I'm like, wait a minute, it doesn't work like that
This is not me buying two games, so you get the free game
But then I offered up, I have Forza Horizon 3
On a demo, or not a demo, but a code
And I haven't used it yet, so I offered that up for the free game
Yes, but the problem is, when he offered up Forza Horizon 3
I said, great, now we're back to the same problem
I'll buy Skyrim, and then what?
I still don't have another game to get
So, then we fought in the middle of Target for a good 30 minutes
And JD had to watch all this, and it was really awkward
But, you know, welcome to my life, JD
It was funny
So, JD, you play the PC stuff and you play some of the classic consoles
You could have gotten Paper Mario
You know, that was suggested, and that was probably the closest
Where I was like, I might pick up Paper Mario
But for some reason, I didn't see it in the Wii U section, did you?
I don't think I even looked for it
I don't even think I saw it
Isn't it a 3DS game?
No
Oh, okay, that's a Wii U game
Well, I mean, it's very similar to the last 3DS game
Shut up
But you've talked about, now we'll talk about the Switch later on tonight
And obviously there was a whole lot of Switch talk last week
But JD, you're feeling the Switch announcement, right?
Yeah, no, I'm really looking forward to it
I mean, especially with the handheld capability
Because I started out, when I started on consoles, I started with the Game Boy
So, I mean, I've been playing handhelds for a long time
So I'm looking forward to seeing, you know, a more powerful handheld
Yeah
So I know another reason that, you know, you've started listening to OLR
And gotten to know us and everything is that you are a big fan of music games, right?
That's right
So tell us, like, how did the music game thing, let's do a throwback episode tonight
Oh, wow
How did the music game thing start? Like, what was your first music game? Was it DDR?
Yeah, so I started with DDR
Yeah, which mix?
It was Fifth Mix
Fifth Mix
Which is still one of my favorites
Uh-huh
I mean, they, anyway, there's a lot of Dance Mania songs on there
And just all of the licensing that they did in the earlier era of DDR was a lot of fun
Were you one of those people posting on DDR Freak back in the day, like some of us?
Every so often
Every so often? Awesome
What was your username on there, JD?
I don't even know if it's still there
I'm just curious if I was like, did I ever see him when I was, I never asked you this, like what was your name there?
I was Sky, that's why I still
I mean, this is ages ago, but I think my username was GameBoyGuy13
Okay, wow, okay, that's old school
Right?
Okay, I think I remember you under that name listening to this show
Oh my god
I think I do, I think I do, name sounds familiar
This really is a throwback episode
I know, I know
So, okay, so you started on DDR Fifth Mix, and then, so what other music games, so do you buy the, like you said you have PlayStation 2
So do you buy all the, because they stopped making Mania 2DX during the PlayStation 2 era, do you import all that stuff?
Yeah, so I have the home version copies of the 2DX titles and the DDR ones
I used to have a PS1 because a lot of the DDR titles were only, the earlier ones up through Fifth Mix were only released on PlayStation in Japan
So, when I was in high school I had them, but I don't anymore for various reasons
But, yeah, mostly I just have a 2DX, because I have a US Konami controller for the 2DX
And I have, I don't have DDR pads anymore, they didn't survive a cross-country move
So, I've been, you know, it's on my to-do list is to pick up a new pad, so, and get it home set up
You grew up in Orlando
That's right
And then you, did you live in Kansas?
No, I went to college in the Central Valley
Okay, and then you, now you live in San Francisco
That's right
Okay, so that was your cross-country, got it
Yep
Got it, got it
Okay, let's see, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, Fifth is a good place to start, though you miss out on Fourth Plus
There was a Fourth Plus arcade machine, like when I was going out and about in Orlando, and Rocky's Replay was the name of the place
And they had Fourth Plus for a long time, so when I would go out, you know, with my friends and go play DDR, that was one of the places I'd go
So I got very familiar with Fourth Plus
Now one thing I find kind of interesting is that, you know, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we kind of, I don't want to say we stopped playing DDR
Oh yep, I'm playing tons of DDR
But we kind of, we kind of, like, we kind of did, like it's one of those things though, but like obviously now with the round one, kind of having these arcade games that I used to be really into in my 20s, kind of making a resurgence again
And like the types of arcades I was into 10 years ago, 15 years ago when the show started, like now that that's making a resurgence, I'm kind of into it again
But otherwise, I don't usually like seek out DDR machines, but you do, right? You still like regularly go to arcades and play DDR, right?
Not as regularly as I'd like to, because there aren't really any convenient to me, and I think that's, you know, a sign of there not being as many arcades anymore as there used to be
I mean, I have to still use website databases to find them, I'm not just going to randomly run across a machine
Have you checked out Ace yet in Dave and Busters?
Oh I forget it's a Dave and Busters, that's another thing in Roseville, JD
We were talking earlier about how all of the fun stuff is in Roseville, apparently
But then I'm like, but Roseville isn't fun, like Roseville will shut down at 10 o'clock and then, now it sucks
So it's just funny, we were like, we could go to Dunkin Donuts, oh it's in Roseville, we go to Golf Land, it's in Roseville, Mongolian Roseville
Everything's in fucking Roseville
They have Krispy Kreme in there open 24 hours
That's true, they have pumpkin spice donuts this week too, it was amazing
Anyway, I could talk about food all night long, but we should probably take the healthier option and continue talking about DDR
We could talk about food gaming
Food gaming? What's food gaming?
Well there's various games about food, I mean there's Cooking Mama, there's Cook Serve Delicious, all sorts of fun stuff
There was one guy I saw a YouTube video of playing Overwatch with a controller made out of bananas through Arduino
So that's food gaming
I guess, I guess that's a type of food gaming
Or we could just have a 100 second kitchen battle
I see what you did there
Are you one of those guys that drops the names of songs into conversations and goes, get it?
Wasn't that a meme a while ago?
It was a LiveJournal community
Oh god, so LiveJournal, you have had your life changed by LiveJournal just like the rest of us
Oh yeah
Yeah, oh man, I met Alan on LiveJournal and Orange Lounge Radio probably still has a LiveJournal community
I don't remember the last time it was updated
I don't even remember what it was
It was either Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio
You couldn't get OLR?
I don't think we got OLR, no I think it was probably Taken or something
So yeah, awesome
So I'm not sure what else to ask you about
So you go to arcades and you play sometimes DDR but not as often as you used to
Ever since Playland Japan opened in Japantown a couple years ago
I've gone there and they have a popin music machine
In Orlando you couldn't find popin anywhere
And now that I'm in the Bay Area it's a lot easier to find
And so I've started playing popin a bit
But you have yet to, even though you're in the Bay Area, you have yet to go to any of these round ones
Right, because I live in San Francisco, I don't have a car
And all of these round ones are way out on the edges of the area
So it's impossible to get to on transit
So just so you know, I brought up our LiveJournal community
Which is at orangelounge.livejournal.com
And the last entry we made was Sunday, June 21st, 2009
Oh wow
And that was, the announcement there was
The new URL to find OLR is at radio.allgames.com
Because that must have been the date that we flipped over to AllGames from Live 365
So, which was our home before we were here at VOG Network
So, just kind of funny that that's the last time the LiveJournal community was used
Although that's a pretty important update
Yeah
I should probably make an update that says, just in case you were looking here
Yeah, I think they have another show on now, Sundays at 6
Which is fine, I'm sure it's a fine show, but we've moved somewhere else
Oh, LiveJournal
I don't know what's going on on LiveJournal anymore
Oh no they didn't, community, right?
I think, oh no they didn't, it's probably the only thing going on on LiveJournal right now
And Russian chat
Well, okay, yeah, there's definitely, there's always been a large Russian community on LiveJournal
But it's mostly taken over the site because of ownership changes
Hmm
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Pokemon collectors on LiveJournal, it's really active
So I guess there's still the communities, some of the communities still have a presence over there
But I kind of, I kind of miss LiveJournal in some ways
We were talking about this a little bit, is that
You know, I know Facebook I think kind of killed it for a lot of people
Because with Facebook it was so easy from your mobile phone to post pictures, to post other things
But Facebook, it sucks, like I don't know how else to put it
Like it's one of those necessary things I have to do
It's so full of garbage right now
It is so full of garbage
But it sucks because I feel that honestly, if I didn't check Facebook
I would not know that like some of my friends are expecting kids or getting married or things like that
Like I would miss that if I did not have Facebook now
Exactly, and I didn't check that and then when I had to help them move
I was like, oh, you're having a baby, okay
Yeah, right
I mean, I even find out about family stuff from Facebook sometimes
Like, you know, it's, people use it, but that's all they use
But the problem with Facebook is that it's not chronological
You can miss things, you know
Exactly
Even if you're reading the site
You have to have, he can sort it with the top stories
Or he can do chronological
Chronological is default
And then Facebook's like, fuck you, we want ad revenue
We're gonna fuck that sorting shit all up
And it's just gonna shuffle everything
And, yeah
Yeah, it's rough, it's rough
And thank you Alex P. Carson in chat says
OMG, I love Rob on Facebook
Well, I don't post, like, I wouldn't dare post
I don't know, I feel like maybe I have gotten political
political stuff is, like, gay rights stuff
Which, you know, you're not gonna dare speak up on my Facebook
anti that stuff, right?
But I think I've tried very hard not to dip my toe into the whole
like, presidential race
Because, like, I just, I fucking can't
Like, there's enough of it everywhere else on Facebook
So instead, I like to post things like
I think just this past week
It was announced that ABBA is doing something in 2017
They're not reuniting, but they might be
And yes, OMG, I can fucking tie ABBA to gaming this week
This is the best week ever since SingStar ABBA came out
Oh, that's been out for a while
I know, right?
But when has ABBA been in games?
And so, ok, but this week they announced that ABBA's gonna be doing something
And it sounds like it might be a VR type of experience
Or it could be, it may be AR
And, like, part of, like, they obviously aren't releasing a lot of details
And they're not going to till next year
But one of the things that crossed my mind was this whole hologram thing
Like, remember when Tupac was at Coachella a couple years ago?
Remember that?
Or if Jamie was here, I'm sure she would talk about gorillas when they play live
Or Hatsune Miku
You people, I'm sure you know Hatsune Miku
Oh man, that VR demo was terrible
I like the game
I like the game
But the concept of the concert is so interesting to me
It's not bad, just interesting because it's, I don't want to say it's all fake
But it kind of is
Like, I guess the music is played live by musicians
But all these projections are fake
It's so interesting to me
So I don't know if that's the type of thing that ABBA's doing
But they could be leveraging gaming technology
Like a VR headset
To bring ABBA current
Which would be awesome because the greatest music ever made
I mean, as long as they're making new music, I'll be happy
They're in their 70s
Those girls' voices, Agnetha and Anthea
Cher is that old and she's making new music
Yeah, I think it always auto-tune the show
So when are we going to embrace Vocaloid Tupac?
I don't know
Why would we do that when he's not dead?
Maybe with Prince
Because Prince has all this unreleased music
So eventually whenever they wiggle out the licenses
Or David Bowie
Those are two artists right there
This year has fucking sucked
There's been so many people that have passed
And those obviously are two all-time greats
But also the thing that those two have in common
Is that they were always in tune
With technological advances and things like that
Like both of them were
Like what David Bowie had a game
Prince had, when he was in his symbol
The love symbol phase
He had some type of interactive CD-ROM
Live journal page
Actually, if I'm not mistaken
Didn't Prince have the largest internet presence
Like in the 90s when the internet was first growing
Like the largest fandom was Prince
I feel like I read that somewhere
But anyway, doesn't matter
My point is that
You're right, that same type of technology
I mean we're having a laugh about Tupac
And Coachella and all this stuff
But that same type of technology
I could totally see like a Bowie or a Prince type experience
Especially if they're opening
Paisley Park
To tourists now
Like imagine if you could actually see
Prince playing on a
I don't know how big that place is
If it had a stage or anything like that
But imagine if you could go in a room and see Prince
Working or something
Crazy technology
It's very crazy
Let's see, Dungeon Buster in Chat says
Bowie was an Omicron
One of Quantic Dream's earliest games
Right, absolutely
Vidpower at live.vognetwork.com says
I remember that Letterman Hatsune performance
Sad that Letterman was so confused
I can imagine, I mean
Also, wasn't that the point where Letterman kind of had
One foot out the door, like he knew his end date
And he knew Colbert was coming into play
So he was kind of like, over it
He was phoning it in that last year
Let's see, Rageinator says
Abba, greatest music ever, Skye, surely you jest
Metallica
Can you imagine like
Queen?
There's also a SingStar Queen diss
There is a SingStar Queen diss, now okay
If you're talking about Queen versus Abba
Okay, now we're having a contest
You know, like, fucking Hologram
Freddie Mercury, I mean that'd be fucking amazing
Hologram Michael Jackson, I mean if we're gonna
Exactly, let's just do it all
But Rageinator says Metallica and Stone Temple
Pilots greater than Abba, first of all
Look
First of all, everybody has different tastes
I could agree with the Stone Temple Pilots one
But I want to point this out
I was at Blizzcon a couple years ago
Metallica was the headliner
So like, we could have got like, seats
Or, well, nobody sits in a Metallica concert
But we could have been right there, like in the front
Mashing with everybody
We chose to go to the bar instead
So, I'm sorry
Cause that probably really angers you to hear that
But I would fully expect that if the
The roles were reversed
And it was an Abba concert, you'd be telling me the same thing
You'd be like, you know what Rob, I went to the bar instead
And, you know, that's fine
Cause everybody's into what they're into
So, and Tigerclaw says they are
Different styles of music, that's very true
That's very, very true
Alright, anyhow
Okay, so JD, one question I always ask
Of guests, and after this we'll move on and talk about
Our gaming weeks, but one question I always ask
Of guests is
What is your favorite
Video game of all time
You can only pick one
All the others will be killed
Just kidding, no, you can only pick one
What is your favorite video game of
All time
Not that I'm putting them on the spot or anything
Favorite video game
Favorite video game, that's what we talk about here
At OLRP Games
If we're just going
Based on replayability
And that, I mean
P-Cross can keep me fascinated for hours
Okay, good choice
And there's so many varieties of P-Cross as well
I like the ones where you draw a picture a lot
Better than the ones that are just, you know
Use the logic and complete the grid
Because I like making pretty pictures
Of course, who doesn't?
People out there are weird
Yeah, it does, I mean even Nintendo
Even made Mario P-Cross early on
Wasn't it like a Game Boy game or something?
And they also
Recently, yeah, they recently
Had a Zelda P-Cross
As a, you could get it with Miitomo points
That was my first exposure to P-Cross
Because I was playing Miitomo pretty hard
Those first couple months, I finally fell off
But you're still playing Miitomo, right?
Occasionally
Well, so my sister
Got a new iPhone and now she has
The memory for apps
So she's started Miitomo
And I've kind of picked it up again
Partly to comment and like her answers
To give her coins, because I know how important that is
When you're getting started
But also it's a good way for us to keep in touch
Because she's still in Orlando
And, you know, we don't talk as much as I'd like to
So that's one way for us to keep it
That's kind of interesting that of all things it's Miitomo
But, you know
Well, it's not just Miitomo, it's Twitter, it's texting
It's a lot of things
I think a lot of people have a story like this
Like when Alan and I were first dating
And Alan was living in San Francisco and I was here
Playing World of Warcraft together was a way
We could quote-unquote hang out
Even though we weren't necessarily hanging out
You know what I mean?
MMOs and video games lend itself very well
In that space to help bridge those distances
Definitely
And I mean, I would get her playing Guild Wars
If I didn't want her to have
You know, I want her to do well in school
Oh, you play Guild Wars?
I mean, I played the original Guild Wars
Starting in like 2006
And when the new one came out
All of my friends in my guild moved over as well
That's cool
I have Guild Wars 2, I don't have the expansion
I have the original Guild Wars 2, but I didn't play it very long
It came out at a weird time
I feel like there was a lot of stuff coming out all at once
My computer at the time was struggling with it
Really?
Yeah, I need to go back and play it now
Because I got a souped up computer a couple years ago
That can play whatever
So yeah, I should go back and do
Guild Wars 2 at some point
It'd be fun
You can be on any server
You're not limited
It's limited by region
If you're in North America, you can only play with North American servers
If you're in EU, you can only play with EU people
That's not that bad
But that's the only restriction
There is one game mode called World v World
Which is
It's a pretty unique mechanic
Where it's like sieging and stuff
So your one server
Is fighting a one-on-one-on-one battle
So there are three different servers at a time
I remember playing one of those
It's like 60 people in there at once
I think the map cap is something like 200
Oh my god, yeah, I remember playing that
All these people, it was PVP on a massive scale
Right, so it's PVP
But there's a big environmental component to it
Because you're wearing down forts and such
Yes
It's not just go kill each other
It's break down the walls
There's catapults and rams and things like that
That's the only place where
Server actually makes a difference
Because if you're on one server and your friend's on another
You can't play together
There's no guessing for that
And wasn't that something where
You would level sync too
Even if you're level 5
You get bumped up to max level
So everybody can compete on equal ground
Max level is 80
And all of the competitive modes
World v World and standard PVP
Which is 5 on 5
All of those are at max level
So you don't have to worry about
Oh I'm underleveled for this match
That's not a concern for the most part
That's cool
There's also no monthly fee
Which makes it a good game for
Oh I have a copy of this but I don't have to subscribe to it
I can just pick it up and play it however much I want
And then leave it with no cost
I know that that's made Guild Wars
Attractive to a lot of people as the model
And in fact the base game
Has gone free to play in the past year
When they released the new expansion
Gotcha
In fact I think Loki kind of wishes
Square Enix would pay attention to how well that model
Has worked for Guild Wars
And adopt it with things such as Final Fantasy 11
They're never going to do it with 11 because they have 14
14 makes them too much money but
Yeah it would be nice
Probably should check out
Elder Scrolls Online because they went
See I really didn't like Elder Scrolls Online
I didn't either
I just couldn't get into it
I couldn't get into it either
That was the disappointing part because I really liked
Elder Scrolls Skyrim
And Oblivion but
Online just not
Not feeling it
I understand
Yeah so that whole conversation from
P-Cross your favorite game
Which if you haven't
Spent your Nintendo points
Which people are probably collecting by signing
Into the eShop every week and stuff
If you are check out that
Zelda P-Cross you can get a free one
And that will kind of introduce you to what those puzzles are
If nothing else
That was my gateway drug
And I believe our pal
Bobby Blackwolf is really into those P-Cross games too
Because I know he says they're
Kind of cheap they're only like 3 or 4 bucks
A pop right?
I think he buys them when they come out
I play them on my phone and there's any number of apps
On the Google store
I think of P-Cross
Think of P-Cross as synonymous
With Nintendo
Which is interesting because P-Cross has
As like a picture crossword which is what it comes from
Has been around since pen and paper
Like you can you know before it was
A video game it was just a puzzle
So now I'm going to go
Download 5,000 P-Cross apps on my phone
Later and I'm going to have you to blame
I'd give you Rex but you're on iPhone
But have you downloaded PolitiCats yet?
I did not download PolitiCats
I haven't either
But we probably should do that first
No I guess we'll talk about our gaming
And get sucked into yet another clicker game
I know that's kind of my hesitation
I don't need another clicker game
I've finally gotten free though from
Nonstop Night I've lost interest in it
Yeah I kind of fell off that too
So maybe it's time to go
Time to get into some PolitiCats
Brad will be very happy
Pod Culture is back this week
After a long break
So make Brad happy this week
Get some PolitiCats action going on
Alright well let's talk about
The games we have been playing this week
Actually
Yeah in a segment we call the
How was your gaming week?
I'm losing it guys
Okay look just disclaimer
And I warned you this would happen last week
I was up until 3am last night because we had a rocky show
Which JD was in town to see
I hope you had a good time
I highly recommend it
And you kind of got to see the other side of Rob Roberts
The Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side
That's right the Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side of me
Hosting that show
And my voice today
Is kind of shot and I'm just like my energy
Is like drained
From last night so
If I'm like out of it tonight admittedly
Yes I am
Because we talked about that whole Halloween on Friday
Halloween on Saturday
So I am a little drained this week
So let's talk a little bit about how was your gaming week
What types of video games have you been playing this week
Well thankfully I've actually played quite a bit this week
So I was playing
I didn't get to play a whole ton of
PlayStation VR but I did play
A ton of it this weekend
Just basically the get ready for
The party that was on Saturday
So I played through Rush of Blood
Previously I played through like the third level
And then I just finished it
This week so
That was fun I really do enjoy that game
It's probably my favorite game on
PlayStation VR so far
Along with that I did play some of the other demos
On there I got to see the
Kitchen demo being played which
Is alright I think it was pretty cool
Probably would have been a little bit more scary
Actually wearing the headset for that
I did pick up
Rez so I'll probably be playing some of that this week
But I haven't actually played any of it yet
I tried Thumper
Which I thought was pretty cool
So that might be one I pick up later on
It was pretty difficult
So I don't know we'll see
And then
I don't know I've been browsing the store a lot
Because I've been like at my work
They do these kind of
Incentive things where like someone will give you
An award for doing something that you're
Normally not supposed to be in charge of
And kind of you know discretionary
Efforts and so they'll give you like a certificate
And then this
They call it a Tango card which is basically
This universal gift card that you go on a website
And redeem for something so I've been using it
For PlayStation money
So I've
Been getting games with that
And so
I've been kind of browsing the store figuring out what I want to buy next
Because
There's not a whole lot of the new stuff
Coming out that really interests me
I thought about doing
I think it was called
Windlands or something like that
It's some like parkour
Grappling hook exploration
Game but I hear it's kind of boring
And I mean it looks neat
It's just kind of
Running low on content
Oh I did try Battlezone that was the other one
That I played the demo for and that was pretty cool
Once again though 60 bucks for that
I don't know that's a bit expensive
And then
I did play some non VR stuff
I played more cluster trucks
Because I was trying to see if the
Free Halloween update was available
But I think that's only on PC
So I haven't dug into my PC copy yet
But I played a little bit more of that
Passed some more levels
And I got to
The future land now
Which is incredibly hard
Because a lot of them involve jumping down holes
To get the things
It's frustrating and hard
But it's fun
That would be an awesome VR game
And then Ingress
I did try a little bit of Pokemon Go
Because of the Halloween update
I played it for like 5 minutes
And already lost interest
I've been loving the Halloween update
But again with the Pogo Plus
And me just having an interest in general
To try to do more walking
I just feel like Pokemon Go has been a great motivator for me
And I've been loving this Halloween event
Because it's not just double candy from catches
It's double candy from eggs
Double candy from the candy factory
It's great
I kind of wish it would just be permanent
It is nice that they have
New Pokemon
That's kind of nice to wander around
Instead of Rattatas everywhere
Now it's Cubones and Meowths
I will say that I noticed a spawn difference
Here in Sacramento versus San Francisco
In San Francisco there were Gasleys
All over the place
Turn around you see a Gasley
And I haven't noticed that out here
It's Meowths and Cubones everywhere
It's a drought out here
It is, it is
Anything else for your gaming week Loki?
I did play Jackbox Party Pack 3
That was something I was introduced to
Last night
So I got to try out a few of the games in there
Trivia Murder Party which is awesome
Hosted by Satan from South Park
It's funny
I think we all played Jackbox Party Pack 3 at this point
And that was the game
I was looking forward to the most
I love it
It's a great party game
And I think for people that are looking for You Don't Know Jack
I think this isn't
You Don't Know Jack
But the setup is extremely similar
I think people that are missing
You Don't Know Jack will be into it
But I can't stand the announcer voice
I can't stand
The filtered announcer voice
I can't do it
When Travis Donovan did DJ Satan
On his show
I thought it was a better filter
It's hard to hear on the TV
I thought it was hilarious
I don't care for it
I know we have folks at Jackbox that listen to the show
And you guys are great
The Satan thing
I couldn't connect with that
I had never played a Jackbox game before
Prior to that
I actually got to try it out
My wife actually played two
You hadn't played Party Pack 2?
No, I hadn't played any of them
I thought it was fantastic
With the phone thing
They should do that with a ton of more games
I don't know why no one else is doing it
Jackbox games does that
I understand they do that with all their games
Seriously, this should be something you should be doing with a ton of other games
Yeah, using a phone as a controller is a great mechanic
And everyone needs to do it
Well, to be fair
And maybe this is also interesting
They were criticized the first year
When You Don't Know Jack was in there
Because the phone has the delay
So when people would buzz in
To try to answer on You Don't Know Jack
It didn't really work right
Yeah, I could see that
But they switched it now in Trivia Murder Party
Everybody answers the question
It's different
So I wonder
If maybe
That was their work around
Maybe we're just going to come up with a new trivia game
Interesting, I'd be curious
Yeah, we played that
We also played Quiplash 2
Which was fantastic
We also played Fake In It
But Fake In It honestly was the least favorite
I think of the whole group
I didn't like it too much
There was no real indicator
The questions they were asking
It didn't seem like it would be that hard
To fake anything
I don't know
It was just kind of dumb
We got really bored with it really fast
We were like, okay, we're not playing that again
Which minigames did you get for it? Was it the pointing one?
We had the pointing one
We had the numbers on your fingers
And then there was
Raising your hand or not
So there's one of them that you can get
It's called texting or something
And everybody but one
The faker gets a certain question
Texted to them
And the faker gets a different question
And then all of the answers go on the screen
And you can see them together
Yeah, that was the last one
And the spoiler, it was Flaco Jones
Flaco Jones had gone to the bathroom
And didn't actually answer the question
Oh no
And so the first round of that were like
Oh, well, I don't know who it is
And we were like, it's probably Flaco
And we just all voted that
And sure enough, it was him
Because he just didn't answer any of them
Oh, I didn't know the game was still going
He could have taken his phone into the bathroom
With him and played from the potty seat
See, that's the other advantage
To having your phone as a controller
Is that you don't have to take a break
Well, and also it's awesome too
Just like the Twitch support and stuff
I just think it's
I know what these games are
I didn't know what the appeal was
Or how fun they would be
And I'm just really surprised
How fun it was
Yeah, some comments in chat
It's an innovative idea and I'm loving it
We've had great parties with the Party Pack
With friends
I don't like using my phone for stuff
It should all be on the console or PC you play on
Plus, not everyone has smartphones
Or Wi-Fi slash Bluetooth
You know, I kind of see
That perspective, but at the same time
I think this is why not every game
Uses this in the world
But I think, you know, this is Jackbox's niche
Right now, and they're doing really well with it
It works as a party game
Plus, you can use a laptop or an iPad
That's true, you could use a laptop
All you need, anything with a web browser
You don't even have to be in the same room
I know some people who play remotely using the room code
And the Twitch thing
I don't remember if it was the first
Party Pack or whatever they had before that
Was when they started realizing
And we had them on the show for packs 1 and 2
And I really should have sent them an invite for part 3
But, you know, just
Everything else going on
But if you guys are out there listening and want to come talk about part 3
You can, just shoot me an email
But, so with part 1
I think they saw the successes on Twitch
So I think in part 2, they actually tried to think
More about how can we accommodate
The Twitch audience, and they were seeing that
Now this one feels like
All the games can be done over Twitch
And there's even thing in the option mode
To let the timers be longer
To account for the Twitch delay
Yeah, it's pretty crazy
I was impressed by how much specific
Twitch features there were in each of the games
I went and looked at the settings
Because I'm that kind of a gamer sometimes
And I was impressed, everything had settings for it
Yeah, so they're kind of refining that
Yeah, so maybe
When they have the Steam sale or something
I'll pick up all three Party Packs
Yeah, probably towards
Black Friday or something, they'll probably have a super bundle
That has a ton of stuff, I'm sure they will
But, what was I going to say about part 3?
I didn't get to play all of it
Because it definitely seems like
For a lot of people
Party Pack 3 is trivia murder party
And other games
Everybody goes and plays that one first
We didn't do faking it until the end until when people started leaving
Because we had 8 people
So faking it is only up to 6
So we're just like, oh we can't play that right now
We're just going to play these two
We played trivia murder party twice
And I like how the second time you play it the same people
It's the siblings
So it's the junior
And then they even create a part 2
With the subtitle
Unless you were the survivor the first time
Then you don't get the junior
Did you play a third game?
We didn't play the third one
There's an achievement for making a trilogy
Yeah, an achievement for making a trilogy
And you get part 3, the never ending gory
That's awesome
I only got to play the trivia murder party
And we played Gespionage
We played Gespionage quite a bit
I was going to say one more trivia murder party
Because basically
For anyone that's not familiar with it
So you answer a trivia question
If you get it right
You get money, if you get it wrong
You have to play a mini game
And the mini games, if you fail the mini game you die
But the one we played
But your ghost can still play
So you're not out of the game
You can still play
But the final round
If you're a ghost, you're at a huge disadvantage
Well, it depends
I've had games where you can
Take over someone's body and win
So there was one
This one, you didn't die
But you had to pick a finger that cut off
Yes, I hated that one so much
I was like
What is this? You pick a finger
Well, I'll pick this finger
And come to find out, there's always four answers
And then if you happen to cut off that particular finger
You can't answer that question correctly
That was brilliant
We just spoiled it for everybody
The first time I saw it was brilliant
You cut off a finger, so like you say, you cut off your first finger
Then you can never answer the first answer
All you see is a picture of a finger
Of a severed finger
That was fucking brilliant
It reminded me of Heavy Rain
It's kind of disturbing
It was a fantastic game
But then when the answer is that answer
You can't guess it
So you go right back to the killing room
So it's an interesting mechanic because
The longer you play, the more likely you are to
Have severed fingers and fail out
It prevents
Indefinite games
My favorite one was the one that Shane got
That was like the wheel of death
The wheel of
The wheel of
The wheel of
Losing
It was like these giant
Squares for death and the teeniest
Little sliver for you live
There was one where you had to make the
Longest word out of the letters
I made a pretty long word
I forgot to hit submit
Oh my god, that happened to me in the first game
I had a sixth game, aw crap
It happened to me in the first game, alright
We've been talking about Jackbox Party back for ten minutes
But it's a lot of fun
Anything else for your game of the week?
That's it
Fair enough, we'll go to our guests next
We haven't heard a lot from Shane, how was your game of the week?
What have you been playing?
Pokemon, oh it was an Octillery by the way
I looked at my list
I see, so that was the
100th Pokemon then
100th shiny unique Pokemon
And I went to round one this weekend
And I played theater rhythm in the arcade
And that was really fun
How is theater rhythm in the arcade different from the DS?
Well you don't use the touch screen to play
You have two little buttons to hit
And these little rounded
Knobs
And so if you've played theater rhythm
You've got times when you're tapping the screen
And times when you're sliding your stylus
Across the screen
So the knobs act like the stylus part
And the buttons act like the tapping part
And because there's two
Knobs, sometimes you have to
Do both in the same direction, opposite directions
It's really interesting
It's pretty fun, I wish I had more songs
But you can unlock them, I don't know how still
But I unlocked one song so I was happy with that
And I want to play it again
Because it was good
The end of that story
And that's all I've been playing
Because it's all I ever play is Pokemon
So at round one you were just playing the usual stuff
DDR Ace?
No I didn't play any DDR because I was tired
Because I had just packed up a whole bunch of stuff
And moved it to my new house
And so I played
Crossbeats a lot
Because they had a Halloween event
And when you played this specific song
And beat it on different difficulties
You got new titles
For your account
So I got the title Trick or Treat
And the title Happy Halloween
I was happy about that
And I changed my avatar to a ghost and a pumpkin
Because I also unlocked that
And that was cool
I'm trying to think if they had anything else
Noteworthy and new there
But I think theater rhythm was the only thing
I saw that was really new
Okay that's all
Alright
No I'm gonna go get food
Okay have fun
JD how was your gaming week?
It was good
So like we talked about I played Guild Wars 2
I picked up Pokemon Go again
Because I actually lost my battery about a month ago
So my phone just didn't have battery to play Pokemon Go
Because it's a real drainer
So I've started on the Halloween event
And I like that a bit
I've been playing Pokemon Shuffle
On my phone which is a puzzle game
It's sort of third party-ish
I forgot the name of the developer
But it's a match 3
Pokemon game
But it's a more puzzle aspect
And they're doing all of their Halloween stuff
So lots of ghost Pokemon events
I picked up Mini Metro
Or I picked that back up
I noticed they added a San Francisco map
And Mini Metro is a game in which you are developing
A subway
And it's algorithmically generated
So stations will pop up
Of different shapes
And you try to draw lines that will match them
And you're moving passengers around
Before they have to wait too long
If you have too many unhappy people waiting there
Your system will close
Because you've caused a meltdown
Because they burned the station down
They riot
Exactly
There's a bunch of different world cities
Most of them are famous for having subways
Like New York and London and Paris
And then there's some more exotic ones
Like Melbourne, Australia
And I think the Auckland one
Is this is a future scenario
In the hypothetical Auckland Metro
If they ever make one
But San Francisco was just added
And since I live there and I'm a transit geek
I was super excited to play that
You're basically building your own BART system
What is a transit geek?
I think Misty
Who listens to this show a lot
Is also a transit geek
She takes trains everywhere across the nation
That's definitely part of it
I'm also interested in where things go
And why and how
I get involved in the city planning process
Sometimes going to show up
At local government stuff
It's kind of like
You know those government meetings in Parks and Recreation
That's basically very accurate
Even in San Francisco
Shane is going to be sad he missed a Parks and Rec reference
That's his favorite show
That's what happens when you leave
I love it
I know this is a video game show
But I have to ask
The high speed rail in California
Oh my god
It's going to happen
They're already building it
But in Fresno, JP
They're building it in Fresno
To Bakersfield or something
These are cities nobody wants to go to
There's already a train
That goes from Bakersfield to Oakland
And it gets a lot of ridership
Because people don't necessarily go
From one end to the other
Don't get me wrong
I love the idea of a high speed rail to connect
San Francisco, Sacramento and LA
And Oakland and the big places in between
But you need to start
With San Francisco to Sacramento
You don't start it in Fresno
Well you have to start somewhere
To be honest there's less of a fight
Politically by starting in the Central Valley
Than there would be trying to figure out
Which alignment to get to LA
Which alignment to get to the Bay Area
Or to get up the Central Valley except the farmers
Well I mean Hanford has a problem with it
But they're the only ones
If you compare Hanford raising a fuss
To Palo Alto raising a fuss
That's why it's starting there
You have to start somewhere
Get something operational and it'll be harder to kill
Alright so gaming
So these are the things you have to consider in mini Metro
Also on trains I picked up Ticket to Ride
They added achievements
And new maps and DLC
So I played a couple of games
I played a Steam version of a board game
Because Days of Wonder is really good about
Making computerized versions of their games
And I mean if you've played board games
Some of the biggest hassle with it
Is putting all the pieces away
And it's nice to have a computer do it for you
And keep score
That is nice, that is awfully convenient
I don't like to clean
You know that now that you've seen the house
Hey it's not that bad
Alright anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
I think that's about it
I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14
Because you all know I love that game
So I'm still hitting the ground with that
So even though I kind of went off on Fan Fest
A couple of weeks ago
It really did re-energize my love of that game
So I've been playing that a lot
But I have been playing other stuff too
I randomly, this super random purchase
But I saw it on the Playstation store and I was like
Okay I want to get that, I got King of Fighters 94
So I played that a little bit
And I forgot how fucking hard that game is
Or at least for me
I can get past the first
Fight barely
But then the second fight I die a lot
So it doesn't matter
I can use Team Europe
I can use Team Korea
It doesn't matter I'm going to get my butt kicked
So that was a fun Neo Geo throwback
And I remember we were talking about that on the show
A couple of weeks ago how those games were going to start showing up
In that series that I think a lot of people forget
Is on Playstation 4
Because they don't really promote it heavily
But it's there
There's some real deep cuts in the library there
It was right there when you went to go buy Jackbox
So it was at least a little promoted
It was but I also knew to go sort new by date
So I could find Jackbox
Even Jackbox I don't think it had a splash banner
Or if it did I totally missed it
It's kind of a habit now
Like on Tuesdays I just go to the Playstation store
And I sort new
And I just look at what's new and see if there's anything I want
And I do the same thing on Xbox One
I don't think the store is as well laid out on Xbox One
But I will boot up the Xbox One every Thursday
To see what's backwards compatible this week
What just showed up in my library
For the backwards compatibility
And I've been getting a lot of surprises there
So that's cool
So yeah I played a little King of Fighters 94
So that was cool that that showed up
But I've also been playing a lot of Dragon Quest Builders
Now I mentioned that I picked up this game
While I was out in Vegas
I never got around to playing it last week
But I finally sat down and spent some quality time with it this week
And I really do like that game
I mean I know a lot of people are writing it off
It's like a Minecraft clone
But it doesn't, like when you were watching me play it
Does it, I mean I should say
Does it look like Minecraft? Yes
The graphics look like Minecraft
But did the interface and the UI look like Minecraft? No
I actually haven't played Minecraft so I can't give that comparison
It's not Minecraft
It honestly
To me feels like
More like a classic JRPG
But it's just that
It's in this world
That you can break bricks
And that's how you find things
But it's got like the very rudimentary crafting system
That you would saw in a lot of early JRPGs
So it's just kind of like honestly
It's honestly like a Super Nintendo style
Dragon Quest game
But I don't even know if I can call it that
Because then you would expect the fights
But the fights are more like Zelda
Like you can charge your sword and do the spins
And all that, it's more actiony
It's not like the classic battles
It definitely looks like there was a collection aspect to the game also
So like 3D.Dragon
Actually
Actually that's not a bad comparison at all
I would say this game has a lot more in common
With 3D
3D.Action Heroes
3D.Game Heroes
That game on PS3, you all know which one
But with a destructive environment
That's the big difference there
And that 3D
3D.Action Hero
That was a straight up Zelda rip off
No but I say that in the best possible way
I mean if you're going to rip Zelda off
Do it good
And that game did a very good job of doing it
And kind of bringing a Zelda-esque game to the Playstation
And I say Dragon Quest Heroes
Kind of continues that a little bit
I'm really into it
I think it's really fun
I hear there's only like 4 chapters in the game
But I've been playing for like 10 hours
And I'm still on the first chapter
Like there are long chapters
So what exactly do you do in that?
Do you build up your town?
So you start in a little hole in the ground
And you work your way out
And you find this town
And there's voices that are talking to you
Like this world once thrived
And then the Dark Lord came
The Shadow Lord came and took it all down
Like every generic JRPG trope
But then you start
The girl will be like
If only we could patch the house back together
So and it's very obvious
Like where you put the bricks
So you learn that if you put your bricks
Like too high
And if your room has a bed and a light
That'll become a bedroom
And that will get your town points
Because you have a bedroom
And so basically you start to learn that if you
Craft such and such things
You'll increase the points of your town
Or you have to craft food to keep yourself alive
You craft weapons and shields to fight the enemies
Or you craft bigger and better things
For your town basically
And then the townspeople will start
Making requests
It'll be like hey we need to have a forge
So we can make more stuff or whatever
So you make this
But then some of the requests
It's not always about buildings
Sometimes the request is
You need to go into this pyramid
That's way out there through the teleporter
And you need to go into this pyramid
And you need to steal the two idols that are in the pyramid
This is a quest that I just did
For one to dislodge the idols
You have to have the highest weapon
So you build the weapon
Then you go to the pyramids
And you find your way through the pyramids
Where the walls are not destructible
And then you find the idols
And you tear them down with a hammer
But then when you do that all the people that are praying to the idols
Turn into the magician dudes from Dragon Quest
So you have to run the fuck out of there
So it's not only building quests
It's the typical type of fetch quest
You would see in RPGs and things like that
It's like all that mixed together
And I think that's kind of why I enjoy it
It's a little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of
Zelda and a little bit of Dragon Quest
Kind of like all together
But I can say all that and how much I like this
But I think there's some people out there that won't be able to
They were not going to be able to stand it
They're going to play this for five minutes and go
This is dumb
But there's a demo out there
And unlike some other games
Like World of Final Fantasy and Inokuni
I think the demo for Dragon Quest Builders
Is really good
The demo for Dragon Quest Builders is like the first
Five quests of the game
All strung together
You get to play it up to the point you get your first teleportal
And then when you try to go through the teleportal
It says, sorry but this area is closed
In the demo, hope you enjoyed playing
And you can't progress any further in the story
Because you can't go through the portal
So it's a decent demo
So if you think this might be up your alley
Just download the demo
I think this is a safe one to judge the game off of
So there you go
Let's see, going to the chat
Over at live.vognetwork.com
Let's see
Dungeon Buster says
I really like the Japanese demo for Dragon Quest Builders
Just need to pick it up at one point
There you go
Some folks in the chat room talking about King of Fighters
I guess talking about King of Fighters 2014
Rageinator says, there's a King of Fighters 14
I thought the 13 was the newest one
And Dark Tetsuya says, no 14 came out a little while ago
So yeah
Vidpower says
King of Fighters 98 was the centerpiece of our arcade
It was the game everyone gathered around
Good times
You know, I guess I'm more of a classic person
Because my favorite to this day is still
Fatal Fury Special
Which is on Xbox 360
And I don't know if it's on the backwards compatibility yet
I don't remember
But that was the last time I remember that game was playable
I hope they bump that one up
For the Playstation 4 archives
And so forth
I just like the classic one a little bit more
I think too
Anyway
Alright that's it for our gaming week
So we're going to get into some news
But quickly I just want to mention some housekeeping
We will not be here live on Sunday November 13th
There will be a show that week
There should be a taped show
It looks like we're going to tape
Hopefully if it works with Loki schedule on Wednesday of that week
And we'll have something new
At 6 o'clock on Sunday
But we will not actually be here live
To interact with
Just so you know I'm going to Chicago
So I won't be here
But otherwise we'll be here next week
And then on November 20th
Episode 666 of our show
Which I don't think we're doing anything particularly special for it
It's just everybody keeps making this big thing about
Oh my god you guys are going to get to episode 666
And to be fair
A lot of shows don't get to episode 666
Some do
If you're more than once a week
Like Critical Myth
They're on 700 something
But they do three shows a week
So they can get the numbers faster
I don't know if there's a lot of weekly shows out there
That have hit episode 666
So I think we're heading into uncharted territory
A little bit
So we're going to have to set the tone
For how shows celebrate episode 666
I'm not sure
That sounds too ego-y though
I don't want to say that either
I don't know what's going to work best for us in our audience
So be here
I want Travis to come on
Do DJ Satan
I want the Satan voice that I enjoy
But my understanding is that he already said no
So whatever
He wants to retire or whatever it is
Alright let's get into some gaming news for now
Loki
So it's just been a couple weeks
Since we heard some news about the Switch
And now we've already got more news
On when we're going to hear more news on the Switch
So the Nintendo Switch presentation
2017
Is going to be held on January 12
It'll be streamed online
And with that they're going to announce
The console's price, the release date
And the lineup of games in development
So
I don't expect to hear much until then
But that's kind of cool that we
Have a date
That they're not just keeping us hanging
Along with that there is
Comments regarding the 3DS
Because people are thinking
Hey the Switch is coming out
It's a portable system, it's a console
What's going to happen with the 3DS
Is this going to be a successor to the 3DS
Well apparently the 3DS
Is not going to be replaced by the Switch
Instead they're going to coexist
With each other so
And I call bullshit
Now
Now I will
Take this back
If in the presentation that we're getting on January 12
They mention that the Switch and the 3DS
Can like talk to each other or something
Or maybe there's some type of environment
Created between the two systems
Where it would be helpful to own both
But otherwise I'm sorry
I don't buy this line
I think this is to not cannibalize
3DS sales but ultimately
This isn't really Nintendo's
Decision because if all the
Third parties stop making games
For 3DS and go over to Switch
Then guess what the 3DS is not going to be
Recorded anymore you might have indies which is cool
And some of that but I think even in the
In the indies if it's as easy to make
A game for the Switch as it is 3DS
I think a lot of indies are going to be looking over there
It's also going to depend on a lot of factors like
Battery life and stuff because if the battery life on the Switch
Is abysmal then you know
True how portable is it
But I just I kind of
Like sorry I know a lot of
People have been throwing this at me when I say
That well so much you know this is the 3DS
Is a successor and I view this as a 3DS
Or I've been sent a link to this quote
I don't know how many times and I'm like
Okay but they do this
Companies do this like
When they came out with a Playstation Vita
I'm sure they said something about well the PSP is not really
Going away or is still going to support the PSP
Like of course companies do that
Because they don't want to cannibalize
Sales of the existing system
Yeah it will replace it
But hey
You can buy the 3DS for a few months
But if for whatever
If for whatever reason Nintendo remains
Super committed to 3DS and I'm wrong
Then I'm wrong that's fine
But I would have a hard time believing
There's going to be the major tent pole releases
To substantiate that
And that's not being made
For the Switch
You know what I mean
They could do that it would make much sense
But they could do that
We'll see I guess
Thank you Raman Chat says Microsoft said the same thing
About the 360 look what happened
MXC said they said it before with how
The DS was not going to take over Game Boy Advance
Oh I remember that
So I'm sorry but this is
This is a line you hear all the time
I mean Nintendo could also do the Smash 4
Treatment where they release it on 3DS and
On their console like
You know with the Switch
Or you know what else would be really awesome
Is that what if like the 3DS
Can serve as like an
Extra controller when the Switch is on
The dock or something
Maybe there is still something they could do
To add the 3DS into that environment
But otherwise I just don't believe that
There's a place for the 3DS when the Switch comes out
You're wrong I'm back
Oh please tell please let me know how I'm wrong
Because with the example with the
Game Boy Advance and the DS
The DS played Game Boy Advance
Games the Switch does not play
Anything as far as
Nintendo's confirmed except Switch games
So all your 3DS
Games they're not coming over to that
You can't play them on that so there's still a
Part for the 3DS
But the developers are going to
Abandon it to make games for the Switch
Will they? Because I think they will
Because this is still going to be a more expensive
Platform the 3DS and the
2DS and the new 3DS
Those are all still more
I don't want to say aimed at kids but they're more affordable
And so parents can replace these
Systems easier for kids
Versus a Switch I think
I don't think anything is replacing anything until
We see how that thing sells in the first place
Yeah I'll give you this
This whole thing could be to leave
The door open a crack for the 3DS
In case the Switch
Flops which
I don't know based on just the buzz
It looks good but
The buzz for the Switch is already better than it was for the Wii U
But I feel like maybe this is to leave the door
Open in a jar for the 3DS so that way
If the Switch does flop Nintendo can
Still kind of fall back on it
Yes it's a portable, yes it's a console
We need to know what the battery life is on that
So it has to at least match the 3DS
I feel like if it's even
Like if it has any potential
To push the 3DS out
So also there's a frog
Outside I almost hit it with a car
It's adorable
Don't hit it with a car then
Then I was going to go catch it I was like no because I'm about to eat
It's not a Pokemon
But it's still adorable like a Pokemon
Alright
So what about the fact that we get no new Switch
Information until 2017
Expected in my opinion, totally expected
Yeah
I like that they set the date
Yeah I feel even with this presentation
That they had
It was more of like people keep bothering
You know
I don't know it's just like
I apologize if you said it and I missed it
But is this a presentation
Like a Nintendo Direct type of thing
Yeah it's going to be a live stream
So could that mean that it's an E3
Style presentation which we haven't seen
Like a live
Live demo that's what I assume
Yeah because that would be a very interesting
Shift for Nintendo
To go back to the big E3
Style conference which you're allowed to do
Outside of E3 Sony does their
Expo they do game developers
Conference Microsoft did their own event
For the Xbox One
We all remember the famous unveiling of the Xbox
One and how well that went
So there's no reason why Nintendo can't do
Their own live event I'd just be very curious
Because we haven't seen Nintendo live in a while
So it would be very interesting if they did that
We saw them at E3
But they didn't know they didn't Nintendo Direct
They didn't do an E3 press conference
They didn't do a press conference but they did
All sorts of live things for E3
They did Treehouse you're right
Pokemon and all that good stuff
I guess
I don't associate the Treehouse stuff
With the executives
But that's a fair point
I don't think it's gonna be like
Here's Reggie and Miyamoto playing
Mario Do you think it's gonna be like an all day
Twitch event like all day on January 12th
No it'll be some hours
But maybe two hours at the most
Interesting
Let's see going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Dark Tetsuya says yeah maybe
This is Nintendo's answer to those other events
The companies are doing
I just think they have to have the information
Out there because I would expect
It already out by now
Nintendo could easier than anyone
Hold their own
Expo
Convention
Nintendo could easier than anyone do it
Oh yeah I would go to a Nintendo experience
So many people would go
Even though Sony experiences in San Francisco I didn't go
I would go to Nintendo's
It was really good
I'm very tempted to go to the one in Anaheim
One of my friends is really trying to talk me into going
I'm like I am convention out
I've got to so many conventions
But I would go to the Nintendo one in a heartbeat
I think the Nintendo one
Would be a ticket mess
And maybe that's why Nintendo doesn't want to get involved
Because I think it would be
It would be faster than
PAX selling out tickets
I feel like Nintendo gets a lot of really strong
Focused brand loyalty in ways that Sony
And Microsoft don't get
Oh you better believe it for sure
Loki you were going to say something before I get to another chat comment
Oh no I was just thinking
What would the new
PlayStation event have
What would they be showing up
I guess Horizon Zero Dawn
It's probably going to be some of the titles from early next year
But they do announce a lot of stuff
At the PlayStation thing
We got the Final Fantasy 7 remake
We got the actual gameplay footage
Finally for that
There was Dumne no Kuni 2 that nobody cares about
There was Rez
I want to say
Was that zombie game there that nobody asked for?
Street Fighter 5 came out of
The PlayStation expo
No
Street Fighter 5 was announced
I thought that was just the characters
No it was a huge deal when they announced it
Wait the last one or the one before that?
I'm only talking last year
I don't know what happened the year before
They announced the exclusiveness on Sony
And it was a huge deal
No man's sky
Well it looked better than it was
Anyway
Let's see
It could be the Nintendo Powerfest
I love it
I missed the Powerfest
It was so good
Let's see
Akuma JP in chat says
Here's a thought, we make games for new systems all the time
But we're not making a Switch game
And you know
I think that's
An interesting division
That I think it's very obvious
To everybody out there that the Switch
Is not going to be something you can just port
A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game over to
I thought that was the whole rumor
That it was so easy that's what's going to make it
Do better
Why wouldn't you be able to?
Because the hardware is not going to be up to speed with PlayStation 4
Yeah but from what I understand
It's just a little less powerful
From the rumors and these rumors that are saying
This are the rumors that have gotten everything else
Right about it so far
We'll have a see
That would be great
If it can compete on that level
Yeah we'll have to take a wait and see approach
Alright
Let's get to some more news
Also about the Switch
And you know what's very important for this
Is third parties and people being interested in developing
For Switch
Well one of the people who has expressed interest
In making games for the Switch
Is Hajime Tabata
And if you don't know that name
Well you probably know the game he's directing
Final Fantasy XV
So he's interested in making games for the Switch
Not necessarily Final Fantasy XV
But the quote is
I'm very interested in this machine
As a player but also as a developer
The Nintendo Switch that you can transform
Into a controller that you can put into a dock
That you can move around with
On which you can replace elements
It's been a while that I've told myself I would like to make games
On a Nintendo machine
So if the Nintendo Switch could be that opportunity
I'd be delighted
That was an interview with Game Blog
Where Hajime Tabata said that
There's definitely, it's catching the attention of people in the industry
And we've kind of heard that too
In some of the rumors
Like the rumors were saying
That there was a lot of interest out there
Because people really liked the concept of
That you could pick it up and go
And it sounds like this whole fact that it transforms
It's like a Transformers machine
With the fact that the controllers pop off
And they can be used one way
You're not limited to necessarily one configuration
I just hope it works in execution
Like it sounds
Oh they pop off, poof!
Alright now here's one other
Big big rumor about the Switch
This will be the last thing we'll talk about
Again this is rumor but
If I were to bring out the wheel of plausibility again this week
I'm sure it would rank very highly
Anyhow this is a tweet from a technology
Reporter for the Wall Street Journal
It's Takashi Mochizuki
And is mentioning in this tweet
Looks like standard capacity
Of Switch game card at least when
Console launched
It was around 16 as in gigabytes
Enough for one layer
Blu-ray game so it looks like
The Switch game cards are 16
Gigabyte cartridges however
We don't necessarily know if that means
It's limited to 16 and can't grow
Later because even the original
NES was
Limited to what 32
Kilobytes maybe I could be totally
Wrong on that but that was expanded
By the time
And that's also why cartridges got more and more expensive
But that was expanded by
The end of its run so
I don't see why maybe you have a 16
Gig cartridge as the original
Configuration but that's gonna grow
To 32
Maybe even 128 if the technology
Gets there
But I notice a lot of people on blogs and so forth
Are very negative on this 16
Gigabyte number because it's less than
A 25 gigabyte
Blu-ray but my
Question is how
Like you guys do a lot of
Digital game downloads right
How many games out there are more
Than 16 gigs to download
I can't think of a lot
Maybe the major games are bigger than that
Dragon Age was bigger? No
Like a lot of the major games are bigger than that
They're like 30, 40 gigs
But those are like major
Major games
I don't know it depends on what that
Thing outputs at
I imagine the texture sizes
I think will probably reduce it quite a bit
Compression maybe
Wasn't 16 gigs
Like the entire capacity of the basic
Wii U
So if this is bigger
Than that that's good news I think
Well like you know
Compression I'm sure has placed some of it
Because I think a lot of that stuff they had
Especially on disc I'm not sure about
Actually downloading it though but like a lot of it
Had to stay in compressed because the drive wasn't
As fast or maybe I'm thinking
3 but
I don't know
We'll see I mean
They're gonna make it work
It's not gonna be like ah shit you know
The game doesn't work too well
Or or
I mean they could pull a fucking Microsoft
And say oh okay well 16 gigs
Fits on this and we're gonna download the rest
I was gonna say it's not
Necessarily out of character to have
Some of it on the cartridge
But the rest of it will download
If the Switch has a large
Internal capacity
Still do 32 gigs please
Well I was gonna say if you downloaded all the high quality
Stuff for Xenoblade
On Wii U
That will fill up your entire drive
Like with all the high
Stuff but you know maybe the Switch
Can incorporate something like that I don't know
So anyway
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Dartitsia pointing out
The cards at the start are right in between
Dual layer DVDs
9.4 gigs and Blu-rays
25 gigs respectively
And I'm sure there's a possibility the cards could get bigger
Down the line yeah if they go to 32
Gigs which would be the assuming that any
Of this information is even accurate in the first
Place that is very true
Sj100Matt says as long as it's not
Proprietary memory cards people
Will just buy larger SD cards
They're so cheap now
We can hope you know the 3DS
Allowed you to use a non-proprietary
Card so there's hope
The Wii let you use a non-proprietary SD card
I have a 256 gig one or whatever it is
I don't remember but it's huge
The Wii kind of struggles to load all of the
Space because it has to like count all the
Blocks right but it works
Yeah the Wii U
Will allow you to connect an external
Hard drive if I'm not correct or if I'm not mistaken
Yeah because their internal storage is
Yeah stupid but I mean but the
Good news is you know when we're talking
About what's plausible and what's not
You kind of look at the track record right
So Nintendo has a pretty good track record of not being
Not constricting memory
To its ecosystem so that's
That's hopeful that
We'll be able to do that with the Switch
That's kind of standard nowadays anyways
I mean it feels like Nintendo has often had expansions to its consoles
Like the N64 had the expansion pack
You know there's always been little
Add-ons that they add on later in the
Console's life
Rama says the Switch will use
Proprietary cards for the games
But standard micro SD if you ask me
And I would agree with that I don't think
They would want just anybody making
Game cartridges they don't want
People to circumvent that so
No I'm sure it will be circumvented
Don't you worry
Well I mean it's so early
To know but Loki
Have you seen anything out there about people
That are like planning to hack the
Switch Oh no I haven't seen anything
But it's gonna happen It always happens
It'll have to happen Yeah that's
A given it will happen
It just you know how easy is it gonna be
Is the question Yeah interesting
Alright let's move on
With another story Loki
Alright so this week
Hello Games actually finally tweeted
Something out and their tweet
Was No Man's Sky was a mistake
And everyone's like
Whaaaat
And it actually ended up being that
Apparently their Twitter account was hacked
And someone posted
That on there and yeah
It was some type of back door through LinkedIn
Is what they blamed too Yeah they're all
100% not hacked anymore obviously
Those mails and tweets were fake
Back to work and then you know they were saying
That umm
Which you know
Sorry real quick by the way
There's a little bit of tangent but it's not
Okay so Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
Is where you guys can call us later on the show right
I don't know if you guys have noticed this
I've been getting inundated with Skype spam
Lately and because the Orange Lounge Radio account
We've collected you know
Hundreds of listeners over the years that have called
Into the show
We will get like I just had to clean up
Like 8 spam messages
As we launch for the show tonight
Do you know what they all were?
They were links to LinkedIn
That said LinkedIn and it had some weird code
After it and it wasn't a phish
LinkedIn site it was definitely LinkedIn.com
But I think it was some type of back door
Injection or something I don't know
The reason why I bring that up
If they were hacked through LinkedIn
I wonder if it wasn't part of this whole Skype thing
Or something that's going on
LinkedIn got hacked a while ago
Server hacked
We were binging Mr. Robot episodes as quickly as we can
Looking for answers
They were saying if anything was a mistake
It was using LinkedIn without two factor authentication
Nothing ever comes from LinkedIn
That's not true
I'm going to stick up for LinkedIn
My current job
I got through LinkedIn
So it does work
So it's kind of like I'm sorry
I have to jump to LinkedIn's defense
I realize why a lot of people pick on them
But it actually fucking works
In some circumstances
I got to give props for props to do
But it is nice to hear
From Sean Murray
Unfortunately it's not anything that has to do with No Man's Sky
So that is still in the dark
So Sean Murray finally tweeted
But the tweets were about the hack
And nothing else
But at least it's one of those
I'm glad to see you're alive
I don't mean to sound so
Someone's alive
I'm glad to see he's alive
Because I was starting to get worried
Well it's like when Pokemon Go was radio silent
When they were having all their issues at launch
It's nice to see something
Yeah but even Pokemon Go finally figured that out
After a week or two
The radio silence from Hello Games has been
Deafening on this
Because
Isn't there talk about
A possible bundle pack that's going to have No Man's Sky
By the end of the year
They've still made a lot of promises for what they're going to do
They've got
It's not just that game
They've got a few different three-game pack
PlayStation 4s that are coming out
So they have one that was
No Man's Sky, Uncharted 4
And
Something else
There was another one
Uncharted 4 and two other games
It's a Sony game
Of course they're going to do some of those bundles
I don't condone the hacking
And it's not appropriate
Or any of that stuff
With this radio silence
I don't want to say they were asking for it
But they were definitely
The longer this goes on
And they're not saying anything
The fan base
Is doing this type of shit
Well it's kind of hard
Especially now after how much
That was hyped up by Sony too
It's like
Who are we going to trust anymore
When it comes to these big
Games that look so amazing and stuff
What I'm saying is if they need to
They need to just rip the band-aid off
If they need to make the tweet that says
We've ended all development on No Man's Sky
And we're moving on to our next project
As much as that's going to piss people
To fuck off
Drop it on a Friday at 5pm
But as much as it's going to piss people off
You just need to get over with
Drop it on election day
Yeah but there are British companies
That doesn't mean that they're not affected
That's true
That's actually kind of a brilliant idea
If you're going to drop bad news do it on election day
Or if there's any number of political events they could bury it under
That's the best way to make it go away
That's true, that's a good thought
Yeah, and Sjoan Undermat says
You can be pissed at a developer not providing updates
But to a point, right
And I'm not saying, again, I'm not condoning what happened
Or what have you
I'm not going to go hack his email, what the hell is that going to do
But I've been on the internet long enough to know
That's what's going to happen
Not having communication is the worst thing you can do
For yourself for damage control
Yeah, anyway
But you know
I want to see the best for everybody
Involved in that situation
You know, I enjoyed No Man's Sky for what it is
Because I didn't buy into the fucking hype
In the beginning
So, you know
Although you all were so mad at me in the beginning
When I was like, remember when they would show
The No Man's Sky stuff at E3 and I'd be like
Okay, so where's the fucking game
Right, and people were like
And I'm like, guess what
That attitude's paying off now
It's not even that, it's just the game wasn't very good
I mean, just the whole inventory management stuff
Is retarded
So that was the whole game
And a lot of it was thrown in there just to
Stretch the amount of time it would take to play the game
And it's just
Stretching out nothing is what it was
There was no game there
Yeah, but there's no game in Minecraft
But add VR support and I'll be all over that shit again
Alright, well
Speaking of VR
Microsoft, I didn't want to get too far into this
But Microsoft had a big event where they unveiled a surface
That made a lot of people very excited
To see that
They're also talking about a push
Into virtual and augmented reality
There's going to be a new line
Of virtual reality headsets
And they're working with a host of partners for these headsets
I should note though, this is not for the
Xbox One, but this is for Windows 10
Some of the partners for the headsets
HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer
Starting at $299
So this was again a Microsoft VR headset
But you better believe though
Ideally what they're saying is
Running on mid-end machines
Just regular laptops and stuff
I'm down with that
Then if it runs on that, it should run on
Xbox One I would think
Now I also do want to point out it's a wired device
And the tracking is handled by
Sensors on the headset itself
It's a little different from
The camera sensors
So it does something a little bit different
I think that's similar to the HoloLens
Yes, most definitely
Similar to that
And this should also be noted
That speaking of HoloLens, just because
This whole thing is happening, that doesn't mean HoloLens
Is stopping development or anything
Like that, but there is a difference
Between AR and VR, so work
Continues on the HoloLens
Which, as you might remember on a previous
Episode, I got to check out one of those dev kits
And I thought
HoloLens was pretty awesome
Did you watch the presentation for
What Microsoft did? No, but to be fair
I didn't watch Apple's thing this week either
I didn't watch Apple's thing I didn't watch any of it
It was funny though, after they showed off
The nice thing and Apple was like
Oh, we got a touch bar
And everyone was like, eh, fuck that shit
To be fair
It's a neat idea
But I got burned the last time I bought an Apple laptop
So I'm not doing it again
The virtual reality window thing that they were showing
Was kind of cool, I thought it would be pretty neat
I definitely still want to get a HoloLens someday
When the tech is actually what it's showing
Once we're there
Then yeah, I'll be all over that
I think the virtual reality stuff is pretty cool
In that they're kind of embracing that
And also the other thing
That they showed was the app that they had
That you can 3D scan stuff with your phone
Which I thought was pretty cool
Of course they said a Windows phone
I'm like, no, I'm not buying a Windows phone for that
But eventually all phones
So it's exciting
That they're getting into that
And I think with Microsoft backing virtual reality now
Too, I mean
With Windows and everything
It's probably going to be
Just getting better
It's not going to be a fad, I think
Alright, moving on
Loki, a follow up to some news from last week, right?
Yes, so apparently
Several of the video game companies
Have been affected by this
Voice actor strike
They have issued a statement
And
Basically
I'm not going to read all of this here
Let's see if we can just cover it a little bit
This is a strike that did not have to happen
SAG-AFTRA never communicated
To its members
What was on the table
When on October 19th
It declined to counter
The company's last proposal
And pushed away from negotiations
So obviously, I mean
I'm guessing the stance by this
Since I haven't read everything
They're kind of defending themselves
And obviously saying, well
Come put blame on SAG-AFTRA
Maybe if they stayed in negotiations a little longer
They might be something that they would have
You know, been able to resolve on that
Let's see
And I guess the offer of a 9% increase
And additional compensations
Are meant for bonuses
For quick resolution
To negotiations expires on
December 1st
So that's like, it's the last offer that they have
This is not good though
That this is still going
The fact that this wasn't resolved in days
Now we have to wonder if this is
Going to be something that's going to take months to resolve
How long did that writer's strike go on
A few years ago? It was a while
It was months
And so now I worry because this is going to affect
Video games
Now will possibly
Games go to non-union
I kind of think
The rise of a silent protagonist
Yeah, either the rise of the silent protagonist
Is going to start happening
With non-union voice actors
I think there's plenty of people
That will do it
But it's not going to have that same star power
And I'm not saying that I support that
I'm just looking at the reality of it
I think for these games to stay on target
They're just going to go, okay fine
Get a non-union voice actor
Do an internet contest
To find somebody to be the voice of somebody
Like, they'll find it
Yeah
But, you know
I understand the voice actor's perspective
And some of the things they're asking for
Make an awful lot of sense
Especially when we talk about the vocal strain
Knowing what the projects are
Having more information on that
A little less secrecy for them
And a lot of that makes sense to me
I hope they can work it out
Because the longer this goes on, nobody wins
Nobody wins
Anyhow, we'll see
Going to chat over at
Live.vognetwork.com
Let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says
Great, the alternative might be Chaos Wars
Level of voice acting
Yeah, that could
Mean the voice acting quality is going to dip
A bit too
S2100Matt says, the Rider Strike ruined Heroes
In my opinion
Oh yeah, not just that show, but several shows
The Rider Strike just killed those shows
It helped some things though
Yeah, we did get Doctor Horrible out of the Rider Strike
So it wasn't all bad
We also got a really good season of Power Rangers
It was the worst season they ever did a Big Brother
Yes, how can you tell?
It was the winter season of Big Brother
It was awful, if you follow that series
It was the worst season they ever did
But that doesn't make any sense, it's supposed to be non-scripted
How would a Rider Strike affect a non-scripted show?
Right, but yet
Not to get too far into reality TV
Here's the crazy part
So they're doing a bonus Big Brother right now
That's only on the online
And it's like the best cast one they've had in years
Well it's because they're not using
The same casting agency for it
So yeah, this is the best season of Big Brother
It's the one that's not even on TV
People who don't follow it
Probably don't even know about
But it's the best season they've had in years
All I know about Big Brother is that
Davon GIF that everyone shows
The one that's always on Twitter
Hi!
She knows how to make an entrance
She was a great player, but
She was not a great player at all
She was an entertaining player
That's what you really need for reality TV
Best diary rooms of anybody
Not once in a competition
Kaijuto in chat says
Big Brother over the top is the shit
I'm not gonna lie
It is the best season of Big Brother since probably 11
Don't forget to vote for Chrissy
As America's nominee tonight
And
Shane obviously has his feelings
About what's going on there
Kaijuto says
I have the feeds on right now
You never know, they might break out in a fight
Moving on
Let's talk about Kingdom Hearts
Because
If you missed Kingdom Hearts
It pays to wait
Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD
And 2.5 Remix
If you did not pick those up on PlayStation 3
You have Kingdom Hearts 4 now
I did the math
You will have the ability to pick them up all over again
On PlayStation 4
It was announced this week
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5
Plus 2.5
Remix
Meaning there will be 6 games
Well 4 games and 2 movies
Involved in this
Will be coming out March 9th in Japan
March 28th in North America
So for those keeping track at home
That's Kingdom Hearts 1, 2
Chain of Memories
Birth by Sleep
And the movies for 3.58
And Recoded
Will not include the 2.8
Final Chapter Prologue
These fucking names
Will not include that
Because that is a separate PlayStation 4
Release
That's the one that has Dream Drop Distance
Which is a 3DS game
Just wait a bit longer
Wait a bit longer
Right before they finally bring out Kingdom Hearts 3
1.5, 2.5, 2.8
And 3
I actually preordered these
Because I don't really have a big desire to play Kingdom Hearts
But to have them all on one console
Is pretty tempting
And it was enough, I preordered them
I have the 1.5 remix on PlayStation 3 obviously
But when they announced 2.5
This was after Final Fantasy 10
Was on PS3 and PS4
And I was like, uh uh
I'm not getting those on PS3 because I know they're going to put them on PS4
Granted, I thought it would happen a little sooner
But I'm glad that it's finally happening
What, a year later, finally
Do they change a lot in the HD remakes?
Because I've been playing through the original PS2
And off and on
Well, keep in mind, right off the bat
The fact that they're widescreen natively
Is a huge change
These are a little bit HD-er
Yeah, they're more HD-er
But they still play the original games
You know, and so forth
It's interesting because you mentioned that you still use
A CRT TV
You have a CRT TV
Right, exactly
So since all my music games
A couple are on the Wii
And we won't talk about San Bodeo Amigo right now
But I have a PS2
And I tried
When I first moved into my place
And I tried doing it with an HDTV
And it just was unplayable
You know, it's 10 or 15 millisecond lag
Which doesn't sound like a lot
But when your timing window is less than 10 milliseconds
Then that's a big problem
Oh, and Akdeft in chat brings up a very good point
These games are final mixes
Which are better and improved versions of the original
So it's kind of like, you know how Final Fantasy 10
Was like the international version
And now 12 is going to be the Zodiac one
And 12 is going to be the Zodiac one
Which I'm really excited about that
More than Final Fantasy
It's really complex because you can't just make your character
Wait, how did you play some of it?
Possibly on an emulator on a computer
I played a good chunk of the PS2 version
It's really good
Oh, the PS2 version
Yeah, because it came out in Japan as the international
I was like, wait, you played the remaster?
What the fuck did you do that?
Basically because I upped all the textures
It looked really good
That's different
So that is the other big difference
That you're playing the last international version
Or whatever
And Akdeft points out that on PlayStation 4
It's all going to be in HD and 60 frames a second
So if your non-CRT TV is like mine
That has the super good refresh rate
Where movies don't look real
They just look crazy
It's one of those smart TV things
Where the frame rate is so good
It's not like it doesn't
TV looks different now
When you have that fast refresh rate
It just doesn't look real
Or it looks too real
The realness
Shut up
Moving on with our next story
We're almost to the Classic Game of the Week
But first, Loki
Skyrim Special Edition
Was just released on Friday
And already
There's Bethesda bug issues
With the game
What a shock
I'm going to die from that surprise
So apparently there are some issues
With the audio
And this is only affecting right now
The PC and Xbox One versions
So it might not win for the PlayStation 4 guys
Although you don't have mod support
So give it a take
Apparently
It's that wonderful audio
Anyways
The special edition features
Dramatically compressed audio
Sounding more muddled
Than the game's original release
And that I guess is the issue
And
Apparently it says the vanilla game
Sound assets
Other than the music and voiceover
Is in an uncompressed wave format
The special edition has the sound assets
In a very aggressively compressed
XWM format
Which is compressed sound format
Designed for games
This isn't so bad
Necessarily it's possible
To compress the audio to
XWM without significant
Quality degradation
Unless you crank the compression
Way up to insane levels
What did Bethesda do?
They cranked the compression up to
Insane levels
So it sounds like
They just need to patch it
That's probably going to be a pretty sizable patch
They're going to have to download the audio
All over again
Boy oh boy
My audio will still be good on the PlayStation 4 version
Too bad I don't got any fucking
Good mod support for it
I still haven't bought the game yet
Well Alan got it for free
Technically I have a PC I already have it
Because I bought Skyrim a long time ago
Well wait a minute I bought Skyrim on the PC
But I didn't get this new one for free
It is free
No because I don't have all the DLC
I only have the base game
I looked at it on the store
It still wanted 40 bucks
You think I have all the DLC on
I'm pretty sure I have all the DLC
I never bought any of the DLC
Because I didn't play enough Skyrim
Alan on the other hand played it all
Seems like a special edition on Skyrim
For PCs kind of stupid
Since there's enough mods out there
Anyways it would probably make it look even better
Than the special edition
There's way too much bloom in that
Like the god rays
I mean yellow tint all over the screen
I'm hoping to check it out at some point
But I've got a million games
I'm trying to play right now
But I did see that they have
The Macho Man Randy Savage mod
Thank god
Dragon mods all ready for Xbox
That's fantastic
Unfortunately I read some modder comments
They're like yeah we're not supporting the Playstation 4
With our mods because
Of this limitation
That's gonna suck
Alright well let's take a trip down memory lane
Back when you couldn't mod games
Like this
It's a classic game
Of the week and unfortunately
You guys I'm sorry to say that Radio Magic
Is broken for the second week in a row
With the teleporter
Devices that allow radio magic
Oh right we get to do Halo again
Yes we're doing Halo again
As I said last time Loki suggested we do Halo
And Jamie's not here
I'm just letting you know chat
I am your advocate here
Alright well I thought
The nice thing to do since
We were unable to make Radio Magic happen this week
I thought the nice thing to do was to
Let our guest pick the classic
Game of the week and I thought
This is a very creative pick from JD
As well so we're gonna let JD pick tonight
The classic game of the week and I kinda think
Dark Sakura would approve of this
Pick but there is no music with
This pick right? Correct
And why is there no music?
Because this is a game about stick figures
Alright what is the classic game of the week?
So this is Kingdom of Loathing
This came out in 2003 and it is a browser
Based with lots of frames
It's a multiplayer online game
So it's an MMO
But it's turn based
So you have a bunch of adventures everyday
In which you can go out and do stuff
In the world
It was like a BBS game on the way
It really was
Black and white aesthetic to it
It's very lightweight
So the basic story is
You're trying to
The nasty sorceress is the
Big boss at the end of the game and you're trying to
Gain levels so that you can fight her
But the bulk of the game you spend
Just doing all of the side quests
And there's so much
There's a lot of pop culture references
And puns all over the place
Which is why it's one of my favorite games
Like I got
Lost just reading the wiki about all of the various
Items in the game
You have 40 adventures
Everyday
Because there's a daily reset at a certain time of day
And you go out and
Just do side quests and main quests
You can get more adventures by eating food
And having alcohol like just in real life
Hooray! And if you have too much alcohol
You get drunk and you have bad adventures
Or you hurt yourself
Less hooray! Right
There are three
There are six different classes that you can be
And there are
Three stats
There's five elements
So like a lot of other games
It has elemental rock, paper, scissors
But they're not the same elements you may be used to
There's hot and cold
But then there's spooky stench and sleaze
And they all fit together in different ways
Kind of like a Pokemon
This is good against that and not against that
It's a constantly
Evolving game
They have content every couple of months
And they're really good
About having in-universe explanations
When stuff goes wrong
Pretty early in the game's life cycle
There was a lot of hacking going on
And the currency in the game is meat
Which is, you know, slang for money
But it's also
They really go full hog with that
They have meat paste and meat smithing
Anyway, so
I played a little bit of Kingdom of Loathing
And I remember all these very sassy jokes
There's a lot at Konami
He's working hard, huh?
I was a disco bandit
Yeah, that's one of the classes
It looks interesting
I've never seen this game before
But it's still going, right?
Even though it qualifies as a classic game of the week
Because it's, what, 13 years old
It's still going
Because it's not a finished game either
It's in open beta
Because they never have a 1.0
Because it's continuously evolving
And they add on a couple of new levels
At the end
The final level used to be 11
And now it's 13
That happened a bunch of years ago
Yeah, but they continuously add on
New areas in the game
And it's all very solid
There's a great fan community around there
And lots of other stuff
There's a chat system
And in order to gain access to chat
You have to pass a test from the ghost
Of the English language
Because English is just so tortured
It's given up the ghost
And now you have to pass a small typing test
In order to get access
Wow, this really sounds like a game Dark Soccer would approve of
In fact, she's probably going to be pissed you took it
That's alright
I mean, there's a bunch of channels
There's a haiku channel
You get to leave after today, I know
The chat is all going
So what happens if the guest picks Halo
Could you get away with it?
And I'm like, I still don't want that phone call
I'll take that phone call
But I'm not taking the Halo call
I'm forwarding it to Shane's phone
That doesn't make sense
Alright, anyway
Yeah
There's a lot of
There's optional player versus player
But it's definitely not a big component of the game
It's definitely much more a cooperative aspect
Even though it's like
You're generally all by yourself
The fan communities and the forums and such
Are out there
The wiki is extensively documented
And there's
This is also a game in which people love to break on it
And see how things work
And in the game it's called spading
To figure out what exactly all the mechanics are
That underlie everything
And so every time there's a new content release
People try to figure it out
And there's a lot of
Specific details on that
The other thing about this game
Is they also have a radio channel that they do
Live 365 channel or something?
I don't think it's on Live 365
Oh no, nothing is
They shut down this year
But yeah, they've had
A radio show going for a while as well
Oh that's awesome
How do we get on that network?
Have your people call their people
I guess, do I gotta throw meat at them?
It's also a free game
Although there are paid things you can buy
So there are no ads anywhere
And that is always really nice
In a free content thing
That you never actually have to spend real money on
For a web game
And it's not pay to win
Like a lot of free to play games end up being
Alright
So this is something that people can play now
Yeah
I think it's .com
Alright
And Shane, maybe you should go check on your character
I wouldn't even remember my login
Well yeah, that's the other thing
If you don't log in
I think it's like two months or something
Your character will go away
As a resource saving thing
So you do have to play it pretty often
So it's not like Neopets
I think I had a Neopet back in 2004
Which would have been the last time I fed it
Oh it's probably dead
I don't think Neopets ever die
Well I remember I joked with you
When you told me you were going to pick this game
I was like, oh you should pick Neopets
They have another game called Word Realms
Oh interesting
So there is, if you do pay
There's an item called a Mr. Accessory
That if you leave it on your character for a day
It'll mark your character
Undeletable
So that is a thing you can do to keep it long term
But it means financially supporting the game
Oh that's smart
There's a lot of smart stuff in this game
Alright
There it is, your classic game of the week
Kingdom of Loathing
It's kind of like when Jamie picked World of Warcraft
But it's still going strong today
So check that out
Good pick
I like the fact that it's not your typical
Console type game
It's a web game
I don't think we've had anything like that
Cool pick
So there it is, your classic game of the week
Since we did not have Radio Magic though
We are going to take a quick in-studio break
So when we come back we're going to talk plenty more
We're going to get to what's in stores this week
Do some rapid fire news
Again we're short so
You should send us emails sometime
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
But we will get to your calls
At Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody
Orange Lounge Radio live in progress
Episode 663 for this
October the 30th of 2016
You know an appropriate game for Halloween
Castlevania I'm sure
You know with spooky ghosts and things like that
And before the show
Tigerclaw put a link in our chat room
And I hadn't seen this yet
But I guess somebody was taking on the project
To remake Castlevania in Unity
And we were watching a little bit of that in studio
And I was very impressed
Was it Unreal or was it Unity?
I thought it was Unity
It was one of those engines
That it was done on
Let me check one more time here
You know why I'm probably thinking that?
I think I saw a Zelda thing
That was done earlier this week that was in Unity
That's probably why my wires are crossing
And that one looked really good too
So it's tough to
Kind of look at this and realize that like
One guy did it and you're like
This is the type of reimagining I would like
To see of a Castlevania game
I mean granted it had some flaws
It wasn't perfect like you could see some little graphical bugs
And things but honestly
I guess you could just go on there and download it
And check it out and I'm like alright
Lords of Shadow was a good game that first one
I liked that reimagining it was pretty good
Yeah alright fair enough
But yeah I just
You liked what you saw Loki of that little
Castlevania remake? Yeah it looked cool
Same thing so alright I liked it
But then let's see
Oh Dungeon Buster says the guy also put it up
On Kickstarter which is not a smart move
That's definitely not a smart move
That'll draw attention
Konami will sue
That's not a good idea
They don't have a lot going for them
They're going to shut you down I wouldn't go to Kickstarter with that
Now if you want to do
A different game
That's like you know
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night
Oh wait you can't do that either
But you see where I'm going with this
You could do a different type of you know
Ghosty goblin-y
You know type of game
And it would be okay
So you might want to think about that my friend
Alright
Anyhow let's get into some rapid
Fire news and talk about quickly
A couple other things going on in gaming this week
Loki so if you like game soundtracks
And you happen to like those soundtracks in
Vinyl well there's some good news for you
Shovel Knight they're going to be bringing their soundtrack
Out to Vinyl and CD
Very soon
So it looks like it's going to be
It looks like a double LP
And you can get the CD version for $18
Vinyl is going to be selling for
$35
And yeah it looks
Pretty awesome so
I'm not sure when that's going to be available
Looks like the 2 dispersion is on Bandcamp
And then the double vinyl
Double LP is going to be on Big Wax
So soon
Also the last
Guardian
Golden going to be coming around the corner here pretty soon
Also getting it's soundtrack on
Vinyl as well also going to be a double
LP
And you can get that through
Iam8bit
And it's going to cost you $35
And I'll be coming
First quarter of 2017
And since we're on the topic of
Fan games
This one thankfully won't get shut down because of
You know Sega's wonderful
Stance hey fan games cool make them
So this is going to be one year
In fact you can probably do them better than we can at this point
Yeah exactly and honestly this looks
Kind of better than
No one can touch their Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account
Nobody will do better than that
Maybe Arby's they're like neck and neck sometimes
Arby's and Denny's you know
Denny's Denny's is really great
Go right now and look at Denny's
Sonic Utopia
It's a 3D Sonic
Game and it's
Supposed to combine all the elements of
You know the best elements of
Different Sonic games so basically
They wanted to expand the Sonic
Gameplay in an intuitive 3D way
And also
They said the capture best of the Sonic
Style and stuff the trailer
Looked pretty cool and actually looks like
A lot of fun the controls I mean
It seemed like it would control pretty well but hey
Don't let the trailer just
Be the judge you can actually check out this
Game and download it now so if you go check out
The trailer
You can also download the game
There's a link in the description
I haven't yet played it yet
But judging by the trailer it looked like
You know this would probably be a
Pretty good take on a 3D Sonic
Game so go check it out
Alright well
I'm going to bring up this story and I didn't realize
Shane would be here on tonight's show when I put
This in rapid fire news but I have a feeling
Shane's going to turn this into a long form story
Because this is about Pokemon Sun
and Moon and there was
There was a new trailer this week
For Pokemon Sun and Moon
Which well wait no it's not
All bad news oh no I know I know what happens
At the end alright so
Here's the deal is that the final
Evolutions for the starters were
Unveiled so you get to see the
Brand new final forms
Are you going to butcher their names I can't wait
Okay
This is the only one I'm not sure of Decidueye
Yeah that's good enough
That's how I would say it
That's Rowlet's final form and I like this
A grass ghost type
Yes for a couple different reasons
People are trying to basically say
Because the owl it's based off
Of from what people can tell is an
Extinct owl in Hawaii
Called the stilt owl
It's also well I'll let you finish the other
Well it also uses ghost moves
Like spirit shackles
Well that's because it's ghost
What else did you want to say?
Oh I was going to point out the connection between the
Secondary types in all three
Okay alright well then let me move on
To Nsign
No I
I went to purposely mess it up for change
Incineroar is the second one
This and of course I know that one because
Litten will be the character
And it's super cool oh my gosh
I like the WWF
Fire belt that it wears
I love its spinning lariat move it's so cool
Fire dark type
And then the worst thing in the
World
Primarina
That's better than what it is
Primarina and the diamonds
Primarina it's a real heartbreaker
It's not a robot Primarina is the
Water fairy type
Of course it's a fairy type
And it's a mermaid
Looking Pokemon and Shane
Is not a fan
It's also based on a siren
So now they also unveiled
Some other Pokemon but if you want to hear
On that you'll have to tune into the next episode
Whenever that is
But I will bring up Alolan Persian
Form because
Alolan Persian looks like
Garfield to me
And I can't get over it like how
Stupid it looks
All it did was eat some bees
So the other thing on the secondary types for the
Starters finals is that ghost dark
Fairy forms a
Trio kind of the same way that the
Fire water grass
Interesting observation
And those are
Like those are newer types too
At least dark and fairy
Dark is gen 2 and fairy is gen 5
Or gen 6
It's one of the later ones
And then
Also apparently
You will run into
Your old pals
Ghost isn't strong against fairy though
Right so it's not a complete trio
I guess we don't have to talk about
No we're just continuing the discussion
So red and blue
You will run into
As part of the game
But make sure you knock on their door
First before barging in
A lot of the stuff I've been seeing on
Twitter lately and loving
But yeah apparently they're all
Grown up now although they don't look that grown up
But also I want to point out
That blue is actually
I can show you some pictures where they look pretty grown up
Blue is actually wearing green
Capri shorts and green shoes
Probably because he's green in Japan
Yes I know that
I'm just beating you to it
I'm just questioning the choice of wardrobe here
That's all I'm saying
Why are you questioning against green shorts?
Because he looks like mom in that wardrobe
No he doesn't he just looks super gay
Because that's what he is
If you watch the trailer and he throws out his Pokemon
And then you see him standing behind it
Is the flammiest pose I've ever seen
Any character in Pokemon
Is flammier than a male Primarina
And like
Go for real
Load it up while I can continue talking about Pokemon
And then Red has a 96
On his shirt to you know
Harken back to the fact that they came out in Japan
Oh I just thought it was 69 upside down
That's all
You want me to show you pictures?
No no my god
The things you see
On Tumblr you can't unsee
You've been tweeting enough
Yeah I just retweet whenever I see
If it's like ugly
Well to be fair so have I
If you just go to Shane and Linko on Twitter
I was going to say man that Pokestop Podcast
Feed is going to be very interesting
Oh god I'm just going to
I'm just going to leave the room for 30 minutes
While Shane just reads
Tumblr porn about Red and Blue
Well it's not going to be hard to do
I think it's just images at this point mostly
Anyway there you go
You didn't even talk about
Other things that happen in the trailer
Because I'm making people wait for the next episode of the Pokestop Podcast
Hey also guys if you have the demo
There's a demo event today
So you better go do it before your timezone changes
Now
You can check this out if you're in Japan
Anyway because I don't think it's coming here
Kunio-kun
Nekketsu complete Famicom
Series is coming out December 8th in Japan
This is a 3DS game
That's coming out for 4,800 yen
Or you can download it for a little cheaper
4,444 yen
Arc System Works is putting this out
And it's going to come with some themes
And so forth but you might be wondering
Well what is this game?
Well this is a collection of every
Kunio-kun game that was released
For the Famicom
This means River City Ransom
Super Dodge Ball
Renegade
Crash and the Boys Street Challenge
And other games that never even came out over here
Featuring those same characters
It's a very unique art style of characters
And I'm sure a lot of you know River City Ransom
And Super Dodge Ball
So this is a collection of all those games
There is all to be said 11 games in the collection
So it looks like it's going to be a pretty
Kickass collection
Boy it's a bummer the 3DS isn't region free
Yeah thanks Nintendo
Just have a Japanese 3DS like what I'm playing right now
To be fair they may be switching that
With the Switch
Apparently the Switch is region free
If you believe rumors
I don't
I believe in disappointment
Alright let's travel around
And look at what's coming out in stores this week
So this week since we're getting
Into November it's going to be pretty busy
So we've got Earth's Dawn coming out
On PC, PlayStation 4 and
Xbox One
The wonderful indie game Owlboy is coming out on
PC definitely check that out because it looks fantastic
Root Letter
On PlayStation 4 and Vita
Seraph on PlayStation 4
Super Dungeon
Brothers on PC
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
And no I don't think this has
Anything to do with Xanadu the movie
But Xanadu Next is coming out
On PC
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare on
PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox
One, Football Man
Who's going to buy that?
Some people, it's space
Couple people, it's a niche title
Yeah
Football Manager 17
On PC, Mac and Linux
Mario Party Star Rush on
3DS
Moto Racer 4 on PC, Mac
And PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
And that's it
Alright so Call of Duty probably the
Big deal game of the week that a lot of people
Oh and I'm sorry I did miss
BlazBlue Central Fiction on
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4
How could you miss yet another BlazBlue release?
How could you?
I kind of want to check out Call of Duty
I like the campaigns, I'm weird like that
Remember, wasn't that that trailer
At E3 that everybody was kind of going
Oh what's this, this is like a space game
This looks like it would be cool, and then it's like
Call of Duty and everybody's like, oh they just fucking
bait and switch to us, that's fucking rude
Like
I think a lot of us kind of had that reaction
I don't know, I may hold off on it because I bought
Infinite Warfare, or not Infinite Warfare
Advanced Warfare
The last one before Black Ops 3 was
And like I bought it and I was like
Oh season pass, I'm gonna go gung-ho multiplayer
Have not played a thing on it
It's like a waste of money
Just throwing it up, throwing off that money
And just a quick FYI from the chatroom
Loki's Xanadu
Not a Olivia Newton-John movie
Dungeon Buster clarifying
Xanadu next is another of
Falcom's RPGs, that's the
studio behind the Ys series
Not to be confused with Ys
It's Ys, that's how you say it
So yeah, it's that
same type of game
RPG in that fashion
Based around the Xanadu movie
Yes, where it's starring a roller rink
And cartoon sequences
that make no damn sense and so forth
Alright, anyway
That is such a good movie though
Moving on, oh actually now see
Rageonator brings up, I remember
Fushanadu, or in fact
Xanadu is what a lot of people said
Pretty good game and I love the title
Screen theme, that was a great NES game
I love that game to this day
Great game, anyway
Let's travel to Japan, quick, everybody on the plane
Let's go, whee, alright
Coming out in Japan on
November the 2nd on the PlayStation 4
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2
And Atelier Firis
Fushigi Na Taibo no
Renken Jutsuji
In a regular premium box
Special collection box with a music
Combo set for
349 bucks
That's a lot of money
So yeah, that is all stuff to look forward to
This week in Japan on the PlayStation 4
I don't think
There's anything of note on the Wii U
I think things are very quiet over there
So look at the handhelds real quick
On the Nintendo 3DS
Actually there's nothing on the 3DS this week
They're getting pumped up for Sun and Moon
There's a new, yeah I was gonna say the new
3DS XL Sun and Moon edition
That's it, there's really nothing
It's kinda, kinda quiet on the 3DS
Well, at least you still have
releases on the Vita where that same
Atelier Firis game is
also being released on
the 3rd
And that seems to be the tent pole for the week
I'm not familiar with that series
But that must be, what is that called
over here? Do they have that series here?
Which one? Atelier
Yeah they have Atelier
I just never got into this series then
They have a ton of them
It was like about once a year
So yeah, that's a big release in Japan this week
It looks like at least the only one that's releasing over there
So that's pretty much it for Japanese releases
Alright, well
PC's not, or I'm sorry
Europe is not getting much
Including, well, Football Manager 2017 on PC
It doesn't list it but I'm pretty sure
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is also coming out
the same day there as well
That's it
Alright
Let's get back into some news
Because usually we would do the mailbag right now
But the mailbag's empty
That's the second week in a row
Is it because you guys miss Jamie?
I understand. Do you miss Jamie criticizing your emails?
If you want, I'll criticize your grammar
I'll do it
I'll make Shane read emails or something
He'll love that
He'll criticize your name
He'll criticize wherever you're emailing us from
Your opinion is probably garbage
So I'll criticize that too
It's a show where every gamer has a voice
And then Shane yells back at said voice
Anyway, participate
I don't deal with stupidity so if you're going to be stupid
Just watch out
We don't have stupid listeners, Shane
Well, do you want me to start?
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
And don't worry
Shane's going to be too lazy to show up to the show next week
Probably so
He will be too busy playing more Pokemon or something
Alright
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
Actually, you could send an email where you rant about Shane
I would love that
And then I'll come over
That would be hilarious
Especially because he moved
And now he's a little bit closer
Not too close, far enough away
What would happen is I'd read the email
This is John Doe
And I'm emailing him
Talking about how much I hate Shane
By the time I'd be done reading the email
Shane wouldn't even knock
He'd just barge through the door
And he'd just say, hold on a minute
I got something to say
I got something to say
Alright, let's get back into some news
Aw, strangers with candy
You know last night at Rocky Horror
I made a strangers with candy joke on TV
I said something about going back to high school
And I said, I was a user, a boozer, and a loser
And I counted
Two people in the audience laughed
See, you're just pointing out all the reasons
Why that is a stupid thing to go to
Shut up
You should have thrown in, I stole the TV
I know, I should have
Did you catch that joke?
Oh my god, it's only the best
Okay, is it still on Netflix and Hulu
No, it's not on Netflix
It might be on Hulu still
But it's long gone from Netflix
Okay, I'm telling you guys, strangers with candy
Which was a
Comedy central show in the late 90s
Late 90s, early 2000s
It stars Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert
Before he had the whole success
Of the Daily Show
And they're on this show
And it's about a 40 year old woman
That goes back to high school
After she was in jail, basically, for so long
It's so good
It's a parody of those self-help movies
From the 70s
I've seen the movie, it's on YouTube
That it's all based on
I was at my rock bottom
It's like one of those scared stiffs
It's still on Hulu
Is that the Hulu Plus or the Hulu Free?
There is no Hulu Free anymore
Get rid of it
But if you have Hulu, check out Strangers with Candy
Because it is Rob Roberts' favorite TV show ever made
There is a movie too
Yeah, I think the movie's not that great
The movie's not as good as the show
But it's a good cheat
It's a good cheat
Wasn't the movie the one where she stabbed somebody with a fork
Or something like that?
I think so, yeah
I do have to say, not having seen Strangers with Candy
Was that episode really confusing?
Oh yeah, because they did the trivia
That's right, no, none of that would have made sense
If you've never seen Strangers with Candy
So you owe it to yourself to watch this show
And you should watch the episode
The spelling episode
The spelling bean
And...
That's probably the best episode of the show they ever did
That was in the second season
I don't know, because there's also the one with the blind guy
And that one's really good too
What's the name of that episode?
Wait, is it that one?
No, it's the blank page
That's it
And then it's the fourth episode
In the first season
Who Wants Cake
That is great
And Stephen Colbert's character
In that show
Is the funniest thing in the world
So please do yourself a favor
And watch that show
There you go
Kaijuto says
It was just the echo of Rob's laugh
And the silence
Oh no, there were definitely people laughing
There were people laughing loudly
Just there weren't very many of them
So the people who got it really loved it
Yeah
And I'm not afraid to waste everybody's time
With a joke that only two people are gonna get
And really get
I mean, that's kind of the beauty of Rocky
A lot of things will just fly over your head if you don't get it
But it's funny for the people who are there for it
It is, it is
Alright, see what happens when you don't email us
We talk about Hulu
Alright, let's move on
With some more gaming news stories
So once again, this was something I didn't actually
Watch, I was busy watching
The Microsoft conference
And apparently there was an Apple conference
Going on at the same time, or near
The same time
Close enough
I just didn't care
But yeah, they were talking
A little bit about Apple TV
One thing I wanted to mention is
Hey, Minecraft is coming to Apple TV
Because Minecraft is coming to everything
Something that is kind of cool about it
You will be able to play your Minecraft worlds
With other users that are also on other Apple devices
Like iPads and iPhones
And
Yeah
And that's coming at some point
So you like Minecraft
Do you think this is a good idea for Apple TV?
Sure, I mean, it's always good to have
More things that it can do
I mean, I didn't get an Apple
I looked at
I talked someone out of getting an Apple TV
Because they were looking for streaming devices
For their home, and it's like, oh yeah
This doesn't have a remote on it
Your remote is an iPhone
It's like, no it's not, you get a remote
With Apple TVs, not that one
That I looked at, they should all come with them
They come with a really garbage one, but yeah
They should have a little silver one, yeah
But then again, this is a qualified
Walmart employee, so
Very possible that he did no shit
Just saying, no
Hey, yeah, you
Know that you need an
iPhone to control, and I was like
Fuck that shit
Yeah, no, the guy was an idiot, because they
Definitely come with remotes, I've seen it
I thought so, but he was very insistent
And I was like, well I'm not going to have you buy this
When you can just buy Roku for 40 bucks
So forget it
Alright, well I'm kind of surprised
That there isn't more gaming on Apple
TV, like I know there was like that harmonics
Game, and there's a few things here and there, but it's just like
You feel like
How long do you think it is going to be before they get into VR
Because I have a feeling that Apple will try to
Do something, you know
I'm really surprised they haven't, but sometimes
They show up to the party late, and they'll put their own
Little spin on it, they have to figure out how to market it
Like they market all the other stuff, you know what I mean
We're Apple, we're releasing something, go buy it
Yeah, we'll see
Anyway, well speaking of the Apple
Platform, one thing that people are very much
Looking forward to is Super Mario
Run, now obviously
This isn't restricted to just the Apple
Platform, although I think it's coming out there first
Before it comes out on the Android devices
Just like every game
Not always, Ingress was on Android
Before it was on iOS, of course
But only because it was developed by Google
It was developed by a spin-off Google team, yeah
Anyway, so apparently
Nintendo is really determined to make
This a huge game
This was in an interview with Bloomberg
Where Tatsume Kimishima
Who of course is the president
Of Nintendo right now, said
In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened
When we delivered Pokemon Go
You delivered Pokemon Go?
Hold on
Nintendo really didn't do anything with Pokemon Go
Let's get that clear first
They provided the intellectual property
That's it, but anyway
In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened when we
Delivered Pokemon Go, and honestly I was quite surprised by it
Myself, there's no doubt that
More people are using smartphones to play games
And at this time we're using
And as this time we're using
Mario, that's a very important
Intellectual property for us
And that's what Miyamoto's team is working on now
Making sure it spreads out
Just as quickly as Pokemon Go
More than 20 million people
Have already registered to receive
Notifications when the game is available
Continuing with some comments
In terms of the game itself
You can download it and play a certain part of it
And then pay a fixed price
And play it over and over as many times as you want
Without having to pay anything extra
And that should give peace of mind that kids can play it
And we're hoping that it will help it become
More popular
So there's no limited Pokeballs
Or incubators or any of that stuff
So it will be one fee
That's going to be the whole game
We knew that was coming, they've said that before
It was going to be one of those typical iPhone games
It's basically now everything's shareware
Again, you get the first episode free
You've got to pay to unlock it
That's what Super Mario Run is going to be
It's going to be shareware
I mean, I like the shareware model
Those are my first games
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I like that model
Bigger than Pokemon Go, Loki?
I would way rather something be shareware for real
Than to try to be freemium
And just nickel and dime you out of everything
You know
If they're talking about the biggest Pokemon Go at launch
No, and I'll tell you why
Pokemon Go is free, for one
Pokemon Go was kind of a unique gameplay thing
Where actually
People were never really exposed to this kind of
Augmented reality thing
Versus a licensed runner
I'm sorry
Even if it is Mario
It'll be popular
Don't get me wrong, but they're not going to
Fucking do news stories about it
People aren't gathering at fucking parks for it
It's not going to be like that
Because it's not bringing anything that unique
To the table
It's a Mario game, which people have been waiting for
But it's a fucking runner
I'm sorry, it's just kind of
Whatever, cool
I think the game will be huge
It will be Candy Crush huge
It will be, you know, draw something huge
It will not be Pokemon Go huge
Because, and you're kind of hitting the nail on the head
It's not going to have that same effect
Where it's on the news and all this stuff
Because it's not a social game
Pokemon Go became a very social thing
Where you got together with friends
And you all downloaded the game
And you went out into the real world
And there's all the, oh you're walking and exercising
There's nothing like this
Mario Run's not going to have that
But that's not to say the game's not going to do extremely well
It's going to do very well for Nintendo
It's going to be number one in the store
For some time
It's just not going to be Pokemon Go levels
And also if it's a purchase game
Even if people don't like it, then they buy it
Because it's Mario, that's going to drive a lot of sales
And that actually, that's the thing
I really hope it's a good game
But the fact that they have a part of it that's free
If it's not a great game
You're not going to get that conversion I think
That's true
I still think people will download it
Just because it's Mario
Well they'll download it, but they might not buy it
And Nintendo's only going to report on who downloads it
They're not going to report on who buys it
Anyway, MXC in chat says
Could it be bigger than Pokemon Go
Since it will be iOS exclusive to start
That's a very good point
Well Pokemon Go couldn't afford to be only iOS only at start
Because then it would have locked out these situations
Like if JD and I wanted to go to Old Town Sack or something to play
We couldn't do it because JD's on Android and I'm on iOS
So it would have cut that element out of it
Now with Super Mario Run, again
Because the social element isn't the same
They can get away with doing that
But you bring up a darn good point
How can they meet those kind of numbers
When it's not even going to be on both platforms at first
And I think it also may show Nintendo a little bit though
It should really show them
Because they've kind of missed the boat on a lot of this social gaming stuff for a very long time
I mean, yeah, sure, Miiverse
I know they're very big on parties in the same room and so forth
But there's a whole other element to online gaming
That Nintendo's just kind of slept on for a long time
Well, I think they also don't know how to handle it
Because Nintendo is so focused on their family friendly, all ages audience
And you just can't subject that to the internet without losing some of that
You know, that's I think one of the reasons why
All of the chat and the friending and stuff is so locked down on all of the things
Doing a code exchange handshake thing like with DS and all of that
It's designed to make sure you're not just adding random people
That's why Nintendo is not very good at social
Because it's not designed to be explosive, viral, social growth
I'm a little pissed they took away my swap notes so I can't send my friend's dicks anymore
On 3DS
Good thing you have Snapchat for that
But that's not Nintendo
See, it's a missed opportunity
I can't send to Snapchat and have it go
Nintendo needs to put Mario stickers in Snapchat
Maybe they will when Super Mario Run comes out, who knows
Alright, moving on, Loki
So there's some more developments in the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus
The two main points from this
One, they are issuing a subpoena to Samsung
To basically get some information related to Samsung's use of the source code and technology
Provided by Oculus in order to create the Samsung Gear VR
So because of that they have to comply within three weeks
I guess of this lawsuit
The other thing is that they are issuing
They want Oculus to provide the imaging of the hard drive from John Carmack
As part of this discovery right now
It's interesting to see they're dragging Samsung into this as well
God, I hope there's no Hillary Clinton emails on that
Let's not even go there
I'm a little late for that now
You know, a couple more days
Sorry, I couldn't help myself
People will not just shut the fuck up about it
Never could the FBI director
Does she have any porn or emails?
Because that's really all that I'm interested in
She's getting subscriptions from like
I'm sure that it's not in hers
Alright, back to
Then again, if you've been reading about where the emails were found
Maybe there was porn there, but nobody wants to see it
Anyway, back to
Back to the ZeniMax Oculus thing
So what, any chance they're going to settle out of court?
Isn't that how these
All these lawsuit stories are
And then they settle out of court
I think ZeniMax has the eye and the prize there
They're hoping to get the big payout
So I don't think there's going to be any settling
If ZeniMax does end up winning
Can you use that money to please patch your games?
Fix that shit?
Because, I don't know
Well, if you are a fan of classic games
Like us here at Orange Lounge Radio
You can be
Confident that GameStop is trying to build up more of the classic gaming
In their stores
Which is ironic because they stopped taking trades of classic games
Not too long ago
Yeah, they were kind of like, nah, we're kind of over that
But now they're back doing it
GameStop is now accepting retro consoles as trade-ins
This originally was a pilot thing
But it was a success
So all stores nationwide
Will now accept NESes, Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast games
They will also take Sega Saturns, Game Boy Colors in advance, GameCube, and Xbox
Are they just taking them or are they selling them again?
I think they are taking them
And they're probably either selling them online
Or I know the way they used to do it
Is like one store in the area was kind of like the retro store
But I don't know what they're doing now
As far as the turnaround
I don't know if they're selling them online
But sell them on eBay
Yeah, I mean it seems like if all they're going to do is just sell it online
Like it doesn't make any sense from the consumer's perspective
To not just do it at all
Like if I were to buy a retro console
I sure as hell wouldn't buy it from GameStop
I'd buy it from eBay
Or some other online source
Or from another independent game store that would probably have that stuff
I think there's going to be a lot of people though
That dig up these cartridges
And then they hear that, oh, GameStop's buying these
They're going to go unload the games at GameStop
Because they don't
Yeah, they're hoping that
Oh, hey, look at you
You got a nice sealed Chrono Trigger there
We'll give you two cents for that
Yeah, exactly, right? We'll give you $2.50
In-store credit
Anyway, I mean
I'm a big retro game fan
So I guess this is cool
I like going to flea markets
And finding stuff there
Sometimes you find some gems there
Although the people who specialize
In selling games at flea markets
They know what they're doing
You're not going to find deals there
But sometimes you find games amongst other stuff
And that's where you find the best stuff
Yard sales
Yeah, it's basically yard sales, for sure
But I guess that's cool that all the retro stuff
Is kind of coming back
I find it very interesting that Genesis
Is in that list because I think back to
We were at Target today
And one thing I noticed in the video game area
There's an Atari Flashback 7
For God's sake, they're up to 7
How different new stuff could they
Possibly have on that now?
It's got to be HDMI at this point
Yeah, I'm sure they've judged
HDMI, man, I'm sure the upscaling
Of that 4-bit graphics
But then
They also had a Genesis
System that had a bunch
Of the Sonic games, of course
Altered Beast, which you'd expect
And I guess somehow, amongst the
Midway closure, they picked
Up the rights to Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3
The Genesis versions
So those are all on there as well
And then I believe the Genesis flashbacks have
Some homegrown games on them
In fact, you notice when you look at the back of the box
Some of the pictures are big
Which are all like the Sega games
And there's a bunch of small pictures
I've never heard of any of these games
I think they're homegrown games that are in there
So that's kind of interesting that they do that with Flashback
Yeah, they did that with the Coleco one
These aren't very good
But I think the Atari one does that too
I think some of those games on there are homegrown games
But then there also was a Genesis
Portable system that was like
The exact same thing, it was like a Flashback
But they actually called it
A Game Gear
Flashback or something
It was like the name, it actually had a little
Tie-in to what the Sega handheld
Used to be called
And you could have a handheld
One of these, and it was relatively
Cheap, I think it was only like 30 bucks
For the handheld
But I still didn't buy one
Because I'm like, okay, I don't need
A Genesis handheld, I'm never going to play it
But I thought that was neat that that was
Out there, but also the reason why I bring that up
Is that kind of stuff
Is kind of becoming more and more where it's like
You have the consoles with the games built in
Is there going to be a market of people
Looking to buy a second-hand Genesis system
At GameStop
Some people there are collectors
Probably, but I just don't know
If you'd really want to do it that route
Because it would be cheaper probably
Just to buy a system that has a lot of that stuff
Built in, or even buy one of those systems
Buy a flash card, if you're not looking
To collect the actual stuff
You're just looking for those games
Buy a flash card, really cheap
And then download all the ROMs to it
Or you can buy
The Nintendo Classic system that's coming out in a couple weeks
Thank you for bringing that up
Because I was going to say, Nintendo is also getting into this game
Big time, I'm sure a lot of you
Are looking at that Nintendo
Classic thing that's coming out
That's coming out in two weeks
Yeah, next week really
Well, not next week, but the week after next
Very, very soon
Yeah
Cool
Alright, so yeah
Those are some things you can trade in at GameStop
Who probably also sells
The Flashback consoles, I imagine they have to
Alright
In any sense they will
Well, it might depend on the size of the store too
The mall ones that are really small may not have room for them
But the one we were at today was a strip mall one
That's huge, so some of the GameStops are a lot bigger than others
Alright, anyway
Let's move on, Loki, one more story from you
And then we're going to get calls here soon
Okay, so this is pretty cool
I have no interest in going to Blizzcon
But
Now I have slightly more interest
If I were going
Weirdo Yankovic
This is going to be the actual
Music act at Blizzcon
This year
And that is the best band
Musician whatever they've ever had
Closing the show at Blizzcon
I'm sorry, and by the way
Remember earlier in the show I said Metallica
Did it one year
Blink 182 did it recently
And I'm trying to think, they've had a lot of those
Types of bands
Right, we were talking about the different types of music
Well, it's always been kind of like that type of music
It's awesome that Weirdo Yankovic is doing it
It's a great choice
And it kind of makes you go, why haven't they done this before?
Why didn't they have Weirdo Owl before?
Maybe this first year it worked out
He's just such a geek, you know
And there's great overlap there
Yeah, it's great overlap
That almost, almost
I'm not going to, but it almost makes me want to buy the stream
I might
He's probably listening
Maybe I'll buy it for Allen
If they have an Overwatch
Because he plays a lot of Overwatch
So I think Allen would really appreciate it
They do have a Bastion skin
Do they? Well, he never plays Bastion
So maybe I don't need to get it for him
If you're interested in that virtual ticket
$40 gets you the concert
As well as the panels and the rest of the show
I mean, it's cheaper than a concert ticket
Oh no, that's next weekend, isn't it?
Yeah, November 4th
It's not Veterans Day weekend
Like it usually is, it's the weekend before
So that's pretty cool
I'm excited, yay Weird Al
And what a great choice there
I hope the concert blows the roof off
And Blizzard goes, we should do more music like this
In the future
Anyhow, so here we are towards the end of the show
And usually the phrase
Would be something a little different
But I think tonight we should best say
Last and certainly least
We have a story
About
Uwe Boll
Remember him? Do you remember Uwe Boll?
Isn't he the guy who did the lawsuit over Kadabra?
Or no, that's Yuri Geller
No, no
No, you think he's somebody else
Uwe Boll was the great
Director
Of video game movies
Such as House of the Dead
Alone in the Dark
Postal
BloodRayne
Name of the King, a dungeon siege tale
Well folks, it was announced this week
That Uwe Boll
Is retiring from
Filmmaking, that's right
He's chosen to retire from the film industry
Because, shock of shocks
He was no longer making money from it
Can't imagine why
Actually he was saying that he was
Losing capital financing his movies
Himself, in a quote he said
The market is dead
You don't make any money anymore on movies
Because the DVD and Blu-ray market
Worldwide has dropped 80%
In the last three years
That is the real reason I just cannot
Afford to make movies
Well
Yeah, you can't
Uwe Boll
You could sell your movies to Netflix
Or Amazon or Hulu
If they were any fucking good
At all
But that's the part that's missing
Is these movies
Are
Shit
They're really bad
Unfortunately
I think there's a Roku app for that
I kind of want a movie app called Shitflix
That's just like really bad movies
I'm pretty sure there's like
Gonna be like pornos called that
Uh oh
Well no, I like that though
No, I like that like really bad B movies
There's a lot of interesting
Apps on the Roku that are
You know, have to do with films and stuff
There might be just like an equivalent of the Razzie
You know like
Anyway, Uwe Boll
Continued to rant saying
I've been using my money since 2005
And if I hadn't made this stupid video game
Based movies, I would never
Have amalgamated the capital
So I could say, let's make the Darfur movie
I don't need a Ferrari, I don't need a yacht
I'm invested in my own movies and I
Lost money
By the way, he has one more film coming out
It's his final director effort
It's called Rampage, President Down
Please tell me that's not based on
I hope it isn't, please
Please
That would be an interesting game to turn into a movie
Well, Uwe Boll
I got two words for you
Bye Felicia
Now you gotta find out about this
Rampage
Rageinator in chat says
In fairness, his movies
They have a trailer, it looks generic
In fairness, his movies have to improve
Dramatically to qualify as shit
You insulted shit movies everywhere
I apologize
I apologize deeply
You gotta love the
Tagline
This bill will not be vetoed
Really?
That's just bad
For some reason I hear Arnold Schwarzenegger in my mind
Saying that line
Not to be vetoed
Do not veto it
Who stars in this movie?
I use my quote
Who's starring in this movie?
Who's featured?
Yeah, I was trying to read the plot here
Bill Williamson is back
Alive and well
I guess this is a sequel to something
So his name is actually William Williamson?
Hey, wait a minute
Don't make fun of him
Don't make fun of him
Yes, Bill Williamson is back
and alive and well
Doing a recon mission around DC this time
This time he wants to cause
major population disruption
within the USA
which will result in a devastating consequence
reverberating
throughout the world
His new mission this time is to bring down
the president of the United States
and his secret service detail
Bill brings with him
an all freakin'
havoc and acidity
This is a third
of a series of movies?
It sounds so generic
There's like no plot to it
Guy goes after president
Bill Bill Bill goes after president
And it's like Sharknado
will make more money
Now that's a good shit movie
Because it's not a generic movie
It's just over the top
This isn't over the top
This is like, crap
If it was like, yes
and Bill Williamson is coming back
with his, you know
cannon or something like that that fires live sharks
William Williamson
and Rob Roberts
You should do like a Saints Row movie
Just make it, well actually they should just
do a Saints Row movie would be fantastic
You need to find your third co-star
John Johnson
Right? Right? I do need to
But yeah, this is starring
and I have no
I honestly do not recognize
any of the names on this
but we've got
Is there anybody that
No
There's no names
Bill Williamson is played by Brendan Fletcher
And we've got Bruce
Blaine, Loretta Walsh
Zane McG-
Okay, I don't even fucking know
None of these people
These are the actors
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line
Save us from a Nuevo film discussion please
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype
If you want to give us a call
We can talk about anything that we've discussed so far
Or perhaps
You have something new you'd like to discuss
Again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
on Skype
While we wait for some calls to come in
Loki, do you have anything, last minute story you want to discuss here?
Oh goodie, Uwe Boll plays a part in the movie himself
He is Rampage Killer number two
Because he's just like Alfred Hitchcock
Just like him
He's just like M. Night Shyamalan
Just like him
Just like him, exactly
Remember when Lady in the Water was like
If that was like watching M. Night Shyamalan
Blow himself on it
It was so bad too
Because all the other movies were pretty good
It's like, oh man, I wonder what this is going to be like
Oh man, this is so fucking terrible
Actually, I think, wasn't the village before that?
The village was before that
I thought the village was okay to me
I did not hate the village
I didn't like the village
Lady in the Water and then The Happening
The Happening was so bad
Oh and The Visit was so bad
I mean, the village and The Sixth Sense
Are the only two Shyamalan movies I've seen
So maybe that affects my opinion
A lot of people liked Signs
The ending kind of made people go
Like literally, fuck you
Signs could have been so much better than what it was
Unbreakable was pretty good though
Oh yeah, Unbreakable was great
That was a great movie
The ending for that was probably one of the best
Out of any of his movies, that was a great twist ending
So, anyway
Orange Lawns Radio, all one word on Skype
If you want to give us a call
Any last minute stories here?
No, slow
Slow news week
It's slow. Alright, well you know
Things are so slow around here, I think we should
Probably take a moment
To do a little bit of ranting
You know, because I think we missed this last week
So, I'm going to take an opportunity to do
The FUs of the week
So with that
Here is justice
Here is punishment
Here is
This is fucked up
Loki
My FUs week goes to Microsoft
For their wonderful Windows 10 updates
Because all that happened
During the week I was awake
I was ready to work on my game
There was an update that needed to be done
I was like, damn, I'll just do the update real fast
And then be done with it
And on top of that it screwed up my touchpad again
Trying to install some sort of driver's port
That don't really work with it
And it's still not quite right
Even after I uninstalled it
It's just very twitchy now
Thanks a lot
Shane, do you have any FUs you'd like to get out
Of the system?
FU to Walgreens for not having
The Power Ranger toys I want
Same with you, Target
But otherwise, no
My FU of the week goes to Shane
For calling me fat
There's a whole story behind it
And I didn't do it on the show
But I'm going to before it's over
And I'll find a way
Shane called me fat today
No, because you implied you were
And I was like, I didn't say that
And you kept pushing me
So I was like, okay then, you're fat
JD, do you have an FU of the week?
The cost of airfare
I found out I need to fly back to Florida
And that's the worst time
The worst time to go
That you need to go
FU to that
FU to airfare
It sucks
Alright
Well, we've got one call coming in
Let's get to it
Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio, who's this?
Hi, this is Ragingator
Hi Ragingator, what's on your mind tonight?
Just two questions
Unfortunately, they're probably going to entail
answers
Well, no
I know it's a little bit early for this
But since
it's just a matter of a few weeks away
Obviously
Thanksgiving
is coming up, which means Black Friday
and sales and whatnot
And chances are
all the major retailers are going to
be having their sales
Plus, obviously, Steam
That being said, are there any
names that you folks are looking
forward to picking up if they
go on sale? Anything you have your eyes
on during a Black Friday sale
You know, since Shane can't
find three games for me to buy during
a Target sale that's going on right now
I don't know about a Black Friday sale I found them, you just didn't want them
I don't know why Well, you know
as far as Steam goes, there's always
something that suckers me in on a Steam sale
And I gotta say, Valve is pretty genius for
building in that wishlist thing
I love it when they email me when a wishlist
thing goes on sale I love it and I hate it
because they'll go, an item on your wishlist is on sale
and then I'll be like, oh fuck, it's only
99 cents bought, and then I just bought
70 games for 99 cents a piece
So, I love it
and I hate it, but the honest answer is
probably some of the stuff that's on my wishlist
which oftentimes is stuff
I already own on console, but it's like
I want it on PC as well
Sometimes you want the best
of both worlds, right? I'm hoping
3DSs go on sale because I don't have
one, and I'd love to pick one up
Yeah, there'll be a deal
if not 2DS, there might be a 2DS sale
Well, I don't want a 2DS
You might luck out, there might be a 3DS sale
but I wouldn't expect to get Pokemon Sun and Moon on a discount
I'm not expecting a game that came out a week before
to be on sale, no
Well, sometimes they'll do
like, buy the game
and get a $10 gift card
or something, sometimes they do that
that's like the little enhanced thing
I want VR games
I want more VR games
for my PS4, that'd be great
to see some of those that I have
a pretty solid interest in
to drop to even lower
That'd be very cool
Loki, anything you're gonna have your eyes on for Black Friday?
Not really, because I have so much stuff in my
backlog now, it's just
I don't know, hopefully they drop some of the prices
of those PlayStation VR games
but even right now, even looking
at what's coming out later on
there's not really anything on the horizon
except for in December, I think there's some rollercoaster
game that's coming out that might be interesting
but that's kind of it
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that came out apparently
at launch, but
It's mostly digital too, though
It's just kind of not
a lot of stuff I really want to pick up
it's kind of a lull right now, I guess
AkumaJP has another example
of a sale that happens
AkumaJP suggests, buy a 3DS and get
50% off a new game
they do those types of things as well
that's when I bought my Xbox One
that's what finally broke me, is they did buy an Xbox One
get a free game, so I got
Forza Horizon 2 at the time
so that's what finally broke me on an Xbox One
so anyway, there you go
Rage Nator, I think for a lot of us, we kind of have to see
what's on the table first, and then we go
ooh, that's an attractive idea, we'll see
I don't know, what was your other question?
You said you had a second question
Well, since you folks
brought up GameStopper
and
obviously GameStopper is universally
hated, pretty much
that, I would like
to take my question
in a different route
is there
a traditional brick and mortar store
that you folks
used to, at one point or another
really used to love going to
for your games and other
entertainment?
Great question, is there a brick and mortar store
that maybe is gone, or maybe it's still there
but maybe a brick and mortar store
that you would go to for your games
that was fun, for me
it was Software, etc. and then GameStop
bought them, was the problem
I thought that was the other way around
was the other way around, yeah, because EB Games got bought
by GameStop, I just remember
back in the day, when Software, etc. was the place
where I got a service
Software, etc., Babbage's
and then I think Electronics Boutique
was another, all those stores, but they all
got bought by GameStop, even if it is the same
company now, like it was
different 20 years ago, it was much different
20 years ago, that was before the age of pre-ordering
or when you would
sign up on a list to get a
phone call the day it comes out, and they would
just hold it for you, I think was the thing
I remember that was the thing
I used to do pre-orders over the phone
yeah, it was like much different then
so, yeah, I remember certainly for those
what about JD? When I was a kid
I actually looked in the phone book for
video game stores, because, I mean
yeah, there were chains in malls and stuff, but I found
some pretty neat, like small
independent used game stores, and I
missed those, because they're not really around anymore
there was one in Orlando that
I liked, and
even in San Francisco, I moved there in
2009, and there was one on Powell
in North Beach, and I think it closed
a couple years after I moved, so I
missed those
and you know, I miss, and
Shane, I know you're going to like this answer too
I miss the retro
Toys R Us
oh, okay, you said retro, I was like, oh where is this going, but Toys R Us
the retro Toys R Us, where you would actually have the
pull tags, and you'd have to pull the tag
and then they'd get it for you up front, and that's
where we used to get, like, that's where my family always got
conversation, we need to make another trip to the
Toys R Us set time for God, because the Chico
Toys R Us still has pull tags
and that whole system, I was like, oh my
gosh, is Chico stuck in 1993?
probably, as somebody
who lived there in 1996
yes, it probably is still stuck there
but anyway, yeah
I like Toys R Us back in the day
that's where my family got all the Commodore 64 games
but a lot of these stores just kind of
changed over the years, you know, it's just
different now, online also really really
changed the game, it really really did
Loki, any quick memories you want to share
real quick?
places I used to buy games, it was pretty much like
software, etc, I think
was the local store I used to go
to
honestly, back when I was
purchasing games from stores like that
well, console games
console games would pretty much be
wherever I'd go to, like Walmarts
and stuff like that
actual PC games, I used to
buy a lot of shareware, and they
used to have those kiosks everywhere
used to buy dead shareware disks
at my local video store
and used to pick up demos all the time
oh yeah, the old school computer
shops, yes
I used to get
wherever, or you even go to the computer show and sale
and stuff like that
I don't know if they still do that
no, not anymore, like that was the huge one they do at
Cal Expo, right?
all sorts of legitimate things
now it's shoes
so, Rage Nator, it sounds like you had a
quick story before we let you go
well, I was
going to say that
it's kind of hard for you guys to relate
because you're out in California
you don't know
in the Buffalo area
but out in
one of the local burbs
in the Buffalo area
which is called
Amherst
there's a plaza
they're called the T.G. Max
Plaza, obviously because
T.G. Max is in there
but back in the 90's
I used to love going there
because they had Toys R Us
there, like what you were
mentioning, they had the pull tabs and all that
I used to love buying my games there
when I started buying games on my own
and right
within the same plaza
I used to love going to media play
yeah
I mean
yeah, they had the video games
there, but aside from that they had
everything else there that
I could possibly want
music, movies
posters, you name it
we had the
gathering cards
that place was heaven, I swear to god
there was times
that on the weekend
I would be there literally all
day to the point where
I was there until clearly closing
and they had to kick me out
sounds like a fun place, but I will say this
even though we are all the way
in California, we have T.G. Max
out here as well, and there's a T.G. Max Plaza
here, and that's where the Mongolian barbecue
is, so we
have our own T.G. Max Plaza that we go
to, so there's that
I also miss CompUSA, they had
a computer lab set up to demo
their games, and I played the logical
journey of the Zoombinis there a bunch
that was the early PC days
and my brother and I
would sit there on the computers and just play games
until they were done, I feel like the first time I ever
played the Castle of Dr. Brain was that
I love that series, right?
oh my god, yes
alright, I'm going to let you go
but thanks so much for the call
thanks for the trip down memory lane
later, alright
Orange Launch Radio, one word on Skype
if you want to try to get in, although I didn't see any other calls
coming in, so I don't know, it might be a quiet night tonight
but I'll give it a couple minutes just in case
yeah, trip down memory lane
good times, that CompUSA
building here in SAC
still, still no new tenant
it's still just empty
I think I finally saw a sign
that they were going to turn it into some event center
or something, but it's kind of sad
that CompUSA building has been empty forever
I mean, they went out of business a long time ago
but nothing will beat
the sign that still is up
that says Circuit City
oh, those things are ghost towns
there is still a sign that says Circuit City, which is funny
because the store did convert
it was, I want to say
it was a Good Guys for a short minute
when they were still around, then they went under
and then it was, it's a wine store now
it's nothing but wine
yeah, no, it's a great conversion
but it's still, for some reason
the sign in the front says Total Wine
or whatever the name of the store is, but the sign in the back
still says Circuit City
it's crazy
alright, we got one more call coming in, then we'll wrap it up
hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
hey, what's going on everybody, it's Ranma
hey Ranma buddy, how you doing?
nostalgic
right, in fact I brought up Circuit City and that was another place we used to go check out
like games and stuff at, but anyway, what's on your mind buddy?
I want to back up what Rage Nator said
because I remember growing up
in my small little town
it was like this one little store
called Weekend Gifts where I would buy all of my
video games from, because I wasn't
really allowed to travel outside of the town
and there were a couple other stores
back and forth I'd get my games from
and then, what usually
sucked because it's a smaller store
games were a little bit more expensive
yeah
when I got into high school and I had a bus pass
I traveled from point A to point B
I discovered software, etc
Circuit City
and sales
and sales
yes, I was so excited
like it wasn't that long ago, because Alan
and I, well I guess Alan and I have been together a while
now, but it was probably about five years ago, Alan and I
took a road trip to Oregon
it was about five years ago, and we stopped
at a mall in, I want to
say it was Ashland, where we
stopped, we stopped at a mall in Ashland
to like eat or whatever, and in the mall
they had a GameStop, and
a software, etc
they still had a fucking software, etc
and bonus, there's
no sales tax in Oregon
so I was like, alright, fuck it, I'm gonna go
buy a game here, just so I can have
say I shopped the software, etc while I was
here, and I actually had a receipt
I don't know if it's still, it's probably long closed
this was a good five, six years ago, but
sorry, I just had to bring that up, because that
was a nostalgia trip for me, that that was still open
like in the year 2010,
2011, it was awesome
brother, let me tell you
if memory serves me correctly
I still have friends that live up in my
in the towns, in the areas
I used to hang out in, the town over
where the software, etc it was
from my understanding
to this day, it's
still a software, etc
rad, although
it's funny that we're reminiscing, because there
literally is no difference between software, etc and GameStop
now, like it's really just the
logo and all the purple, is the only thing
that differentiates them at this point, so
but, I don't know, there's just something
about it, there's something about it
true, but you know what
my thing was, I just loved
I just like funko way, and you go
in every month, you get like this
this newspaper of all the sale
prices, and you knew what they had
and they had these cool demos up
and it was like, they
only carried the popular games
so, what they didn't have, you had to
run over to Toys R Us
or software, etc, or at the
time, if you really wanted to do it,
KB Toys, to get those games
because KB was the spot
where I used to get my Master System games
My Atari 2600 games came
from KB Toys, that was old school
I think I bought my first Game Boy Color at KB Toys
Yeah, wow, they didn't
last long past
the Nintendo 64 era, right?
They were, they went
under a long time ago, anyway
Alright, good times
good memories, so
yeah, lots of
stores that are unfortunately long gone
Where do you buy your games now?
Um
I actually buy my games from
either Micro Center
or Best Buy
or Nintendo World
If I have to go to New York City
I kind of bless myself
before walking in, so that I
don't have a stroke talking to these
people about a particular game I'm looking for
or something like that
Since you're in New York City, you can just go straight to the
30 Rock Nintendo store and
get it from the stores, that's pretty awesome
Yeah, and then I can go upstairs and play
Star Fox on the Wii U on a big ass
250 inch screen
That's the life, the life
of New York City, but you pay a premium to live there
just kidding
Sky, you have no idea
I have some idea
Yeah, keep in mind, our buddy
JD here is from San Francisco, we get
near full from our friends over there, so
we have some idea
I'm just thankful they didn't hike up my rent
this year, because my place
is about the size
of the old studio
of what I came to visit
that time
Which is small
Does New York have rent control?
Oh, New York has rent control, but when you're living somewhere
and you're paying month to month
because you need to rent out the basement
it gets a little tricky
At least
Squatter's rights are on my side
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we wrap up
the show, thanks for the call and the memories
Alright, Rob, one more thing
Stay fabulous, brother
Always, always, stay black
I try
Work on it, alright, take care
Bye
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight
If you didn't get through, you should email us
or participate at orangeloungeradio.com
That is
gonna wrap it up for another episode of
Orange Lounge Radio
Hey, Shane, thanks for being here tonight in studio
I'm sure you had a great time
as always. Did you catch any Pokemon during
the show? I'm not catching anything right now
I'm working through the story
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry about that
He needs a ditto
Did you not pay attention earlier?
Is it because you're too fat?
Worked it in! Yay!
Rude and unnecessary
Uh, JD, thanks for being here
I hope you had fun. Was it fun being
in the studio? Absolutely
What do people out there need to know about the way
OLR really works?
Oh, man
Um, I don't know if there's anything
I can share
It's all a secret
Alright, you'll just have to come find out for yourself
Alright, anything you're here to plug
You don't really have a show or anything
Do you have a blog, a Twitter
Or something that people should follow
Twitter is probably the best place to find me
If you want to know more
I retweet a lot of stuff
Sometimes it's politics, sometimes it's ash
Or not ash, it's red and blue in fan art
Who knows what, you'll be fine
And your Twitter account is?
jai underscore d-i-t
It's jaydee from French
That's how you say it!
So it's French for I have said
But it's also my name
Because puns are very central to me
I remember the first week I was like
Is it jaydee? What is it?
Oh, it's jaydee, it's his name, I get it
I'm looking right now for this fan art
I'm not seeing it
Because I have to compare to see if I have any of it
Alright, uh
Any final thoughts to leave with our listeners tonight?
You know, I don't know if they're still around
But For Your Entertainment used to have
A DDR machine in the mall
One of the malls in Orlando I went to
I think a lot of those stores closed, sadly
It was all part of the Suncoast
That's another fun thing
As always, I just want to say

Five star review
And my final thought tonight is
I'm glad I got capped for tomes on Final Fantasy 14 already
So I don't have to play again tonight
I can play more Jackbox Party Pack or something else
Loki, last but not least my friend
Your final thought tonight
I get pizza tomorrow? I don't know
Pizza party!
Fortunately I have to watch a
You know
I'm gonna call a keynote
I'm gonna get a presentation from our CEO
Well good luck with that
But at least I get pizza
Good luck with that
Happy Halloween everybody
Be safe, don't be a fool
But I think most of you probably already finished your celebrating
I was gonna say it wasn't a Halloween thing
And I almost did this too
But I totally want to make some of those Borderlands pants
That they have
Have you seen those?
Where they paint them so they look cel shaded?
I would just wear those regularly
Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio
Have a good Halloween, we will see you in 7 days
BlizzCon
So we know we'll get a lot of PC gaming news
Happening this coming weekend, so that to look forward to
So we'll see you in 7 days to talk all about it
And whatever else is going on in the gaming world
Have a good one everybody, good night!
It's at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern
