Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, you'd probably expect me to talk about the Nintendo Switch, but your hosts will do that for more than 13 seconds. What you may not have heard is the ongoing labored strike by Union voice actors. My time is up for now, but stay tuned for this and plenty more news right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight, episode number 662 for this, October 23rd, 2016. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California. And with me, as always, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi, Loki.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hi.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
So, Steve, I overheard you say a phrase I don't hear you say very often while you were eating dinner before the show, and that was, this might be too much bacon. Is that true?

01:03.000 --> 01:15.000
Well, it's not. You can have too much bad bacon. Like, the bacon is just kind of, eh. You know, it's fast food bacon that's just kind of, you know, it should be bacon.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Or the bacon they used to have in my college dorms. It's disgusting.

01:18.000 --> 01:31.000
If it's bacon that they, like, deep fry or they crisp up to the point where it's, like, snapping, you can never have too much of that. Or if it's salty. But fast food bacon that's basically been cooked in the morning, sitting there all day long, you can have too much of that.

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
Alright, well, look, we could talk about bacon for a while, but there's a lot going on tonight. We have a very busy show tonight. Very excited to welcome. I know a lot of our longtime listeners have been looking forward to this.

01:42.000 --> 01:56.000
One of the creators, or I believe the creator, of Cat President is here tonight. Not to be confused with President Cat, but we'll talk about that in about 30 minutes with Paul from O'Iraq Studios.

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
And some other, I believe there's another game he's about ready to release, so we'll talk all about that, as well as Cats and why they would make great presidents and so forth. We will get into that a little later.

02:06.000 --> 02:24.000
However, up first, I'm sure the folks listening this week are dying to know. So, what does Loki think of the Nintendo Switch? And in case, for some reason, you only get your gaming news from OLR, which I would find hard to believe, but thank you if that's the case, Nintendo did unveil the NX this week.

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
So, the NX is no more. It is now the Nintendo Switch, and that's the name. And there was a three and a half minute trailer that we got with not even a day's lead time, what they announced Thursday night that they would be posting it Friday morning.

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
And it was very similar in nature to the Wii U trailer that they showed at E3 years and years ago, where it was actors using the device as Nintendo envisions this to be embraced by the world.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
So, Nintendo Switch. Loki. First off, Loki, what about the name? What do you think of the name Nintendo Switch?

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
It's not Wii or Wii U, so they've got points right there.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
That's a good thing, right?

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
It's not stupid. There you go. It's not a stupid name.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I like the name. I do.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I think it's fine.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
It doesn't scream console to me, but certainly neither does Wii.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
It doesn't scream what the hell?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
What's a Wii?

03:19.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm surprised they maybe didn't do Game Switch, but maybe that's too close to some... There's probably a company out there already called that. But anyway, that's alright.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm fine with the name Nintendo Switch, and I like that the logo is very different.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
One of the biggest things you notice that they're quote unquote fixing right off the top is they are separating this from the Wii and the Wii U.

03:41.000 --> 03:57.000
Visually, with the name, very big difference, which is interesting considering the fact that in some ways I kind of feel that the Nintendo Switch is what a lot of people thought the Wii U could have been or should have been.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Maybe that the technology wasn't quite ready for, but the fact that the gamepad should go with you anywhere.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
But regardless, a lot of the rumors that we've talked about here previously on the show turn out to be true.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
Not all of them, certainly, because there was the whole fuckery of a touchpad with no controllers on it, although...

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
Or was it the one that was the concept where the controller was the touchpad? Like, you'd have the actual buttons and the image would be underneath, which is stupid.

04:25.000 --> 04:36.000
So that's all out the window. And I was going to say, although, to be fair, since those controllers come off the touchpad, I suppose you could have where it's just the touchpad, although I don't know what game to play.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, technically we don't know that it's a touchpad yet.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
True, true. We don't know that it's a touchpad yet.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Although it would be stupid not to do that.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
I would be very surprised if it wasn't. I guess the question would be, how expensive is it to be a touchpad?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Not much, I don't know.

04:49.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, in this day and age that technology is very cheap. Anyway, Loki, I'm sure you watched the trailer, 7am Friday morning like a lot of us did. What did you think?

04:58.000 --> 05:11.000
I thought it was alright. I mean, it's just, I'm not, like, I was expecting a little bit more, I don't know, like, with the Wii and stuff it was more of like a wow factor because it was a different way to play your games.

05:11.000 --> 05:26.000
I think taking my system somewhere and playing a game is not necessarily that big a deal to me because I used to do that, shit, I did that when I was in high school with the PlayStation 1 and I've, you know, did it with previous systems before.

05:26.000 --> 05:37.000
So it's not, I mean, it's neat that you can take the controller, I guess, with you and it doesn't seem to stop your game, but I don't know.

05:37.000 --> 05:50.000
I do like the fact that theoretically it's powerful enough to run games like Skyrim and stuff so hopefully that means that we'll have some third party games on there or even, you know, something better quality.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I mean, because that was a really hurting point for the Wii U.

05:55.000 --> 06:05.000
Well, Nintendo did come out with a slide, I don't know if it's from their press site or where, but it's floating around the internet there that shows all these company logos and it's, look at who we're partnering with for the Switch.

06:05.000 --> 06:19.000
And I don't know, I kind of take that with a grain of salt, not that I'm trying to be negative when it comes to Nintendo. I am excited about the Switch, I look forward to it, but I just kind of help, can't help but feel like we saw a slide like this with the Wii U

06:19.000 --> 06:30.000
and, you know, EA's logo was up there, EA even got on stage with them at E3 and talked about how frickin' great the Wii U was and then what did EA do, put out two games and then dropped it?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Yes, I remember the...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Like, I just...

06:33.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, it was even worse than 3DS because they didn't just have game, they didn't have game company names, they had game names on there like Saints Row and DJ Hero and that shit never fuckin' happened, so I was a little bit disappointed there.

06:47.000 --> 07:06.000
But, I mean, it looks nice as like a portable system, I guess, but it's so huge as it's not really good for a portable system and then the other thing you have to factor in too, it's not like your tablet or your phone because where's the internet?

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
You have to be on Wi-Fi to use that shit and so all these dreams of people saying, oh, portable Splatoon, no, not unless you're tethered to something.

07:14.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, I mean, to be fair, a lot of that depends on how much online Nintendo's gonna embrace with this. If Nintendo is doing Wi-Fi, which would make an awful lot of sense, the 3DS does it and so many places have Wi-Fi now like Starbucks, etc.

07:29.000 --> 07:52.000
McDonald's, they were doing some giveaway there, so so many places have Wi-Fi now I could see that and we know that, hell, even back to what the Game Boy Advance could do same room multiplayer through the infrared, which I'm sure is all now Bluetooth technology, I'm not worried about multiplayer in the same room by any means for sure with the Switch and I would think Wi-Fi is a given for the internet.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Look at, I mean, look at the Vita and the 3G on the Vita, that went nowhere.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
No, it didn't go anywhere.

07:58.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't see Nintendo really selling cellular, just getting their hands on that. I think they'll probably do Wi-Fi like they do on DS and that'll be fine. I kind of think that's gonna be it.

08:08.000 --> 08:19.000
But the thing, like, the other thing about that too is like what they were showing in the video where there's people, you know, split basically taking the two joy cons and two sides of the controllers and using them to play multiplayer games on a tiny screen.

08:20.000 --> 08:37.000
It just doesn't seem like that's something you're gonna be doing a lot of because that screen is fucking tiny and you're playing it. It's just like that's about as feasible as, oh, hey, did you know that there's sensors built into the Wii U tablet screen that you can use your motion controllers with it to play motion games on that screen?

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
Did anyone fucking do that? No, they didn't because it's stupid because that screen is so small, it just is not gonna work very well.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
I just, I don't see the point. I mean, I guess in that one scenario where they're showing, oh, it's in a car.

08:51.000 --> 09:03.000
It is for the Wii games that they're gonna sell on Virtual Console, trust. The Wii U, the Wii U gamepad has like that same thing in it and that's like the only time I've seen it used is you can optionally use that as your infrared box.

09:03.000 --> 09:15.000
Right, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't make any sense. That's what I'm saying is the screen's so small, it doesn't make sense to do like split screen gaming on it because you're splitting a section screen two ways. That's just dumb.

09:17.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't know. I mean, it didn't really show us much yet other than it doesn't have a stupid name. It looks like the hardware is more powerful.

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
That's all we really know about it and that there's potentially a Mario game, maybe Skyrim, although Bethesda's like, oh, we're not confirming that Skyrim's gonna be on it.

09:35.000 --> 09:44.000
Which reminds me of, oh, hey, Minecraft on the fucking, what was that, the OUYA. Yeah, Minecraft on the OUYA. You know, it's all over again.

09:45.000 --> 09:56.000
It's just, I don't know. I'm not impressed, but I'm not like disappointed, I guess. I have no expectations of it really.

09:56.000 --> 10:05.000
Do you think the rumors from beforehand that we had that, you know, kind of ended up being plausibly correct, do you think that that all kind of played into it?

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
Because I know for me, it was like when I saw the trailer, I was like, oh, okay, cool. So they're running with that idea that everybody's been already talking about for a while now.

10:12.000 --> 10:23.000
So it was kind of, in a way, I kind of felt the reveal was anti-climatic in that regard, although, you know, the little bones tossed of a potential Skyrim on this thing, although we don't really know.

10:23.000 --> 10:34.000
I just don't, to me, it's just, it seems like it's a console that you can take with you, cool. I don't see the innovation there aside from it's convenient to take it with me, if I was going to take it with me.

10:34.000 --> 10:45.000
But as far as gameplay-wise, it's basically doing the same shit that fucking Sony and Microsoft are doing. As far as gameplay, I mean, there's no indication of motion controls on there at all.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
It's like they've gotten rid of that whole thing. There's no indication of a touchpad yet, although it'd be crazy for them not to do that, but it's not a guarantee.

10:53.000 --> 11:05.000
So it's just, to me, as the way I described it, it's safe. They're playing it safe. And that's fine, they can do that, but, like, I think we're just looking for, like, to be this impressed, like, the Wii was, like, holy crap.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
You know, that's, can you imagine, you know, playing games this way, or like in the 3DS, wow, 3D without glasses, that's going to be crazy impressive.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
And all that kind of fell flat, and now it's just like, eh, we're just not really going to try to impress you. It's the system you can take with you.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
So it needs the games to really justify it.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
It needs the games, and it also needs the price point that makes sense, because they're going to fuck people on the price point, and have a feeling that's going to happen.

11:28.000 --> 11:38.000
I want to make sure we get some of our chatters into, very important, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geese Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

11:38.000 --> 11:49.000
And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat, live.vognetwork.com, where we have some comments such as Dark Tetsuya mentioning the fact that the switch is a one-syllable word, saying,

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
I think they were just trying to keep it simple and easy to remember. It's one syllable like we was.

11:54.000 --> 12:05.000
So, you know, switch is a very, you know, just a simple word. I can kind of see that perspective, that maybe they didn't want to come up with a complicated name, so they kept it very simple, that makes sense.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
Let's see, Stellarose412 in chat says, there are a fuck ton of third-party partners, super excited.

12:11.000 --> 12:22.000
And yeah, despite what I said about, you know, the Wii U thing and where I said, I don't want to get my hopes up, at the same time, Nintendo is very, very, very strong in the portable market.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
And if they've leveraged a lot of that from their portable market to the switch, then that's really only going to be a good thing.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
I mean, Square Enix, as an example, puts out some pretty cool games on 3DS that you really can't get anywhere else.

12:35.000 --> 12:43.000
Right. And that makes sense why they would want a touchscreen on there. And also, it solves the problem, well, there's not a lot of content on the Wii U.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
Well, now we just have the same content that's from both into one platform, basically.

12:48.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't know how I feel about the Wii U. What did you think about the whole fact that it looks like they're doing Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon for Wii U?

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
Although, just, you know, before people call it out, yes, we had King Boo driving a kart in Mario Kart.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
That could be DLC. That could simply be DLC for, you know, later on.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Same thing with Splatoon.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
Same thing with Splatoon. That's basically DLC. Is that worth it for purchasing the game all over again? No?

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, but the argument would be a lot of people didn't purchase it in the first place, because the Wii U didn't move as much as Nintendo wanted it to.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
That's fine if they want to make that argument. But here's my problem also, though.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And Vanetta 2 should be there.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay, here's my problem, though, with it, is I purchased all my games digitally.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Are you gonna tell me that I'm once again not gonna be able to move my digital library over to the new system?

13:36.000 --> 13:46.000
Because, like, I get it with the Wii and Wii U titles and stuff like that, but if they pull that shit with Virtual Console again,

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
where I can't play those Virtual Console games on this new system, what the hell?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I mean, that's just stupid.

13:54.000 --> 14:04.000
Oh, well, we had to make this, like, login for our network so we track all your purchases and everything, but it's just not gonna fucking work again.

14:04.000 --> 14:14.000
I mean, see, it's all these things that I need to see what's gonna happen with it, like, answer all these questions before I decide whether I want it or not.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah, and I think you do raise some good questions about, I mean, I am not expecting that people who purchase that stuff on Wii U digitally

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
are gonna get any sort of deal because the people who got it on disc, when there's no disc drive on that thing, are not gonna get a deal.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I just don't see that happening, period.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
And some folks in chat, several folks in chat are saying the Splatoon changes look too big to be DLC.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Some folks thinking that's a new game.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
But at the end of the day, we don't know.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
We are speculating off of literal seconds of footage, so we don't know.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Nintendo will eventually have to say more about what this Splatoon is.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
Is it a enhanced edition? Is it Splatoon 2? What the hell is it? We're not gonna know for a while, right?

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
Loki, I would think this is probably the last we hear of the Switch until January.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I think that's what they said, and that's stupid, but whatever.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
Well, is it? Because with the holiday season and everybody gonna be looking around for holiday stuff, this is something that's not gonna be on the shelves on the holidays.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
So, is it stupid to just kinda let it go till next year? Get people hyped in January?

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
Right. I think it's gonna be stupid to do that because people can get hyped about the Xbox One or something.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Hell, I was looking at it today. They were offering some stuff where the system's $50 off.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
They give you $50 on top of that towards a feature purchase and a free game for $250 for an Xbox One.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
I was like, shit, maybe I should do that.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
I just don't know what the price of this is gonna be, and is it worth purchasing for?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
In Skyrim, that's kind of exciting that Skyrim's on a Nintendo system.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
Now, as much as I'm championing this thing and I do feel positive about it and everything, that's the one thing where I kinda was like, big fuckin' deal.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Skyrim's an old game.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
It was on the Xbox 360. It's on the fuckin' PlayStation 3. Big fuckin' deal.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
However, with that, if this is some type of enhanced Skyrim, or if it's the HD Skyrim or whatever,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
but the reality is, PlayStation and Xbox are gonna get it.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I would like to just see something new from Bethesda.

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
Now, rumors are that that's happening with Beyond Good and Evil, right?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
We've heard the rumors this week, because that was out previously.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
That's not Bethesda, though. Beyond Good and Evil?

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Crazy moment.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I thought there was something with Bethesda as well.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
There was something that was, well, anyway.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Okay, then fine. All that stuff aside, clearly my thought changer railed on that, but all that stuff aside,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
I would like to see something maybe new from Bethesda, because,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
and my concern is, look, don't hate me because I'm saying this about Skyrim,

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
but the reality is, the Wii U launch lineup was Mass Effect, Arkham City,

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
all these things that had already come out a year before, and look where that got the Wii U.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
So I don't find Skyrim on this thing to be good news.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Bethesda needs to be pushing something current.

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
Now, I suppose, what about, this is gonna sound ridiculous,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
but what if it was Elder Scrolls Online?

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
Because that's still something that Bethesda's trying in that department,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
and you're just straight up laughing.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
That's stupid. No one wants that shit.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Rude. Rude.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
No one wants that, I'm sorry.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
But at least, and the reason why I say that-

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
And it can't be online, it can't be Elder Scrolls Online,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
because fucking Nintendo doesn't get online yet.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Well, we don't know. They didn't say anything about online.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Okay, let me tell you this much.

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
My expectations of Nintendo's ability to grasp online and actually get it

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
is about as high as the fucking announcement of the Switch.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm gonna shut this down right now. Dragon Quest X is a thing.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
It's not a thing here for some reason, but it's a thing.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
So, yes, Nintendo is capable of running an MMO.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So, shut it down.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Alright.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
No, I'm sorry, it's not here, so that doesn't count.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
Well, that is, that's a frustration for me, too.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
ActDef says, while they did announce the console, we didn't get details about it.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Stoppy says, I'd say we got a lot, just not everything.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Let's see.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Tigerclaw says, whatever Elder Scrolls they are coming for the Switch,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
it's gonna be some stripped down version with some features missing.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Well...

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I don't know about that.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't know about that. No, I don't either.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
You know, it may not be this HD remaster that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
are getting, what, this week, right?

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
But it could be the older version with some other type of alternative enhancements.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I don't know.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
We don't know yet.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
There's a lot of information we don't know about it yet.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
I mean, I was gonna say, one of the things that we saw,

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
one of the things they were talking about is that it can actually run Unreal 4.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
So, if it can run Unreal 4, I mean, I know it's scalable and stuff,

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
but it could be, I mean, pretty decent.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I just don't know what this is capable of.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
I mean, the Zelda game looks pretty, and the Mario game, theoretically,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I mean, even though we don't know anything about it,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
it could very well just be CG bullshit, look nice.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So, I don't know.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
AlphaCananagram in chat says,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
MeTomo is a good sign of future network of Nintendo.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Ugh. Ugh.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
You might want to, maybe Pokémon Go or something, I don't know.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Ugh.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Not like MeTomo.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Ugh, vomit.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Dungeonbuster says, Skyrim on the Switch is a big thing

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
because Bethesda had never brought over any of its flagship games

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
to a Nintendo system before.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
But do you see why that concerns me, though?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Because, again, it's an old game on the new console

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
that I don't think there's the demand there for that people think.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You know what I mean?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't know.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I don't want Skyrim to be Bethesda's benchmark

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
of how well can we do on the Wii.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
They do mods and everything, that would be pretty cool

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
if they had mod support on there as well.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I guess that'd be cool.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
There was another really good comment a minute ago

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
that I wanted to get out here.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Oh, here it is.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com, I hope I'm saying this right.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Sorry if I'm not.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Ichbin Maya says,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
I would also think that our virtual console purchases

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
may be offered again on the Switch at a discounted upgrade rate

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
like they offered for the Switch from Wii to Wii U.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
So that is a good point that Nintendo already has that technology

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
to know what you've bought in the past.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
So maybe, if you did buy something digitally,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
maybe you could qualify for a discount.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I just, I don't know.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I think it would put Nintendo in a really weird position

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
because you're going to have all these people that have it on disc

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
that wouldn't necessarily qualify unless maybe they, I don't know,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
do some type of like my Nintendo registrations,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
although that's all gone.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I don't know.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
It's so weird that you say that, you know,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
and how that they have different systems that are capable of different things

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
that you purchase one game on, you get to play it on all of them,

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
like both Xbox and Sony have.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
So that the fact that they're not able to do this with, you know,

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
the 3DS Wii U and Switch is kind of stupid.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So they can get my discounted rate of

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
I don't give a shit about their fucking virtual console at that point.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Well, we'll see.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm willing to let this just kind of sit for a while

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
because Nintendo hasn't talked about online.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
We'll find out.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
You know, we just don't know.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
We've got, this is all off three and a half minutes,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
but at least it's something finally.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Let's talk about battery life

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
because you're going to have battery life in the stupid little Joy-Cons.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
You have battery life in the actual system itself.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's going to be a mess.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Couldn't they all charge each other?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Couldn't that dock charge everything?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Right. That's what I'm thinking it's going to do.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And then the system would charge that.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And then when they showed the two Joy-Cons

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
plugged into that grip thing,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I'm assuming that has a battery in it as well.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
All the batteries.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
All the batteries!

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
The Nintendo battery!

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
The Nintendo battery Switch!

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
I'm pretty sure a nice, good charge will take care of all that, though.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
What else do we want to talk about on the Switch here real quick?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Because there's a lot of news that's kind of like follow up to this as well, right?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
We heard about...

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
It's based off of NVIDIA Tech,

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
so they're the ones doing the processing design and everything.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So the Tegra thing is true.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
It's a new Tegra, not the one that runs other stuff.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
So that's pretty cool.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
So it'll be interesting to see what that can push out.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Confirmed no backwards compatibility with Wii U,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
because there's no disk drive.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Or 3DS.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Not a thing either.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I have to admit,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
see, here's the tricky thing for me is that

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm actually viewing the Switch as a portable successor.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
And believe me, I know full well that Nintendo has said,

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
no, we still plan to support 3DS, and this is the console.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
But I don't know if I believe it, per se.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Is that coming from the marketing side, or is that coming from, like, Miyamoto?

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
They'll support it while there's people buying the system, that's it.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
I mean, because the DS will support it for a long time.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Yeah, it's also one of those things where it's like,

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
well, we'll support the Nintendo 64 after the GameCube comes out,

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
but not for very long.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
See, what I would want to see with, like...

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I don't want to see the 3DS continuing.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Well, I want to see with the Switch, like, ideally what I would have liked the trailer to show me is,

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
like, why that system being portable is innovative.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
You know, other than, oh, I can take it with me.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Cool, I guess.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
But, like, if they showed me, like, hey, I can take this Pokémon game,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
and I pop it off, and it has GPS built into the system,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
and I can walk around and catch Pokémon or something like that,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
like Pokémon Go or something, and then come back and, you know,

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
it adds, like, gameplay to that, not just I can take the same game with me somewhere else.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I mean, that's... I don't know.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Let's see, looking in chat for more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I'm sorry, I love this one.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
Dungeon Buster says, I just hope they don't source Samsung for the batteries.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
That's a good one, I like that.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Then that whole portable playing on the plane thing isn't going to happen

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
if Samsung does those batteries.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I heard that they actually had kiosks in airports to try to get you to turn those in,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
if you haven't already, so that's kind of funny.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Oh my gosh, all right.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Let's see, what else is there?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Stoppy says, I'd say it's like Game Boy to Game Boy Color.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
They're going to support it for a long time with lots of cross and backwards compatibility.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
But I don't think... I think it was...

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Somebody has said that that cartridge slot is not going to hold the 3DS cart.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Like, it's different, right?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah, it looked different.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
So, I don't know if we have the firm details on that,

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
but don't assume just because there's a cartridge slot on it that it's playing 3DS stuff.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
And maybe that's another reason why I kind of view it as a successor to the portable market,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
because it is doing the portable cartridges that I'm used to at this point,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and they kind of got rid of the disk thing.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Like, I don't know, I just...

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Well, it can't really do 3DS, because, I mean, how would you do that?

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
I mean, I guess you would turn the system vertically or sideways.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt also says,

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
I do see this as a portable experience, like tablet mobile and not a home console.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And then, let's see, AlphaCananagram says,

25:07.000 --> 25:15.000
Nintendo Switch is what the PS Vita should have done better when continuing console games on the go.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
That's probably a really good point, like, because didn't the Vita kind of...

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I seem to remember 1E3, they were doing some type of dungeon crawler,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
and the guy, like, paused in the middle of it and kind of continued it on the Vita,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
so they were kind of showing that a little bit.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
But we didn't really see a lot of that fully realized, right?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Not really.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
So this is maybe taking that a step further, right?

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
What else do we need to talk about with the Nintendo Switch,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
with the follow-up news that came out after this?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't know, that's pretty much it.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I mean, there's still a lot we don't know about it yet.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Okay.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Any games that you're hoping to see Nintendo announce,

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
like, anything that you would like them to unveil, Loki, that would move you into the fan column?

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Well, I'm always for remasters of games that are actually, I thought, pretty good,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
like on the Wii and stuff, for example.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I love a new Excite Truck game.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
I'm not talking Excite Bots, because fuck them for that game.

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
I mean, seriously, whoever the asshole that thought putting mini-games in the middle of a fucking race is,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I want to kill him.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I want to strangle the fucker to death.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
I mean, it's just the dumb, it made no fucking sense at all.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
So I love a new remaster of, like, an Excite Truck game, because that was actually fun,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
and I really enjoyed that.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I think that'd be cool.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Or how about fucking F-Zero?

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
If we're going to talk about racing, let's talk about fucking F-Zero.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
F-Zero would be cool.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
F-Zero.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
That's how many of those games we've seen in the past decade.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Fucking Zero, and it's really irritating me.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
That would be cool.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
You know, a new Metroid would be nice.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Let's see.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Each Ben Mias sharing an article saying,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Nintendo did confirm no DS and 3DS compatibility.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Sharing an article there.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I thought I had read something like that.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
MXC in chat at live.vognetwork.com saying,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm curious as to the storage size of the game cartridges.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Given the ridiculous sizes of some modern games,

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
it'll need to be decently large as compared to the 8GB and 4GB game sizes

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
of 3DS and Vita respectively.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Those cards ought to be 32GB, don't you think?

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
That would seem like a relatively, at this point, inexpensive size

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
that's going to hold a lot of data, right?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I think we need to be pretty big, yeah.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
And speaking of pretty big,

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
let's hope that they're not fucking retarded with the stupid onboard storage

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and giving us 32GB again.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Because they can go fuck themselves with their 32GB.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I have a feeling that...

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Well, well, well.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Okay, tinfoil hat.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Could the dock have some of that storage?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Wow, that would be so useful when I take it to go!

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh wait, I can't access my storage because it's a fucking home!

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
What if there's some type of portable memory or something?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I don't know, maybe that's too complicated,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
but my concern is because it is something you're taking with you on the go,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
you're not going to have exactly a terabyte.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And the fact that all the games are cartridges now.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I'm not asking for a terabyte. Fucking 256GB or 128GB.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Is that too much to ask?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It might be.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I mean, depending on the size of the games, obviously.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
But if it's anything like the Wii U,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
after two or three games on there,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
it's like, oh, sorry, you gotta get external storage now.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
That's retarded.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
I mean, I don't even know how many games I have on my PlayStation 4 right now.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And those are Blu-Ray games.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
And I've got, like, at least 20 games on there.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Let's see, a couple other thoughts here at Live.FogNetwork.com.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
StellarRose412 says, would they maybe have the SD card like the 3DS?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I suppose that's a possibility.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Who knows? Especially with it, and a lot of people, multiple people saying,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
how cheap that type of storage is.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
So I suppose anything is possible, right?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
That would be nice.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
And again, maybe something where you could put it on the dock

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
and have more memory.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
I think that might just be too complicated for most people. Who knows?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Anyway, we're going to shift gears here a little bit.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm sure there will be plenty more to talk about on the Nintendo Switch

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
in the coming weeks.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
But we want to go back and talk about PC gaming for a little bit here

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
before we get into our gaming weeks.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Because we're going to talk about a PC game that's available on Steam right now.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
And it's a game called Cat President.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
And we're getting on the line right now.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Paul from, oh, Rock Studios.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
And he's going to be joining us to talk about the game Cat President.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And we're trying to get him on the line right now.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And I think he's there. Hey, Paul. You there?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Hello. Hey, how's it going?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Great. Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Hey, thank you very much. I'm very happy to be here.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
We are very happy to have you.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
This is an interview that's been a long time coming

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
ever since we first spotted your game on Steam.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
So I'm glad you could be here, especially on such a large week

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
with the whole Switch reveal and all that stuff.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Surely you're watching that as a gamer, right?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Oh, yeah. I'm paying a little attention.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
I mean, my main and only thought that I had while watching that video was

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm going to lose all of those parts immediately.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Just right out of the box. They're going to go under the couch.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
They're gone.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
No, considering like everything is detachable.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Or bringing this back to cats.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
If anyone has cats like my cat, you leave that on the floor.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
That shit is under the couch.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
That's a damn good point, Logan.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
All right. So, Paul, tell us about your game, Cat President.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
Yes, okay. It's a visual novel.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
People have compared it to Hataful Boyfriend.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
I don't see the comparison personally, but you know, that's fine.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
It's a visual novel about the presidential election

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
and presidential politics, except that all of the candidates are cats

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
and there's a very good chance that you will fall in love with them.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
Just like you do the pigeons in Hataful Boyfriend.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I think that's probably why you're getting the comparisons.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I guess I can kind of see it. I don't know.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Well, Hataful Boyfriend is also one of the more well-known visual novels.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah, and we kind of copped their art style.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But other than that, totally different.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
Speaking of copping things, I need to clear something up here

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
for our listeners and some folks who have been listening to the show a long time.

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
Paul, was any of this inspired by a Wii title from a few years ago?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
No, it wasn't. The first time I even heard about President Cat,

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
I'm ashamed to say was in the very first review of Cat President that came out,

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
which was on a major website and had some very unfavorable comparisons.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
It was a great review. It sounded like that Cat President was the worst thing

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
that had ever happened to this person in their entire life.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
That's not nice.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Well, it happens.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Well, first off, I didn't realize that that review was on a major website.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
So first off, that just proves major websites are listening to this show,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
so watch what you say, Loki.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
They all say you've been out of shape if that's going to make their life miserable

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
just like playing a game.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Although I also feel kind of bad because you had no idea.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And to be fair, the President Cat thing was years ago,

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
and I knew when your game came out that obviously this has been a crazy freaking year

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
when it comes to elections, so of course somebody made a game

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
that is somewhat inspired by the electional stuff.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
And who doesn't love cats?

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Well, to be clear, I do hold you 100% responsible for that review.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Well, wait a minute. We're going to blame Jamie.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
She's the one that translated it, and she's not here.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
So when in doubt, blame the one that's not here.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Okay, that's fair. Okay. I can accept that.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I'm going to redirect those complaints to Dark Soccer.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
All right, well, I'm sorry to hear that the review invoked some internet fuckery thing

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
that we started, but that person just needs to get over it, I suppose.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
But to be clear, also, your game is not action or minigames

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
or any of that stuff that we saw with Sukiban Sochowrenawe,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
which was the President Cat stuff.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
This is a visual novel game.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah, pure text-based decision-making.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
You have a lot of dialogue.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Basically, you decide whether you're going to be nice to the candidate or mean to the candidate,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
and your reactions kind of determine whether you get the good ending

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
where you get to live happily ever after with your new cat friend,

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
or if they fire you, you die, stuff like that.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Is this the first game that you've done?

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
No, it's the first game we've released on Steam.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
We've released a few other small visual novels on itch.io,

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
one called My Nigerian Prince, another kind of romance-themed game

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
about falling in love with an internet scammer,

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
and one called Francie Drew, which is a mystery parody of Nancy Drew.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
But I also released an FMV game last year,

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
written, directed, starred, camera work, everything 100% by me, black and white game,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
about an awkward person trying to answer his front door

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
when there's someone outside and he doesn't know who it is.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Those all sound awesome.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I know. You have a great sense of humor.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
These all sound amazing.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Thank you.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
I hope those major websites that are clearly listening to this program,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I hope they discover your shit through this,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
because it sounds like you've got some genius.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
The My Nigerian Prince thing, that is funny.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
That is really funny. I'm going to check that out.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
To be fair, I can't claim 100% credit for that,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
or Cat President for that matter.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
I work with a partner who does a lot of the writing.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm focused more on the coding, the copy editing, and the cat photoshopping.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Okay, fair enough. So when I say you, I mean your studio. Fair enough.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
And some folks in chat over at live.fognetwork.com

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
already finding the link there for My Nigerian Prince.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
Well, let's talk about Cat President, though, the one that is on Steam.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
So you actually went the Steam Greenlight route with this, right?

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, it was a learning experience.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Putting a game through Steam Greenlight,

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
pretty much you're never going to be bothered by,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
let's say, negative feedback ever again,

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
because you're just going to get tons and tons of comments

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
about how terrible your game is, how you're ruining Steam.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
It's like immersion therapy for people being terrible on the internet, basically.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
If you can get through that without just flipping out, deleting it,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
throwing your computer in the garbage,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
you can take anything at that point.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Paul, how do you feel that you personally are the reason

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
we don't have Half-Life 3?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Oh, it's 100%.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Oh, I take full credit for ruining Steam.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
If Steam is in the crap hole now, that's my fault.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That's absolutely true.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
So what inspired?

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I know you said that you have another guy that you work with

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
that did a lot of the writing, but what inspired this game?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
What inspired you to be the Cap President?

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
My friend, he plays a lot of Japanese dating sims on his phone,

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
and he started to notice that there were a lot of comparisons

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
that you could draw between candidates in the presidential election

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
and the type of bows that you have in Japanese dating sims.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
You have the nice guy, the guy who shouts a lot,

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
the young candidate, the pervert,

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
and that made him think that we could do something with that.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
So we started talking on Twitter about the idea,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
and then I said, hey, can we make them all cats?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And the rest is history.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
That's outstanding. I love that.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
And you guys have a new game that you're doing this coming week, right?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Yes, yes. Thank you so much for bringing that up.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
I have a game that's completely different from everything else I just mentioned.

36:27.000 --> 36:33.000
It's a retro-style point-and-click adventure game called The Beard in the Mirror,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
heavily inspired by old Sierra games, LucasArts games,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
the kind of stuff I grew up playing

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
and the stuff that made me want to get into game development in the first place.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
My wife and I have actually built this one together.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
We've been working on it.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
Basically, the entirety of our adult lives,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
this game has existed in the background for us,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
and it's finally coming out, and we couldn't be...

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
I don't know if happy is the right word,

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
but more relieved, certainly, that we finally finished it.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
I can't help but notice in your Skype little picture

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
that you yourself have a beard, and this game is called The Beard in the...

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Is this some type of biography?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
To be fair, the main character's name is also Paul,

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
but no, my wife started making the game by herself

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
before we even started dating, actually,

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
and she wanted to put me in the game.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
We talked a bunch of times about,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
should we change the character's name? Is this getting too weird?

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
But as the game progressed, as we wrote more,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
as we kind of figured out who the character was,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
he just kind of became his own person.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
He's his own character, so yeah.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
But Beard does play a significant role in the game.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I'm not going to say any more than that.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
All right, fair enough.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
I was going to say, tell me a little more about the plot,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
but is it too spoilery to tell me much more about the game?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah, pretty much.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
I'm so bad at elevator pitches.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I'm the worst salesman in general.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I'm happy to say, here's my game.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
If you like it, that's great.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
If not, oh well, that's fine.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Maybe you'll find another game you like.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Who cares?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
No, it's, like I said, a retro point-and-click adventure game.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
The character is awoken in the middle of the night

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
by a mysterious woman who thinks that he should remember him.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
She's like, Paul, Paul, wake up.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Don't you know who I am?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Blah, blah, blah.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
And then he wakes up, opens his front door.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
There's a forest out there where there was previously a hallway,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
and then the rest of the game is kind of figuring out

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
what the hell's going on

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
and figuring out what this person kind of wants to do with his life.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
How have you developed your games?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And if you guys have questions for Paul,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
of course our chat room is wide open for questions

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
What tools are you using to develop?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Because I find that interesting that you've been doing a lot of visual novels,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
but you're making a very radical switch now

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
into a point-and-click adventure game.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So what have you been using to develop?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Oh, yeah, sure.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
We use a couple of different free tools.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
I mean, we use the same thing a lot of beginning studios,

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
beginning developers use.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
We use Ren'Py for visual novels

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
and AGS, Adventure Game Studio,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
for the point-and-click adventure game.

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
Basically, stuff that requires a minimal knowledge of actual coding involved

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
to be perfectly frank.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I don't know that without this kind of software,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I could code my way out of a paper bag.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Well, I think that's totally okay

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
because everybody has to kind of start somewhere on one hand,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
and I think there's a lot of huge games.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
Isn't Five Nights at Freddy's from one of those types of software

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
where you can do it?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
I think so, yeah, yeah.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
And a lot of them,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
I don't know if you've ever heard of a company called Wadjet Eye Games.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
They do a lot of point-and-click adventure games like we're working on,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
and all of their stuff is the same program that we use,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Adventure Game Studio.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I think that stuff is just,

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
and even when you look at something that's quote-unquote serious like Unity,

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
there's a lot of plug-and-play components to Unity, right, Loki?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Well, yeah.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Oh, no, it doesn't matter what you use to get there

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
as long as it's what the end product is, really.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Exactly, for sure, for sure.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Yeah, I mean, I just think it's great.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
We live in a world right now where anyone who can just wake up and say,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I want to make a game,

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
and they can just download some free tools online and do it.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Like 20 years ago, I mean, I can tell you,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
in high school when I started studying this stuff,

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
I was like, wow, I'm really wicked bad at this.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
There's a lot of math.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And I would never have become a game developer

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
if there weren't such easy tools to let you dip your toes in

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
and just figure out what you're even doing.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
I think it's great that we live in that kind of world now.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
All right, let's get to some questions from our chatroom

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
live.vog.network.com.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
SSG100Matt is asking,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
where did you get the cat or animal pictures that are,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
because if I remember right, I saw a dog that was wearing cat ears.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Yeah, so the cat pictures actually, it's fun.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
I put out the call on Facebook asking for friends to submit cute pictures

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
of their cats to put in the game.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
And I mean, it was like I was George Bailey at the end of

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It's a Wonderful Life with cat photos, just tons,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
like cat photos just raining from the heavens.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
The one advice that I could offer to any aspiring game developer out there

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
is to put your friend's cat in your game,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
because then they will have to tell everyone about it.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It's a great promotional tool.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
You know what's hilarious about that, and I know he's listening,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
or will be listening on the podcast later this week.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
We have a friend of the show who also does development

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
who's also doing a game through Steam Greenlight

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
that just got greenlit right now, our buddy YYR.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
And he put a game out on the Xbox Indie Games called Bungee Ferret Tossing.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
And he did something very similar because he had all these

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
exploding ferrets in the game.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
He didn't want people to think that it was actually advocating

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
violence against animals.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
So in the very beginning of the game, he puts this PSA about

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
please don't hurt animals.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
And he solicited pictures of everybody's animals.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And I think a very similar thing happened.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
And that's how my cat got in a video game.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Aww.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
So there it is.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Yes, and that's just a 100 Matt and Chad says,

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
the internet is filled with cat pictures.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Ragenator in chat, by the way, saying,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
yeah, anyone can make a game except Loki.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
He starts making them, but then can't complete them.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Wow.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Hey, I could complete it just fine.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
It would just be a piece of garbage and, you know,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I don't want to release a piece of garbage.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
So, I mean, hey, if you want me to release what I have right

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
now for that game, by all means, I could do that.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Maybe a broken piece of garbage.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
And I really don't feel like I want to release that.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking,

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
any plan for a cats versus dogs game or a game wholly

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
about bacon?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I don't know if that means you're going to do a cats

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
versus pigs game, but is there more?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Is there time for more cats later on, Paul,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
or is this like an idea that, no, you're one and done?

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
I mean, we've tossed around the idea of doing some DLC

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
episodes starring some of the minor candidates of the game,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
or maybe doing a full sequel, maybe to align with the next

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
presidential election.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
But that hasn't really gotten beyond the us tweeting ideas

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
at one another stage as of yet.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
There are some dogs in the game, though,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
and I actually stuck my pet bunny rabbits in as vice

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
presidential candidates as well.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
I was very, very happy to be able to do that.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Oh, that's amazing.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
All right, one more call for questions over at our chat room

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
And I notice Akdeft is saying a cat president to reelection.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
So they're already pitching you ideas over there.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Oh, I'm going to have to make sure to check that out then

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
because we don't have a lot of ideas yet.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
So you're going to be releasing the beard in the mirror game

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
really soon.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Have you thought about, you know,

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
as these games are starting to sell on Steam and you're kind

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
of getting more and more, you've kind of moved from itch.io

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
to Steam and so forth.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
Are you looking at trying to maybe expand even more,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
potentially trying to get into places like the console market?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Is that something on your radar?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
No, not yet.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
I'm pretty happy making my small weirdo games at the moment,

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
to be honest.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
I really like the ease of access on the computer.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
I really like just how simple and straightforward everything

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
is.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Like I said, I'm still someone who's kind of learning how to

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
do all of this on the fly.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
So not at the moment.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
I did release, you mentioned Xbox indie games a few minutes

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
ago.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
I did have a point-and-click adventure game I released there

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
several years ago back when the indie games channel was still a

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
thing called Life in the Dorms,

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
a comedic game about trying to make friends in college,

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
basically.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Semi-autobiographical.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
I was going to say a lot of these games kind of seem based

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
on potential real-life scenarios that then spiral way out of

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
control when you sit next to a computer.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
And now that just makes me even wonder even more where Cat

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
President comes from.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
Well, it came from the time my cat ran for president.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Just print, just when they, when they bury this show,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
just print that on the tombstone,

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
that little exchange right there.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Just print that on the tombstone.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Let's see.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
And look, our chatters are, instead of asking questions,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
they're just throwing around ideas for sequels.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
StellaRose412 says, Cat President 2, the empty podium one.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
I don't understand.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Cat President 2, impeachment.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
The dog party tries to ouster the current cat president and

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
replace with their own candidate.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
You could have, you could have instead of the governator,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
because that fricking happened in California,

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
instead of the governator, it could be like the puppy-nator.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Or how about this?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Cat President 2, the hunt for Mysis.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Oh, no.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
That might be getting a little too real for us.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Shut it down.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
We're done.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Thanks for listening.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Good night, everybody.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Let's see.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
We have a rage-inator saying, Cat President 2,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
make catnip great again.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Isn't catnip already awesome though?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I don't think, maybe what Dungeon Buster says a little

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
more along those lines.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I tried catnip, but I didn't inhale.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
So many great ideas there, but Paul,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
we're going to leave the ideas and the execution to you guys.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
It really sounds like you guys are very clever and creative

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
and have created some visual novels that I hope people will

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
give a read or a play, if you will.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
So one more kind of shout out.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Where can we follow you?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Where can we find these games?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Where can we track what's coming up from O'Rock Studios?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, sure.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
You can find me on Twitter.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
I'm on there kind of constantly, at Paul M. Franzen.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
You can follow our group.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Also on Twitter at O, at O'Rock Studios.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
We have O'Rock.com where it kind of has a link to all of our games.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
And our whole library of games is basically between itch.io and Steam.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
So that's all there.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
All right, well I really wish you the best of luck.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
And you know, because we could not have President Cat in the States

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
because for some reason they just didn't think it would do well here.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It's pretty common because it didn't do well in Japan either.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
Well, I still say, I never saw the receipts on that.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
But anyway, I want to say thank you for making a presidential cat a reality at least.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
At least in one way or another we do have presidential cats as a reality

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
even if really we had nothing to do with it

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
and we're really just causing you problems because of it.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I'm still thankful, so.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
Hey, we still got a review on a major website at least, so.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Hey, that works.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And the last thought here, and I'll let you go.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
ActDeft is suggesting Cat President 2, grab them by the human.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
Okay, wait, that's actually really good.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
And I'm going to write that down.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
There you go, all right, look at that.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Look at that, ActDeft, you might be a star.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
You better go trademark that before Paul gets to it.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
All right, all joking aside, Paul, thank you so much for being here.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I really appreciate it and best of luck.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
And we're going to keep an eye on you and what's coming out of your studio

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
since it sounds like you have some really hilarious stuff

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
and hopefully we'll have you back on the show sometime.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
That sounds great, thank you so much for having me.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
All right, no problem, take care.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Bye.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Bye.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
All right, again, that is Cat President, the beard in the mirror.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
And what was the Nigerian prince?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
My Nigerian prince.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
My Nigerian prince, that's pretty awesome.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
That's great.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
Dungeon Buster was a fan of that interview saying great interview,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
love how they came up with the idea for the game.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
Yeah, I did not realize there was, I mean, obviously I did a little research

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and I knew he had a new game coming out,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
but somehow I missed that he had these other games about the Nigerian prince.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
That's funny, so good sense of humor over there.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Best of luck to them as it develops.

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
And I also love the message there that, yes, anybody can make a game

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
and that there's tools out there to do it and so forth.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
And, you know, I think doing a visual novel would be fun.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Maybe I can handle a visual novel.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Probably.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
I wouldn't have to do physics.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Physics is where gaming gets scary.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Well.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
Of course, I have a good friend that does physics for video games,

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
but I just, it's still scary.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I will see, kind of go back on like anything done

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
because, you know, it's seriously, it's a mental thing.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
I've been trying to get something done, you know,

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
and trying to figure out how I'm mentally going to be able to focus on something.

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
And so I found what my problem has been is not that the scope is too big

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
because I don't give a shit about the size of the scope.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It's about the pieces.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
I'm like, you know, already thinking about how I'm going to optimize an engine

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
before I even build an engine, which is stupid.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
So what I decided is I'm going to just break it down into incredibly small pieces.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
Like, today we're going to make something that I can move in a grid.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Done.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
You know, and tomorrow we'll make something that, you know,

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
I can spawn blocks in a grid and go.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
I mean, that's because those smaller chunks I'm able to focus on

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
instead of like, crap, I've got to figure out how I'm going to make this like engine run

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
and I've got to figure out everything before I even start programming.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
No, it's not going to work that way.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
All right, well, I should look into these visual novel development software

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
that he was talking about there.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Maybe I can do my dream visual novel game.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
Yeah, the one you're thinking about for Five Nights at Freddy's is Click Team Fusion.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
And they just had that on Humble Bundle not too long ago.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
Let's see, I'm going to do a visual novel, The Co-host Who Couldn't Love Nintendo.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I think I'll do that. I think I'll do that as a visual novel.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
That is so untrue.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I loved Nintendo one time.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
It's just, unfortunately, Nintendo started doing all this weird shit,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
got into some weird crowds, and just...

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
It's hanging out with the wrong cat.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
It's not the same Nintendo that I used to know a long time ago.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
So, best of luck again.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
And the beard in the mirror, it looks like our chat room is actually checking that out on Steam right now,

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
and it is out this Tuesday, so a very timely interview there.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
And for our podcast audience, most of you will probably hear this when that game is live,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
so go check that out on Steam.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I'm sure you can just put it in the search box and you can find that.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Cat president. But My Nigerian Prince is over on itch.io, so check that out over there.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Alright, we're going to get into our gaming weeks before we get into gaming news.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
So, let's talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week. Loki.

50:36.000 --> 50:48.000
So, my big gaming week was because on Monday, I decided I'm going to pick up a PlayStation VR, and so I did.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
Oh, so after the show last week, you ended up being kind of sold on VR.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
Yeah, so I picked it up and I actually dig it quite a bit.

50:56.000 --> 51:05.000
You know, the control issues that I've seen and stuff, a lot of it's not so bad, but it is kind of broken a little bit.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.000
For example, there's a really bad problem that they have with the screen drifting.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
So, you'll be playing a game and it's slowly drifting to the left for no reason.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
It's just the issue with the tracking and it's a software issue, which is weird.

51:20.000 --> 51:29.000
I think from what I've heard, it's because you're close to being outside of the distance that the camera can pick you up in or something like that.

51:29.000 --> 51:36.000
And when you're kind of on the outside of that, if you go more towards the center that it's able to pick you up a little bit better.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
Because I know the way my couch is, which my room is not all that big that I play it in my living room.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I thought I'd be able to sit comfortably on the couch and be able to play it just fine.

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
But apparently it's just like a few inches shy of being too far away from the camera, which is really silly.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
I almost feel like Bobby was talking about that exact same problem on his show last week.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
He was talking almost about a very similar thing.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
That he had to get to sit forward on the couch.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
Right, yeah, exactly. And I had to scoot the couch up a little bit.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
And I'm always worried to do that because my cat's a retard and she will go behind the couch and lay there or something.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
And then I'll scoot the couch back and crush her to the death.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
So, I mean, I always gotta watch out for the cat trying to kill herself.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
But, no, I played, and once again, you know, thank you Shane.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
He's our pusher for when it comes to the gaming stuff.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Yeah, SSG100Matt in chat calling that out.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Shane's hero's power of making people buy things got to Loki.

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
It's not him that got me to buy it. It's trying it that got me to buy it.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
Because if I had tried it, probably at Best Buy, I probably would have picked it up.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
I wouldn't have cancelled my pre-order. I would have just had to find some way to be able to pay for it.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
So I did pick up, ironically enough, I picked up Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

52:53.000 --> 53:00.000
Which, honestly, that is not a game I'm remotely, like a genre that I'm remotely interested in at all.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
I don't like horror games at all. But this game is fucking awesome.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
So I don't know. It's just weird. It's a shooting gallery game that's like,

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
my best comparison is it's Toy Story Mania meets Saw is basically what it is.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
See, I would like to play the Toy Story Mania game because Shane did make me play that finally.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
I think it was after the show I finally sat down and played that game and I had to stop.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
Like, there was just too many jump scares and I was not, I was not having it.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Really? I didn't see it. There wasn't that many jump scares for me.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Okay, but you know he picked the course that was the worst one.

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
And that, to the opposite of Shane's power or whatever you want to call it, that is the worst thing to do.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
If he knows I don't like scary games, he should have started me on a soft-

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
They did have some jump scares, but like, it was more of like, you got me. That's pretty funny.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
You know, like, you know it's like something's gonna jump out and stuff.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Like, there was, like I played through about three of the levels so far in Rush of Blood.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
So the first one you start off, and I think that's the one you had me play here,

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
is basically you're going through everything and then you gas at the end.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
And so they're kind of teaching the mechanics of the game and stuff and shooting.

54:07.000 --> 54:13.000
So the second level is the one that they have in the actual demo on the PlayStation VR disc,

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
which is basically this thing where you go into a slaughterhouse type thing,

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
and all of a sudden all the pigs come alive and start squealing and the saw is going up.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
That was the stage he made me play. It was gross.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Yeah, with the dolls and stuff like that, and like, it's kind of creepy.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
The third stage is like a ghost stage.

54:29.000 --> 54:35.000
And so they've basically got this woman that's shooting crows at you a lot of the time.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
And so you have to kind of shoot those away.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
But there's one part that's pitch black that you're going through with these mannequins.

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
It's like the Silent Hill Nurses almost. Like, the mannequins move when you're not looking at them.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
And they kind of, like, creep up in your face and stuff. So that was kind of creepy but fun.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
It's an entertaining type game, and I've actually had quite a bit of fun just playing that.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
The other game I picked up was Job Simulator, which, it's a fun game to mess around with,

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
and my son likes playing it even though he is too short for that game.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
So, like, that's one of the things I don't really like about PlayStation VR,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
and this is basically a software thing.

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
The calibration stuff is not always easy to get to in the middle of a game.

55:16.000 --> 55:24.000
Like, when I was trying to adjust it for him, you know, you can raise and lower the floor so that you're taller or shorter, depending on what that is.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
And I really wish they had a way to kind of calibrate that, like they do, I think, with the Vive,

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
where you put a controller on the floor, put a controller on top of your head or something like that so they know your height,

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
and kind of scale everything based on that, or at least make you taller based on that.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Because that would have been really helpful, because I just kind of had to wing it to see if he would be tall enough.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
And even still, when I did it uncalibrated, he's like, okay, you got to take the paper out of the thing.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
He's like trying to reach up and grab the paper, and it's just too far away.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
Or, oh, you got to get a coffee cup to fill it with coffee, and he couldn't reach the top shelf, which is pretty funny.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
But it's a fun game, but I think it's something, and I kind of was worried about when I bought it, too,

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
that I'm going to get bored with really fast.

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
Like, you play it through all the levels like once or twice, and you're just like, okay, I've seen everything there is to see in this.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
So I was a little bit worried of that.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
I did play a lot of the demos, though, that were on the demo disc.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
So like one of the ones I liked was Drive Club.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
A lot of people say that that makes them sick.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
I never had a problem with motion sickness in that game, though.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
What I did find funny, though, about it is it's a game that you're supposed to be sitting down in.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
And so I didn't do that.

56:29.000 --> 56:36.000
I stood up or moved my head to the side, so it's like I had my head sticking out of the top of the roof or out the side window and stuff.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
That was kind of silly.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
But the game does look like shit graphically.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
It's just not pretty, but it's all right.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
The one game I really liked the demo for was Eve Valkyrie.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Totally would play that if it was a single-player game.

56:52.000 --> 56:59.000
But I hear the single-player campaign is 30 bucks, the game is $60, and it's a multiplayer game, and I'm not playing that.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
But the demo is so fucking awesome.

57:02.000 --> 57:11.000
It's just like, man, if this was Colony Wars or something like that, that was a single-player campaign that was several hours long, I would totally be down for this.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
But it's just, no, I'm not really into playing a multiplayer online game like that.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I played Rigs, which is all right.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Same kind of thing with that.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It was all right.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
It was kind of fun to play.

57:24.000 --> 57:30.000
It would be more fun like an Armored Core-type game, but I just don't want to play a multiplayer online game.

57:30.000 --> 57:38.000
I just am not really interested in that, especially with VR and being kind of not entirely twitchy enough.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
I guess it's not that sensitive, but I don't know.

57:41.000 --> 57:49.000
The Eve Valkyrie demo, man, even just playing it, you just get so psyched when you're playing it, but it's so short.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
I'm just not going to drop $60 for that short of a campaign, though.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
It's kind of unfortunate.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
I didn't end up playing Rez.

57:59.000 --> 58:05.000
I thought about picking up Rez, but once again, I think that's something, once I play through it, I'm going to be done with it.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
That's kind of how I was with the old Rez.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
And PlayStation Worlds is just a tech demo, so no, I'm not picking that up either.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You've got to try Thumper, though, if you haven't.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Thumper looked cool.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I may try that.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I don't know.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
That might be something I may pick up.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I'm just going to wait to see what more stuff comes out for it.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
I know there's some rollercoaster games and stuff later on that might be kind of fun, but yeah, I'm very hopeful for it.

58:29.000 --> 58:35.000
I hope that these tracking issues that they have maybe will be patched out eventually, so I'm hopeful for that.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Otherwise, the move controllers work okay.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
It does have some trouble, especially in Job Simulator, where you can kind of turn all the way around.

58:42.000 --> 58:51.000
Obviously, it has trouble tracking the move controllers when they're behind you, so you have some weird stuff that happens with that, but it wasn't terrible.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It was all right.

58:53.000 --> 59:00.000
Maya in chat says, VR is one of the first times in my life I felt old and cantankerous and uninterested in tech progress in video games.

59:00.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah, I'm a little on that side where it's the whole, after I play it for 20 minutes, I need a break.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
That's what I'm worried about with it.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Oh, I played it for several hours and it wasn't a problem.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
Wow. I saw the VR available at Target, so it's not sold out everywhere.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
No, it's not.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I thought about it.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
GameStop in white is, I just checked to see if they had it on the show.

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
I checked to see if any of them had it nearby and one did, so I picked it up and that was that.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
Yeah, I mean, it's not terribly hard to find.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
It may be okay to wait a little bit because there's not a whole ton of games out for right now.

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
If some of these multiplayer games aren't really what you're looking for, you might want to wait.

59:41.000 --> 59:48.000
I know they're supposed to be adding a VR mode to TrackMania, which that I can see is vomit-inducing,

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
but I do want to play that because TrackMania was an awesome game.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
That's weird that you say there's not a lot of games when that list we read the other week was gigantic.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
There's a lot of one-trick pony-type games, right?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It's also coming soon stuff and a lot of them are just like, for example, the Star Wars one that they have with Battlefront.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's just a patch to Battlefront, so if you own Battlefront, you get that.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But I'm not paying $60 for a tech demo.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
All right, fair enough. A good question here before we move on.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
SSJ100Matt says, did Mrs. Loki or the kids try it out?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Yeah, my wife tried it out. I put her on the PlayStation Worlds demo that they had,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
so it's basically the C1 where they drop you down in a cage and you're kind of just drifting down looking at fish.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Actually, I think my youngest son would probably like that, but he didn't want to put the headset on.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
My oldest son, he wanted to try Job Simulator, but his hands are too small for the Move Controller,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
so he has a hard time reaching the triggers.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000
He still had fun with it, but it's just too hard for him to play, I think, because those controllers are too big for him.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And did Mrs. Loki go, I'm okay with you spending the money after playing the demo?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Oh no, I just told her that I sold my Oculus Rift to pay for it, which is what I'm going to do.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I just haven't quite done it in that order yet.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Okay, okay. All right.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Because honestly, my Rift, I haven't played it in a long time. It's just sitting in a bag, so you might as well sell it.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Sure.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Eventually I'll get a Vive or something and I don't need that.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Fair enough. All right, anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Just Singress. I've been trying to not play as much, but unfortunately I've played more, so yeah.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I kind of know those feels, but that's all right. Moving on to my gaming week.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Honestly, it's been a lot of the MMO space. I've still been playing World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV, kind of juggling those games,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
especially despite some of the things I was saying about Fan Fest last week.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Even though the event itself had issues, I still felt very motivated, and probably a lot of that was hanging out with some of my people that I play the game online with.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Just the general fact that I just think that game is really great, and it keeps expanding with these patches on things to do, so I've been still playing that.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I try not to completely lose sight of the consoles and stuff, but the one other game that did divert me for a little bit this week on PC,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
you know I had to check out Civilization VI.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Of course.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
It was released this weekend, so of course I had to check it out.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Now unfortunately I was out of town all day yesterday, and that would have normally been my time to spend some more quality time with a game that was released on Friday.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So I couldn't really spend a lot of time with Civ VI, but I played a little bit.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I have a tradition, as I've done with Civ V, and when the expansions came out for that, I will do a new game as the Queen of England, because that's how I always play Civilization.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So I started a new game in Civ VI as the Queen of England, and I have to say, I was kind of not ready for how different it feels.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And I realized that, okay, it's a sequel. They need to do some things that are different.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But even Civ V, I was like, okay, Civ V just feels like, you know, it's kind of like Civ IV, but now it's a lot of hexagons, and okay, they've changed some of the rules too.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
There's some other things.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000
But like Civ VI, I don't know what it is with the whole fact that, you know, now when you have your, they're not settlers, or not settlers, but workers are now builders.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And the builders, you can't just automate anymore. You have to kind of strategically choose what type of building goes in what square in your city,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and that's very new for a Civ game, and that really made me stop and think.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And then now, there's not just a tech tree, but like culture has a tree that's different from what it was in Civ V, where it was more like a talent tree.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Now it's like straight up enhancements as well.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So a lot of those differences really kind of left my head spinning, and I'm like, all right, I need to really roll this back and like start as a,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I know it asks you in the beginning of the game, are you new to games, are you new to the series, or are you new to Civilization?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And kind of tailors the tutorial built on that. I kind of feel like I need to go back and say, I'm new to all these games to really kind of get the stuff from the ground up,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
because I just felt, boy, I felt lost and out of it. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I still, I kind of actually think that's a good thing, that it's so different that it made me really stop and think.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But, you know, the presentation and everything, it still felt very Civ, and I know I'm going to have a lot of fun with this.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So I'm going to continue to explore this game, lol pun, in the coming days.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I just, I honestly maybe spent like an hour and a half tops with it the other day.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
So I feel like I'm not at a stage where I can really critique the game.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I can just say that, you know, wow, I was really kind of woo at first at how different it was from Civ 5.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But I'm also really looking forward to being able to play online with some other people and losing an entire weekend to Civilization 6,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
because that's what these games do to us.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I'm sure there will likely come a day where Bobby and I play that game for a very, very,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and maybe we can have, because I know Spike from Game Buoy and some of his friends,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I think First Mate Slidekick, I know they all played, we used to play Civ 5.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
So I'm sure we could set up some type of like VOG Hostathon.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I don't, when's the Extra Life event? I think Extra Life is the weekend I'm in Chicago, though.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But maybe kind of around that we could do some type of marathon event for a charity, some good cause.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
And it would be very easy to spend all day playing Civ 6.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Anyway, we'll have to check everybody's schedules and see if we can work something out.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Let's see, going into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Kaijuto says, I heard Civ 6 is horseshit.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Well, I didn't feel that from the first little bit that I played.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I did read a review online that said, it said something completely different than my first impression.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
The review I read said it's really similar to Civ 5.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And like, I didn't get that at all.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But maybe I didn't play, I mean, I played a bit of Civ 5.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But I didn't play it a long, long, long time like a lot of people did.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something there.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Let's see, DungeonBuster says, I won Civ 6, but I've been playing Shadow Warrior 2.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
SSG100Matt says, I forgot Civ 6 came out.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's for the best, I didn't get it right away.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Otherwise, I would turn around and realize that it's Tuesday and I still want to do one more turn.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And Kaijuto is saying, people are saying they turned Civ into a tablet game.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That was like Civilization Revolutions, wasn't it though?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Yeah, that was the tablet game.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
See, but here's the crazy thing.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
They also had Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And I really liked that game for what it was.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Like, I didn't see it as a tablet game so much as I saw it as like a...

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It was more like the original Civilization than anything else they'd put out around that time.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And because maybe I remember the original Civilization the best,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
and that's the one that really made me fall in love with the series,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
maybe that's why I'm a little bit partial to it, but I don't know.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I guess I could see though, I mean, if all you're using is your mouse for point and clicking,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I mean, you could probably do the same thing on a tablet.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But I didn't really walk away with that impression that like, oh, this was designed for an iPad.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Like, it seems to look better than that on my monitor.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I didn't walk away with that impression.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
So, SSG100Matt says, is it a different jump like Civ IV to Civ V to Civ Revolution,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
or Civ V to Civ Beyond Earth?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I would say for Civ VI, I would say it's kind of like...

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I guess Civ V to Beyond Earth is a decent comparison,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
but Beyond Earth was still in the Civ V engine, so there was a lot of feeling in that.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And this one is definitely, you know, they've kind of gone back and reinvented everything,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
but I would say that comparison is probably a little closer,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
because Civ IV and V were really stripped down for Civ Revolution,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
and I don't think this game's been stripped down at all.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So, anyway, that's my initial thoughts on a few quick minutes with Civilization VI.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So, let's get into some housekeeping, and then we'll get into the news.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
First, we will not be having a show on November 13th.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That's Veterans Day weekend. I will be out of town.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
However, we will be doing something, because we have to have an Episode 665 of some sort

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
to keep us on track to have Episode 666 on 20 November.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So, we will do something pre-recorded.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It just might be a shorter show, but it won't be live.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So, you folks that turn out here live, you'll undoubtedly get to hear something new

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
at 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock that night, depending on your time zone,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
but it won't be live, just so you know.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
or we are on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Gaming news, there was a lot of it. Let's get to it. Loki.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Yeah, so, apparently the SAG-AFTRA unit has officially called for a voice actor strike

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
against several gaming companies, including Activision, EA, and Take-Two.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000
They did say that this is due to, I guess, failing to renegotiate their contracts

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
with the terms that they wanted.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Basically, this could possibly affect games that went into production after February 17th of 2015.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
So, maybe some of these games that are on the slate for next year and stuff.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
That's kind of unfortunate.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I know that some of the names I saw on there, they had quite a few well-known voice actors

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
that are a part of that.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I know I saw Jennifer Hale on the list.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Will Wheaton had an article about it on his blog, even though I don't think,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
well, I guess he is participating in it one way or another,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
although he doesn't do a lot of voice acting.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I know he's done some for games.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So, yeah, it's definitely impacting.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
There was also a list out there of what games it impacts,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and it does not affect Mass Effect Andromeda,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
but I would imagine because the voice acting in that game has probably already been sealed up.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
They're not doing any more work on that.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
But if there were to be DLC to come for that game, then that would be at a pause,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
depending on how far they are with that.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
But I think a lot of us are hoping they work out these differences relatively quickly

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
so that this doesn't get...

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Right, because I remember the acting strike, or the writer strike that they had for TV and stuff,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
that kind of fucked up a lot of shit.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah, that killed the TV show Heroes. Remember that?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Yeah, well, season two kind of sucked too, but you know, that's here.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Well, that was the season that got abbreviated by the strike.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
It was supposed to go longer, but it didn't. Anyway.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Thank God they cut it short, put it out of its misery. Shit, man.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
What do you think? I've been reading a little bit on the strike,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
and our buddy Rama texted me to a Facebook post that a prominent voice actor has made,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
and I do get a lot of their concerns. I mean, especially when we talk about the whole fact that,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
you know, four hours of screaming, you know, and recording those voices,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
that is going to take a toll on the voice.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
You know, when we do this show here, you know, we can do this for three hours, but...

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I like the feeling of three hours of screaming sometimes.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Sometimes you do, and I don't know how your voice doesn't hurt the next day.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
But for the most part, maybe Loki aside, we're not sitting here screaming constantly

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
for the entire time the show is on.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But I will tell you this. You guys have all heard this show,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
is that you guys know that sometimes I host sometimes, and I do that type of stuff.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I host theater, specifically a lot of Rocky Horror,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
although that's going to be more cult movies in December.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But actually, funny enough, here in SAC, we have a Rocky Horror show coming up next week.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So I can tell you right now, when I host Rocky Horror on Saturday night,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000
that's not even three hours. That's like maybe 30 minutes of me having to use a very loud,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
boisterous voice while I'm doing the pre-show and doing some light stand-up

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and doing the initiations and things like that. That's like 30 minutes, maybe.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I will come in here on Sunday and my voice will sound like this.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Like, I will not have a good voice.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So I can't imagine doing something like that for, I mean, God, two hours, let alone four.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Especially if you're doing, like, weird voices and stuff. Who knows?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It's even harder when you change up your voice.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So a lot of those safety concerns I get, and I also understand a lot of the concerns

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
when it comes to the secrecy of the projects that are involved.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And they did make a very good point about, like, sometimes the things are so clamped down

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
that they can't really necessarily get a sense of what the character is and all this other stuff.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And so, I mean, reading the post made a lot of sense.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And the Wil Wheaton post is really good, too, in laying that all out there.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Now, I also, just so you know, I also can see a little bit of it from the other side

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
where they're saying, why should the actors get residual payments

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
when nobody else who works on the game and develops the game gets residual payments?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Yeah, I kind of, you know.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I don't know. And a lot of the response I feel like I'm seeing, at least based on comments,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
so take it with a grain of salt, but a lot of the response I'm seeing is,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
well, maybe those people need to ask for it, too.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I don't know. I can sort of see where the residual payment, like, I get that.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Especially, like, if you're marketing your game based on the fact that, let's say,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Mark Hamill is back doing The Joker, and that's a big selling point for your game,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
then, yeah, he's probably entitled to some residuals.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
But I'm not saying that the programmers and some of the people behind the scenes

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
don't necessarily deserve some of those as well.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
But I think the more immediate thing that they really need to figure out is some of these safety concerns.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You know, the safety with the motion capture, the safety with the four hours of screaming and all this stuff.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I do think there's a valid argument to be made there.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
This contract hasn't really been looked at since, what, the 90s?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
It was probably the last time they did this.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
When Tim Curry was starring in Gabriel Knight was how long ago, and not that remake.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I could do a whole show on that.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
But anyway, when Tim Curry was doing Gabriel Knight, it was just different then.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It was completely different than the industry is now.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So I can see why a lot of this needs to be reevaluated.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Regardless, I hope they're able to solve it sooner rather than later.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And especially these safety issues.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So, we'll see.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Raginator says, I wouldn't mind three hours of Sky's diva rants on OLR.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Be careful what you ask for.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000
SSG100Matt says, from what I've heard from going to voice acting panels,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
some of these developers can really screw over these actors.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Like making them do all the yelling and screaming lines in the beginning of the sessions,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and not the end, resulting in ruined voices for a while.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000
ActDef says, basically, Voice Actors Guild needs to be on par with the Screen Actors Guild,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
or almost on par.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Well, that's kind of what this is, because SAG is Screen Actors Guild,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
so a lot of these folks are represented by Screen Actors Guild,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
which merged a few years ago with AFTRA, which, sorry guys in the industry,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
don't be mad if I get this wrong,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
but I think covers a lot more of the Broadway talent, like live theater and those sorts of things.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
There's probably more to it as well.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But generally, it just involves acting in all different types of forms,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and that would, of course, be an umbrella for voice acting as well.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
So, anyhow, I hope they're able to figure that out,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
because, again, you know, we're going to feel it with some of the game releases,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
and if you think we've got a drought of games this year,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I mean, if this goes on for a while, that could cause some games to get delayed.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I mean, it could cause, I don't know.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Do you think AAA studios would look to using non-union talent?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I know this is a highly controversial issue that we probably have no authority to speak on whatsoever,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
but it's not stopping Twitter from doing it,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.000
so do you think that these AAA companies would be bold enough to use non-union talent?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I'm telling you, Gilbert Gottfried's going to get so much work now.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Gilbert Gottfried's under SAG, though.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
He would be able to do it.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
You'll see more contests like the one BioWare had a couple weeks ago to get in the mat.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Remember when we acted out that scene on air?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Which, by the way, no phone call from EA.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Isn't that disappointing?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
That's so disappointing, Louie.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Anyway, all right.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Moving on, let's talk about one of those games that could be impacted.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
This is Rumor, tinfoil hat.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Get out the wheel of plausibility for this one.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Oh, wait. Oh, didn't we have a theme song for the wheel of plausibility?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I think we did.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It's time to spin the wheel of plausibility.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
All right, I'm already over that song.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Could Diablo IV be something that is revealed at BlizzCon 2016?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Could it? Because it is a Blizzard game.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Therefore, yes, it could be.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And apparently what's causing all this is a four-sided die.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
It's a D4 die that I get.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Is that being found in a BlizzCon bag or what?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I guess something.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They're finding a D4 die is somehow associated with BlizzCon and Blizzard.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And I guess the numbers are printed wrong on this die.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And the dates that it reads are the dates for BlizzCon 2016, November 4th.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So could Diablo IV be happening on November 4th?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Also, I guess somebody had spotted, somebody over at PC Gamer was reporting that David Breivik,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:07.000
who is a project lead on Diablo II, and senior producer Bill Roper were spotted at Blizzard headquarters.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And this is just adding fuel to the fire.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So could Diablo be happening at BlizzCon, Diablo IV?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Well, here's the thing.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Something Diablo is happening at BlizzCon.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It makes complete fucking sense.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
World of Warcraft's expansion released two months ago.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
They're not going to release a new expansion.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
They're not even going to announce a new expansion for Warcraft.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I mean, this isn't Sims we're talking about here.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Overwatch, I feel, is still a little new.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
You might get your new character.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000
This whole Sombra thing might happen at BlizzCon, but I don't see any radical changes with Overwatch.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Maybe StarCraft, there's been those rumors of a remaster.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I don't know, but this really leaves Diablo as the franchise that is going to have some attention paid to it this year.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
But Diablo IV? I don't know.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I kind of think it's an expansion for Diablo III.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Because the story at the end of the last expansion was kind of left wide open for in Act 6.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I suppose that could go into a new game.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I suppose there's a lot of reasons why Blizzard might want to just jump into Diablo IV.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And a lot of it is probably tied to the fact that there is still negative stigma around Diablo III because of the way it was when it launched in the Auction House and all that stuff.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Even though Diablo III now is completely different from when it launched.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And I think it's a game that's definitely worth checking out.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
But I just don't know. I have a hard time believing it's all the way to Diablo IV.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I tend to think it's a new expansion before I think it's Diablo IV.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000
But if it is Diablo IV, cool. I guess I'll be curious to see what kind of changes and updates they make to it.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
But Loki, you don't really care because you don't play Diablo, huh?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I don't, unfortunately.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You know, all that stuff is on consoles, too, though.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I know. Every time I see a game, I tend to buy it, but I just never do.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
S2100matt in chat says, just sitting here waiting for a Lost Vikings sequel. Maybe someday.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:13.000
By the way, speaking of Blizzard, their Battle.net launcher, which of course is used on PC to launch the various multiplayer games such as Diablo or World of Warcraft.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It just added voice chat into it.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Yeah, we're not supposed to call it Battle.net anymore. Remember that?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
No, it's still Battle.net to me, so I'm breaking the rule.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
The Battle.net launcher has added voice chat into it.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So Blizzard voice is what they're calling it.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And it is a voice chat that will work across the different multiplayer titles.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
So it's kind of like Steam's voice chat since, you know, Blizzard games aren't on Steam and you have the separate launcher for it.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:48.000
So you can talk to friends or even friends of friends inside or even outside of games as long as you have the Battle.net program open.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:57.000
And this will allow you to talk to people like, so I could be playing World of Warcraft and my buddy could be playing Overwatch and I could talk to them across those games.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Which, I mean, it's Xbox Live on your PC for things that are through the Battle.net launcher.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So they're talking about high quality voice and superior stability.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I'd be very curious what this is going to do for things like Warcraft rating.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Because we used to use Ventrilo, but I would imagine services like that are starting to fade.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Especially now that Discord has a pretty good voice chat in it and that's becoming an option for a lot of gamers.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
A lot of my Final Fantasy XIV stuff is going to Discord.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000
And then I know, you know, now that these games have it built in is a big thing for people as well.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So, anyway.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Also, you are not able to talk to friends that are, excuse me, you can't talk to people that are not in your friends list during random pickup games.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
That still has to be enabled, I would imagine, by the game.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So I guess you can do it in Overwatch, but you can't do it in, say, Diablo.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
World of Warcraft at one time had voice chat built into it, but it was awful.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I wonder if they haven't stripped it out of the game to replace with this.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
So, anyway.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That is what's going on with Blizzard.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Of course, their big convention is, what, less than two weeks away at this point.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So I'm sure we'll hear plenty more very soon.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Meanwhile, Loki, other big gaming news this week.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yeah, so this week, not only actually the same day as the Switch video they had.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
They had the first trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So that'll be coming out fall of 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Nothing announced yet for, like, PC.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:43.000
But one of the things that they did announce was that there's gonna be select content for Red Dead Redemption 2 that'll come first to PlayStation 4.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So they're gonna have a brand new online multiplayer experience that'll be coming first to PlayStation 4.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
So the way I picture that is just, like, Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I'm guessing that they're talking about, like, content.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Like, how they do the free expansion, not free expansions, but, like, free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So that'll be similar with, like, Red Dead Online or whatever the case may be for that.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Cool.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I mean, the trailer was pretty.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Definitely something they'll pick up when it comes out.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And that's important, a pretty trailer.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
We don't know too much about it, but it sure looks nice.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I mean, that's all we have to go by.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah, I don't know. I have to admit, I didn't really get super into the last Red Dead Redemption.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But I thought it was neat.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000
But, you know, again, it's just one of those games that MMOs keep me away from playing and all the other stuff that I tend to play as well.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So there you go.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000
However, one game that I did take a little time out to play, and I need to go back and play it again a little more, is Doom.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Because Doom now has an arcade mode in it.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Yes, that's right. Doom got an update this week.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
It was the fourth free update that they've done on Steam.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And it added the arcade mode.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Arcade mode now unlocks all guns, suit upgrades, runes, and you now play in a multiplayer-based scoring system that rewards aggression and accuracy.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
You play every level with all guns, runes, and equipment fully unlocked.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000
You compete against friends and players worldwide for the highest score by attacking demons quickly, avoiding attacks, and grabbing multipliers on the way.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So I guess it's a more fast-paced thing.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I want to check this out. It sounds pretty cool.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And there also is another Doom multiplayer pack called Hell Followed that's coming out on October 27th.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
So man, they're keeping the updates coming for that new Doom game.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Which, you know, it really is one of the better releases of the year, I think, which was kind of surprising.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Because I think with a lot of these reboots, sometimes they miss the mark, but Doom's pretty awesome.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And the fact that they continue to support it with a good balance between free and DLC and paid stuff, I think just does the game even more credit, to be honest.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So, snaps for you folks making Doom.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Moving on, Loki.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Alright, so this is kind of unfortunate, but United Friends Games has apparently shut down.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:20.000
United Friends Games, they were responsible for some of the Sony games, ModNation Racers, Little Big Planet Karting, and then more recently Sleeping Dogs.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.000
And apparently they were working on a multiplayer brawler game called Smash and Grab.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:34.000
But I guess it just recently hit Steam Early Access, but I'm guessing now that...

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I don't know. Is that not being finished now? Like most Steam Early Access games, I guess?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yeah, it's never good news when game studios close, you know?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Yeah. So apparently, yeah, they rumored to be closing based off of, I guess, a post on NeoGaf, and then GameSpot had confirmed it with somebody close to the studio, so that's unfortunate.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Alright, moving on to some news out of Sony and what's going on with PlayStation tournaments.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Earlier this week, Sony announced that they are teaming up with ESL, which is a gaming network, and they're going to be hosting a digital, month-long basketball tournament.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And this is going to be through NBA 2K17.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So from October 27th, which is this coming week, through November 26th, there are going to be major cup rounds every Saturday.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And the tournament is based on NBA 2K17.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
If you're one of the top three players at the end of the tournament, you get a prize pack with PlayStation gear, controllers, and all that good stuff.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Of course, if you want to participate, you do need the game to be able to play.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
You do have to have a PlayStation Plus subscription, I imagine, so you can play online.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000
And you do want to get an account with the ESL gaming site.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So you have to register for the tournament beforehand at ESL, and then you're automatically prompted when your time to compete comes.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
No idea how large the player pool's going to be.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Everything, though, they are saying one versus one.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And Sony wants to expand this with other tournaments moving forward.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And Microsoft, of course, did something similar at Game Developers Conference when they talked about the Xbox Live tournament platform, which allows folks to make tournaments via Xbox Live.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So it's only logical that Sony kind of makes a similar step with this.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Of course, since sports games aren't really up my alley, I can appreciate that they exist and that they bring a lot more gamers into the market.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
But so this particular tournament, I can't say I'm getting super excited about.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But, you know, maybe it would be cool if there were tournaments for other types of games as well, not just necessarily sports games.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And I'm sure we will see that if things like this do well.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000
So to be continued, maybe I'll get a tournament for Diablo 4 in 2019. Who knows?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Who knows?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
All right. Loki, before we get to the classic game of the week, what do you have?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
So there was a mod that was made for Grand Theft Auto 5 that was kind of silly.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:14.000
It replaced the sticky mines or the C4 that you have with a Samsung Galaxy Note.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Because, you know, that's silly. Someone basically can throw that and it sticks to something and it explodes.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And so they had a video that was on YouTube. And then, of course, it got a DMCA takedown from Samsung and they didn't apparently like it too much.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:39.000
However, recently, YouTube, though, has reinstated the video because the creator filed a counterclaim against Samsung.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
But so you can go check it out.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:52.000
That's kind of unfortunate that people are using DMCA to, you know, well, what? Abusive automated systems on YouTube? You don't say.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Did you see that whole thing? I think it was Reddit or Twitter or somebody had this linked.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:05.000
But like some guys got a threatening email that said, give us a thousand dollars or we're going to get your we're going to copyright strike your YouTube channel out of existence.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And they did it. They didn't pay the thousand dollars. They got they got copyright striked out of existence.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And that really just makes me go, wow, I don't want to ever.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Yeah. Isn't that wonderful that YouTube heroes exist so that we can now have people do that even quicker?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
That's so fucking fantastic, YouTube.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Yeah. YouTube needs to fix this. There needs to be recourse against fakers.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And I think stuff like this is only just going to make this happen even even faster.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
At least I hope it does. Or else YouTube is going to, you know, some folks are trying to up the competition now.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
There's what? There's this vid me is something newer that's coming out.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
The Twitch for gaming Twitch allowing the uploads on their side now. That's pretty big step.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So, I mean, YouTube kind of needs to figure this out or they're going to.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:56.000
It's just it's being abused. And the bad thing about it, too, is it's, you know, one of their complaints, the channel that got taken down.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
They're saying that, you know, if they were a larger channel, YouTube would have resolved this already.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:09.000
But because their numbers are smaller, that YouTube doesn't give a shit about them. And I kind of feel that's the case.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Oh, for sure. For sure. There needs to be some type of legal recourse that these guys can take with the fakers.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And yeah, could they even I know this might sound ridiculous, but I have to throw it out there.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Could they could they attempt to like sue? This is crazy.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:33.000
But sue YouTube for lost income that their videos could be granting because it was fake and that they have evidence that they were blackmailed or whatever.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Well, I don't really know if they can. I mean, because I'm not a lawyer. That should be obvious.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Well, they have a lawyer that's already helping out Ryan Morrison, the video game attorney. He's, you know, kind of jumped in to help him out.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:57.000
They contacted Fupo, which is that H3H3 Productions created a bunch of different YouTubers created this like account that those guys can't fix every single start.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
It shouldn't be their job to fix it. It should be YouTube's.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Right. But YouTube is a fucking clusterfuck. So they just. They can't. There's too many things going on, but there's not a humans checking all this shit.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Yeah. No, I guess there's no easy answer. All right. Well, let's let's travel back to a simpler time.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
We're going to go back to a time when you didn't have YouTube and copyright strike or any of that stuff.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
It's time to go to the classic game of the week.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:38.000
But regretfully, our magic machine is broken this week and there is no radio magic this week to bring dark soccer to the show this week.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000
So I apologize for that, but we'll work on getting that fixed so that we can have her here next week.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:49.000
So we're going to do what we do when dark soccer is off for other reasons other than a long term absence.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Which, by the way, I did hear from her this week, at least.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And she does think that things are going to work out where she will be able to come back to the show in January.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I think this early January. So around the holidays.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So that's good. But we're going to do what we did usually when she would miss out on the show.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And I'm going to pick a classic game of the week or Loki would.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
But we decided I'll do it this week. Maybe to my Halo pick.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
But, you know, I said I don't want to get that phone call. I do not want that phone call.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
So let's get to the classic game of the week. And I picked a game on the Game Boy.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And it's a it's a game that I remember. I figured it was a Nintendo week.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So I'll do something with the Game Boy. And this is a game that I remember playing an awful lot of when it first came out.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And it's called Moto Cross Maniacs is the name of this. Did you ever play Moto Cross Maniacs on the Game Boy?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Old school member, old school title on the Game Boy.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
It was a game that was by Konami. And it was kind of which is interesting because I had no idea that it was by.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Sorry, the audio on that is really loud. Sorry. I had no idea that that was a Konami game.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Although, yeah, I still remember this kind of hear it in the audio because it looks like it could be like a sequel to.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Excitebike. Excitebike, doesn't it? And I think that's part of the reason I picked it up was originally when I was younger is because it looked like it was like a sequel to Excitebike.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It was actually by Ultra Games, which was Konami. That was Konami. That was the way they got around things in the US.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:20.000
But anyway, what you do in this game is you control a motorcycle and it moves pretty much in one direction, which is similar to Excitebike.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
But in Excitebike, you could kind of you have that fakie 3D effect where you can move up and down the different lanes.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000
No, Motocross Maniacs doesn't have that. Remember, this was on the original black and white Game Boy. It wasn't that complex.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.000
But what it had instead was that, you know, you could do all these wheelies and you were flying on ramps.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And not only were you flying on like normal ramps, but you were flying on stuff that didn't exist in real life, like loops and like double, like you'd hop from one loop to another loop and be flying all around.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:59.000
You know, it was just it was fun to play when I was a kid. You would use your nitro boost just at the right time when you're going over one of these slopes and you would go flying.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Now, that was a lot like Excitebike on the NES. So that's where some of those comparisons come from.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
But some of these levels are just like insane with the type of stuff that they're doing.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And of course, ridiculous things that would not exist in real life, like platforms floating in midair.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But who cares? It's a video game. It's the Game Boy. See, look at that, Logie. Two loops. See that in the video right there? Two loops.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Oh, my God.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I got hit back to back. Whoa, that's like Sonic the Hedgehog right there. But on a Game Boy.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Anyway, you control the motorcycle and you can move the front wheel upwards or downwards.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
You do have a limited amount of fuel, but they call it a time bar in the game.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And so you have to complete the course before you run out of fuel.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
You do have a limited amount of speed boosts and there are letters like NTR.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I'm sorry. NTR is actually what you see in the bottom of the screen. NTR is short for Nitro.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000
But you can pick up more boosts like N, which is additional boosts.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
There's also extra fuel, which is the T. There is special tires, which is the R.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And then there's also an S that's increased speed. So that'll help you move even faster.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
You can also do combos by doing like front flips and back flips.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And doing combos will get you a flying booster, which you'll see the little word jet appear.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
That will let you jump super high if you actually use super boosts.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Also what was really cool about this game, again, for the Game Boy, which was released in North America.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
By the way, this game was out January 1990 in North America.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And this was one of the earlier releases. It wasn't a launch title, but it was right around.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:41.000
It was the next wave of games. Japan, this game was out on September 20th of 1989.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
But there were multiple paths that you could go in some of the levels.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
The first level is pretty straightforward, but then later on you had multiple directions that you could go in.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And one of the directions would have other power-ups in it as well.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So you had to get those boosts down and use your nitros just at the right time.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So you could fly different ways and get through the different courses.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
There are eight levels in the game, which of course get harder and harder as you move along.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
You can select any level at the beginning of the game.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
There's also A, B, and C difficulty level, which will change the time that you have to complete.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
And then there is single player, single versus computer, and single player versus second player.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Where the second player will appear as a silhouette behind you.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And you might remember in the days when the Game Boy was first released, it was huge on that link cable, right?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So you'd use the link cable to link up to another Game Boy, and then you could actually play against somebody head to head.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And there's that little Game Link logo right on the box to let you know that you could do that.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000
And there's really not... I mean, it was a Game Boy game, so it was pretty simple, but it was one that I remember owning and really enjoying.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
So that's why I picked it as the Classic Game of the Week.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Moto Cross Maniacs is the Classic Game of the Week.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Loki, you never played it at all.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I may have. I never had a Game Boy. My friend did.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
So I may have played it on his, but it's... God, that was years ago.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I do want to say, you know what this also... The game reminds me of Uniracers, which came out a long time later on Super Nintendo.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But that was a Nintendo, or at least one of their in-house dev teams that did that, if I remember right.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So that felt a lot like this.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
This game in some ways I think was ahead of its time, but the Game Boy platform kind of limits what it can do, I think.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Because, you know, the Game Boy was a real simple piece of hardware.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
You know, it couldn't do super complex stuff.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
So, there it is.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Moto Cross Maniacs. Check that out.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Although I don't know if it's aged well.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I don't know if you play it in an emulator, you're going to get the same thrill that you get on an actual Game Boy.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
But I think it is on Virtual Console. I could be wrong, but I think you can't get that on Virtual Console.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Yeah, that would be a nice game we'd have a remake of, would be Uniracers. I like that game.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Oh, Uniracers was fun. I love the game. I should have done that as Classic Game of the Week. Maybe next time.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Yep. Maybe next time.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Although, next time we want to hear Dark Sakura back here through the magic of radio.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
But anyway, since we didn't have the magic machine working this week, we are going to take a quick music break.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
But we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
We've got rapid fire news in stores this week, the mailbag, although I'm not sure if we had anything in there.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
A few more stories, and of course, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
All that is coming up when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 662 for this October the 23rd of 2016.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And boy, that felt weird. It's been weeks since we've taken a music break.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
And you know, I miss Dark Sakura. I wish she was still here so we could take music breaks more often.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
But that was nice. I know I can't play these on the podcast feed because otherwise it's copyright and all that stuff.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
But we played the new Christopher Tin song from Civilization VI.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
If you guys haven't heard it, it's out there on YouTube. You can check it out very easy.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Or, you know, just check out Civilization VI.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.000
But the song that he does in that game, which translates to the Dream of Flight,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
which I believe is the music on the menu music, is really good.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And a lot of our chat responded very positively to that.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
A lot of folks didn't even realize he had done contributions for Civilization VI.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
So there you go. I'm glad we could have done that there, at least for you live listeners.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
For you podcast folks, though, you get a whole internet out there. I'm sure you will find it.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000
But be sure you join us here live sometimes. You don't miss out on that stuff.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Sunday nights, of course, at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And yes, I know if you don't watch The Walking Dead, some bitch is going to spoil it for you.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
But you know what? I've never seen an episode of that show, so I don't know what everybody's getting so excited about.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I just don't. But hey, that's fine. That's fine.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
There's a lot of shows now. I don't know if you've had the same experience, Loki,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
but having this show on Sunday nights has ruined so much TV for me.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I never get to see Game of Thrones. I never see Walking Dead.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
What's the other show that's on Sunday nights on AMC?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Is there another big one? I don't know.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
But there's all these Sunday night shows that I never get to see and I just don't get as excited about.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I don't know.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
There's always Netflix.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I'm sure they're fine shows. I'm not shading them or whatever.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
It's just, you know, we're doing this instead. It's all good.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Maya in chat says Westworld. Is that another Sunday night show? I haven't heard a lot about that.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Yeah, that's what some of the watch was, Westworld.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I've heard that one too. For me, it's like, I got to do Netflix shows.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000
That's like Stranger Things. That was great because it was also, it was only eight episodes.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You can watch Black Mirror. That's another good one. We just started watching season three of that.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I think Shane was talking about that like right after we taped Pokestop Podcast this morning,

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
is that he was talking about the, which by the way, new episode of Pokestop.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Kind of like Twilight Zone about technology.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Is it from the UK too?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Yeah.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Okay. That's what I thought. Yeah, he was talking about that and he said he's a really big fan of that.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So I have to check that out.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Season three has been okay. The first episode of season three I did not like. It was kind of boring.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
The other ones have been all right.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
All right. I got it. There's a ton of documentaries on Netflix I want to watch too.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Like there's, I don't know if you guys get into documentaries.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Well, they were starting to put Disney movies on there now.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Like modern Disney movies like Zootopia is on there. My kids can't stop watching that.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Oh yeah. That was a big deal.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So I'm looking forward to when like the Marvel movies come out.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:18.000
All right. Let's do some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on in the industry. Loki.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
So you'll be happy to know that finally that time has happened.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000
The Last Guardian has gone gold. So yes, there won't be any more delays.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Although I am quite surprised that it's gone gold now.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
What being the middle of October yet the game is not coming out for another, you know, month.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
You know, December is when it's due out now.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So, but hey, there shouldn't be any more delays.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Well that's good.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Yeah.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And maybe the day one patch will be minimal.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Hopefully. And then of course there's a report that the HTC Vive has sold more than 140,000 units.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
So that's not too bad.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I'm curious to see how much the other platforms have sold in PlayStation VR.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
They're saying, you know, they're expecting to sell 2.6 million units by the end of this year.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
So yeah, I mean that's only a good thing.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000
More units being out there means more people wanting to develop for those platforms, meaning more content.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Agree. You don't think the fact that it's all split across different platforms is going to hurt anybody?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I don't think so right now because really PC wise you've got Oculus and Vive.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
And a lot of those games kind of work with each other.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I mean they've got, you know, they're either support both or I don't know.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I don't think it's going to be that big a difference.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And even with like the PlayStation VR you kind of have a little bit of both of that.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You have some of those, you know, sitting experiences and you have some that are like kind of in a little play space.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Kind of like the room stuff with Vive.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I'm sure it's not as intricate as the Vive stuff because I know it's a lot more powerful hardware.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
But I think it'll be interesting. It's going to be about getting that price point down.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I think eventually maybe in a couple years once those prices come down then a lot more people will be able to try it out.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:17.000
But then again, you know, if they are compelling enough for you to get it, people don't have problems paying that Apple price or the price of a new phone.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
So, you know, it's all about being compelling enough for you to want to have that piece of hardware.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
True.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Or being cheap enough to it being not such a risk to try it.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
True.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Alright, well let's talk about Xbox One backwards compatibility.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You know, you got to give credit where credit's due and Microsoft has really done an amazing job.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And I'm so disappointed that I don't see backwards compatibility reports for PlayStation. I mean honestly.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Yeah, I really thought that would have lit a fire under Sony to do the same thing.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Although I guess if Sony is still quote unquote winning the war, they're not as motivated to have to do that.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
But I will give credit, big credit to Microsoft for sticking by this backwards compatibility thing.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Like I would have been surprised at all if they did it for a couple months and then quit.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Because that's kind of what Microsoft used to do.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
But this is very nice that they're still making this happen.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
That they're still trickling out more games.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And this week we got a big one.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Orange Box went to the backwards compatibility list this week.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That's huge.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
That's Portal.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
That's Team Fortress. That's Half-Life.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
You know, there's a lot of heavy hitter games in that.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Which I think was our favorite game of the year that came out.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
That was a great... I'm looking for Valve to do another box set.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Wouldn't that be amazing if they did another box set that had like Portal 3 and Half-Life 3?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It's Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3 and Explode internet.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Oh my god, the internet would just like collapse. Like worse than it did over the weekend.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
It would just be... wow.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
But anyway, I'm not going to get too ahead of myself.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:51.000
The good news is, you know what, despite its age, the Orange Box is still a very solid set to play.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Granted, Team Fortress has changed a lot, so I don't know about that one so much.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:02.000
But, you know, for Portal alone, and for the Half-Life series, which is fucking great too, being on Xbox 360.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I mean, it's just a solid list.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Also, by the way though, Joe Danger 2 the movie...

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I don't know what the fuck that is. What is Joe Danger 2?

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Joe Danger is a game where you're kind of doing like stunts.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
So it's Hello Games other games.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Oh, that's where that's from. It's Hello Games other games. That's right.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So they have Joe Danger and Joe Danger 2 the movie.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Is that why Hello Games went radio silent on everything else?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Is they were too busy prepping this game for backwards compatibility?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Where the fuck did they go? Where the fuck did Sean go?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Where did he go?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Do you think he took the money and ran? Do you think he's in another country right now?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
No, I doubt that.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I hope the dude's okay too. You know, I can say that and joke kind of tongue-in-cheek.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But I also kind of wonder, did maybe a lot of this negative feedback really...

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It's okay. I mean, I seriously wouldn't be too bent out of shape about it. I mean, look at Spore.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I mean, come on.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
That's true. And you know what? Will Wright is and will always be one of the all-time greats in game development.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
That's right.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
If Sean Wright can make a Spore, then you can make a No Man's Sky, I guess.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Loki, coming from you, that's a very, very nice way to put it.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I think is a great, positive message for Sean Murray.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Because I'm sure he's out there listening.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Perhaps the journalists out there listening can relay that message for us to...

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
No, they're too busy writing articles about how a game about cats as a visual novel has ruined their life.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Galaga Legion is also backwards compatible on Xbox One.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
It was no Pac-Man Championship Edition, which I think is what they were trying to emulate in a way.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
But it's worth a look. It's worth your time.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
A lot of people got into the Galaga Legion.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
So those got added to backwards compatibility.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Pokemon Go got an update as well.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Pokemon Go had an update this week that dealt with the Plus.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000
The Plus, actually, they were saying it didn't do a great job at distinguishing PokeStops from Pokemon.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
And so forth.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So, yeah, I do notice the vibrations in that thing are different now.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
So you can notice what's different.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And also you can specify within the Pokemon Go app if you want to get just notifications for the actual Pokemon, for the PokeStops, or both.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
So that's something for me to keep in mind.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Because I am so low on PokeBalls right now that I'm thinking about maybe I need to run over to a place where there's a ton of PokeStops here.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Either downtown or Old Fair Oaks or something.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And just set that to PokeStop only mode and load up.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Because I am out of PokeBalls.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I have honestly not played Pokemon Go in weeks.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
You know, I talked about this on PokeStop podcasts.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I don't want to double talk myself too much.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
But I have been really motivated thanks to the Plus.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I've been using it for more of my walking and exercise.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I'm hatching a lot of Pokemon.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I'm not taking it that seriously.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I'm just kind of using it as like a Fitbit for even bigger nerds.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
And it's working for that purpose.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
So that's why I get really irritated when I see all this stuff that's like Pokemon Go is dead and all this stuff.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I'm like, but it's motivating me to exercise more.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So for that alone, it's kind of a win.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
So just stop being a fucking cynical gamer community and let games be, I guess.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I don't know.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
We've got to talk about what's in stores this week.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
What's on the shelves this week, Loki?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Actually, because we're in that busy fourth quarter.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
So starting this week, we've got Corpse Party for 3DS.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.000

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Exile's End on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Hide and Shriek on PC.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I literally read that as Hide and Shrek when I first saw that.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It's like, why are they making a Shrek game?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Ginger Beyond the Crystal on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Just Dance 2017 coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:03.000
King's Quest Chapter 5, The Good Night on PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Trillion, God of Destruction on PC.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.000
World of Final Fantasy on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Yomawari, Night Alone on PC and Vita.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Clockwork Empires on PC and Mac.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Alice VR on PC and basically all the other Vive and Rift platforms.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Berserk on PS3, PlayStation 4, and Vita.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Crow's Burning Edge on PlayStation 4.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Neo Atlas 1469 on Vita.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Through the Woods on PC.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Weeping Doll on PlayStation VR.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Carnival Games VR on the Vive and PlayStation VR.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse coming out later in the week on PC as well.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:05.000
And then for some reason they have all these games releasing on that Friday, which is Titanfall 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.000
The Yellow Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.000
And then finally Hitman Hokkaido on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I wonder if game releases won't switch to Fridays, because music did a couple years ago.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Like all the new releases are on Friday.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I'm sure you were following the fact that Lady Gaga put out a new album on Friday.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I don't think it really necessarily follows that, because all the other media like movies and stuff come out on Tuesdays.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
They release dates on Tuesday.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
But then again, they like to do these event things on Fridays and stuff, and I don't know.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Well, heading over to Japan and looking at the releases there.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Over in Japan on the PlayStation 4, Sword Art Online Hollow Realization is out in a limited edition this week.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
World of Final Fantasy is also out in Japan this week.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And there is a game called Crow's Burning Edge.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Mafia III gets its Japanese release as well.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
This is all on the 27th, which is a pretty busy day.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Let's see, Just Dance 2017 out as well.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I'm sorry, that's not Japan specific.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That is other parts of Asia.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000
But then we also have, let's see, Psycho, nope.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Sorry, that is also, I've got them all mixed up here.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Berserk Musou is the other one that is out in Japan this week on the 27th.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Heading on over to the Wii U.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Yep, still pretty quiet on the Wii U.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:40.000
There's no releases, so we might be just removing these until there's something really, really big coming out in Japan.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
But on the PlayStation Vita, still going.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Did you know World of Final Fantasy is out on the Vita in Japan?

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
That is happening on the Vita in Japan.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
That is also out on the 27th.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Neo Atlas 1469 also on the Vita.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Which, you know, just to backtrack a little bit, I think that kind of says a lot about this whole Switch thing.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:06.000
The fact that the Vita is still so big in Japan, I really think that Switch concept is going to go even further in Japan than it is here.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I really do.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
There's still tons of Vita games coming out here.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
It just seems like, but it seems like the portable life, especially.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I want to say this week, there was more Vita games coming out than there were 3DS games.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Interesting.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Alright, well, other Japanese releases this week on the Vita.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Neo Atlas 1469 and Saka Agari Hurricane Portable gets a limited edition.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Also, that same Sword Art Online Hollow Realization also comes out on the Vita this week.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
So, busy, busy week on the Vita.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000
And lastly, just checking the Nintendo 3DS, where there are still some releases.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Just a few things.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
We have Sonic Tune Fire and Ice.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And then we have Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari SP.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:53.000
And Kamiwaza Wanda Kirikira Ichibangai Kipatsu comes out this week.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Those are the Japanese release dates.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
How about the UK, Loki?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
World of Final Fantasy on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And Carnival Games VR on PC.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
And I would imagine PlayStation VR as well.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
It's kind of more abridged there.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Just responding to what I had said there about the Japanese perspective.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Mikuma JP in our chat from Japan lending that perspective over at live.vognetware.com saying,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I can see that sky, but too big to carry around.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
So, you know, the fact that it's going to be bigger than the 3DS.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
So, people don't... Do men not have purses in Japan?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Because they have them here.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
They don't call them purses, of course, but they're man bags.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
They're messenger bags.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Thank you, messenger bags.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
The message I'm sending is that I'm a woman.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Yeah.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
But the over-the-shoulder bags and that.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
More men are carrying those.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
That is the thing.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Granted, you can take it with you, but it's not all that portable.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Really, the only advantage is that it has a screen attached to it.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
But, shit, I used to carry my systems around in a bag.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
And if it had a screen attached to it, it would be basically the same thing they're doing right there.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Maya calls them merces.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Yes, I've heard that name too, but, you know, you can't go to a place like...

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Who sells, like, fossil?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
You don't go there and ask for a mers.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000
You ask for a handbag or a, you know, a carrying case or something like that.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Akuma JP says, yes, but we like to travel light.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Oh, that's fair. That's fair.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Kaijuto is saying, everyone has a backpack here.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So, no issue. That's true.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
A lot of people, if you don't use something that's over one shoulder, it's over both, like a backpack.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Or you carry it on one shoulder, and that's how you get light scoliosis like I had in high school.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Did we do the UK releases? Yes, we did, didn't we?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
So, I think we're to the mailbag segment. How does that sound?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
We're gonna get to the mailbag.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Every week, you guys email us.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
and we like to pull out your emails and read some of our favorites here on air.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Although, I believe this week, we didn't have anything because I looked earlier.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Yep, it is an empty mailbag. It's a desert. It's a wasteland.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
So, this is where I ask the listeners, why don't you love us?

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Why don't you love us? Send an email. Tell us what you think about the Switch.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Come on, there's been a lot of stuff on that. Are you gonna get Red Dead 2?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
What about Diablo 4? Is it gonna be Diablo 4 or is it a Diablo 3 expansion?

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I'd like to hear from some voice actors. I know we have a few of them listening.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
What do you think about all that strike business going on?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.000
And actdeaf says, we do, in response to loving us, we just don't like writing.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Twitter has ruined everybody.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You can say things in more than 140 characters. It's okay.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Alright, that's fine. No mail this week, so we will just table that till next time.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Next week will be the Halloween show, because Halloween is Monday, right?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000
So, next week will be our Halloween show, so you can send us a scary, scary story.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Send us a scary story to read on air, but it has to involve video games.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
So, it has to be like that one time you broke your console or threw a Wiimote through your TV.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
That'll be fun.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Let's get to a few more stories, and then we'll get to your calls.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Loki.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
So, another page of this seems like a great idea for television.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Apparently, they are adapting Candy Crush, yes, Candy Crush, into an hour-long game show for CBS.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It's gonna, they haven't really said when it's gonna premiere, but the format will consist of two teams of two.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
They'll be competing on an interactive game board.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And, you know, we are huge fans of Candy Crush, and like so many others, we know the rush of advancing to the next level of the game.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
We're excited to work with Lionsgate and King to adapt one of the world's most popular and entertaining game franchises for television,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:06.000
to make it available to its massive, passionate fan base who can watch and play along at home.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Can't they use that hour to, like, put Big Brother over the top on TV, or the Star Trek series that they're doing on TV?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Do they have to give an hour to fucking Candy Crush, really?

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
They've had weirder game show ideas.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.000
My favorite of the recent, you know, because I don't really watch live TV, but back when I, in fact, I got a cancel cable.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I've been meaning to cancel the cable portion.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000
They give you, you know, a better deal if you buy cable and the internet versus just the internet.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And, like, I only use the internet, so I've said, well, if I can get cable and the internet, and it's still cheaper than what I'm paying for just internet, then sure, why not, let's do it.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
So I decided to watch some live TV when I first put it on.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Of course, then I unhooked my cable box, and I'm like, fuck this shit.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:56.000
But one of the shows that they had on there, and I'm not really sure what the premise of the show was, but it was, I think, people answering trivia questions or something like that.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And they had, like, valuables of theirs on a conveyor belt that would fall off a building and smash on the ground.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And I'm a big fan of dropping things onto the ground, so that show was kind of cool.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:16.000
But, yeah, Candy Crush, go fuck King, and seriously, CBS, fuck you guys for even giving them the light of day for that shit.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I still can't believe that whole thing where people would do the shapes with the wall.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
What the hell was that show called?

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Oh, through the wall or something like that?

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Yeah, that was, um, I don't, but see, like, once again, like, the Japanese game show was funny, whereas this, you know, show was stupid.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Like, when they bring it over to America, it's fucking lame.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I just don't understand why, like, they can't make the goofiness of that.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I mean, the closest thing we got was Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, which is basically just a goofy redub of, you know, Takashi's Castle.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000
But, like, if they actually took it seriously, it would be stupid.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Now, here's the other thing I don't understand, okay? CBS, if I'm not mistaken, CBS, Viacom, same thing, right?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Viacom owns MTV, MTV owns Logo, so CBS could theoretically be airing RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Yeah, but then that would expose gays to the mainstream audience, and then we can't have that.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Okay, but Candy Crush, alright, look, in fact, we haven't done this in a very long time.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
You know what we need to do? We need to take a poll.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000
We need to do a live poll right now here at The Voice of Geeks Network, VagaNetwork.com.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000
We're gonna go and ask this poll, and, uh, it's up live over at Live.VagaNetwork.com.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
What would you rather watch on CBS?

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:49.000
You can choose the first answer, Candy Crush, or you can choose the second answer, RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Vote now.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
We'll get the listener's final answer in just a moment.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I vote C, actually, which is Silent Library, because that show is hilarious on MTV, and I'd rather watch that.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Have you ever seen that show?

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I think I have.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:10.000
See, that show right there was the closest show that I could see that was, like, a Japanese game show.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It was basically, they had to be quiet in a library, and they would have a task that they would have to do that was ridiculous,

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:21.000
or, like, painful, or just gross, that they would have to do while being quiet.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
That was the premise of the show. No one won anything, it's just silly.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And that's what that show, like, through the, uh, you know, whatever they called it in Japan, the one where you go through the wall,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
it was just a silly show.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
The whole point is that I can complete it, hooray for me.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You know, it's not like, I'm gonna win money.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
It was just trying to beat it, just for the sake of beating it.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Alright, uh, we're gonna, we're asking that question again.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
This is your last chance to vote live.vognetwork.com.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
If you don't see the poll, I guess refresh the page.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
But people are voting, so I know the answers are coming in.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Uh, so check that out and you can vote live.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000
We'll get to, uh, the, uh, the answer here in a minute.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.000
And it's, it's, it is not unanimous, I'll put it that way, does that even surprise me?

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
So, we'll get to that in a minute.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Which would you rather watch on CBS, Candy Crush or RuPaul's Drag Race?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Alright, uh, so, I'm sure a lot of you experienced this last week, but it did, uh, it did incorporate gaming into it.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:21.000
And that was the fact that there was a large DDoS attack, a very large DDoS attack, which of course is direct denial of service attacks.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And it did affect PlayStation Network.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Uh, and this was because PlayStation Network is a part of Dyne, D-Y-N, is that, am I saying that right?

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:34.000
The, the name of the company on the East Coast that, that provides, uh, a lot of internet coverage to a lot of big websites.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:41.000
They got hit with a massive DDoS attack, which, I mean, this is so big that now apparently the Department of Homeland Security is involved.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:52.000
They're saying that it was something where, like, devices in your home, like a camera or a, I don't know, a, a baby monitor or some shit that has IP address.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Somehow they're getting malware on these devices and they were being used in the attack as well.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Um, the attacks have stopped, but it certainly made people stop for a minute. I mean, I was pissed off. I couldn't use Twitter for hours and hours.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I was a real, I didn't realize how fucking addicted to Twitter I was until that DDoS attack took down Twitter for a good chunk of the morning and most of the afternoon on Friday.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.000
But, uh, obviously gamers were affected as well. So, Loki, you're laughing over there. You laughing about the DDoS or what?

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I'm just, like, picturing, like, Twitter, or not Twitter, uh, malware in a printer or something like that.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Well, yeah, it's, I, whoa.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Baby monitor malware.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Well, it's, it's crazy to think, you know, if that stuff, uh, can be turned and used on, you know, other places, that's almost, you know, it's kind of scary, especially with how much our society relies on the internet.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:46.000
This is probably causing a lot of people to kind of stop and go, whoa, hopefully our government is kind of looking at that and going, well, not everything needs to be on the internet.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So, um, yeah, we'll see. Anyway, uh, I have a feeling-

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
We gotta, that's why we need to invade your computer to find those hackers and catch that 4chan.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Uh, I, I unfortunately don't think this is the last we're gonna see of it either. I think there's, uh, probably more to come from these attacks, so be ready for it.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I don't know, can, can they ever stop DDoS attacks?

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I thought one way that they were doing it, like, you would see that cloud flare thing comes up and sometimes it asks for a, um, cause, like, that's what they did with the Pokemon Go.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Uh, they asked for all the CAPTCHA codes, right? Every time you ping the server, so it, like, slows it down tremendously.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I guess other sites can't do that?

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000
That's funny. I thought the whole slowing down tremendously was just a feature of Pokemon Go.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Oh, shut up. Uh, DungeonBuster in chat says, uh, over at Live.FogNetwork.com says, let's make everything internet smart from DVDs to toasters.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
But what about security? Who attacks toasters?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Uh, SSG100Matt says, I wonder if this is connected to those lizard squad kids getting charged for their attack on SOTY recently.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.000
I don't think anyone's really claimed responsibility, have they? Or no, they did on Twitter, didn't they? But it was a different group, right?

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Yeah, who knows, who knows. Anyway, I know what I give a shit about and that is our live poll.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
What would you rather watch on CBS? Candy Crush or RuPaul's Drag Race?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And the poll is at an end, and believe it or not, Candy Crush got 37% of the vote.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:18.000
So, Candy Crush with 37% of the vote, RuPaul's Drag, actually, uh, it's 37 and a half percent of the vote.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.000
RuPaul's Drag Race was 62 and a half percent of the vote, so that's almost, almost a 30 you would rather watch Candy Crush.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Well, you know what?

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
That's a third less, you know, I hope I have for humanity.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I hope you're happy with that decision. Enjoy your crap television. Alright, that was just a silly fun poll.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.000
I realize we haven't done a poll in a long, long time, so I'm glad we could do that there, so.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Part of listening live over at vognetwork.com. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you have for us?

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Alright, so, this is pretty awesome. I'm waiting, you know, because it's only twice a year that we get to see this,

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:02.000
but I usually watch it in the archives and everything, but they have the information on the Lineup for Awesome Games Stunt Quick 2017,

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:08.000
and, uh, some of the games, you know, of course, it's gonna be running through January 18th through the 15th,

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:15.000
and the schedule has been finalized. I haven't heard Flocko saying anything about the PT run,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
so I'm gonna assume that, unfortunately, he didn't quite make it in there.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I looked at the schedule, and it was not there, I'm sorry to say.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:29.000
That's unfortunate. But yeah, they have all the blocks so you can go check it out and everything.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I haven't quite gotten a chance to take a look and see if there's anything that really stood out.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:44.000
But I really, honestly, I just like watching all of it, because it's just fun watching, especially watching them play the games

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000
and talk about what they're doing to kind of, the different strats and everything for it.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
For sure.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:58.000
It's fascinating. That, I would rather watch on TV, versus their stupid Candy Crush Saga shit.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:07.000
And seriously, it's an hour long! I mean, goddamn, I mean, shit, just put two reruns of Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy on there instead.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I mean, that'd be better.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Next time I do a poll, I'll put that in there, but I really think if anything was gonna be 100 to 0,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
it would be awesome games done quick, versus Candy Crush. So, there you go.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the marathon, even if poor Flaco is still not in it.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
But keep trying, Flaco! He's gonna keep trying until he gets in. I know it. Don't give up. You can do it.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Hey, maybe this is a game we'll see speedrun in the future, because this is something way out of Nintendo's archives.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:41.000
This is a game that was for the Satellaview that was unearthed just recently.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:47.000
You know, this Satellaview, if you didn't already know, that was a Japanese-only peripheral that existed for the Famicom.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Super Famicom, excuse me, which was their version, of course, of the Super Nintendo.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
And it allowed you to basically download games through satellite, basically.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.000
One of the games that was released on it was called The Legend of Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:10.000
That game was originally only broadcast in Japanese, but now there are language patches available in English, French, and German.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000
You can check that out at BSZelda. That does not stand for what BS stands for, usually.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
But that was part of the name of the Satellaview.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:23.000
But BSZelda.zeldalegends.net. They have the file there, so you can check that out.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
English, French, and German patches.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
I can't tell from the screenshots, was that a Super Nintendo game?

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
It is a Super Nintendo game. It was Super Famicom originally, of course.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:37.000
But yeah, obviously the look and feel is very similar to Link to the Past.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.000
See, that's like, that kind of shit, I wish, like, you know how we see these remasters of different things?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Just like, do like, a, not necessarily remaster, but like, you know, kind of like,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Hey, it's Link to the Past and this, you know, on top of it.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Or just fucking put this out on Virtual Console.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Obviously, there's people out there that want it.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
And this has a whole, there's a timer on it.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Like, you know, even though it's very clearly like a Link to the Past, there's a timer on it.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.000
You know, so there's like, speed, ironically enough, speed running that's happening in this.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.000
So, anyway, originally the game was broadcast in four one-hour chunks.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
And yeah, it was broadcast at a specific time, once a week, and you could only access that game at that time.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
So, that's, wow.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000
And the broadcast was streamed audio that had voice acting and orchestrated music.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Yeah, very, very weird technology at the time.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
So now, anyway, it's available and you can check that out if you want.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
There it is. There's also YouTubes out there, of course, if you want to see a little bit more on that.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I think that's cool, though, that something was unearthed after all this time.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
And that was some neat technology at the time.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I think the closest thing we had to it was the Sega Channel.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Which obviously was not a Nintendo thing, but it was, you know.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Something else I saw that was unearthed was, I guess, a ROM for the SNES version of Rayman.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I did see that. Yeah, I missed putting that on a show this week.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
But yeah, there was a Super Nintendo Rayman, apparently, that was unearthed this week.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
And apparently ran at 60 frames per second and it was pretty awesome.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
That's awesome.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing some of that as well.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Cool. Well, I think it's time for us to take your calls.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000
So, if you'd like to give us a call, you can right now on Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000
The Skype line is open for your calls right now and it's already lighting up.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
My gosh, people were just waiting to get in here tonight.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Let's do it.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Hello, Brad, my friend. How are you?

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Oh, peachy keen, just a little tired from setting this new thing up.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Oh, yeah, you're in the midst of a studio renovation, right?

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Yeah, we'll move. Yeah, yeah.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Oh, wow. I hope we can do something similar here at OLR, maybe.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
I think it might finally be time to replace the computer.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:51.000
As much as I've dragged my feet on that, it's probably time.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Oh, God, how many years has that been now?

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
A while. Here's the thing. Here's the thing.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Christmas and New Year's Day are on Sundays this year, or this coming year, whatever you want to say.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
So I have a feeling it's going to kind of force us to take a little break from OLR.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Granted, we could do some pre-recorded stuff, but I think our audience would forgive us if we took a nice big break for the holidays.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Oh, take a break for the holidays, for God's sake.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Yeah, exactly. And so I think that might be the time we kind of do some.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Now, obviously, I rent this house, so we can't do anything crazy like painting the walls like you're doing,

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:30.000
but I think that might be a good time for us to take a break and do some of those upgrades and changes.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I just had to make the first call from the new studio to you guys.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Oh, fuck. SSJ. Sorry, excuse me, Brad. SSJ 100 Matt brings up a good point.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.000
MAGFest is the week right after New Year's. We may end up being gone for a month.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I don't know, guys. I don't know. Would OLR people be pissed if we were gone for a month? I don't know.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Not this one. I mean, you guys need a break.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I appreciate that. We'll see. I don't know what's going to happen. Maybe we can look at doing something pre-recorded.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I don't know. We have to get through episode 666 first, and then we'll talk about what's going to happen come the holidays and MAGFest and all that other stuff.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
But anyway, Brad.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I did have to call with the game though. Have you played PolitiCats?

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I haven't played PolitiCats yet. I've just had a million other things going on.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
But I know you've been telling me about this. Tell the listeners about this.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Oh my God. You're this cat, and you run for various offices. You start from town clerk.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:32.000
You can work your way up through district attorney and mayor. You eventually get harder and harder, but I assume you can move up.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And now they've added leaderboards, and there's a 24-hour running game.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:47.000
If you're in such-and-such a tier, you get little bonuses at the end of that 24 hours. And now they've done a Halloween update.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
And what's in the Halloween update?

02:10:50.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Oh, it's all cosmetic stuff, but there's little witches costumes you can unlock, and the graphics are cobwebs and just goofy Halloween-themed type stuff.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But it's a fun little clicker game.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Alright, I'm going to have to check that out at some point. You know I love my clickers. And I think I finally ran out of steam on a non-stop night.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I think I finally kind of stopped playing that and checking on it as much as I was, but for a clicker game that was a lot of fun.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
And that was something you recommended, so I don't see why I won't check out PolitiCats.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Now one of my buddies on Twitter, I will say this, speaking of cats, recommended an app today that's called, what is this, Weather Kitty.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:35.000
And all it is, it's like a replacement for your weather app, which there's like 5 billion weather apps on the phone, I know, not that exciting.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:44.000
But it replaces it with what is going on with the weather, and a picture of a cat that matches the weather.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Oh, this is so adorable, the picture changed. So it's saying right now it's 63 degrees in Sacramento, and there's a little cat sleeping at a night, like a little night city, which obviously isn't Sacramento, but a little night cityscape there. Isn't that adorable, Loki?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Yes.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I will have to check this out.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
There you go.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
As long as it's more accurate than AccuWeather, then yeah.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Well, that's not hard to beat sometimes.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.000
My favorite is when I check one of those weather apps, and it's like, it's partially cloudy, and all this, and I look outside, it's fucking raining.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
It's raining right now, and it's like clear and sunny, and it's like, no it's not.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Although, technically, different parts of the city can see rain versus, but anyway, I won't get into that level of it.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Oh, for like three weeks after DragonCon, I was still getting Atlanta reports.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I don't care anymore.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Yeah, my weather app has, or the one I was using before it, I think Weather Channel or something, before I was using the cats,

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I think had Atlanta as one of the cities in it, just because I know I go there at least once a year.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:49.000
That was in there. L.A. is in there, because I was going there a lot. Yeah, road trips, fun.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
But games, take some more calls, get back to games.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I will, I will.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000
But political, oh my god, the Halloween thing is just too much.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000
But Brad, there's no better time to play a game than when you're on an airplane waiting to go to another city.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Do you know how much Dragon Quest VII I played while I was traveling?

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Hopefully not on a Note 7.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.000
No, not on a, no, Dragon Quest VII was on 3DS, so we were fine.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Alright, I'll catch you guys later.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Alright, take care my friend.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Peace.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Bye.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
We have another call coming in, let's get to it.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Hey, this is Raging Eater.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Hello my friend, how are you?

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I'm pretty good, how about yourself?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I'm alright, I'm alright.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
What's up, what's on your mind tonight?

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Well, one question, and before I get to it, a few minutes ago you were talking about the Satellaview and whatnot.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Yeah.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Well, aside from the Sega Channel, which I definitely remember hearing about, if memory serves, there was something else that came out right around the same time.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:07.000
It came out for both Super Nintendo and the Genesis, if I remember right.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I think it was called, what, X-Band or something like that?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Yes, yes, there was that thing as well.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
You're right, there was X-Band, I think it was kind of a similar thing as well.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Yep.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Yeah, I honestly don't remember much about it.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:38.000
The only thing I kind of sort of recall is that there were kind of rudimentary lobbies, a little bit of a chat, I think, and of course obviously you could play your games online.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I never got a chance to try it myself because my parents wouldn't allow us, but the technology was there though.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Alright, good to know, good to know. So what was the question you had tonight?

02:14:53.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Well, obviously the two of you, I wouldn't necessarily see everyone in chat, but the vast majority of the people that were in chat are at least to some degree or another into PC gaming.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:22.000
To what extent, that's up to the individual, but at least some people like to play PC games.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:38.000
My question is for the two of you and of course for chat, what were the games or games that got you into PC gaming and why?

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Great question. What were the games that got you into PC gaming and why? I'll start while Loki thinks about that.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Well, see, my story was a little different because I was kind of enabled by the Commodore 64, which was prior to PCs, but that was still a home computer, so it was a PC of sorts, but not an actual PC, if that makes sense.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:14.000
So Commodore 64 was really kind of what enabled me with games, I think even before Nintendo Entertainment System, because sure, I had an Atari 2600, but I probably spent more time on the Commodore 64, because the complexity of the games you could do on the Commodore 64 was even more so.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:21.000
And especially the music, the sound chip in the Commodore 64 was divine, and you had some great music in there.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:36.000
So yeah, I think that was really the gateway that then took me into PC games, but the earliest PC games I remember playing were a lot of the old Sierra stuff, like King's Quest IV and those sorts of point and click adventure games.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:17:02.000
The original Civilization was huge for me. But you know what really sold me on PC, like way back when and something I was really into Rage Nator? It wasn't even so much the games as it was, and I know we've joked about this on the show before, but it was Prodigy, was what really sold me on like, we need a PC in this house, you know, I'm like 12 years old trying to convince my parents, we really need a PC in this house, because Prodigy allowed me to be online and like talk to people.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:15.000
And as somebody who was, believe it or not, a little bit shocked sometimes, because I got picked on a lot in school, I kind of was drawn early to the fact that I could kind of, you know, post on these bulletin boards online.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:24.000
And then I got into the whole BBS thing, which is a whole other story, but I didn't really find out about that until well after, I think I found out about those on Prodigy.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Or maybe it was my dad, actually my dad, there used to be like a newspaper they published here locally, and like the last page of the paper had all the numbers to the BBS's, so I think my dad used to always kind of collect those and tell me I should be participating in them, but not to call long distance or my mother would lose her mind, which is all true.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:54.000
But anyway, so yeah, I guess that's kind of my answer. I don't know if there's really one game I can put my finger on and say this is the reason I needed a PC, but these were all things that really made me a PC gamer. What about you, Loki?

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Shareware, that kind of got me into it. But like first PC was just basically, it was kind of a gift from somebody, like they didn't want their old PC, so I had like SimCity on that.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:23.000
But you know, like purchasing games, a lot of that was driven by shareware, and playing a lot of the shareware demos back then were like pretty substantial, and you know Castle Wolfenstein, that's just one whole campaign, I mean that's quite a lot of game.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:36.000
So it was kind of that, and then you know, like BBS's and stuff, and then finally once the internet came around and you know, doing all that. But yeah, it definitely was driven by just playing shareware games.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:42.000
And what was some of your favorite, I loved the shareware games too, like Commander Keen, that shit was off the hook.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
ZZT, long live!

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Yeah, ZZT was awesome. You know, and also like PC Gamer Magazine, you know a lot of the demos and stuff when they're in there.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So, you know, I didn't have that powerful of a PC at the time, it had 4 megs of RAM, but it was, you know, back then you had to do all sorts of crazy shit to your, you know, different config sys and auto execute bat files to get stuff to run to allocate memory correctly.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:18.000
And all that bullshit that you had to go through, so getting Doom to run, you know, just wouldn't really run on what I had.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:32.000
But you know, Wolfenstein was fun, eventually when I got my own PC, you know, Duke Nukem 3D, I don't know, it was just a lot of, mostly I played console games, but you know, I did a lot of stuff on PC.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Command Conquer, Red Alert.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Ragenator, what about you real quick? And your kiddies, by the way, which of course you see on the cam there. What about you, Ragenator, before we let you go?

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Well, it's kind of a complicated answer. The short version is it's, well, twofold. Everyone knows the BS I had to deal with with my consoles back in 2012.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
That's one reason why I got into PC gaming.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:13.000
And of course, you know, one thing that you always harped on for the longest time is Steam sales, Steam sales, Steam sales, you know.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Now, in cheap games, you know, and plus, you know, not only that, but I always heard about, you know, games being better on PC, be it like Duke Nukem 3D or the Doom series or the Quake series.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Plus, certain games like Diablo 2 never came to console, so I kind of figured, what the hell, if I'm going to have to choose between getting a PC versus getting a console,

02:20:44.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I might as well go with PC. I'll probably save money in the process, long run, and get to play superior versions of whatever game. Plus, I'll get to play games like Diablo 2. So, so far I've been loving it.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in another call here before we call it a night, but thank you as always for your question.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Sure. Have a nice night.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:21.000
You too. And pet those kitties that were in the background there. Let's get to another call. Wow, our phone is, like, ringing off the hook tonight. Hi, you're on Orangeworm's radio. Who's this?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Hey, what's going on, everybody? It's Ranma.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Hey, Ranma. What's up, buddy?

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Oh, not a lot, not a lot, but we need to put on another pot of coffee right now.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Uh-oh. What's up?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Switch.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Oh, the Nintendo Switch. What do you want to say about it?

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Where do I start?

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:47.000
I don't know. What were your thoughts? We'll start with, what was your reaction to the trailer?

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:58.000
The Nintendo Switch is going to be an overpriced piece of junk powered by a customized, underpowered processor.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Ouch. So, you're not a fan.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
No, I am not.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:11.000
What about the games, though, Ranma? I mean, if they have the must-have games on it, isn't the rest of it not going to matter?

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:20.000
In a way, I say the same thing about the Wii U. Yes, the Wii U is $2.99. There are at least ten games on it that I want.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:29.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, $2.99. There's at least three games on each of those consoles that I want.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:37.000
The only difference is, I'd sooner gyrate towards those, because it's technologically a lot more powerful, and I know it can do something with it, you know?

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Whereas the Wii U, yes, has great games, but it's sitting in the corner eating paste.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000
So, the Nintendo Switch really has to come out for the right price.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Yes, and I already said it. If the Switch doesn't drop at $200, I'm not buying it. Simple as that.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:57.000
I think, though, Ranma, $1.99 could be a realistic price for the Switch.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:03.000
No, I don't think so. $2.50 at least. If not more, I would say $2.99, probably.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I think it really depends. I think the big question mark is the dock. For me, it's the dock.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:13.000
The dock has no tech in it. I don't think it has anything in it.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Well, that's what it comes down to. If the dock is doing anything, then it's going to cost more.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:26.000
If the dock is doing nothing except being a pass-through for the TV, then it will cost less, I think.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000
All I can see from the dock, it's a pass-through with two USBs.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Now, my thought was, okay, when you put it in the dock, the dock has more memory, better chipset, and all this other stuff.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And I think that's awesome because right now Alienware has something similar.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000
If you buy this high-end laptop, they have a special docking bay where you connect your laptop to it,

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:54.000
and there is a much more powerful video card in it and other stuff, and you can really do some serious gaming.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
But from what I've been told, it's just a pass-through. That's all it is.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Interesting. I could see $249, Brad from Pod Culture says $249 with a pack-in game. I could see that as well.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:14.000
$249 with a pack-in game? No, I still won't. Because when it goes to price point, let me tell you something.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I just started this side project, and I had to pick up a low-end tablet.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:28.000
So I went out and bought a low-end Windows 10 tablet that doubles as a laptop, more of a tablet,

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:39.000
and I paid about $130 for it. This thing has 2GB of RAM, 64GB of memory, video quality resolution is average by best.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:45.000
What I see on this, it's not even close to the Switch. Now, they're pushing $41.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:54.000
They put it up 1920x1080p, that's what they want. This thing's going to have at least 4GB of memory to run the OS,

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.000
to run the applications, to run the games. Storage? No.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I really see, in order for Nintendo to really make this shine, they've got to take one hell of a loss on each one sold.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Which Nintendo usually doesn't do.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Right. The only time they've done that is when the 3DS first came out. Yes, they were making money off of it,

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:22.000
but then they had to cut the price down to take a loss, now they're making a profit. Same thing with the Wii U, you know?

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Act F does confirm the dock will be included. Nintendo Japan already confirmed it.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.000
So we had theorized one of our many Wheel of Plausibility scenarios that the dock and the thing could be sold separately,

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
but I think that's back when we thought it was two separate systems in one ecosystem,

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:47.000
and I think that talk kind of started to die down when the rumors about it being a Switch basically started to pick up.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:55.000
But anyway, the good news is, at least we know. This is what I wish Nintendo would have done a month ago,

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:01.000
but is it going to change the fact that I'll be there pre-ordering the system to pick up in March? No.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000
They can do whatever they want, I suppose, but sometimes I just kind of look at it and go,

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:11.000
why are you doing this to me, Nintendo? But you know what? If they sell a ton of them, it doesn't really matter what I think.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
If they sell a ton of them, yeah. Because honestly, I'm not getting one, because you know what?

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I already carry around my work tablet. I already carry around my side tablet. I also carry around my 3DS.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I also carry around my phone. There is no room in my bag for another gaming tablet, and whoever buys it,

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:38.000
you better hope and pray that it doesn't get damaged, because the way I see a tablet, that's a one-hole cohesive unit.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Sometimes that screen, that whole thing is getting replaced.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Yeah. I need to see more games, and I guess I'll be waiting until January.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I mean, I'm pretty confident just being the gaming nerd I am. I'm going to get one.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
But I really, really want to see the games to get me more excited about it.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Look, when you get one, me, Loki, Matt, Acta, we're going to redo that whole Genesis commercial when Matt got a Genesis.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000
We're going to redo that whole thing. We're going to knock on the door and be like,

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I heard Sky got a Switch, and we're going to redo that whole commercial. That's what we're going to do.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Well, you know what? The hands-on experience sold Loki a PlayStation VR, so anything is possible. Anything is possible.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go to try to fish for one more call before we wrap up, but thanks for the call.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Hey, no problem, dude.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session or else.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Oh, yeah. Rob, one more thing.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000
What?

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Take the vacation. Anime Jam Session does it every year. Take the vacation. You earned it. You all deserve it.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000
If anyone has a problem with it, send them to me. I'll set them straight.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I appreciate that deeply. I just have a feeling the podcaster in me is not going to let us go three weeks with no content,

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:51.000
but inevitably we'll have to probably go three weeks with no live content. I just don't see how we get around that,

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.000
unless we do a show New Year's Day, which is possible. Anything is possible. We'll see.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000
It's too early for me to think about, so guys, please don't take anything I'm saying.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:07.000
There's a lot of stuff going through my head when it comes to this show, and a lot of decisions are made very knee-jerk sometimes,

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
so we'll talk in December.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Rob, I'll tell you this. At MAGFest, if you're getting that mindset, I'm dragging you to the bar, and I'm shoving shots down your throat.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Can we do that anyway?

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Yes.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.000
All right, sounds good. All right, take care, my friend.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Later.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
All right, bye.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:30.000
All right, we'll see if we can squeeze in one more call. 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Loki, any last minute stories to share with us? I feel like there's a lot we didn't really get around to tonight.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.000
There's some information. It's rumored that there's going to be a new Brothers in Arms game that's in work,

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:45.000
and a new Far Cry Blood Dragon because they were spotted on that SAG-AFTRA list.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Oh, okay. Even though a lot of the SAG-AFTRA lists used codenames. There's a lot of codenames.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000
A lot of codenames, yeah, but those apparently weren't.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Gotcha. Anything else to share?

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000
No. That's about it.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Well, things are pretty quiet on the Skype side, so I think we will close it down and close up shop for the night.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:14.000
We've had a lot of shorter shows recently. I don't know if that's because Jamie not being here and not having that third opinion is shortening things down or what's going on.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000
If we just have less to say or if there's less gaming news, I don't know, but that's that.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:26.000
We're going to wrap things up tonight, but we will be back to do it again in seven days, a Halloween episode, so we'll talk about scary games a little bit.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I don't have an interview booked yet, but I'm going to try to see if I can't get something for next week, especially if this voice actor thing continues another week.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:42.000
I think I would really love to hear, but I also kind of want to be able to cover both sides without starting an argument, so I want to be able to kind of do that respectfully.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:48.000
But I want to see if we can't do something like that next week, but who knows? Stay tuned.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Obviously, at the same time, I don't want to cover it because I want it to be resolved on Monday or Tuesday.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:59.000
That's what I would really like to happen, but we'll see. Anyhow, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Thank you so much for listening to our show, and thank you for downloading it and listening to it live.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Please consider telling a friend about the show. Spread the word, because Orange Launch Radio is the show where every gamer has a voice, but not if we don't have them here.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:21.000
So tell a friend about the show and spread the word. A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes and all that stuff goes an awful long way as well.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Loki, shoot, any final thoughts tonight?

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I don't know. I guess I'll try to work on my game this week. I say that every week and it doesn't end up happening, so I'll try again.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Well, I need to get around to getting Dragon Quest Builders, because I bought that game because I like the demo so much.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:50.000
This is my final thought. I like the game so much, or I like the demo so much, I bought the game, even though I bought it with the slow shipping so I could get the extra credit on it.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Because I knew I'd be in Vegas, I wasn't in a hurry to play it. But boy, I really am not in a rush to play it, because it's still sitting there waiting for me to play. I just haven't gotten around to it.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.000
Maybe tonight. We'll see, now that I have 20 extra minutes than I usually have. We'll see.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Anyway, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. We will see you in seven days to do it all over again. Have a great week everybody, happy gaming, and take care.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:28.000
