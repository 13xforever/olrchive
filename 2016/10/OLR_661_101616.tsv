7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week, Pokemon GO's popularity has risen so high that not only is it mentioned in the mainstream media, but is being actively parodied as well.
20000	27000	There's plenty more from the week's gaming news that doesn't have to do with past lovers, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	45000	Live tonight on October the 16th of 2016 with episode number 661 of our show.
45000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where we tape Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
56000	63000	And joining me here in Studio N7, by my side as he is for the last 661 weeks, Techmaster Loki.
63000	64000	Hello.
64000	65000	How are you, Loki?
65000	66000	I'm fine.
66000	67000	It's pizza breadstick night again.
67000	68000	Yes it is.
68000	71000	It's a good solid dinner.
71000	73000	It's nothing but carbs. Carbs and dip.
73000	74000	Yes.
74000	76000	It's good times, good times.
76000	78000	How was your weekend? Did you have a good weekend?
78000	85000	It's been raining here in Sacramento finally. We're back. The season's just changed overnight. Wasn't it like last week it was like 100 degrees?
85000	87000	And now it's all rainy and windy and stuff?
87000	91000	It wasn't 100 degrees, but yeah, it was in the 80s. It's still supposed to be in the 80s this week.
91000	98000	Alright, crazy. But what does that mean for going out with the kids? You can't really go out and play in the park. Can't go Pokemon Go with the kids and all that.
98000	99000	No.
99000	101000	No. Have to stay indoors.
101000	105000	No, not really. I wasn't indoors today.
105000	106000	No, yeah, you went out?
106000	107000	Yeah.
107000	108000	Yeah?
108000	109000	And get drenched.
109000	110000	Getting drenched? Playing in the rain?
110000	111000	Yeah.
111000	112000	Oh, good times, good times.
112000	114000	It doesn't work very well if there's a lot of water on the screen.
114000	117000	See, it says you're ingressing out in the rain, clearly.
117000	121000	It's like it's doing its own taps and stuff. I'm like, hey, no.
121000	127000	Some pals that I know will put it in a plastic bag and play over the plastic bag.
127000	128000	Yeah, I should have done that.
128000	133000	Yeah, I try not to play in the rain, but you know, sometimes. Sometimes you gotta.
134000	141000	Also, joining us here in studio, we have a guest with us tonight who, you know, he's here all the time.
141000	142000	Hello.
142000	143000	Hi, Shane. How are you?
143000	144000	Fine.
144000	150000	Shane, of course, from the Pokestop podcast, as well as Ranger Pride, both on the Voice of Geeks network also here.
150000	155000	But tonight, Shane is joining us because you actually went in on the PlayStation VR.
155000	162000	Yeah, I think I was like the only one. Well, not the only one. Pretty much the only one of my friends who preordered it and actually kept it.
162000	168000	Yeah. I don't know if you heard last week's OLR, but we got into it a little bit about that Loki and I decided to cancel our preorders.
168000	174000	And I think for both of us, it wasn't really a place of we don't like PlayStation VR. We want it to fail.
174000	178000	It's nothing about that. But I think it was just like the price for me. Anyway, the price was making me nervous.
178000	182000	And it was like, do I really want to be an early adopter? I don't know. But you stuck with it.
182000	188000	Yeah. You know, it's funny. It's, you know, the 100 percent of the Ranger Pride podcast got their PSVR.
188000	191000	So me and Spike both got ours.
191000	202000	And then Spike will have Game Buoy. And I'm sure they'll have an episode dedicated to that coming up, because I'm sure they've been doing something similar to what we were doing tonight where you were letting Loki and I play PlayStation VR a little bit.
202000	203000	Yeah.
203000	209000	So let's talk about that a little bit at the top of the show here. The launch of the PlayStation VR, obviously a pretty big deal.
209000	219000	The fact that console now has VR, which means it's I guess for lack of a better term, it's really easily accessible. It's plug and play, so to speak.
219000	229000	And that's not to say that Oculus and Vive are necessarily like difficult pieces of tech, but they are a little harder since they are with your PC.
229000	237000	And the Vive has those, you know, you got to set those little like, they look like speakers that old school surround sound systems use that you have to hook up.
237000	244000	I mean, don't get me wrong. It's an awesome piece of tech. But, you know, it's kind of like the whole classic PC versus console.
244000	252000	Console kind of establishes your baseline, right? So with the PlayStation VR, you pretty much plug and play, although it is like seven different plugs before you get to go.
252000	255000	And a little baby PlayStation 4, too. It's so cute.
255000	256000	The little processing unit?
256000	258000	Yeah. It's so adorable.
258000	267000	Yeah, it's cute. A little baby PlayStation. Well, tell us about your experience with PlayStation VR here on the launch week, because I was out of town, which we'll talk about a little bit later.
267000	273000	So I didn't get to experience as much, maybe like an hour today. Loki only got to play maybe 15 minutes for the show.
273000	278000	And we'll ask him in a minute here. But what's your experience with PlayStation VR being like, Shane?
278000	292000	I love it. I'm so glad I kept that pre-order. And I really, really hope that Sony doesn't treat it like the Vita or the PSP and actually supports it and keeps it going for, you know, the foreseeable future.
292000	306000	I think it's just an amazing little piece of tech. And literally every game I played for it except for one, I have found something redeeming or really, really liked about it.
306000	311000	And what's funny to me, and the listeners may not realize this, is that you don't own a PlayStation 4 currently.
311000	319000	Right now, yeah, because mine broke. And so it would have cost more to get it fixed than to just wait and get the Pro, because I was going to get the Pro anyway.
320000	325000	So the Pro comes out in just a few weeks. So I don't have the system, but you know, I have friends that have the PS4.
325000	330000	So you kind of, and so you've just been doing the traveling PlayStation VR thing right now?
330000	333000	Yeah, I'm like a demo-er again.
333000	342000	You also have to understand, guys, that Shane is kind of like Norm on, not Norm, who is the guy on, Kramer on Seinfeld that would just show up, right?
342000	344000	No, I don't show up unannounced.
344000	346000	He doesn't show up unannounced, but he'll show up in the PlayStation.
346000	347000	And I have better hair.
347000	354000	Yeah, you do have better hair. And yeah, you're probably funnier. But anyway, tell us about the games that you played. So what have you played?
354000	362000	So the games I purchased, because I got the launch bundle, so I got PlayStation Worlds, which incidentally has my least favorite game on it.
362000	367000	But I also bought Rez, Thumper, and Rush of Blood.
367000	374000	So Rez, Thumper, and Rush of Blood are probably my favorite games that I own.
374000	378000	Rez and Thumper, great, great music games on their own.
378000	387000	They are enhanced by using the PSVR, but I don't think it's a great, or those two games are great indications of what the PSVR can do.
387000	396000	But throw in Rush of Blood, and that is such a fun experience if you like horror and scary rides.
396000	397000	It's really, really fun.
397000	403000	PlayStation Worlds, the game I don't like on there that I played was the luge game.
403000	413000	I don't think it looks good. I don't think I really felt any, like, trippy movement, like, you know, no motion, no feeling like I was in motion on it.
413000	421000	I have the demo disc also. The demo disc has a lot of games now that I'm looking forward to.
421000	425000	It had the harmonics game, which they had, like, four different sections.
425000	429000	The first one, which was just, like, this tropical island visualizer, I didn't care for.
429000	432000	But every other part of that was really fun to me.
432000	435000	It had Kitchen on it. That was pretty freaky.
435000	441000	Couldn't get through it all the way because I just did not like getting that scared and right in my face.
441000	449000	And I loved the Double Fine game. I think it's called Nog. I call it GaNog because it starts with a G.
449000	454000	But it's a puzzle game, and it's not even out yet, but the demo was really fun.
454000	459000	And you just have to figure out everything on your own. It's pretty cool.
459000	468000	Yeah, and then, you know, I watched other people, I watched, like, Flaco Jones and his wife play, like, the VR Playroom.
468000	471000	That was really fun. I played some of that too.
471000	472000	What do you do in the VR Playroom?
472000	474000	It's just, like, little games.
474000	475000	Mini games?
475000	480000	Yeah, so my favorite one that I played was, uh, it's, like, this monster attack.
480000	488000	And one person's the monster that has the VR headset, and you're, like, walking forward and you're, like, using your head to knock down buildings.
488000	490000	It feels really good.
490000	494000	And then at the end, like, the little guys try to fight you, and if they win, they launch you into outer space.
494000	497000	So you're flying backwards, and it feels so cool.
497000	501000	It's all about, like, the motion feelings in these games, I feel like.
501000	505000	One game I also liked, I think it's called Here They Lie, or Where They Lie? I forget.
505000	509000	It's, like, a horror game also. It's on the demo disc.
509000	515000	You actually get to move around in that game yourself, so you control the movement, and it's all first person.
515000	520000	I played it standing up, and it felt really, really weird playing that standing up.
520000	522000	And it was pretty good too.
522000	526000	So I really, really like this. I want more stuff.
527000	532000	I want every game to have some sort of aspect now that comes out that I can play in VR, because it's a lot of fun.
532000	540000	Does that concern you, though? Because you almost kind of just said what my hesitation on being an early adopter of PlayStation VR was.
540000	542000	You just said, I can't wait for more stuff.
542000	546000	Well, there's already a lot of stuff out. I think they said there's, like, 30-something ones.
546000	549000	No, I mean, yeah, we had the list last week. It was gigantic.
549000	557000	To be fair, some of those games were, you have a lot of games that are, like, they're HDTV games, but they have a VR mode.
557000	562000	Like Thumper, basically, right? Which, you know, Thumper, don't get me wrong, Thumper's got a really cool VR mode, so you have games like that.
562000	568000	And then you had other ones that were, like, more like experiences that weren't necessarily, like, full-on, like the Hatsune Miku thing, right?
568000	569000	Yeah, except I never tried that one yet.
569000	571000	Yeah, but that's not really, like, a full game, right?
571000	574000	I don't think it is, but I'm not sure.
575000	581000	Or if it is, it's kind of like, you know, it's, I don't want to say a throwaway, but it's just, like, a demo-y type of situation.
581000	584000	I think it just depends on what you want out of it. Like, yeah, I'd love more games.
584000	589000	But the ones I have right now, I mean, what do I play on my 3DS? Pokemon.
589000	591000	Nothing else, really.
591000	597000	So I could be fine with just Resident Thumper and then my demos forever, probably, and be okay.
597000	599000	I just want more stuff.
599000	604000	Like, imagine doing something in Mass Effect with that, or, you know, anything.
604000	610000	That would be something. If they had a Mass Effect thing that used that, that would be really, really compelling.
610000	618000	I didn't think I'd be even ever considering the purchase of this game, but I'm really considering getting Resident Evil 7 now because of the VR.
618000	625000	Because Kitchen was freaky, and I imagine that the game itself is going to be pretty frightening, too.
625000	633000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and apologies to the chat room because I had pinged out during the opening moments of the show and didn't even realize it.
633000	636000	So if you guys were chatting in the beginning, I missed your comments. Very sorry.
636000	647000	But I'm back, and I do see comments like MXC in chat talking about the Hatsune Miku VR thing is a really simplistic rhythm game, but it doesn't really matter what you do or don't do, lol.
647000	649000	Okay.
649000	652000	Yeah, I know, right? Okay, so you just kind of can do whatever.
652000	653000	I would still like to try it.
653000	660000	But Hatsune Miku is all about kind of like the, it's like half like Barbie dress up thing and with dudes, too.
660000	673000	And then like the stages and stuff and, you know, so I imagine, I figured it was just like, either they took the rhythm game part out of it and was just like a Hatsune Miku concert that you're watching in VR, or maybe had some very simple button taps or something.
673000	680000	Again, that's an assumption. I haven't played it. I was hoping somebody in chat might know how complex it is, or what have you.
681000	687000	Bobby Blackwolf says it's not on the demo disc, but it's in the store. It's a free demo. There's a rhythm game in it. So there you go.
687000	688000	Yeah.
688000	690000	Over to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
690000	693000	Yeah, I queued it up. I just never downloaded it on Falco Jones' system.
693000	694000	Gotcha.
694000	703000	Well, I got to play just a little, now I haven't played it as extensively as Shane has since, you know, I only, I was out of town all weekend, so I only really had an hour today.
703000	716000	But I got to check out the first stage of Rez, and so that was, that was a trip to play in VR. I was really impressed and surprised, because Shane told me, when he put the controller in my hand, he's like, don't use the analog stick, just move your head.
716000	724000	And I was surprised at how well that worked, actually. And so I must have looked like an idiot fighting the boss, because you know how the boss of the first stage is like a disco ball?
724000	726000	Spoiler alert, but it's the first stage.
726000	736000	And so you have to like move your head like completely around to blow off the edge of the disco ball or whatever. I must have looked ridiculous rolling my head around trying to hit everything.
736000	745000	But it actually responded very well, and it was kind of fun to play. And some of the parts of the stage, like I think parts three and four, you're looking at the left wall and then the right wall.
745000	756000	So that was kind of like a trip, and they did that pretty well in VR. Like, you know, because that could probably make you sick with it going to the left and to the right like that, but it worked out really well.
756000	768000	So I enjoyed Rez, and yeah, that was a fun experience. Then I played Thumper, and I played the first stage of that. Now, here's the thing with Thumper, I like the game.
768000	775000	I mean, because I like the demo I played a while ago, but the VR part, to me, it just felt like you were sitting right in front of the TV.
775000	781000	You know how like, I don't know if you guys did this when you were young, but when I was young, sometimes I'd sit right in front of the TV and my mom would say,
781000	792000	Don't sit so close to that TV set. It was kind of one of those things. And it's like, it's like your field of vision. Yes, you can go to the left and go to the right, you know, but it's it's still just kind of like feels like you're just sitting in front of the TV.
792000	812000	But because of what Thumper is, being that it's kind of like a roller coaster kind of game, you know, it kind of works pretty well. And the color, like the the palette changes and the colors and the visuals and everything make it kind of like one of those like visual roller coasters.
812000	819000	Like I feel like this is something we probably paid to do years ago at a theme park. You know what I mean? Like the virtual coasters or something.
819000	830000	So I did enjoy that. And then I played what that same harmonics VR thing. I wasn't as big on that as you were, Shane, I got to admit. I didn't like that.
830000	831000	It's okay that you're wrong.
831000	834000	I didn't like the paint thing as much as you did, but I'm not much of an artist.
834000	850000	The thing is, there's that. But you also like when I was watching you play, you were still like basically looking forward the entire time. And you've got to get out of that mindset. You've got to be like, okay, well, I'm going to like spin this around and then like, look to my left and look down and look all over the place.
850000	851000	I kind of was doing that.
851000	852000	No, not on the paint thing.
852000	859000	But do you remember when I made the giant scribble and then I like pushed it back and I had to like launch it into space? I was kind of doing that. Give me some credit.
859000	862000	No, you're not getting any credit for that.
862000	875000	The dance thing was cute. But again, like, I'm not sure. That's not really a game, right? That's just a concept thing that maybe harmonics thought there could be a game there and there wasn't. I don't know. I don't know.
875000	883000	So, yeah, that was that was okay. And then you made me play the kitchen thing. And I only lasted until the guy got stabbed. And then I was like, nope, it's too much.
883000	886000	Yeah, you didn't even get to the parts that are actually like not fun to watch.
886000	893000	No, it's too much. You know, I don't like that gory stuff. And you guys, the whole time she was like, you gotta play kitchen. You gotta play kitchen, play kitchen, play kitchen.
893000	895000	I would rather you have played...
895000	897000	You should watch me throw his PSVR across the room.
897000	902000	I wanted you actually to play Rush of Blood more than anything because I think that's more fun because that's interactive.
902000	904000	That's probably disgusting, too.
904000	910000	Well, one of the stages super is. And that was the one that Flaco Jones's wife had her head down the entire time.
910000	919000	And you see what they're seeing on the TV. So he sees your character's legs and she's just screaming. It's so good.
919000	927000	Alan Alchemy in our chat says, Shane streamed it on Periscope. This is about me playing Rez with the title Idiot Spins Around.
927000	930000	Thank God I don't think Shane knows how to use Periscope.
930000	932000	I've heard of that thing before.
932000	935000	I'm going to be thankful for that for a minute here.
935000	938000	So what do you think the future for PlayStation VR holds, Shane?
938000	941000	Hopefully lots of games and lots of support.
941000	949000	I think the developers will be on board if Sony actually pushes it.
949000	956000	I worry because I feel like there wasn't a lot of push the month and a half leading up to the launch.
956000	961000	I don't feel like the word was out there except if you went to Taco Bell.
961000	963000	Or Best Buy. They have the demos.
964000	969000	Or Best Buy. But then again, I don't have TV. So I don't know if there's commercials on TV.
969000	979000	And I didn't see a lot on websites either. So I worry that this is going to be like the move was.
979000	985000	I mean, it's integrated into this, but the move is like, oh, this is so cool. A month later, what's the move? Nobody cares.
985000	988000	I think this deserves better than that.
988000	996000	So you're more concerned with the track record of the move came out, disappeared. The Vita came out, disappeared.
996000	1002000	PSP lasted a little bit longer, but also it stopped being supported.
1002000	1008000	What else? The PlayStation Eye back in the day, that had a few games and it wasn't supported.
1008000	1012000	And this is way more expensive than all of those.
1012000	1015000	So Sony just has to let this one ride a little longer.
1015000	1018000	Yeah. They can't give up on it as quickly.
1018000	1019000	Okay. That's fair.
1019000	1024000	And I just, I don't want to, especially like, you know, I played it at the PlayStation Experience last year.
1024000	1029000	I thought it was cool, but now they actually have my hands on the final product in playing the games.
1029000	1032000	Like, I really think it's such a good product.
1032000	1036000	Okay. So some folks in chat are saying that PSVR is on TV.
1036000	1041000	Bobby Blackwell saying there were Taco Bell commercials on TV all showing PSVR.
1041000	1042000	But I think you mentioned that.
1042000	1043000	I just see it at Taco Bell.
1043000	1045000	Also saying they were all over football.
1045000	1051000	So if they're advertising this on Monday Night Football, that's, well, but those are people with money, Shane.
1051000	1055000	And then Kaijuto says PSVR is all over TV. GameStop advertised it for months.
1055000	1059000	Okay. Well, that's good. You know, things that I don't necessarily see.
1059000	1062000	I'm glad it is getting like some recognition out there.
1062000	1066000	And I hope, like I was hearing things about it selling out. So that's also a good sign, I guess.
1066000	1071000	But especially at that price point, I just, I don't want it to fail.
1071000	1076000	I think it's so much fun. And it's such a better way to get VR in the hands of people.
1076000	1079000	Because you don't have to have a super expensive computer and a setup.
1079000	1083000	And you don't have to constantly be upgrading your system like you would for a computer.
1083000	1092000	Right. I can still see, like, having tried all of these, I can kind of still see where, like, the Vive is kind of like the Mercedes of VR right now.
1092000	1094000	You know what I mean? Like, it's the high-end VR.
1094000	1098000	But, like, PlayStation VR is kind of like, it's a Toyota Camry.
1098000	1099000	But see.
1099000	1100000	It's reliable.
1100000	1101000	I don't know what it is either.
1101000	1102000	You don't know what a Toyota Camry is?
1102000	1104000	I don't.
1104000	1107000	But, it's like, this has...
1107000	1109000	I should have named a Korean guy. Then he'd know.
1109000	1115000	This has the potential to reach more people, I think, than any of the other VR platforms.
1115000	1119000	So, I hope that it actually does.
1119000	1122000	Loki, we haven't really talked to you about this.
1122000	1124000	I mean, I know you didn't get to spend a lot of time on PlayStation VR.
1124000	1126000	But what's your initial thoughts?
1126000	1128000	Kind of, what did you check out and what do you think?
1128000	1133000	Well, I played the Eve Valkyrie demo, which was pretty awesome.
1133000	1136000	I gotta say, it was quite immersive.
1136000	1141000	And the only thing I don't particularly like, and it could have been just because I didn't adjust the headset really,
1141000	1146000	is on the outside there's really bad pixel separation.
1146000	1150000	So, like, you can actually see, like, the colors are separated.
1150000	1152000	You didn't adjust it right then.
1152000	1153000	Yeah.
1153000	1154000	You can get rid of that.
1154000	1156000	That's the only complaint I had.
1156000	1159000	But I would say, like, you have to find the sweet spot.
1159000	1163000	Like, it's definitely one of those things where you have to, like, kind of just, like, find the sweet spot.
1163000	1166000	And, like, the littlest outside of that will kind of throw you out of it.
1166000	1171000	But, yeah, like, especially, like, the Eve demo, they have you, basically, you're in your ship.
1171000	1174000	And then it kind of launches you off.
1174000	1176000	And then you're getting into a dogfight and stuff.
1176000	1180000	So, you know, definitely, and the ship is kind of immersive.
1180000	1182000	You can see your body and everything, which is kind of cool.
1182000	1185000	And then that launch, you know, you definitely feel like that.
1185000	1187000	And they feel like, oh.
1187000	1188000	But it was awesome, though.
1188000	1190000	And I had a lot of fun with it.
1190000	1194000	And I thought it was a really good representation of, you know, kind of what it can show off.
1194000	1195000	And they tried Res.
1195000	1197000	And Res is just kind of eh.
1197000	1200000	Honestly, I just don't really gain that much from Res.
1200000	1201000	I mean, it's all right.
1201000	1206000	It's just the demo, they really should have, like, polished that demo.
1206000	1210000	Because, I mean, the music is, like, choppy in the demo.
1210000	1212000	I hope it's not like that in the full game.
1212000	1216000	And just, you know, I don't know.
1216000	1217000	All right.
1217000	1221000	Well, in that demo, because I didn't even realize that they had a demo on there.
1221000	1224000	They chopped the stages, Taylor.
1224000	1226000	That wasn't the right stage, because it gave you Area 4's boss.
1226000	1229000	But it started you, like, halfway through Area 1.
1229000	1231000	They just skip around to kind of give you an idea of what the game looks like.
1231000	1239000	But, yeah, it's just, I wish, I don't know, I kind of wish that they polished that demo a little bit better.
1239000	1243000	Because it's like, this is a music game and the music shouldn't be choppy.
1243000	1246000	Yeah, that's because, well, the full game worked fine.
1246000	1247000	So, yeah.
1247000	1251000	Anyway, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1251000	1252000	Let's see.
1252000	1253000	What was it about Twitch?
1253000	1254000	Oh, yeah.
1254000	1259000	Jason, VX Jason, our voiceover guy says, before I rage resubscribe to Twitch Turbo.
1259000	1260000	I'm curious what the story is there.
1260000	1265000	80% of my stream pre-roll ads were Taco Bell slash PSVR.
1265000	1267000	I don't have Twitch ads anymore.
1267000	1269000	Thanks to the whole thing last week with Twitch Prime.
1269000	1270000	Yeah, it's kind of the same thing.
1270000	1277000	Alan Alchemy in chat saying, Sony catches shit for releasing the move and then forgetting it entirely, which is valid.
1277000	1284000	Microsoft continues to support the Kinect out of a commitment to the technology because they don't feel they've found its full potential yet.
1284000	1286000	Won't let it die, catches shit for it.
1286000	1288000	Wait, I thought they already let it die.
1288000	1289000	They've already let it die.
1289000	1290000	Yeah, they did.
1290000	1297000	But I get Alan's point is because he's saying, like, when the Xbox One first came out, like, you know, they kind of were forcing Kinect for a little bit.
1297000	1299000	Like, they really tried to make Kinect happen.
1299000	1305000	But I think the problem was, see, there's kind of a little bit of a difference here, but I also see this point to some extreme.
1305000	1315000	Is that with Kinect, it was becoming all, what, dancing games, exercise games.
1315000	1316000	Like, Kinect could not-
1316000	1322000	And they even made it like, oh, you know, this is the best way to, like, browse your TV stuff, too.
1322000	1324000	Like, you just wave your hand and, no.
1324000	1331000	It just couldn't really break outside and show us, like, that game that everybody had to have outside of maybe, like, Dance Central.
1331000	1335000	But, you know, Dance Central kind of came and went, and then what, you know?
1335000	1349000	But with PSVR, and where I would say maybe that comparison does have some weight is because I would not want to see PlayStation VR just become a bunch of, like, on-rails experiences.
1349000	1353000	And it sounds like a lot of stuff that's out right now are these rail games.
1353000	1355000	Well, and I think the reason is-
1355000	1358000	And that could just be the games I'm into, and that's fine, but, you know.
1358000	1368000	Well, I think that also one of the reasons that they do that is because when you have that separate motion where you're moving your character around and then you have your head movement as well, it might make people feel sick.
1368000	1370000	Well, they need to get over it then, and those people shouldn't play those games.
1370000	1371000	Exactly.
1371000	1372000	No, it's true.
1372000	1373000	No, exactly.
1373000	1378000	Like, no, it's just, like, the here they lie or whatever, where they lie, whatever that game's called.
1378000	1384000	You get to move yourself around, and like I said, I played it standing up and it felt really weird.
1384000	1389000	But I enjoyed having that freedom, and it's not like I threw up while playing it.
1389000	1397000	So, you know, just because you get motion sick doesn't mean that everybody else shouldn't have the cool games because you suck.
1397000	1400000	Well, if Jamie was here, she would read you to filth.
1400000	1408000	Anyway, but what I was going to say about the whole, I think what Rez did good is Rez gives you different options.
1408000	1410000	I think accessibility is important.
1410000	1411000	Yeah, okay.
1411000	1417000	And so Rez gives you options, is you have, like, you can play kind of, like, minor motion or you can play major motion.
1417000	1418000	Yeah.
1418000	1421000	And I think that's a good compromise, right?
1421000	1423000	No, actually, I don't agree.
1423000	1431000	Because, again, if you get sick from, if you get motion sickness, you should know that you should not be playing that game.
1431000	1432000	Exactly.
1432000	1440000	It shouldn't hurt the other people or it shouldn't be withheld from the other people because your body has a physical reaction to it that, you know,
1440000	1441000	is unfortunate.
1441000	1446000	What's, okay, I don't, what's wrong with the developers accommodating both?
1446000	1449000	Because, like, for example, let's bring up Jamie again.
1449000	1451000	Jamie gets motion sick with first-person shooter games.
1451000	1454000	Should we just stop making first-person shooter games because...
1454000	1458000	What kind of accessibility feature would you make it so you couldn't get sick off of that?
1458000	1460000	Like, would you only always be able to look for it?
1460000	1461000	Would it be, like, classic Doom?
1461000	1465000	That, I mean, that would be your only other option.
1465000	1466000	Counterpoint.
1466000	1468000	Skyrim has the over-the-shoulder look.
1468000	1469000	So does Mass Effect.
1469000	1472000	You can go from first-person over-the-shoulder and the game doesn't really change.
1472000	1474000	Yeah, but that sucks.
1474000	1475000	Why?
1475000	1476000	I don't like that version.
1476000	1477000	But that's you!
1477000	1478000	That, that's an okay change.
1478000	1479000	That's an okay change.
1479000	1482000	But you can't say something like a first-person sh-
1482000	1487000	Well, no, because then it just turns to, it turns into an entirely different genre at that point.
1487000	1491000	I don't think that the resources would be there.
1491000	1494000	Alright, this is, this is going down a different path.
1494000	1496000	I want to get back to the VR stuff.
1496000	1500000	So, Shane, you're happy with your purchase.
1500000	1502000	You're gonna stick with it.
1502000	1507000	Is there anything down the road you're looking forward to that's scheduled to be released?
1507000	1509000	I haven't done a lot of research, to be honest.
1509000	1513000	So, right now, based on what I've played and know is not out,
1513000	1516000	Resident Evil 7, probably, in that Gnog game.
1516000	1517000	Like, whatever.
1517000	1518000	Gnog.
1518000	1519000	It's not Gnog, but that's what I say.
1519000	1521000	Oh, there was another game.
1521000	1523000	I forget what it's called.
1523000	1528000	But it's a, like, point-and-click sort of adventure thing, and it's puzzles.
1528000	1530000	Anything with puzzles, I'm just sold on.
1530000	1533000	Like, the puzzle stuff in that is so much fun to me.
1533000	1535000	So, I want more puzzle games.
1535000	1537000	Was it Super Hypercube?
1537000	1541000	That has, it's on the demo disc in the sense that you can look and buy it,
1541000	1543000	but there's no demo. It's really dumb.
1543000	1545000	So, I don't even know what that's like.
1545000	1547000	Thanks, Polytron.
1547000	1550000	But, I do want to play that, because it's one of the better games, too.
1550000	1554000	So, yeah. I don't know what else is out there, or is coming.
1554000	1557000	All right. Well, I mean, it was neat to play,
1557000	1560000	and I'm looking forward to seeing what else comes out.
1560000	1563000	I'm really curious about what this whole Final Fantasy XV side thing is all about.
1563000	1565000	Oh, yeah. That thing. I don't even, whatever.
1565000	1568000	I'm curious what it is, exactly. What is it? Will I be into it?
1568000	1571000	You know, it's really just going to take that one or two games
1571000	1574000	that are going to make me really jump in.
1574000	1578000	Can I get, like, a proper Dead or Alive game so I can look up at the guys' crotches
1578000	1580000	like they do in the girls' ones?
1580000	1582000	Because that's a thing.
1582000	1585000	So, you can do it for the girls. Why can't you do it for the guys, too?
1585000	1587000	I'd get that game.
1587000	1589000	Oh, because...
1589000	1592000	Oh, now you want to have both versions.
1592000	1594000	Now you want to have two different versions.
1594000	1596000	That has nothing to do with the gameplay.
1596000	1598000	Anyway.
1598000	1601000	I was going to say, the only thing that's kind of disappointing about Eve,
1601000	1604000	isn't Eve supposed to be, like, an MMO or something like that?
1604000	1606000	I don't think the VR version is.
1606000	1608000	No, I think it's kind of like the lore is based.
1608000	1610000	Yeah, I think it's a side thing.
1610000	1613000	It shouldn't be this confusing already before the game's even released.
1613000	1617000	Well, I think that game's already out on, like, the other VR platforms.
1617000	1620000	So, I think this is just catching up.
1620000	1622000	I don't know. It was neat.
1622000	1627000	Kind of wish I still had my pre-order, but there was a lot of money.
1627000	1629000	And I didn't have that money at the time.
1629000	1633000	At the end of the day, it's like, okay, I can still like it and go,
1633000	1636000	but it's still a lot of money that I can use for other stuff,
1636000	1638000	such as the trip I took this weekend.
1638000	1640000	And the headset.
1640000	1644000	After trying a few headsets, that headset's very comfortable.
1644000	1646000	And that's kind of what all the reviews have said.
1646000	1648000	And yeah, it's incredibly comfortable.
1648000	1650000	Yeah, I'll give it that too, yeah.
1650000	1652000	So, I mean, I don't know.
1652000	1654000	Down the road, definitely.
1654000	1658000	But I also am still kind of concerned with some of the missing features.
1658000	1662000	Because, for example, Job Simulator and stuff,
1662000	1666000	it's not as good in PlayStation VR versus playing it on the Vive.
1666000	1669000	Like, there's a lot more freedom of movement that you can do on the Vive.
1669000	1671000	That game's fucking hilarious on the Vive.
1671000	1673000	I haven't seen it on the PlayStation 4 yet.
1673000	1676000	We tried it the other night, and it was awful.
1676000	1677000	Really?
1677000	1680000	You know, that is my worry right there.
1680000	1683000	We played it at DragonCon, and it was hilarious.
1683000	1684000	But it was on the Vive.
1684000	1687000	Yeah, it wasn't responsive enough for what we were trying to do.
1687000	1688000	Exactly.
1688000	1690000	See, this is what my worry is.
1690000	1696000	Yeah, I like Eve and stuff, but I would probably like Eve as well on the Vive.
1696000	1703000	And so, I gotta watch myself before I'm getting excited about a product like this.
1703000	1707000	Because, you know, I'll buy it and play these games.
1707000	1708000	Oh, these work fantastic.
1708000	1710000	And then I see something else like Job Simulator.
1710000	1711000	Like, man, that looks hilarious.
1711000	1712000	I'm gonna play it.
1712000	1716000	And then you get that experience on the PlayStation VR.
1716000	1722000	And it's like, wow, this is not representative of what I saw in that video from the Vive version or something.
1722000	1725000	It's like playing Mortal Kombat on the Game Boy versus playing on the Genesis.
1725000	1727000	Maybe not that extreme, but, you know.
1727000	1728000	Right, yeah.
1728000	1733000	Well, and maybe there's just an optimal setup for the PSVR version too that we just didn't have.
1733000	1736000	I know it can't be as good at all, but...
1736000	1738000	It's not the VR at all.
1738000	1740000	It's the fucking move controllers.
1740000	1742000	Those controllers are god fucking awful.
1742000	1743000	Interesting.
1743000	1744000	They were good for Rush of Blood.
1744000	1745000	Love them and that.
1745000	1746000	All right.
1746000	1751000	Well, let's move on and talk about other games we've been playing this week that maybe weren't necessarily the PlayStation VR.
1751000	1753000	We always like to do this towards the top of the show.
1753000	1755000	Talk about our gaming weeks.
1755000	1756000	Loki, we'll start with you.
1756000	1757000	How was your gaming week?
1757000	1760000	I wish I had played more, but it was basically just Ingress this week.
1760000	1764000	And I reluctantly played as much as I did.
1764000	1766000	I mean, I don't know.
1768000	1773000	Yeah, I really didn't want to play it as much as I did, but I did.
1773000	1774000	And then...
1774000	1776000	Don't overdo it or you'll never play it again.
1776000	1778000	Well, it's just...
1778000	1779000	It's like...
1779000	1780000	It's...
1780000	1781000	I get it.
1781000	1782000	It's getting like a chore.
1782000	1783000	It's getting nature.
1783000	1784000	It's just...
1784000	1785000	It's getting...
1785000	1786000	It's like a chore.
1786000	1788000	It's like there's so much pressure.
1788000	1790000	Like, oh, we want to win ten times in a row.
1790000	1792000	And it's like, okay, cool.
1792000	1794000	Who's gonna come assist me with this?
1794000	1795000	Waiting.
1795000	1796000	Waiting.
1796000	1797000	No one?
1797000	1798000	Oh, great.
1798000	1800000	I get to take on six people from the other side.
1800000	1801000	And guess what?
1801000	1806000	A bunch of them are retired and playing whenever the fuck they want to play.
1806000	1809000	Because they're retired and that's all the fuck that they do.
1809000	1812000	They've dedicated their lives to this phone game.
1812000	1814000	I don't want to become that person.
1814000	1818000	That, as I'm saying, is like, dude, I gotta go to fucking work.
1818000	1823000	I've got a window of like maybe 15 minutes in the morning and maybe 30 minutes coming home.
1823000	1824000	And that's it.
1824000	1825000	I don't have...
1825000	1828000	I'm waking up at two in the morning and I'm gonna go field.
1828000	1829000	Yeah, no.
1829000	1833000	You have to play within your limits or it's just gonna drive you bonkers.
1833000	1835000	So it's just ridiculous.
1835000	1836000	So there's that.
1836000	1842000	I wanted to play other games, but once again, I was trying to work on my game, which ended up not happening.
1842000	1844000	Surprise, I know.
1844000	1845000	I'm sure everyone's shocked.
1845000	1849000	Instead, I was working on actually work stuff.
1849000	1852000	And then on top of that, I would...
1852000	1857000	The only thing I have brain power for is actually watching YouTube videos.
1857000	1861000	And I've been watching one YouTuber, Carl Sagan 42.
1861000	1862000	I don't know his actual name.
1862000	1863000	Maybe it is Carl.
1863000	1864000	Probably not.
1864000	1871000	But he is a speed runner and, you know, just super...
1871000	1874000	Like a Mario Maker aficionado.
1874000	1878000	I mean, he plays like some crazy ass hard levels and stuff and just kinda...
1878000	1879000	I don't know.
1879000	1882000	It's just fun and very relaxing to watch him play that stuff.
1882000	1886000	And so that's what I've been relaxing with is watching him play Super Mario Maker levels.
1886000	1888000	And there's a lot of cool stuff that you can do with that game.
1888000	1890000	And that game looks still pretty fun.
1890000	1891000	Just...
1891000	1899000	I'm like literally fighting staying awake or like days like today where I have a migraine for half the day.
1899000	1901000	And that's always fun too.
1901000	1907000	Trying to concentrate on programming with your head throbbing and you're trying to keep your eyes open.
1907000	1909000	So that's what I've been fighting with.
1910000	1912000	Alright, well, feel better.
1912000	1914000	Let's move on to Shane.
1914000	1915000	How was your gaming week?
1915000	1917000	What did you play besides PSVR?
1917000	1920000	I only played two games regularly other than that.
1920000	1923000	So World of Warcraft now and Pokemon.
1923000	1924000	That's it.
1924000	1925000	That's all I play.
1925000	1926000	Well, tell us a little bit about...
1926000	1929000	Obviously, we know all about Pokemon already because of the other show.
1929000	1931000	Okay, what number is your shiny collection up to?
1931000	1932000	Let's get an update.
1932000	1933000	97.
1933000	1934000	Oh, you're almost to 100.
1934000	1935000	Almost to 100.
1935000	1936000	What was the most recent one?
1937000	1942000	Most recent one was a Barbarical, I think.
1942000	1943000	Okay.
1943000	1947000	And we will tape another Pokemon Stop podcast this coming weekend.
1947000	1952000	But you are going to get the Japanese demo for Sun and Moon this morning.
1952000	1953000	Tomorrow.
1953000	1954000	Yeah.
1954000	1957000	Because it should go up midnight Japanese time.
1957000	1959000	So that's about 8 a.m. our time.
1959000	1962000	So I'll be at work, but my DS will be ready to go.
1962000	1963000	Downloading.
1963000	1964000	Keep refreshing.
1964000	1965000	That's exactly what I plan on doing.
1965000	1968000	It's like trying to order concert tickets while you're at work where you have the tiny,
1968000	1971000	tiny window in the bottom corner refreshing.
1971000	1972000	That's true.
1972000	1974000	So I'm pumped.
1974000	1977000	Okay, tell us a little bit about World of Warcraft and your return to that.
1977000	1979000	What made you return to it?
1979000	1980000	Why are you playing it more?
1980000	1982000	I was hearing good things about it.
1982000	1984000	This expansion after that last one was just awful.
1984000	1986000	I was like, okay, I'll give it a shot.
1986000	1990000	And I've got a good group of people I play with and I'm actually having a good time.
1990000	1992000	And so it's been really fun.
1992000	1999000	I max level on one of my characters and I tank for them and it's pretty cool.
1999000	2000000	I like it.
2000000	2001000	What do you do?
2001000	2002000	I tank.
2002000	2003000	I just said that.
2003000	2004000	You log in and what do you do?
2004000	2006000	I play the game.
2006000	2007000	I do quests.
2007000	2010000	They have daily world quests now.
2010000	2016000	You can get some good loot from that and the app on the phone helps too.
2016000	2017000	I don't know.
2017000	2019000	Just a fun little thing to kill time with.
2019000	2022000	But once Pokemon starts up, I know I'm just dropping everything.
2022000	2024000	Absolutely everything will be dropped.
2024000	2025000	Canceling your sub.
2025000	2028000	I took six days off of work for Pokemon.
2028000	2029000	Oh my god.
2029000	2031000	So I am ready.
2031000	2033000	I can barely get the time off to go to Vegas for a week.
2033000	2039000	Well, okay, technically I took four, but I'm taking the Thursday off that Pokemon comes out in Japan digitally for me.
2039000	2043000	And then Friday I'm taking off and then I have Saturday, Sunday off already and then I'm taking Monday, Tuesday off.
2043000	2045000	So six days.
2045000	2046000	All right.
2046000	2047000	Yep.
2047000	2048000	So my gaming week.
2048000	2053000	I played a lot of Final Fantasy XIV because this weekend I was at Final Fantasy Fan Fest.
2053000	2056000	I'll come back to this topic in a little bit because Final Fantasy XIV is also in the news this week.
2056000	2059000	So I will talk a little more about Fan Fest in a moment.
2059000	2066000	But before Fan Fest, because I didn't leave for Fan Fest until Wednesday, I was still playing Final Fantasy XIV at home, of course.
2066000	2068000	Kind of similar to what Shane's doing in WoW.
2068000	2070000	I'm doing it Final Fantasy.
2070000	2077000	I have to admit, for me, I knew I would not be able to substantiate two MMOs at the same time and something's got to give.
2077000	2082000	And for me, I've kind of hit that point in WoW where I'm like, I don't know what else I can do.
2082000	2088000	I guess I could do Mythic Dungeons, but you have to have a pre-made group to do Mythics, right?
2088000	2089000	Correct.
2089000	2092000	See? And I just don't think I'm going to get that.
2092000	2095000	Well, I think it's just, you know, your server choice, too.
2095000	2100000	Like, if you come play with our friends, or my friends, I think you'd have people to play with.
2100000	2106000	I just, I don't know. And it's kind of, but again, even if I could do that, would I still want to really play for two MMOs?
2106000	2111000	I don't know. And actually, Shane, that shouldn't matter because everything is cross-server in World of Warcraft.
2111000	2114000	So if you really wanted to do that, I could go right now.
2114000	2116000	Well, I don't want to invite you to my server.
2116000	2124000	Well, then that's not helping. So yeah, I just kind of feel like I've hit this point in WoW where it's like, all right, I guess I've kind of done everything.
2124000	2132000	I really wish, and you know, I don't want to turn this into a 14 versus WoW thing because you can like both games.
2132000	2136000	I do like both games, but at the end of the day, I'm only paying one sub-fee.
2136000	2140000	But I think one thing that's very appealing to me about 14 that WoW doesn't have is it's like,
2140000	2151000	if I want to do another character at level 110 and try to do the end game stuff, I have to level it all the way from start or pay for a boost or...
2151000	2152000	That boost is way too much money.
2152000	2156000	It's way too much money. And it's just, I have to kind of play through everything again.
2156000	2165000	Whereas in Final Fantasy, I can equip a new weapon and yes, I have to gain the levels, but I don't have to do the story.
2165000	2175000	Did I say 11? I meant 14. I don't have to do the story from scratch, which, you know, to be fair, 14 has got a long fucking story, especially compared to World of Warcraft.
2175000	2177000	So it's like, thank God I don't have to play through that again.
2177000	2188000	But on the flip side, you have less ways to go through and get easy XP. Like, you have to fake grind or leave grind or dungeon grind at that point.
2188000	2190000	And now there's Deep Dungeon 2 is another option.
2190000	2191000	Or that thing, whatever that is.
2191000	2196000	Yeah. So they're trying to come up with some other ways too. And I'm not sure if the books allow you to do that, but anyway.
2196000	2202000	So, I don't know. That's just one thing that is kind of attracting me to 14 right now over WoW.
2202000	2207000	But anyway, I don't want to get into that debate, but it's just like, you know, I can't pay for two MMOs forever.
2207000	2214000	However, World of Warcraft, you can pay for your sub with gold and I think I have enough gold to pay for another month.
2214000	2221000	So I probably will do that to expand my WoW subscription at least through this patch 7.1, because I do want to see this whole Karazhan thing.
2221000	2224000	And the return of Karazhan, because I'm very interested in that.
2224000	2227000	That's a Mythic Dungeon, by the way, from what I understand.
2227000	2232000	Is it? Great. Well, then maybe I won't see it and I'll be justified in canceling.
2232000	2239000	As far as other stuff I've been doing, I downloaded the demo for Dragon Quest Builders.
2239000	2245000	And I wasn't expecting to like the game because I appreciate Minecraft, I like Minecraft.
2245000	2252000	But then you start to see all the clones and you're like, okay, I don't know how much, if I like Minecraft that much to play all these other things.
2252000	2257000	But, long story short, I really like that Dragon Quest Builders demo.
2257000	2266000	Like it was just cute enough retro Dragon Quest stuff without being too Minecrafty.
2266000	2271000	Like, yes, you collect items and you create things and you place them in certain places.
2271000	2280000	Although, unlike Minecraft, there's actually a very rich story to this where you actually build floor plans that people want to see and all this other stuff.
2280000	2285000	So I feel like there's more of a goal and something to kind of work towards in Dragon Quest.
2285000	2289000	And yeah, I just, I had a really good time playing that. So I ended up buying the full game.
2289000	2295000	And so that got here while I was out in Vegas. So yeah, I'm excited to play some more of that.
2295000	2304000	And then speaking of Dragon Quest, since I had a lot of time on the plane and at the airport and so forth, I finally spent some real quality time.
2304000	2310000	Shane's gonna hate me for this, but oh well. I finally spent some quality time on my 3DS playing Dragon Quest 7.
2310000	2318000	And guess what? Apparently we're already done with the Pokemon podcast because you don't play it anymore.
2318000	2321000	So we just canceled it. Just canceled it. It's over.
2321000	2323000	That's not just come on.
2323000	2330000	Okay, but do I give you crap because you play PlayStation VR sometimes as opposed to Pokemon?
2330000	2332000	I mean, you can play other games.
2332000	2333000	Well, what am I doing right now?
2333000	2341000	You're also sick. But anyway, I really enjoy Dragon Quest 7. Have you even tried Dragon Quest 7?
2341000	2346000	I played it on PS1 and I know not to buy another game when I have something else coming up.
2346000	2350000	Oh, Sun and Moon. That's still a ways away though. You got some time.
2350000	2354000	No, it's like a month. It is literally like a month and a couple days.
2354000	2363000	So I played through the beginning of Dragon Quest 7 and I played through enough of it where I finally got to actual battles.
2363000	2370000	Because Dragon Quest 7, there's like a good maybe two hours of the game before you even get into a single battle.
2370000	2374000	So I got through all that and I got to battles and yeah, I'm still in the early stages.
2374000	2377000	Dragon Quest 7 is a long game so I'm still in the kind of beginning part of it.
2377000	2382000	But yeah, I like it for a grindy Japanese RPG. I like it well enough.
2382000	2384000	So yeah, I've been having a good time with that.
2384000	2391000	So yep, it's been a very square Enix week between all the Final Fantasy and all the Dragon Quest.
2391000	2394000	I guess this is what it is.
2394000	2398000	SSG100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2399000	2404000	Wait, Shane isn't buying or watching Power Rangers right this second. I guess he's not a fan anymore.
2404000	2413000	I actually have one coming to me that I already bought and right now in my area there are no Power Ranger things to buy.
2413000	2419000	And I did just save a picture of shirtless Riley onto my iPad so I'm pretty much doing my job. Thanks.
2419000	2427000	Alright, anyhow. Let's see. Let's get into some housekeeping real quick before we get into the news for tonight.
2427000	2436000	There will be no live show on November the 13th, but we are going to try to tape something in advance for you guys.
2436000	2442000	I will be out of town yet again, but we still got a good four episodes or so before we get there.
2442000	2447000	So that's really it. Otherwise, follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
2447000	2450000	We're also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O L R.
2450000	2455000	Oh, these are some good questions in chat. I'll ask you these real quick, even though it's not really video games.
2455000	2458000	But anytime the chatters are going to give Shane a little crap, I'm for it.
2458000	2460000	I'll give it right back. So it doesn't matter.
2460000	2464000	It's not that bad. Stop. He says, Shane's in mourning after the new trailer.
2464000	2469000	Give him a break and try. Tiger Claw says, what does he think of the Power Rangers trailer?
2469000	2475000	Oh, well, you'll hear about it also on my podcast. Ranger pride. Good tease.
2475000	2480000	Or you can hear about it on another one I was on this week, but I actually didn't really care for it.
2480000	2484000	Just the trailer. Yeah, I did it. I thought you liked it.
2484000	2487000	No, you never talked to me about the trailer. I thought we did talk about it.
2487000	2490000	No, I watched the trailer and I thought it was pretty good.
2490000	2493000	No, it had spoilers for the show.
2493000	2497000	It has nothing like in it that screams Power Rangers until the very end.
2497000	2504000	And that is worrisome to me. Like it didn't feel anything to do with Power Rangers to me.
2504000	2513000	That was actually kind of the hook that got me in because as a Power Rangers fan, I would kind of like it to be about Power Rangers.
2513000	2518000	All right. Enough of that. You stay tuned for your show to hear more about that unless your show gets canceled.
2518000	2521000	All right. Let's move networks.
2521000	2525000	Because I did not see James Van Der Beek at all in this trailer.
2525000	2528000	Were you confused? Or Katie Sackhoff. She was nowhere to be found.
2528000	2535000	And honestly, you know, with the announcement of Bryan Cranston in there and who's the other guy?
2535000	2539000	I want to see more of them in the trailer, but, you know, I guess not.
2539000	2544000	All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Starting us off tonight, Loki.
2544000	2548000	All right. So since we were talking about PlayStation VR, let's talk about PlayStation VR some more.
2548000	2555000	And Sony is basically saying that they're expecting to sell 2.6 million units by the end of the year.
2555000	2560000	Apparently they've had quite a few units already sold.
2560000	2564000	Wow. That's actually not even a really they have a pretty exact number.
2564000	2569000	They'll sell about two million six hundred and two thousand three hundred and seventy units.
2569000	2570000	That's pretty exact.
2570000	2574000	Is that based on preorders or something or is that based on what their factories made?
2574000	2581000	I don't know how they factor that down to such an exact number, but it could be how many they're making.
2581000	2588000	Maybe they fill their soul out of all of them. I know. But that's a pretty neat estimate.
2588000	2592000	I guess it's selling pretty well from what I hear would. Now, I don't have the numbers in front of me.
2592000	2602000	But would that mean that the PlayStation they would sell? Are they expecting to sell more PlayStation VRs than we use the first Christmas?
2602000	2608000	I don't know, but I think it's probably doable. Maybe. I don't know. That's that's something else that happens.
2608000	2617000	It has more games for it. Well, I mean, as much as you're kind of making a sass joke right now, it's kind of facts like.
2617000	2620000	So that was the truth. Yeah, I was doing.
2620000	2625000	I'm curious to see how much the total library is like on. I'm talking like physical games.
2625000	2630000	How many physical games were out on the Wii U? Because I don't think it was too many. No, it wasn't.
2630000	2636000	I think it was between 12 to 14. I think when it first launched. No, I mean, now.
2636000	2644000	I mean, I think that the amount of physical games total now is not very large. But who knows?
2644000	2648000	So another neat thing, though, about your PlayStation VR, you might not have realized.
2648000	2654000	But of course, you know, people see HDMI. They're going to stick whatever HDMI they have into the device.
2654000	2658000	I'm sorry. I just want to quickly because I want this is bugging me. So I had to look.
2658000	2664000	This is units shipped. So not units sold, but it was three point oh six million.
2664000	2670000	So it's it's kind of close. I mean, especially because that's that's sold, not shipped right.
2670000	2674000	The PlayStation number was sold. Was VR sold or shipped? I think they're talking about sold.
2674000	2678000	OK, because that's yeah. So interesting. That would be very if they make it.
2678000	2682000	That's very, very interesting. Anyway, sorry, Loki. I just wanted to put that out.
2682000	2685000	So apparently you can use your PlayStation VR like an HDTV.
2685000	2695000	So if you plug it into, say, for example, an HDMI or HDMI on Xbox one or the HDMI port on the Wii U,
2695000	2703000	it'll see it like a TV and it'll output to it like a in cinematic mode where it looks like a large 2D screen in front of you.
2703000	2708000	Have you played around with that at all, Shane? What? The cinematic mode where you just use something else?
2708000	2714000	No, Jim did. He played PT and Overwatch, but I haven't tried it. Interesting.
2714000	2720000	But that's even still PlayStation. That's not like putting a Wii U in there or putting Apple TV or something in there.
2721000	2725000	Interesting. But apparently you can do that with this.
2725000	2730000	If you listen to Bobby show this week, he talks a little bit about that cinematic mode.
2730000	2738000	He played around with it a little more and he made it sound like it's really a neat feature because, yeah, you bypass your PlayStation 4 completely, essentially.
2738000	2744000	Yeah. So you can kind of take that somewhere else that your PlayStation 4 maybe isn't necessarily at.
2744000	2752000	So that's pretty cool. Yeah. I mean, anything that gets you more functionality out of it, that would be pretty nice, especially.
2752000	2759000	I mean, I don't know how we would play, but like since I don't get to use the TV that often, it would be nice to have that second screen placed up.
2759000	2768000	Although, I mean, obviously there's going to be some image loss because you're blowing something up that's supposed to be that resolution to something bigger.
2768000	2775000	And it's not going to look quite right, but. Still neat. Whatever. Still get you through what you need to do.
2775000	2783000	Interesting. All right. Yeah. Fifth Dream in chat says, same reason you watch a Blu-ray on a regular TV to see a movie.
2783000	2786000	Yeah, that's a pretty good comparison, I suppose. Right.
2786000	2797000	I'm, you know, because they have this, you know, a lot of this stuff on the Oculus and even the Vive and the Gear VR and stuff, all these free, like, experiences.
2797000	2804000	I like, I kind of wish they'd have some more of those experiences for the PlayStation VR, like roller coasters and shit like that.
2804000	2810000	You know, just the really quick shit that's free, that they have like a plethora of on the other platforms.
2810000	2814000	Well, but that's just a PC versus console kind of thing to begin with, right?
2814000	2821000	Why does it have to be that? I mean, it's like that on the mobile too. I mean, I don't understand. I mean, it's just easier to publish for this platform.
2821000	2833000	Yeah, I think the answer is more complicated about the fundamental of, you know, maybe if, what about, Loki, if PlayStation had something like what Xbox, Microsoft did with the XNA stuff?
2833000	2834000	God, I wish they would do that.
2834000	2836000	Yeah, actually. Okay. Yeah.
2836000	2845000	I have that with PlayStation Mobile, then they like, eh, but like they should do that. I think that wasn't a bad idea, but it's just a lockdown now.
2845000	2851000	Yeah. And Bobby Blackwell says, Sony's more of a walled garden, but there are some of the free experiences on the store.
2851000	2857000	Yeah. I mean, there's like the Hatsune Miku and there's obviously no shortage of demos on that disc. I mean, there's a ton of stuff on that disc.
2857000	2858000	That is one killer demo disc.
2858000	2865000	Yeah. That's pretty good. Anyway, so moving on, let's talk about something that's not necessarily VR.
2865000	2871000	Although I would really love to see what this would look like in VR. And I heard they did a concept demo of it once in VR.
2871000	2883000	Anyway, it's Final Fantasy XIV. And one of the big, big announcements in the MMO world this weekend was the fact that Final Fantasy's latest expansion was announced called Stormblood.
2883000	2891000	Stormblood is going to be the next expansion following Heaven's Word and it will be announced, sorry, it will be released in early summer of 2017.
2891000	2893000	And I was there in Las Vegas.
2893000	2900000	You need to talk about the fiasco text messages that you sent me that got my hopes up and then just, they all went to crap.
2900000	2908000	So the trailer, if you haven't seen it, is gorgeous Final Fantasy rendered cut scene stuff and it looks great.
2908000	2923000	And the very beginning of the trailer, after it shows, you know, after showing the scenery, the rock formations and the waterfall and all this stuff, shows this lady in a long red dress who there's some speculation about who she is.
2923000	2927000	And it makes a lot of sense, but we'll have to talk about that somewhere that wouldn't be so spoilery.
2927000	2929000	It's an agent from the Matrix. I know this. I've seen the movie.
2929000	2930000	Yeah, you're right.
2930000	2932000	Why can't we just talk about it?
2932000	2938000	Okay, potential spoiler alert for this. The thought is it's Eda.
2938000	2940000	Who?
2940000	2942000	Oh my god, I have no idea who that is.
2942000	2945000	One of the people that went missing at the end of Rock and Roll.
2945000	2947000	We've already seen her, I thought.
2947000	2948000	So, anyway.
2948000	2950000	So that's, no, that's not her.
2950000	2953000	Anyway, moving on. So, it's safe to listen again.
2953000	2964000	So, in the very beginning of the trailer, she's there and she is, like, she's doing these very elaborate type of karate moves where she has, like, ribbons and she twirls in the air and stuff.
2964000	2969000	And the media thing, I text Shane, oh my fucking god, it's a dancer right at the beginning of the trailer.
2969000	2971000	I was like, oh, MFG, dancer, because I know Shane.
2971000	2973000	Shane's like, well.
2973000	2975000	There are two jobs I want in Final Fantasy XIV.
2975000	2976000	Yeah.
2976000	2977000	One of them is dancer.
2977000	2978000	And then what else did you do?
2978000	2984000	It was, okay, so then I'm like, Shane, it's a fucking dancer, they're putting dancer in this expansion.
2984000	2989000	Then I think I even, the first time I tweeted it, I was so excited, it put Final Fantasy XIV Stormdancer.
2989000	2991000	And I was like, god damn it, no, it's Stormblood.
2991000	2993000	I had to go erase the tweet.
2993000	2994000	Stormblood.
2994000	3001000	But anyway, so then at the end of the trailer, you see the Warrior of Light, but I didn't catch, they've given him such a makeover and made him.
3001000	3002000	Oh, he's super hot.
3002000	3003000	He's much better looking.
3003000	3005000	He's been hot the entire time, but he's super hot right now.
3005000	3008000	He keeps getting hotter. What kind of workout regime is this guy doing?
3008000	3016000	Anyway, so at the end of it, he kind of like lunges at the lady in red and he's glowing blue.
3016000	3022000	But something you see right before that in the trailer looked like a dude that was in like blue magi from 11 Type of Armor.
3022000	3027000	And I was like, oh my god, Shane, I'm not fucking with you. It's a blue mage and it's a dancer.
3027000	3029000	The only two jobs I care about.
3029000	3031000	And I'm like, Shane, I'm not fucking with you.
3031000	3038000	And then they started to do the announces and then I was like, actually, wait, he's wearing a shirt that says Scarlet Witch.
3038000	3040000	And he did this shit two years ago.
3040000	3042000	So red mage is clearly one of the jobs.
3042000	3045000	So I made a mistake, Shane.
3045000	3051000	And then I quit caring about the entire expansion because the only two things I wanted were there for half a second.
3051000	3054000	And then the reality came out that it was neither.
3054000	3056000	So I don't think blue mage is there.
3056000	3058000	But if she is not a dancer.
3058000	3059000	She's a monk.
3059000	3061000	She's clearly a monk.
3061000	3062000	Then she's a dancing fucking monk then.
3062000	3063000	She just looks like a monk.
3063000	3065000	Then you should be playing monk because that's a fucking desert.
3065000	3070000	No, because that game is fundamentally broken in the way you play it and it's not that fun sometimes.
3070000	3075000	That's just something you're saying to yourself to justify why you're not playing that and that WoW is better.
3075000	3077000	No, I'm not saying WoW is better.
3077000	3080000	I'm just saying that this game needs a bigger overhaul than what they announced.
3080000	3088000	Well, they announced as part of the expansion for Stormblood, they are going to be completely redoing the battle system.
3088000	3094000	They didn't give a lot of details about the battle system but they're going to be re-approaching it.
3094000	3097000	But as far as the details, please look forward to it.
3097000	3101000	And one of the other fanfests they're doing in Japan or Europe later on.
3101000	3103000	So Stormblood was announced.
3103000	3106000	Let's see, what else did we get here?
3106000	3109000	So we also got some other things that are going to be in Stormblood.
3109000	3112000	And honestly, this was kind of the expected stuff.
3112000	3117000	The level cap will raise to level 70 which is common for MMO expansions.
3117000	3122000	But then the other big, big deal that got a lot of cheers in Vegas when it was announced.
3122000	3125000	They're going to be ending PlayStation 3 support.
3125000	3129000	And you may wonder why that got a lot of cheers.
3129000	3135000	But with the hardcore Final Fantasy crowd, people have kind of been through this before with Final Fantasy 11.
3135000	3142000	And Final Fantasy 11 was held back technologically because that dev team did not want to cut PlayStation 2 support.
3142000	3148000	So that game was never able to go past on a technological level what the PlayStation 2 was capable of.
3148000	3154000	And so you could tell that Yoshi, the director of Final Fantasy 14,
3154000	3162000	he was nervous about giving kind of like the bad news at the end of the press conference, the fanfest reveal I suppose.
3162000	3166000	Because he said there's two important things we're going to have to talk about.
3166000	3170000	One is the minimum specs for the game are going to go up on PC.
3170000	3176000	So if you're running a 32-bit operating system, he's like, we're not going to release those specs today.
3176000	3183000	But if you're running a 32-bit operating system, you really, really need to think about going to a 64-bit operating system.
3183000	3187000	And he was like, we will try our best to continue to support 32-bit.
3187000	3191000	But he's kind of like saying, he's kind of giving you a hint where that baseline is.
3191000	3196000	Which is a pretty, it is a pretty gutsy thing for an MMO to do.
3196000	3202000	To possibly like cut out people that are on lower end systems still playing the game.
3202000	3209000	However, Warcraft has done this too. They raised the bar a little bit with each expansion.
3209000	3213000	And at least with Final Fantasy, it's also on consoles.
3213000	3217000	So if you're not a PC person who wants to keep upgrading your PC, you can get a console.
3217000	3225000	Except if you're a PlayStation 3 person, they also announced that with the specs going up, PlayStation 3 support will be ending.
3225000	3230000	So when Stormblood launches, the game won't work at all on PlayStation 3.
3230000	3241000	So even if you are playing Heavensward or just regular Realm Reborn, you will not be able to play Final Fantasy XIV anymore once Stormblood is released.
3241000	3248000	However, the nice little like, you know, they were, again, they were worried that I think the fanbase was going to eat them alive for this.
3248000	3252000	So they were very apologetic and they said, we're bringing back the free upgrade campaign.
3252000	3258000	So if you're on a PlayStation 3, you can upgrade to a PlayStation 4 and it will not cost you one dime.
3258000	3263000	So that was pretty cool. So at least, you know, except the fact that you have to buy a PlayStation 4.
3263000	3265000	But hey, at least the prices of those are coming down.
3265000	3270000	So I feel like, you know, they're giving people enough notice where, you know, start saving for the PlayStation 4, I suppose.
3270000	3278000	But the fanbase, you know, the hardcore fans likely already have higher end PCs or PlayStation 4s.
3278000	3280000	So what does this mean for the game?
3280000	3285000	Stormblood, the graphics, et cetera, are only going to get better than the game looks today.
3285000	3288000	And the game already looks pretty fucking good today.
3288000	3291000	So they're going to be raising that bar even higher with the expansion.
3291000	3295000	So that is really, really, really exciting, in my opinion.
3295000	3302000	So Brad from Pod Culture in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I don't play, but that is stupid.
3302000	3307000	Well, elaborate, please. I'm curious what is stupid about that.
3307000	3309000	I mean, it's a good thing.
3309000	3314000	It's going to suck for the people who are still trapped on PS3, which I think there's more.
3314000	3322000	They said they ran the numbers and I think there's more in Japan, which makes sense because for Final Fantasy XI, a ton of people were still on PlayStation 2 in Japan.
3323000	3330000	But I guess, you know, at least they're doing the free upgrades, which I don't think every company would necessarily do.
3330000	3333000	So, I mean, I guess that's kind of nice in that way.
3333000	3337000	Brad from Pod Culture said some folks don't want to update.
3337000	3341000	Kaijuto says don't assume the fan base has PlayStation 4.
3341000	3348000	Dungeon Buster points out Destiny's Rise of Iron didn't come out for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 console users either.
3349000	3354000	So I guess Square is not the only one making this decision to, you know, push the technologies forward.
3354000	3363000	I don't get it. Like, why be resistant to leaving old hardware behind if you can't keep up?
3363000	3364000	It could be a money thing.
3364000	3365000	I get that.
3365000	3366000	But if it's a money thing...
3366000	3368000	Then why are you paying for a monthly subscription game?
3368000	3370000	That's, yeah, I, yeah.
3370000	3377000	Go play something free on some other platform. Like, that bothers me.
3377000	3382000	But I, you know, I'm sympathetic to it, but at least they're giving a lot of notice.
3382000	3385000	And again, the free upgrade program is kind of what makes me go, okay.
3385000	3392000	So if you really want to play Final Fantasy XIV and you only have a PS3, you have until early summer.
3392000	3402000	So, like, half a year to get $299, if you're in America, $299 to get a PS4.
3402000	3404000	Which hopefully it'll come down again by summer next year.
3404000	3406000	Yeah, it may even come down more.
3406000	3410000	So it's saying this is stupid or this sucks.
3410000	3418000	Don't pay for an MMO that you have to pay for monthly if you can't save up $299 in the next eight months or however long it's going to be.
3418000	3423000	I'm still not hearing free-to-play Final Fantasy XI, and you can imagine...
3423000	3426000	Yeah, that mobile one, because it's all supposed to go to mobile now, too.
3426000	3428000	They haven't talked about that in a while, either.
3429000	3439000	All right. So I want to talk a little bit, though, about Fan Fest itself, because I was there for this big reveal and went to the actual Fan Fest in Las Vegas.
3439000	3443000	And obviously, you guys know I'm quite the Final Fantasy XIV fan.
3443000	3446000	I've said good things about the game, and I'm still feeling pretty good about it.
3446000	3451000	I'm not afraid to speak my mind when things are going wrong in the game.
3451000	3463000	And I think that is kind of what I'd like to do now, because I did spend money to fly, go to a hotel, and pay $130 to get in the door for Final Fantasy XIV Fan Fest.
3463000	3470000	And I believe that Fan Fest was a downgrade from 2014's Fan Fest.
3470000	3475000	So they had it at... Okay, well, let's talk about some good news.
3475000	3480000	It was on the strip this year, so instead of being at the Rio, which was off strip, it was on strip.
3480000	3489000	So there is no shortage of restaurants, places to stay, granted everything's marked up because it's the strip, but there was no shortage of stuff to do.
3489000	3498000	So, I mean, as far as the stuff outside the convention, there is plenty of places to go eat, meet up with friends at night, do whatever you want to do.
3498000	3504000	I mean, the location... I'm kind of surprised more gaming stuff doesn't happen in Las Vegas.
3504000	3512000	Maybe it is because of the premium on the strip or whatever, but I'm kind of surprised more stuff doesn't happen there because, you know, it's a great location.
3512000	3525000	The festival itself, though, I mean, okay, so they had two days worth of stuff, which was you would have a couple panels every day in the main room with the panels.
3525000	3531000	And then they had some stations set up where you could do three different experiences in the game.
3531000	3540000	One of them was a EX trial roulette, which means you would do one of the primal battles, but they would put a modifier on the battle that doesn't exist in the regular game.
3540000	3549000	So it was like a super hard mode type battle. So, for example, my friends had to fight Bismarck, but the modifier they got was they don't have a UI.
3549000	3554000	So they had to memorize all their key bindings because at the start of the fight, the UI disappeared.
3554000	3560000	And so I was like, how the fuck do you heal that? And they were like, you just have to keep pressing F1, F2, F3, F4 to target the right person.
3560000	3567000	I was like, God, that sounds like a nightmare. So even though I'm sure those of you that aren't really into 14 are probably going, that sounds ridiculous.
3567000	3572000	Again, this is for the fan base. And so, you know, events like that are really meant to kind of push things forward.
3572000	3576000	So that event was kind of interesting and it had by far the longest line.
3576000	3583000	Then they had a 24 man battle that you could do that wasn't in the game yet, something called Proto Ultima.
3583000	3587000	And I was surprised that that battle was not as popular.
3587000	3588000	Did they have a shirt for it?
3588000	3589000	No.
3589000	3591000	Oh, that's why it's not popular.
3591000	3596000	See, and in 2014, you had more incentive to do the fight, which was Odin that year.
3596000	3599000	Because if you beat Odin, you got a shirt that said I beat Odin.
3599000	3605000	This year you got stamps that would get you a real life triple triad card.
3605000	3607000	That was the big giveaways they were doing this year.
3607000	3612000	Woo, a card. Holy cow. Don't break the bank on that one.
3612000	3618000	And then it really sounds like the increase in price for the tickets really went to like, you know, good things for the show.
3618000	3630000	The other thing they had was a PVP station, which had no line the entire show because for some reason the crowd that plays Final Fantasy 14 hates PVP.
3630000	3640000	Now, I realize there's a very vocal minority in 14 that really enjoys the PVP, but there's tons of people that have no interest in playing it whatsoever.
3640000	3646000	And I just want to say before the PVP people send me hate mail, the Final Fantasy 14 PVP is fucking great.
3646000	3659000	Like if you actually play it, like the presentation of it, the music, the battlefields, like it's a great fucking game that nobody's playing because people would rather do the PVE stuff, I suppose.
3659000	3670000	It's really a fascinating thing. And boy oh boy did Square try to push PVP. They had two hours of PVP content on Saturday when most people went out to get lunch.
3670000	3682000	I just, it's this weird phenomenon. I'm not sure I can explain that like the group of hardcore, I know people that are hardcore in 14 and they're like, nope, I'm not touching PVP.
3682000	3691000	It's just, it's so interesting. But anyway, so and then they had some cute little games that were inspired by things in game.
3691000	3705000	Like, you know those things you see at like Dave and Busters where it's like a TV on the ground. They had something like that that was to emulate one of the events in the game where if you're standing on the wrong space in the platform, you get blown off the platform.
3705000	3715000	So it was like this little wheel that would spin and if you were in the red zone, you were out of the game. But what do you get for winning the game? A stamp in your book and a triple triad card, something.
3715000	3726000	So anyway, I don't want to bore you with all the fine, fine details. My point is, is that for all this money that we spent going there, there's not enough to do. There was not enough to do.
3726000	3741000	And I criticized this two years ago and I'm a little irritated. I mean, not that I think Square is personally listening to my feedback, but I feel like I'm not the only one saying this is that Square really needs to think about using this as an opportunity to do more than just Final Fantasy 14.
3741000	3747000	Final Fantasy 15 is coming out in what, six weeks? World of Final Fantasy is out in two weeks.
3747000	3749000	Or wait, yeah, yeah it is. I thought, I'm sorry.
3749000	3758000	So yeah, World of Final Fantasy is out in two. Why the fuck are they not taking an opportunity to show off these games and let people try those? I mean, I don't understand.
3758000	3772000	Obviously people who play 14 like other Final Fantasies too, or you would not get questions during the live letter like, are we going to see Bartz and Locke and characters from old Final Fantasy games like we saw lightning in the game?
3772000	3776000	Are we going to get like, people would not ask that if they were not into other Final Fantasy games.
3776000	3781000	Or how about, was it that arcade, uh, Dissida game that they're supposed to be putting out?
3781000	3796000	No, no, nothing. There's nothing but 14. Nothing. And the problem is, it is, with the Fan Fest happening today, and Stormblood not being until early summer 2017, there was so much that they didn't announce.
3796000	3804000	And it kind of irritated the fuck out of me that they would be like, oh we've got these two new jobs, but we'll tell you in Japan.
3805000	3820000	Or we got this thing that said, why did you fucking bring it up? It's like, it was just too early. I think that my biggest beef with this is that if they knew the expansion wasn't going to be until early summer 2017, then why did they have this now?
3820000	3827000	Because if I'd gone to BlizzCon, I would have been able to play the expansion at BlizzCon. And that's what they need to have out on the floor.
3827000	3832000	Yeah, we've been announced and playable and basically all the cool details would be announced.
3832000	3836000	But they split it up between three different regions and it's not a good thing.
3836000	3845000	So despite all this stuff I'm saying about WoW and Final Fantasy here, I can take a step back and realize the people that put on this event need to fucking go to BlizzCon and see how it's done.
3845000	3853000	And BlizzCon isn't perfect, but BlizzCon, there's more stuff for people to do and I would not be as critical here.
3853000	3861000	Exactly, because BlizzCon is for all Blizzard games versus one specific Final Fantasy game.
3861000	3877000	Now, here's the thing. I've got to get to this. This isn't the worst of it. The Final Fantasy Fan Festival had the worst staff I've ever seen at a convention. Ever. Ever.
3878000	3884000	And that's not Square Enix. I'm not blaming Square Enix. Well, I am, but I'll get to that.
3884000	3885000	Well, you should because they hired them.
3885000	3887000	Shut up and let me finish.
3887000	3888000	No.
3888000	3896000	The dev team, it's not their fault. People love Final Fantasy in part because the dev team is so approachable and great and they're wonderful. That's not a read on them.
3896000	3903000	But where I would blame Square Enix, as Shane is spoiling over there, is that they contracted with this horrible company and I don't know who they are.
3903000	3910000	I don't know if it's the Paris. I don't know if it's something that the Paris uses, but this company was shit.
3910000	3923000	And they were rude. They had no customer service training. They were inept. They were taking bribes so that people could cut in line and get stuff that they didn't earn.
3924000	3934000	That's how bad this was, Square Enix. Who was fucking overseeing the vendor company? You fucked up and it affected the entire show.
3934000	3946000	And it didn't just affect that. The merchandise line? Oh my God, you guys. That is the biggest shit show I've ever seen in my 15 years of doing this fucking show.
3946000	3949000	That was a mess.
3949000	3955000	It was pretty bad when I went that first year. I mean, in terms of you had like a three plus hour wait.
3955000	3968000	That's what makes me livid. You had 2014 and everybody pointed out, your fans, everybody pointed out the ways that that merch booth could have been improved.
3968000	3983000	Did you not listen to any of it? Because it was worse. You had a line going around the entire building and it was not moving fast enough.
3983000	3992000	And they tried to cut it off. But as I mentioned, the staff was accepting bribes for people to cut in line anyway. So that was something that was going on.
3992000	3998000	And then there was no... They didn't know how to manage the line. They didn't know how many people they could fit in line.
3998000	4006000	People were standing in line all fucking day just to get to the front and then be told, sorry, it's cut off. We're not going to be able to sell anymore.
4006000	4014000	We're going to give you a ticket to come back tomorrow and wait for another two to three hours only to be told that the book that everybody wants, we've sold out of.
4014000	4019000	Because we didn't consider that everybody here at this convention might want to buy a book so we didn't print enough of them.
4019000	4026000	Now, there is a part of me in my mind that would wonder, why the fuck would you go to a convention just to stand in a merch line all day?
4026000	4034000	But at the same time, Square Enix, you've got your biggest fan base like throwing their wallets at you. Why? Why?
4034000	4039000	Two times in a row now, can't you manage a fucking merch line? It's ridiculous.
4039000	4047000	Again, why don't you go look at what Blizzard's doing since I'm going to keep telling you that when it comes to running a convention.
4047000	4054000	And go notice how they open up their shop a week in advance so that people can make their orders and get their stuff in person.
4054000	4064000	Because it was just... They should be embarrassed. And then at the end of the show when they come out and they're like, best fan fest ever, I was like...
4064000	4068000	I gave the biggest stare like, no, I'm sorry.
4068000	4076000	Again, I want to point out, I still love the game. And my perception of the convention is not going to ruin my love of the game.
4076000	4080000	And there was a lot of stuff that happened outside of the convention that was really great.
4080000	4085000	I got to hang out with my free company peeps in real life, other people I play the game with, that was all awesome.
4085000	4099000	But the event itself was a badly organized mess. And it is solely on the shoulders of whoever, whatever vendor Square Enix contracted with to put that stuff together at the location.
4099000	4106000	And they need to be fired immediately. And if I even catch a peep that that company is back in 2018, I'm not fucking going.
4106000	4110000	I'm already on the fence where I'm like, why would I go again in 2018?
4110000	4117000	To see the people that I play the games online with. I guess there is that. But I don't need to pay the $130 to go to the show to see that.
4117000	4126000	Anyway, sorry, that was a little bit of a rant. But I was not happy, you guys. I'm sorry. That's just what happened.
4126000	4135000	So, let's see. Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Fifth Dream in chat says, oh yeah, the stream was shit too. I heard about that.
4135000	4141000	On a proprietary site that sent no emails about the stream, fucked up the first 20 minutes and had no chat.
4141000	4151000	Wow. Let's see. SSJ100Matt says, Rob's rage level is at 7 out of 10. Loki is just thinking good, good, let the hate flow.
4151000	4159000	BobbyBlackWolf says, important question, did they open any of the Final Fantasy XIV expansions to people that never finished the 2.0?
4159000	4167000	Or are you still locked to old content because you don't like raiding? They didn't answer that specifically at this fest.
4167000	4176000	But they've said something previously that they want to do a catch up mechanism for 4.0. Especially for people that are starting the game.
4176000	4181000	They want to do something where they can kind of run through all the content and catch up with everybody else.
4182000	4192000	So, that is something that's on their radar. But, you know, again, on that whole note of too early, they barely talked about the content patch 3.5 that's coming out in a few months.
4192000	4202000	I mean, they didn't talk about the expansion. I just felt like it wasn't a lot of news, which I was hoping there'd be a little more of that, you know?
4202000	4207000	Even when I went in 2014, I felt like we got a lot more. I don't know. You went in 2014, Shane, right?
4207000	4208000	Yeah.
4208000	4209000	And you had a good time, right?
4209000	4212000	Yeah, it was pretty good. I mean, it was kind of lackluster in what we could do.
4212000	4218000	Right? And there was less this year, Shane. There was less. They didn't have a dungeon thing set up. They didn't have a music panel.
4218000	4224000	So, I'm really glad that when you said, oh, you should still come out and come do this this weekend, I'm glad I didn't go.
4224000	4228000	Because A, no tickets available at the door. And B,
4228000	4232000	Unless you bribe somebody. And I have that on authority that that happened.
4232000	4234000	Do you know how much they ended up paying?
4234000	4236000	$60.
4236000	4238000	Well, that's less than the actual ticket cost.
4238000	4239000	I'm aware.
4239000	4241000	Did they get the bag and everything, you think?
4241000	4242000	I don't know.
4242000	4247000	Oh. Okay, so there's that. And, yeah, it just sounds like it was a garbage show.
4247000	4253000	And, you know, everything that happened that I cared about, with the exception of the Primals concert,
4253000	4257000	which I think I just found a YouTube of the song I cared about,
4257000	4263000	I could look out the internet for free and not go to Vegas.
4263000	4269000	So, hooray, I'm glad I didn't go. And I don't feel like, unless something changes, I'll ever want to go again.
4269000	4275000	So, yeah, I mean, to end, I was gonna, since you brought it up, I was gonna try to end on a positive note.
4275000	4279000	The two concerts they did, and they did add a second concert this year,
4279000	4282000	I think, for one, they need to let the Primals play a little longer.
4282000	4285000	I don't think an hour is enough for the repertoire they have.
4285000	4289000	Maybe that's a limitation of Soken and what he feels comfortable doing.
4289000	4295000	And if that's the case, then okay. Soken is a genius, and, you know, the music he does in the game—
4295000	4298000	I still listen to it in the car, as you heard this when I came up to your house today.
4298000	4302000	Let Soken do what he wants. If he's the one that's requesting only an hour, then fine.
4302000	4306000	But if there's a will or a way, let them play longer, because they have a larger catalog.
4306000	4311000	But the concert was good, and they did a new piano concert Friday that they didn't do the last time.
4311000	4314000	And that piano concert was really, really good.
4314000	4322000	They actually had Susan Calloway, who sings the themes, did the answers, the dragon song and all that stuff.
4322000	4325000	So she actually sang it live and had a piano player.
4325000	4329000	And then Soken came out and actually played the theme to The Lost City of Ampedore,
4329000	4335000	which has this cute little piano thing, and he actually had a tiny piano that he played at the same time that he played the big piano.
4335000	4338000	That was really cool. So to try to end on a positive note,
4338000	4347000	if you were fine paying $130 to attend two hours worth of concerts, then that was Fan Fest.
4347000	4349000	So I'll leave it at that.
4349000	4353000	Well, no, I won't leave it at that, because I wanted to say one more quick thing,
4353000	4359000	and that is that Square Enix, I know it's coming off that I'm really angry, and I think I am,
4359000	4365000	but the reason that I'm angry is that your fan base and your incredible game deserves better
4365000	4370000	than what that staff at the Paris, whoever, I don't know if it's Paris' fault, I don't know if it's a vendor fault,
4370000	4378000	whoever, they deserve much better, your game deserves better and your fans deserve better than what that company gave you,
4378000	4381000	and apparently the streaming company as well.
4381000	4385000	So you have an obligation to fix this.
4385000	4391000	You have an obligation to evaluate your formula of what you're doing for your fans
4391000	4396000	who are traveling from places like East Coast, Australia, and so forth to be here.
4396000	4399000	You have an obligation to make it better.
4399000	4405000	Do not copy the formula from two years ago and try to stick it for 2018,
4405000	4413000	because you want to see me hit rage 10 out of 10, have me pay to go to that show, we'll see what happens.
4413000	4417000	So I know AkumaJP in chat says, nah, Square Enix is not listening to this show.
4417000	4424000	I know, however, I'm one voice, there's folks on Reddit saying the exact same thing, they're a voice,
4424000	4430000	there's folks on Twitter saying it too, they're a voice, you've got to get that feedback out there, folks.
4430000	4432000	Not that they'll follow any of it by the sounds of it.
4432000	4436000	Well, but that's what I'm saying, and that's where I'm leaving it at.
4436000	4442000	You have an obligation to fix this, and if you don't, the consequences will be dire.
4442000	4449000	Like, you stand to lose a big part of this loyal, loyal fan base you have, and it's going to be ugly.
4449000	4451000	So, just saying.
4451000	4456000	Alright, and that was my trip to FanFest.
4456000	4463000	But if any of my, I hope my guildies, if they're listening, you know, again, I had a great time with people outside the show.
4463000	4468000	Everything I'm saying is just about the event itself.
4468000	4474000	But everybody I talked to, almost everybody, almost everybody I talked to, was like, yeah, 2014 was better.
4474000	4479000	And even the people that wouldn't go as far to say that would at least still be able to say,
4479000	4482000	yeah, there were a few things they did better in 2014.
4482000	4488000	So, you know, I'm not the only person that's this irritated.
4488000	4494000	But if I had to go back to Vegas in two years just to hang out with my friends from online,
4494000	4498000	because they're all going to 2018, then maybe I would consider doing that.
4498000	4501000	Just not going to FanFest. I did that at BlizzCon one year.
4501000	4505000	I just went to go hang out with people, and I didn't even go to BlizzCon. I went to Disneyland instead.
4505000	4509000	I had a great time. So maybe I'll just do that in 2018. We'll see. Anyway.
4509000	4517000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, egg.
4518000	4524000	Alright. Let's see. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4524000	4530000	Fifth Dream says, I can't say don't, but I bet there's a reason they couldn't do a lot like they wanted.
4530000	4534000	I hope it's not a sign the game is tanking. The cosplay was amazing.
4534000	4544000	I really think it's the time frame. I think they planned when FanFest was going to be before they knew when that expansion would be out.
4544000	4549000	Because in 2014, Heaven's Word was supposed to be out in April, it got pushed back.
4549000	4553000	But that still made the timelines kind of running out six months.
4553000	4561000	So I just feel like because they're announcing it further out this time, it just screwed a lot of things up.
4561000	4567000	So Square, don't schedule the next round of FanFests until you know when that expansion is coming out.
4567000	4571000	And honestly, do the FanFest closer to the expansion. Let people play the expansion of FanFest.
4571000	4577000	Alright, I'm done. I've talked too much about it. There's a lot of people out there that don't even play Final Fantasy XIV, but I wanted to talk about my trip.
4577000	4579000	So let's get on to some other news. Loki?
4579000	4588000	Alright, so this morning, Rockstar Games' Twitter account, as well as some of the other social media pages, posted a single image.
4588000	4596000	It is a red background with their logo in front of it. But it's that particular red background that people go...
4596000	4598000	It's that particular shade of red.
4598000	4605000	That particular shade of red, they're like, oh shit, it's going to happen. Basically that it's hinted.
4605000	4613000	There's a strong hint that there's going to be some sort of Red Dead announcement soon. Which is awesome.
4613000	4618000	And to be honest, any announcement from Rockstar Games at this point would be fantastic.
4618000	4623000	I don't care if it's a new Midnight Glove, it's an expansion of the Grand Theft Auto.
4624000	4631000	Please not Table Tennis, but whatever. I mean, Bully, if that's what you want to do. Manhunt, I don't care.
4631000	4636000	Just anything would be fantastic. I'm hoping for a Red Dead game.
4636000	4641000	Interesting. This seems like an interesting time to announce something big like that.
4641000	4644000	Could they be announcing for this holiday that soon?
4644000	4648000	No, no. It'd probably be next year. Next holiday, maybe.
4648000	4650000	That far out, really?
4650000	4653000	I don't think there's anything coming out of this soon. That would be ridiculous.
4653000	4657000	You never know. Beyonce changed everything.
4657000	4664000	They could do an April release, they've done that before, but I think it would be next holiday.
4664000	4666000	They'd tease it that far out.
4666000	4673000	Kaijuto in chat says, uh, Rockstar, please do Agent. Why Red Dead? I love the game, but Agent is the real game I want from them.
4673000	4675000	I don't think Agent's going to happen at this point.
4675000	4680000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Red Dead TV series on Netflix?
4680000	4682000	No.
4682000	4689000	Bobby Blackwolf says, they could do it now. They'd announce it on the day they submit it for certification.
4689000	4697000	That would be one hell of a secret. Like, oh hey, by the way, I could see that short announcement window if it was a rematch.
4697000	4701000	We're seriously fanwanking right now. Don't get your hopes up, people.
4702000	4707000	If it was a remaster of the original game, then maybe that wouldn't need such a large announcement window.
4707000	4712000	But if it's an actual sequel, then you're not going to get anything anytime soon.
4712000	4717000	That's fair. So, yeah, excited to hear more about it.
4717000	4721000	But this isn't even like a teaser of a teaser date.
4722000	4730000	They just did the, uh, they put Red Dead Revolver on PlayStation 4, the, you know, the PS2 games that they have on there.
4730000	4740000	So Red Dead Revolver is on there. And now just Redemption would probably, it's backwards compatible with the 360s, or not 360, but the Xbox One.
4740000	4745000	So Red Dead Revolver, Red Dead Redemption, how about Red Dead Resurrection?
4745000	4749000	It's got to be something with an R, right? Or maybe.
4749000	4752000	Left for Red Dead? Maybe not.
4752000	4756000	Well, they did the zombie thing. It actually was pretty cool. So, uh, they've already done zombies.
4756000	4761000	But, you know, I could, I don't know, it would be cool. I'm guessing it's going to be very similar.
4761000	4769000	They're going to try to mimic what they did with Grand Theft Auto so that you're going to have like a Red Dead Online or something like that with all the microtransactions and that fun stuff.
4769000	4770000	Of course.
4770000	4777000	But you know what, though? I mean, with that being said, I mean, it's not really shoved in your face too much, which is nice.
4777000	4783000	It's just, there's a lot of content online, none of which I'm really interested in playing at the moment, but the races are cool.
4783000	4794000	I just wish that with that content, there was still more story stuff. I get it that they're making like tons of money doing that, but it's like, come on, more story, please.
4794000	4800000	It'd be nice because Grand Theft Auto IV is kind of, you know, I was spoiled by that with the expansion.
4801000	4808000	All right, well, moving on to something completely different, but maybe this is a system that Red Dead could come out for in the future, although probably not.
4808000	4814000	But this is by a gentleman named Nolan Bushnell, who hopefully you know that name.
4814000	4815000	Shane, do you know who Nolan Bushnell is?
4815000	4816000	No.
4816000	4817000	I knew it.
4817000	4820000	Does he do those baked beans or something?
4820000	4821000	No.
4821000	4822000	Did he invent a camera?
4822000	4826000	No, Nolan Bushnell is the founder of Atari.
4826000	4827000	Nobody cares about Atari.
4827000	4829000	And the founder of Chuck E. Cheese.
4829000	4830000	And the founder of Chuck E. Cheese.
4830000	4831000	Nobody cares about Chuck E. Cheese.
4831000	4835000	Listen, if it wasn't for Nolan Bushnell, you would have no Chuck E. Cheese.
4835000	4836000	That's right.
4836000	4837000	You'd have no Five Nights at Freddy's.
4837000	4838000	That's right. You would have no Five Nights at Freddy's.
4838000	4839000	I think I can live.
4839000	4840000	You would have no...
4840000	4841000	He says that.
4841000	4845000	Although you have bull ankles, which is almost as creepy as Five Nights at Freddy's.
4845000	4847000	Or there was showbiz pizza.
4847000	4848000	Well, okay.
4848000	4849000	That's true.
4849000	4852000	So then Shane will probably not care about this either.
4852000	4854000	I never care about old stuff.
4855000	4856000	Well, this isn't old.
4856000	4860000	Nolan Bushnell is launching a new VR company.
4860000	4863000	And the name of the VR company is Modal VR.
4863000	4866000	And Jason Crawford is with this as well.
4866000	4868000	He invented the Modal technology.
4868000	4870000	He will be the chief executive of this.
4870000	4871000	What's a Modal?
4871000	4877000	That's a good... Modal is the...
4877000	4879000	Do you know Loki?
4879000	4880000	I have no clue.
4880000	4884000	So I don't care about this Jason Crawford guy, because he created something I don't even know.
4884000	4886000	And it has a stupid name.
4886000	4888000	It's like a server rack by the looks of it.
4888000	4889000	Oh, that's super interesting.
4889000	4892000	I'm so glad that Jason Crawford's on board with this.
4894000	4896000	I'm trying to see if there's more...
4896000	4899000	They have the full website for the Modal VR.
4899000	4900000	So yeah, okay.
4900000	4901000	So that looks kind of cool.
4901000	4905000	So what it is, from just looking at this, it's like a VR platform that's wireless.
4905000	4910000	So I guess I'm thinking more like VR in the sense of like those attractions that you would see,
4910000	4913000	like at David Buster's or something like that, where they have like, you know...
4913000	4916000	Oh, so the guy that found the Chuck E. Cheese is interested in these types of attractions.
4916000	4920000	I mean, that's what it kind of looks like, because I don't think your average person is going to be like,
4920000	4923000	I want to install a server rack for my VR, you know?
4925000	4927000	But yeah, that's what it kind of looks like.
4927000	4934000	There's going to be a hardware and software company doing high-end completely immersive virtual reality experiences.
4934000	4937000	They're not talking about the specifics of the company's tech right now,
4937000	4944000	but what it does is it uses sensors that follow a record movement in a room in a full-body tracking suit.
4944000	4951000	So this definitely sounds like a much more immersive VR experience than just the headset.
4951000	4952000	I mean, this is like your full body.
4952000	4957000	Sounds like a much more immersive wallet raping thing.
4957000	4958000	But it had Pong.
4958000	4960000	So they had Pong that they played.
4960000	4966000	It says, you know, one of the things that they did was in a 3,000 square foot room, which is ridiculous.
4966000	4969000	They had been playing Pong using the technology.
4969000	4970000	So there's two people.
4970000	4975000	They're running back and forth in the empty space to bounce the ball.
4975000	4976000	Okay, but that's exercise.
4976000	4977000	I don't want to do that.
4977000	4978000	Exactly. Why?
4978000	4979000	You guys are so crazy.
4979000	4980000	But no, no, no, no, no.
4980000	4988000	Now, what I say with this, though, because this is where it really needs to go, if I'm concerned,
4988000	4994000	that would be a good foundation for a really kick-ass version of laser tag.
4994000	4996000	And that's really what it comes down to.
4996000	4997000	There you go.
4997000	4998000	Laser tag.
4998000	5000000	Now you're getting to something.
5000000	5005000	And yeah, if this was the type of way that I could get exercise at the gym, I might be more apt to do it.
5005000	5011000	Or like they have a little clip in this video here of the Tron Legacy where they're doing the disc battle.
5011000	5012000	Yes, please.
5012000	5016000	There's a game on PlayStation Worlds that's kind of like that.
5016000	5021000	You're in a tube that's all glass, and you have an opponent, and it's just like you bounce the ball back and forth,
5021000	5023000	and they have special moves, and it's really fun.
5023000	5028000	And then if they lose, I mean, it's not like you see a person, but their icon shatters,
5028000	5032000	and their tube just falls down to the depths, and it's pretty cool.
5032000	5036000	Yeah, I would like to see that Tron run R in the virtual reality.
5036000	5037000	I'm kind of surprised.
5037000	5039000	There needs to be a Tron something.
5039000	5040000	A Tron cycle game.
5040000	5041000	Oh, that'd be fun.
5041000	5042000	I like that.
5042000	5043000	Tron everything.
5043000	5046000	In Run R, there was a cycle mode, too. It wasn't just the runner.
5046000	5052000	But like a VR Tron cycle. I know they had like someone had made like an app or something like that on PC for it like that,
5052000	5058000	but I want like a good, you know, movie authentic.
5058000	5059000	I understand.
5059000	5066000	SSG100Matt says, guys, it's all a front. He's reviving QZAR in VR.
5066000	5068000	Oh, and Fifth Dream brings up a good idea.
5068000	5073000	I played Tron Run R in Cinema Mode. So you could, I guess, kind of do a Tron Run R thing.
5073000	5077000	So, OK, that's that's a good, good way to do it for now.
5077000	5081000	All right. We're almost to the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.
5081000	5087000	So being that Halloween is right around the corner, I was hoping to play final or Friday the 13th.
5087000	5089000	But let me have the wait a little longer.
5089000	5092000	So Friday the 13th is not going to be coming out this year.
5092000	5100000	Said it's got pushed back to early 2017 or I guess the multiplayer is coming out in 2017 early.
5100000	5107000	And then they're going to have a solo campaign that's going to be coming out in the summer of 2017.
5107000	5110000	But that's kind of cool. So.
5110000	5120000	I'm curious to see what that's like, because I watched a little bit of the video of this and it was kind of him hunting you down or you're hunting the other campers down.
5120000	5123000	That was kind of cool. So isn't that the whole catch of the game?
5123000	5126000	Is this one of those like four versus one games like Evolve or something like that?
5126000	5129000	Like this is like a version of those four versus one. But it looked cool.
5129000	5133000	Well, you know, that type of game, even if. Yeah, I mean, it just looks awesome.
5133000	5142000	So I'm very interested. They're saying that the price of the game, though, is going to be from 30 to 40 dollars.
5142000	5147000	And then they're going to have a physical version of 60.
5147000	5154000	Checking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Somebody had talked about.
5154000	5160000	Oh, yes. Dungeon Buster said, will the pastel Jason be a preorder bonus as a very important question.
5160000	5172000	I don't think so. And then speaking of delays, another game that's been delayed, which it seems like more every time I hear about this game, it's because they're discussing a delay for it or when it's coming out.
5172000	5178000	Cuphead has been delayed into 2017 as well. And that's a game that looked like the very early animation.
5178000	5183000	You know, the old cartoons and stuff and kind of a Mega Man style shooter platformer.
5183000	5192000	So it looks like mid 2017. All right.
5192000	5196000	I know a lot of people are looking forward to the Cuphead game. It looks cool.
5196000	5203000	The art style is fantastic. Yeah. It'd be interesting to see if the game plays really good to write.
5203000	5212000	Well, you know, before we had all these fancy animated things that look like they are from the 1930s, we had technologies from the 1930s.
5212000	5218000	OK, maybe not that old, but at least technology that is 10 years old or more.
5218000	5226000	And every week, Dark Sakura joins us in studio one way or another to talk about a game that is 10 years older or more.
5226000	5232000	That is the classic game of the week. Let's get to it.
5232000	5240000	And thanks to the magic of radio bending time and space, we can teleport the one and only Dark Sakura into the studio right now.
5240000	5246000	Bitch, I drove. How are you doing, Dark Sakura? I have a car-dis, not a tar-dis.
5246000	5252000	A car-dis, not a tar-dis. What's the difference? Mine's a car.
5252000	5256000	It's a blue car, not a blue box. It's not made of tar? I don't know. I got nothing.
5256000	5262000	No, it's not time in relative dimensions in space. It's car in relative dimensions in space.
5262000	5267000	I see. Let's save this really awkward conversation with a discussion on the classic game of the week.
5267000	5273000	Dark Sakura, what did you pick? I picked a short one, actually. Short one? Yeah, because there's not really a whole lot to say about it.
5273000	5279000	But it's an innovation in and of itself. The game is Rent-a-Hero. Rent-a-Hero.
5279000	5287000	Which I'm specifically focusing on the Mega Drive version. First of all, the game was produced by Yu Suzuki.
5287000	5297000	He gave us all kinds of fun games. But the fun thing about this one is that for an RPG, it was a kind of different RPG for its time.
5297000	5310000	It was meant to be a funny game. Because basically the main character, Taro, lives in a town with his mother and his dad and his younger sister.
5311000	5317000	Oh, there we go. Sorry, there's like 5,000 screens in the beginning of this. Finally the volume came in there.
5317000	5323000	But one day, he ordered pizza and instead got combat armor.
5323000	5332000	That would be cool. Like if I were to call the pizza place and order something and they bring me clothes instead. Actually, that would be kind of awkward.
5332000	5342000	But the combat armor gives him super strength and things like that. But then the people who sent him the armor, even though they did it, they're making him pay for it.
5344000	5356000	So he decides to become a hero for hire. Well wait, that's not cool. If that's the case, where's my pizza? Combat armor is going to be expensive. Do you know how much Iron Man paid for that suit of armor?
5356000	5370000	It was a lot. It was a lot, Jamie. It was a lot. This guy just lives with his weirdo family. So he decides to become a hero for hire to be able to pay for it.
5370000	5379000	And so that is why he's rent a hero. Dun dun dun. But one of the cool things about this game, have you ever played Sword of Vermillion?
5380000	5393000	I think I played it like once. Well this, I think you're looking at the Dreamcast one. The Mega Drive one was based off of the graphic engine for Sword of Vermillion.
5393000	5403000	But one of the things about this one, even though it's an RPG, your combat sequences instead of being turn-based are like a fighting game.
5403000	5413000	Oh that's cool. So you fight, and you fight all kinds of weird stuff like a guy in a Godzilla suit and, you know, weird things. It's just a quirky, funny game.
5413000	5418000	Just common everyday things that you fight. Like I had to fight somebody in a Godzilla suit yesterday.
5419000	5434000	Okay. Anyway, it came out on Mega Drive on September 20th, 1991. Of course released by Sega. And then it got a virtual console release, I think only in Japan on April 17th, 2007.
5434000	5449000	But now here is the remake. The remake was made on Dreamcast as Rent-a-Hero number one. And you have Hiro, the main character, but then you also have Rent-a-Hiroko.
5450000	5467000	So you can rent a female hero. And it has the same fighting engine that was used for the Spike Out games. So it had like different online capabilities. So you could use the CoolNet Entertainment for Xbox.
5467000	5475000	It had a translation, but the translation actually just sort of was left in limbo. It was mostly done. And there's a ROM set for it out.
5475000	5480000	That transform was so pretty. Did you see that? He did like a little twirl and he's like, oh, I'm transforming.
5480000	5482000	Yeah. Cause he's a magical girl.
5483000	5484000	I loved it.
5485000	5500000	But anyway, there was a promo for it in Japan, which was a UFO catcher game. And it was based off of, you know, just like the same old crane games from Japan.
5501000	5508000	Taro is in Fighters Megamix as an unlockable character, which I love Fighters Megamix cause you can fight as a car.
5508000	5512000	That game is so like weird. It's actually really good.
5512000	5514000	You can fight as the AM1 logo.
5514000	5515000	I know. It's awesome.
5515000	5516000	It's fantastic.
5519000	5531000	So, but anyway, Rent-a-Hiroko, it got pretty okay ratings. Famitsu gave it a 30 out of 40. IGN said it was cheesy as fuck. That's not probably what they said, but...
5531000	5536000	What's wrong with that? I like a good John Waters movie once in a while. They're cheesy.
5536000	5546000	But they said that it was just great graphics, you know, for its time. It was very tight gameplay. And as they said, it definitely had a soul.
5547000	5548000	It doesn't suck.
5548000	5558000	There's also going to be a Rent-a-Hero movie apparently. Um, but I don't know anything else about it. Just says that there's going to be a film version of Rent-a-Hero.
5559000	5560000	Okay. That's random.
5561000	5563000	Yeah. Let's make a movie out of a game that was out.
5563000	5564000	Directed by Steve Pink.
5565000	5571000	Huh. Is that one of those things where somebody just like put that on Wikipedia and it's completely unsourced? I'm thinking so.
5572000	5573000	There's a source.
5574000	5575000	Wow. All right.
5575000	5579000	As of July. Let's take a look at it.
5580000	5581000	Yes. Tell me more about Mr. Pink.
5582000	5584000	Mr. Steve Pink.
5584000	5586000	If that's his name.
5587000	5598000	Um, so according to the article here, thank you, Ash versus the Evil Dead. He's the director of Hot Tub Time Machine and writer of High Fidelity and Gross Point Blank.
5599000	5600000	Okay.
5600000	5601000	Signed on to write and direct a Rent-a-Hero movie.
5602000	5603000	Huh.
5604000	5612000	We'll write the project with Jeff Morris, who penned the Netflix adventure, The True Memoirs of an International Assassin.
5612000	5627000	So in this one, it tells the story of a reluctant slacker genius who joins a high tech startup pitched as Uber for heroes. Aim to improve people's daily lives at an affordable price.
5628000	5631000	This is so like random that that's happening.
5632000	5633000	I would watch the shit out of that.
5634000	5635000	I would watch the shit out of that. I will.
5636000	5637000	That was pretty good.
5638000	5641000	Especially if there's magical girl transformation sequences, just like we see in this game, which is outstanding.
5642000	5643000	Who wants to go ribbon like Sailor Moon?
5644000	5645000	One can hope.
5646000	5647000	One can only hope.
5648000	5649000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Rent-a-Hero.
5650000	5651000	Rent-a-Hero.
5652000	5654000	I think I will go rent one right now. Thank you for the suggestion, Jamie.
5655000	5658000	Well, at least it didn't do Pepsi Man. I almost did Pepsi Man.
5659000	5662000	Uh, that's going to do it for this week. We will see you next time, Dark Sakura.
5663000	5664000	Eventually.
5664000	5679000	All right, it's time now to get into some rapid fire news, although coming up later in the show, your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. But first, Loki.
5680000	5685000	All right. So there was a new Maroon 5 video that came out for their song.
5686000	5687000	Let's see which song was here.
5687000	5698000	It actually satirized Pokemon Go, so it was for I Don't Wanna Know, and it was basically like this guy dressed up like a Pokemon type character running around.
5699000	5700000	They all are. They're all Pokemon in the video, yeah.
5701000	5702000	Trying to avoid being captured, I guess.
5703000	5704000	Not actual Pokemon.
5705000	5707000	Right, it's kind of similar to Pokemon.
5708000	5713000	Like the one guy kind of looks like a giant eggplant with a face. Obviously they can't do the real Pokemon, but it's...
5714000	5721000	I don't know how much of the video you saw, but it's heavily implied that it's Pokemon Go because all the kids have their phones and they're all trying to catch them.
5722000	5723000	They're all flicking the things.
5724000	5731000	Yeah, so that's kind of fun if you want to check that out. Don't Wanna Know, that's the song from Maroon 5, so you can check out the video there and be amused for a little bit.
5732000	5739000	I'm surprised this is coming out because I know they've been talking about this for a while, but I'm not sure if I have any interest. Nope, I don't have any interest whatsoever.
5740000	5746000	That is the Skylanders series is going to be coming out on Netflix October 28th.
5747000	5750000	So that'll be interesting. I wonder if my kids will want to watch that.
5751000	5755000	I guess Netflix is trying to up their children's TV show presence or something.
5756000	5760000	Yeah, Skylanders Academy. That's going to be on October 28th.
5760000	5771000	The only reason that I'm slightly interested in that is because the villain in the show is the same voice actor as Invader Zim, and I love Invader Zim.
5772000	5776000	That's really it. That's where my like ends.
5777000	5783000	Alright, well moving on to talk about Pinball. I love this idea for a franchise.
5784000	5792000	So Stern Pinball is going to be celebrating their 30th anniversary coming up, and they're going to celebrate their anniversary by celebrating another anniversary.
5793000	5797000	And that is the 50th anniversary of the Batman television show.
5798000	5800000	Oh man, that's something I wish was on Netflix.
5800000	5808000	That's the Adam West, Burt Ward version with the super campy, this is, I love this show. There was a movie and everything.
5809000	5816000	So what's really cool, they are making a pinball table called Batman 66, and that is being done by Stern Pinball.
5817000	5821000	And it's being developed by Eugene Jarvis doing a lot of the animations and sound that's in the game.
5822000	5826000	There are three versions. There's going to be a super limited edition, a limited edition, and a premium.
5826000	5833000	So I guess the super limited editions are already gone, but they're talking that this table is very colorful.
5834000	5839000	It looks like there's an old school TV that looks like what was inside the Batmobile is like the display board.
5840000	5841000	That's awesome.
5842000	5848000	That's really cool, and it is apparently the first Stern game that will have a full color LCD in the back box. So that is going to be rad.
5848000	5858000	What's funny is I was just in Vegas this weekend, right? I played a Batman 66 inspired by the TV series Slot Machine.
5859000	5864000	They had a full slot machine on Batman that was really cool and would actually play little clips from the show and the bonus rounds and stuff.
5865000	5866000	I think I actually won like $2.
5867000	5869000	I'm guessing one of the bonus rounds has to be the bomb.
5870000	5875000	I didn't see that in the one I did, no. I got like a, it spun the wheel and it came up with the Riddler.
5875000	5880000	And so it started like it was like a clip from the show where Robin was reading one of the riddles or something.
5881000	5887000	And then I don't know if it was just like free spins or if it was one of those like tap the stuff on the screen because all the casino games are kind of the same.
5888000	5895000	And then like it would show the conclusion of that. Like it wasn't anything. I didn't see the bomb thing, but I imagine that has to be in there somewhere.
5896000	5899000	But I just didn't get it when I was playing. But maybe it will be in the pinball table somewhere. I don't know.
5899000	5907000	But I think that's rad that Batman 66 is kind of like making a comeback. I didn't realize it was the 50th anniversary, but that explains it.
5908000	5915000	I always thought they should do a new show with like almost like taking all those characters from the 66 show and putting them in modern time.
5916000	5922000	Like just having them be so clueless with the old ass tech and everything, but just fighting crime in like modern world. That would be hilarious.
5922000	5929000	I didn't realize this. SSJ100Matt in our chat room says they're coming out with an animated movie based on the Adam West Batman.
5930000	5934000	Complete with Adam West, Burt Ward, and Julie Newmar voicing their characters. I have no idea. That's rad.
5935000	5936000	Yes, I did see that.
5937000	5945000	Anyway, while you wait to play that pinball table, because who knows how many arcades will actually get it, although that coin op here in Sacramento really seems to love pinball.
5946000	5950000	And they get a lot of the new stuff, so I bet it will show up there. I want to check it out for sure.
5950000	5958000	Anyway, meanwhile you can check out some old school games on your Xbox One because more games have joined the backwards compatibility list.
5959000	5967000	And what we got Puzzle Quest 2 two weeks ago, right? So this past week we got Puzzle Quest. The original Puzzle Quest is now available on Xbox One backwards compatibility.
5968000	5975000	And we also got Matt Hazard and Silent Hill Downpour is now available as Xbox One.
5976000	5977000	Boo, that game's awful.
5978000	5979000	You didn't like Downpour?
5980000	5982000	No, it wasn't the last two months. Now it's just not interesting.
5983000	5986000	Isn't that the one where they kind of forced Pyramid Head back in it just because that was when the movie was coming out?
5987000	5988000	No, that was Homecoming.
5989000	5994000	Oh, that's right. That was Homecoming. Okay. Which one was Downpour? Was this the first one without Akira Yomoka involved?
5995000	5996000	Yes.
5997000	5999000	It was, wasn't it? They outsourced it to the Russian studio, I think, that did it.
6000000	6004000	Well, a lot of those did the Silent Hill games, but this one has the guy that did the music for Dexter.
6005000	6007000	And sorry, the music is just not that good.
6007000	6009000	Really? I'm surprised. He was not bad.
6010000	6016000	I think it's a mixture of the music not, you know, being Akira Yomoka's stuff, which is what you've come to expect.
6017000	6020000	You just get the guy to play Dexter to play one of the main characters in that.
6021000	6026000	And the story's not good, and the game is not good, and Silent Hill just needs to stay dead at this point.
6027000	6029000	Better yet, just bring back Dexter. Just bring back Dexter.
6030000	6032000	But what about the Silent Hill pachinko machine that's inevitable?
6033000	6034000	Nope. Nope.
6035000	6036000	What already happened?
6037000	6047000	Did you see the video? Because, once again, I'm a big fan of Jim Sterling, so whenever there's shit to talk about Konami, it's usually, you know, what's being brought up.
6048000	6049000	He's right at it.
6050000	6051000	Like, fuck Konami news. Gotta love it.
6052000	6061000	But anyways, they did show a video of what the Castlevania machine looks like, and it's like, barely Castlevania.
6061000	6066000	Like, if it didn't have Castlevania on there, I would not have known that that was a Castlevania licensed machine.
6067000	6076000	No, you know, some of my friends went over to the Bellagio in Vegas because, I guess, on the sign, it said something about, like, a Konami casino area or something like that.
6077000	6080000	And they were thinking, oh, maybe we'll get to see some of the pachinko machines or something, but apparently, no, it was nothing.
6081000	6086000	Just like any other casino. Because, you know, Konami does make casino games, but, you know, it was just, you know, that stuff.
6086000	6092000	Nothing Silent Hill or Metal Gear or any of that stuff. It's just their random, like, doesn't Konami make the Dungeons and Dragons slot machine? I think they do.
6093000	6094000	I don't know.
6095000	6096000	There's some other stuff that they do.
6097000	6102000	Yeah, just, you know, Konami, unfortunately, is just, yeah, my interest in them is very not existent.
6103000	6104000	Yeah, I understand, I understand.
6105000	6109000	Alright, let's travel around and see what is in stores this week, starting with the US. Loki.
6110000	6113000	I'm sure we have lots of fun stuff to look forward to this week.
6113000	6122000	So, starting things off, let's see, on this week, we've got Crazy Machines 3 for PC.
6123000	6129000	Eagle Flight on Oculus Rift. Remember that game? That was that weird one. I think that's an Ubisoft game.
6130000	6133000	They fly as an eagle for some reason.
6135000	6140000	Exist Archive The Other Side of the Sky on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6141000	6146000	Mordheim The City of the Damned on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6147000	6151000	Super Dimension Neptune vs. Sega Hard Girls on Vita.
6152000	6156000	Hopico on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6157000	6159000	This looks cool, except it's on Vita.
6160000	6162000	Macross Delta Scramble, that's on Vita.
6163000	6166000	Pixel Gear on PlayStation VR.
6167000	6172000	And then we've got Batman Return to Arkham on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, that remaster.
6173000	6177000	Battlefield 1, coming out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6178000	6180000	Civ VI on PC.
6181000	6186000	And then the Lego Harry Potter Collection on PlayStation 4. That's it.
6186000	6196000	Alright, well, traveling to Japan, it seems like a slower week for them on the PlayStation 4 anyway, with NBA 2K17 releasing on October 20th.
6197000	6201000	And then I was wondering, why are they getting all these, like, they have all these peripherals called tactical peripherals coming out,
6202000	6206000	but that's because they are also getting Battlefield 1 is coming out, but just on October 21st.
6207000	6209000	I guess that must be some type of worldwide thing that's going on there.
6210000	6212000	So that is what's happening on the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.
6212000	6220000	Nothing really happening on the Wii U, that's obviously in pretty much a holding pattern until Nintendo announces whatever else is coming out next.
6221000	6228000	Even looking at the PlayStation Vita, we get a few titles, although nothing I'm familiar with, but Macross Delta Scramble,
6229000	6234000	Idle Death Game TV. Is that like those cute little idle girls?
6235000	6237000	Oh my god, it is. What is this?
6237000	6245000	I'm looking at the box art, Idle Death Game, and it's all these cute little, you know, like, in the idle games, are they battling to the death? Like, what?
6246000	6249000	Is it like Battle Royale of, like, the idle singers? Cause that could be cool.
6250000	6256000	I don't know, but this one girl that's wearing one of those adult pajamas thing, what are they called? The kigurumi? Is that what they're called? The pajamas?
6257000	6262000	She's got a giant fish in her hand, like she's gonna slap somebody upside the head with a fish and kill them.
6263000	6265000	And Rama says yes, that is what this is.
6265000	6272000	This is Idle Girls Battling to the Death. Well there it is, your game of the week, and it's only on the PlayStation Vita!
6273000	6274000	See, that's so weird.
6275000	6276000	The Vita is alive and well in Japan.
6277000	6278000	It is.
6279000	6281000	Anime girls battling to the death. Oh my god.
6282000	6292000	Akumaj AP in chat says we are waiting for Final Fantasy XV. I guess maybe this dead period was planned because Final Fantasy XV was supposed to be out by now, but anyway.
6292000	6301000	Okay, also on the Vita this week, Recolove Blue Ocean and Gold Beach, two different flavors there, and Saran Digit in a regular and a limited edition.
6302000	6314000	Lastly, checking out the Nintendo 3DS this week. Sanu Amiibo are coming out this week in the Super Mario series, and that's all because of Mario Party Star Rush hitting Japan this week on the Nintendo 3DS.
6315000	6318000	So that's probably a bigger deal over there.
6318000	6323000	So there it is, your Japanese games. Back to Loki for the UK.
6324000	6332000	Not too much. Batman Arkham, the collection's coming out there, so you get Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, and then of course Civ VI on PC.
6335000	6339000	Civ VI snuck up on me. I am not ready to have my life ruined by Civ VI.
6339000	6349000	Battlefield 1 looks cool. I don't know. I purchased the Battlefield games, but then I don't play them. I have Battlefield 4, and I never really played much of that.
6350000	6356000	I almost purchased Hardline, but I don't know. They're just really interesting looking games.
6357000	6372000	Sorry, AkumaJP is linking me to the idol death game. He's linking me to pictures, and you can kind of see how one of these plays out here, where it looks like this baseball player is throwing the baseball so hard she probably kills somebody with it or something like that.
6373000	6384000	It's kind of ridiculous. I kind of want to play it. It looks silly. I want to play that, yet I won't play the kitchen thing. But that's because the idol girl is a cartoon thing, and it's ridiculous.
6384000	6386000	You need to play Rush of Blood still.
6387000	6390000	I don't know. I do want to play that. Maybe I'll do that when it's done.
6391000	6392000	Alright. Super good.
6393000	6396000	Well, I think it is time that we visit. Oh wait, did we do the UK dates? Sorry.
6397000	6398000	Yeah, we did the UK dates. I'll brief.
6399000	6406000	Just want to make sure I didn't interrupt you with the discussion of the further idol death girls. Anyway, it's time for us to get to the mailbag.
6406000	6422000	Every week, you guys email us. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com, and we jump into the emails head first and pull out the emails that we want to read, and we read them.
6423000	6433000	And we start off tonight with an email from YYR, who says, Hello, LR. I sent this email over the two-week break, but I guess it didn't get through for some reason. It's still relevant, though, so I'll try again.
6433000	6443000	So here's the deal. That was my bad, and the reason why is because I read your message earlier in the week, as I sometimes do. I'll kind of just go in and see, kind of like just looking at what emails are coming up ahead for the show.
6444000	6452000	And then I forgot to mark it as unread, so when I came back to get them for the show, it wasn't in my queue of stuff to read. It's really just that stupidly simple, so I apologize for that.
6453000	6457000	But yeah, one missed click or forgotten click, and I ruined the entire mailbag segment.
6458000	6460000	Alright, anyway, so YYR continues with the email.
6461000	6472000	On the subject of Project Diva X, it is true that it has fewer songs than previous versions, as well as a mandatory story mode, and I use the term story very loosely, as you should.
6473000	6485000	Looking for something better? I have a recommendation. Go to playasia.com, buy a 10,000 yen prepaid Japanese PSN card, create a Japanese PSN account, and finally, go buy Project Diva Future Tone from the Japanese PlayStation Store.
6486000	6491000	It is a direct port of the arcade game of the same name. Oh, I've seen that at round one. You've played that, right, Shane?
6492000	6493000	Yeah, it's super hard.
6494000	6502000	It has set you back over $80 US, but it contains over 220 songs. It's also got gorgeous high-definition graphics and runs at 60 frames a second.
6503000	6513000	DLC has started to arrive recently. The DLC brings the game up to date with the arcade version. It's heavily rumored that the arcade game will receive its final update soon, and sales of Project Diva X were not looking good in Japan,
6513000	6522000	so it's possible that this will be the final and definitive Project Diva experience. Well, why do you release a lesser version in the US, then, when this is out there?
6523000	6527000	This is back to the Konami days of the show all over again, but anyway, I digress.
6528000	6534000	And because the song list is almost entirely made up of licenses, it is unlikely to ever be released in America. Oh, well, there's the answer.
6534000	6545000	I've already sunk a few good hours into it, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Vocaloid music, who has enjoyed a Project Diva game in the past, and has not turned off by a high-priced digital exclusive release.
6546000	6552000	Now, on the subject of the NX price point, things are very different now than they were a few years ago.
6553000	6558000	There was still some hope with Wii U that it could be a console we could play third-party games on, that it could be a primary console.
6558000	6569000	That hope evaporated pretty quickly, and it became clear that Wii U was at best a secondary console, one that you would buy mostly just to play Nintendo's own content, and not the latest, greatest, or prettiest games.
6570000	6574000	That is, I believe, a major factor as to why the Wii U didn't sell well at $2.99.
6575000	6587000	Regardless of what the NX actually turns out to be, gamers are now beginning to get used to the idea of Nintendo's consoles being in that secondary role, and all the rumors seem to back up the theory that NX will be in that secondary role as well.
6588000	6595000	In order to be successful, I believe that the NX has to be priced accordingly, and by that I mean $1.99. Yes, $1.99.
6596000	6608000	Perhaps this would be without the TV dock, or Power Booster, or sprocket lockets, or Nunchuck Motion Plus Alpha, or whatever crap they're going to try to sell us along with it, but the base price absolutely has to be as family-friendly as the games.
6609000	6616000	Nintendo has a lot to prove with the NX. They need to make a compelling and convincing argument that they shouldn't just go third-party and publish their games on other companies' hardware,
6616000	6619000	which, by the way, they are already starting to do with Super Mario Run.
6620000	6621000	They really do need to do that.
6622000	6633000	They also need to somehow convince us to buy a so-called portable system that, if the rumors are true, is way too big to ever fit into a pocket, and to convince us that we should hook up yet another box to our TV.
6634000	6639000	A box that we are not even expected to use as often as our primary box, or our older boxes, the ones with the backlogs on them.
6640000	6648000	If the launch games don't kick every conceivable kind of ass, or the price is too high, mark my words, the NX will hit the wall even faster than the Wii U did.
6649000	6652000	What are the chances that Nintendo will ever be taken seriously again if the NX is a failure?
6653000	6660000	If, after ignoring the competition and doing entirely their own thing, and being punished for it, they repeat the same mistake a second time with the same results.
6661000	6665000	I try to be an optimist with just about everything, but Nintendo is making that very difficult right now.
6665000	6669000	Oh well, going back to playing Project Diva, Aaron, YYR.
6670000	6673000	I don't necessarily disagree with the points raised in the email.
6674000	6681000	Which, by the way, since we didn't bring it up, because I don't want to report on rumors, especially with the NX, but the rumor is...
6682000	6684000	Since you brought it up, since YYR brought it up.
6685000	6693000	Since he brought it up, the rumor is, and I know that we're going to get our hopes up, that they're going to make an announcement next week.
6695000	6704000	Oh, that's hilarious, because in my mind I thought you were going to say the rumor that it's going to be revealed as part of the Video Game Awards show, because Nintendo and Geoff Keighley get along.
6705000	6709000	So we have two different rumors out there about two different date reveals. Yeah, that's not plausible.
6710000	6714000	Maybe the announcement will be that they're going to announce it at the Video Game Awards.
6715000	6716000	Yeah, announcement of the announcement, right?
6717000	6718000	That's a popular thing to do.
6719000	6721000	I suppose I shouldn't say it isn't plausible, because it could happen at the Game Awards.
6722000	6723000	You know what I want them to do?
6723000	6725000	You know what? I don't... I'm over it.
6726000	6730000	I want them to announce the NX, and have it be just kind of okay, and then Rockstar's like,
6731000	6732000	Fuck you, it's goddamn Red Dead time!
6733000	6734000	And it's like, what NX? What?!
6735000	6737000	I'll give a crap about that, because it's Red Dead time.
6738000	6747000	Unless Rockstar plays the biggest joke ever on you, and announces Red Dead as part of the Nintendo NX reveal, with it launching first on the Nintendo NX.
6748000	6750000	Never going to happen. Never going to happen.
6750000	6757000	I only want it to happen so bad, just to see those tears.
6758000	6763000	It's not even tears, it's just going to be... everyone's going to be like, I don't get why you would do that, but okay.
6764000	6767000	Well, it'll be just like Bayonetta 2. It will. It's going to be just like Bayonetta 2.
6768000	6772000	No, please! A Rockstar game is not Bayonetta 2.
6773000	6776000	That's not even close of a comparison.
6777000	6780000	I'm going to keep my mouth shut, because I'll say something shady.
6781000	6782000	Let's see...
6783000	6785000	By the way, how much have you played Grand Theft Auto 5 lately?
6786000	6789000	Not a lot, because I'm playing all this other shit too. You know exactly how it goes.
6790000	6791000	How about Fallout 4?
6792000	6793000	How about Pokemon?
6794000	6796000	See? There's like a million things to play!
6797000	6801000	I know, and I keep purchasing more. Like, I was putting more Steam keys into my library this weekend.
6801000	6806000	Because I apparently like watching that number tick up, and that's really the only reason.
6807000	6813000	And I don't know why. It's like, I don't even know what half these games are. I'll purchase Humballs. I'm like, damn, I gotta get that game. It's already in my library.
6814000	6817000	He catches shinies, you catch Steam games. That's how it works.
6818000	6820000	I will play them. Someday.
6821000	6825000	Someday. Someday. Or you'll pass it on to your kids and they can play them someday.
6826000	6827000	Will you? There's like a thousand games.
6828000	6831000	AkumaJP in chat says, Loki, you have a problem over at live.log.
6832000	6836000	I do, but the problem is that there's such good deals. I'm almost doing that with PlayStation games.
6837000	6838000	The problem is this sweet deal!
6839000	6844000	I was like, man, Killzone's only like $7! And I'm like, wait, no, it's Killzone. I don't want to buy that.
6845000	6855000	Anyway, I don't want to get too far away from YYR's email, but I don't know if I have a lot to respond to that, because I just kind of feel like what he says is kind of in line with how I feel.
6855000	6867000	I would say, though, the part where he talks about, even if the system is $1.99 and they sell that dock separately, get used to that idea, because that could be a thing.
6868000	6871000	If it's the handheld, but I don't want to go...
6872000	6877000	I'm sorry, but if you're going to try to be the best number two as you can be, which is stupid.
6877000	6887000	I don't need a second system. You know what my second system is going to be? It's going to be a fucking VR rig, because that shit's going to be fucking expensive.
6888000	6897000	Why am I going to buy... Especially, even though I didn't purchase my Wii U, I have a Wii U that I don't play a lot of games on.
6898000	6906000	Literally, I go to the store and I'm like, I should get some more games for the Wii U, and I look there and I'm like, no, I'm not paying those prices for those games.
6907000	6913000	It's not bad, though. Why would I buy an NX when it's going to be this thing all over again?
6914000	6922000	I can take it with me and playing games will be fun, but I could get 3DS for that if I really wanted to. I don't know.
6923000	6933000	I've just hit a wall when it comes to NX. I've theorized to be heading it back. Nintendo just needs to talk already.
6933000	6941000	I think right now they really do need to announce something, because whatever they announce, it's going to be Half-Life 3, basically.
6942000	6946000	It's going to be where our expectations are up here, and their announcement is just going to be down here.
6947000	6953000	The sooner they come out with a realistic, here's what it is, the sooner people will be able to deal with that.
6954000	6959000	Somebody tried to pass off another one over on the internet, that whole Photoshop and Nintendo duo.
6959000	6966000	I don't believe anything. No, you do not have a screenshot of a presentation that's going to be announced. That's never a thing.
6967000	6975000	All right, new email, new topic. This is from Andy R. over at participate at orangeontrudy.com if you want to send us an email.
6976000	6983000	Andy R. starts off, I'm betting you've had at least a few other impressions of the PSVR on the show by this point, or during calls, but I thought I'd chime in with my two cents.
6984000	6986000	Well, lucky you that Shane decided to grace us with his presence tonight.
6986000	6993000	At the moment, I'd say it's pretty impressive technology. I haven't had nearly the issues that Giant Bomb was complaining about, and it's been mostly solid.
6994000	7002000	I've noticed some occasional drift in the headset every once in a while. Moving closer to the camera, I was pretty close to the far end of their recommended distance, seems to have helped too.
7003000	7006000	Plus, most games will re-center the headset simply by holding the options button.
7007000	7012000	I've only used the Oculus a couple of times and Gear VR once, but I'd say this is easily the most comfortable of those.
7012000	7016000	Screen looks good, and it fits easily over my glasses unlike those other ones.
7017000	7020000	As far as games, I'd say this is one of the better launch lineups for a hardware launch in a while.
7021000	7030000	Eve Valkyrie and Battlezone are both great showcases for the tech, while Thumper and Super Stardust Ultra are great in the VR added category, and Headmaster is just plain fun.
7031000	7035000	I haven't picked up Batman VR or Until Dawn, which I'm being told are very solid games as well.
7036000	7039000	I can't wait to get Rez, I bought the physical version which sadly isn't shipping until next month.
7039000	7052000	I did get a little sick to my stomach the first night. Out of the 5 or 6 times I tried PSVR before it came out, I only felt queasy once, so I was a little surprised that I felt it that first night, but I guess playing for a longer period of time did me in.
7053000	7057000	I'd like to think I'm already getting used to it though, it's just taking my brain a couple days to adjust.
7058000	7068000	Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. I don't think it'll usurp all conventional gaming, though I did enjoy being able to play non-VR games on it while laying down last night.
7069000	7080000	There's another vote for Cinema Mode and something that hasn't even really been talked about until the thing releases that somebody's talking about, ooh I like this feature, so interesting.
7081000	7089000	But there you go, more impressions that I guess are generally in line with what we're thinking here in studio, except it sounds like you've played a lot more games maybe than we have.
7090000	7093000	Shane, you haven't done the Batman VR thing or Super Stardust Ultra or any of that, right?
7094000	7096000	No, because I don't know those games and they weren't on the demo disc.
7096000	7105000	Gotcha, gotcha, alright. So anyway, that's it for email tonight, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you would like to send an email to us in the future.
7106000	7114000	In the meantime, we have a few more news stories for you guys before we open up our Skype line at orangeloungeradio, all one word on Skype.
7114000	7125000	So we talked about this a few months back where they had kind of come to an agreement that there was going to be a settlement or something according to the other OS lawsuit.
7126000	7138000	So now that's finally happening, so if you basically purchase one of the launch systems between November 1st, 2006 and April 1st, 2010, you can claim payment for that.
7139000	7155000	So apparently there's two options. One is, I guess if you were, I want to say if you had some evidence that you were using the other OS, then you would get like $55, otherwise you could get $9.
7156000	7168000	And so, yeah, apparently they're saying that 111,000 people have claimed the $9 level. So, interesting.
7169000	7172000	Yay, free money. Sort of.
7175000	7190000	Oh, I'm sorry, yeah, it'd take 100,000 people to get over a million dollars. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I didn't use the other OS. It is disappointing. I know I'm not going to do this to get $9.
7190000	7199000	I feel like I would have tried it if they kept it in there. Especially at this point where my PlayStation 3 is like a secondary room console at this point.
7200000	7209000	Like, the PlayStation 3 at this point is in the studio where we do OLR and we use TuneIn on it to listen to Bobby and other stuff that's going on on VoG before the show.
7210000	7213000	And one of these days I'll figure out how to get chat on the TV in here.
7213000	7219000	Hey, just remember when we used to use the PlayStation 2 and the iToy for chat? Or the chat camera?
7220000	7225000	Oh god, that was years ago. Wasn't that the whole thing? You had to go to the website and every 10 seconds it was a new picture?
7226000	7228000	Yes. Was it that? Oh my god. That was old school.
7229000	7233000	The wild west days of the internet. That's what kind of video streaming we could do.
7234000	7235000	Those were the pre-podcast days.
7236000	7239000	Oh my god, it's refreshing every couple seconds? You're refreshing too fast.
7239000	7246000	Okay, this thing that we're talking about, run up to the camera and hold it there for 10 seconds so we make sure we get a picture of it.
7248000	7250000	Anyway. Before live video.
7251000	7260000	Yeah, now that they're doing this now. Let's see, JD in chat says, there are PS3 IRC clients out there, Sky. Are there? I didn't even know that.
7261000	7266000	Like, legit ones in the store? Or is it something that you can get on the web?
7267000	7268000	I'm thinking it's probably a website that you can go to.
7269000	7276000	It's probably a web thing that actually will work that runs. I actually haven't tried to do the vog chat on PS3. Maybe. So I'll have to look into that.
7277000	7284000	But wouldn't that like, cap us or something? You know, if you have too many people. Oh no, you're talking about through the website.
7285000	7291000	Yeah, no, if too many people in this house are on it, then yeah, it would cap us. But we could figure something out.
7292000	7294000	Because you can use 4G or something, or LTE.
7295000	7296000	I'm not gonna do that.
7297000	7300000	We need to figure out the neighbors' wifi. Just kidding.
7301000	7309000	Alright. Let's see. JD says, yeah, I don't think it's in the store. I'm seeing stuff that's putting Mibbit on. Okay. Or custom ROMs. Okay.
7310000	7314000	Let's see. Let's move on with some other stories.
7315000	7322000	Talking about a Steam update. And an upcoming Steam update is going to be expanding PlayStation 4 controller support.
7322000	7329000	So, you know, if you have not picked up one of these Steam controllers, you can still use a PlayStation 4 controller and that is going to be enhanced.
7330000	7337000	And this was announced during the Steam dev days that are actually going on in Seattle right now. I think our guest last week, I follow him on Twitter, I think he went to this because he was talking about this.
7338000	7348000	So they've been talking about some of the things that are coming to Steam. And Jeff Bellinghausen from Valve talked about that a Steam update is going to expand its controller options for the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4.
7348000	7358000	So you're going to be able to tailor your games to use the PlayStation 4 in a variety of new ways. Like the touchpad and the gyro features that you can use will be available on Steam.
7359000	7365000	So that's kind of neat. And then they actually showed a preview of what the configuration screen looks like. So, kind of neat.
7366000	7375000	Also, it was mentioned by Lars, I hope I say this last name correctly, Doucette, who is the developer of Defenders Quest, who is also presenting this said,
7376000	7381000	Believe it or not, when you use the PS4 controller through Steam's API, it's exactly the same as the Steam controller.
7382000	7387000	You make the exact same API calls, you only get actions, not inputs, and the Steam API takes care of everything.
7388000	7392000	So it sounds like they're really trying to make it so that, you know, if it supports the Steam controller, it'll support the PS4 controller.
7392000	7398000	Which is kind of good guy Valve, I guess, because, you know, if they wanted to pigeonhole people in that Steam controller, they could.
7399000	7405000	But they probably realized they'd make more enemies than friends with that. So, fair enough. Loki.
7406000	7416000	Alright, so there's a game that's going to be coming out on PlayStation VR that's kind of a throwback to an old legend of the arcades.
7416000	7429000	It's a game called Polybius. And Polybius is, I guess, rumored to be some sort of game that was in a few arcades and had some, like, mind-bending visuals or something like that,
7430000	7436000	that was causing people to get headaches and other people ill. Some say that it was like a CIA mind control experiment or something like that.
7436000	7438000	Oh god, I remember that.
7439000	7447000	But anyways, so now, you know, Llamasoft's Jeff Minter is making another game that's with the same name that's supposed to be kind of like the legend.
7448000	7449000	Like, ooh, you're playing the game for the first time.
7450000	7454000	That's the other VR game I wanted to play. I forgot. Isn't that exclusive to PS4 VR?
7455000	7459000	I think so, yeah. So that's going to be something that you'll be able to play as well.
7460000	7463000	Sounds like one of those found footage horror movies or something.
7463000	7474000	Yeah, I don't know. It's hard for me to get excited. I mean, Tempest is okay, but it's like, I don't know. I can't get that excited about it.
7475000	7483000	Alright, lastly for our show tonight before we get to your calls, I don't know, this seems something that's right up Shane's alley, although it might be the wrong game,
7484000	7489000	but I have a feeling Shane is going to want to do this anyway. Shane, you might want a road trip to Los Angeles.
7490000	7491000	Why?
7491000	7499000	Because I am 8-Bit is going to be hosting their own escape room.
7500000	7501000	Oh, that'd be cool.
7502000	7503000	And the escape room is based on Resident Evil 7.
7504000	7505000	Oh, okay.
7506000	7510000	Yeah, I knew. Like, escape room, I'm interested. Resident Evil 7, I'm less interested. But you did say...
7511000	7512000	I did say I do want to get the game now.
7513000	7514000	Yeah, you might be on the fence a little more now.
7515000	7518000	So anyway, yes, Capcom and I am 8-Bit are teaming up to create this escape room.
7518000	7523000	They're calling it, though, an escape experience because this is actually multiple rooms.
7524000	7531000	Those are the better escape rooms, I think. Like, my favorite one I did was, like, three rooms in one session. It was really fun.
7532000	7539000	Only 300 tickets are available, and only one room is presenting the experience from October 20th through November 6th.
7540000	7544000	I don't know why they say one room, but then they say it's multiple rooms. I think they mean to say it's one place.
7544000	7551000	But I don't know. But anyway, it's the I Am 8-Bits, Los Angeles offices, $35, and teams up to six people are allowed.
7552000	7560000	And there's an Eventbrite page for the event and everything. So, I don't know, Shane, you gonna get a car ride together to go experience Resident Evil 7 escape room?
7561000	7562000	Nope.
7563000	7564000	We have yet to do an escape room here in Sacramento.
7565000	7566000	I know.
7567000	7568000	Ever since you came back, going like, I love escape rooms.
7569000	7570000	I still feel like it would be a bad idea, but I still want to do it.
7570000	7573000	I think you should do it with friends and create some great new memories of escape rooms here.
7574000	7575000	That's the problem.
7576000	7577000	What? Listening to me complain and scream?
7578000	7580000	Yeah, or throw a fit because we're not finishing it.
7581000	7583000	Me throwing a tantrum? How dare you?
7584000	7585000	Yes.
7586000	7588000	Do you think I'm gonna throw- I was gonna make a Drag Race reference and then realize you don't watch it anymore.
7589000	7590000	Nope.
7591000	7593000	Alright. Just throw my wig off and start crying.
7593000	7600000	Alright. Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call. If you prefer the old school way, 1-877-GAMO-LR.
7601000	7606000	Orange Launch Radio is the place to call us if you want to talk about anything that we've talked about tonight or maybe something we didn't get to.
7607000	7608000	You can do that right now.
7609000	7611000	Meanwhile, I don't know, Loki, any last minute stories?
7612000	7613000	It was such a slow week.
7614000	7620000	Well, besides the PSVR launch, I mean, but that's not really new information. That's just the delivery of something we've been waiting for.
7620000	7623000	But, um, so not a lot over there, huh?
7624000	7631000	Not a lot. I'm still on the fence about, um, uh, getting one of those Google Pixels.
7632000	7636000	And then I was decided to read Neogaf and apparently someone has a very awesome opinion.
7637000	7641000	They said Excite Truck was super rad and we need another one. Yes, I am very interested in this forum thread.
7642000	7645000	I'd like to subscribe to this newsletter. Anyway, we got a phone call coming in so let's get to it.
7646000	7647000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7647000	7649000	Hey, this is Marcus or MXC in chat.
7650000	7651000	Hey, Marcus, how you doing?
7652000	7653000	I'm doing good. Thanks.
7654000	7659000	Good. You called us a couple or last week, right? To talk about that you were going to be bringing the or you were getting a PSVR, right?
7660000	7662000	Yeah, but I was nervous about the purchase.
7663000	7664000	Well, so now I have it.
7665000	7666000	Here we are. What happened?
7666000	7673000	Yes. Um, and basically, um, I am having various issues.
7674000	7675000	Oh.
7676000	7677000	But I still really like it.
7678000	7681000	See, so you're letting the issues slide because overall you like it.
7682000	7683000	What are what are the issues?
7684000	7690000	Um, the big one is sort of I think Bobby Blackwell talked about it where there's sort of a drifting of the screen.
7691000	7695000	For me, I noticed it in rez. It seemed to keep going to the left.
7696000	7701000	So I played the whole game through areas one through five and then area X basically in one session.
7702000	7706000	And when I was done, I took off my headset and I was facing directly away from the TV.
7707000	7710000	So 180 degrees because it kept drifting.
7711000	7712000	Wow, that's a little weird.
7713000	7716000	And it didn't seem to work the sort of like reorient button.
7717000	7719000	I didn't seem to do what I needed to do.
7720000	7722000	So that's how I ended up facing the exact opposite direction.
7723000	7729000	Um, and then, but I mean, that's okay. I just sort of stand up and I can deal with rotating, I guess.
7730000	7741000	Um, the bigger issue is sort of, um, which I noticed with Job Simulator is sort of the world kind of like vibrates or something.
7742000	7745000	Um, and that's that's pretty disorienting for me.
7746000	7749000	To see things sort of shifting when you're standing still.
7750000	7752000	Um, that made me really nauseous the first night.
7753000	7759000	Um, I was sort of able to overcome it by forcing myself to try it again, but I don't want that to be the case.
7760000	7761000	Um, it's the only game I notice where that happens.
7762000	7767000	Um, because these, these incidents are sort of selective. They don't seem to happen on every single game.
7768000	7771000	I feel like it's a software thing and I'm hoping that it could be resolved somehow.
7771000	7775000	Um, I've made my setup. I've modified it. I've tried different lightings.
7776000	7779000	Um, some games still have issues, others don't.
7780000	7785000	I don't know if you're seeing some of the advice that Bobby's giving you in chat about getting closer to the camera, turn off the lights, adjust the devices.
7786000	7791000	Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've played in pitch black basically, or I've, I've went by camera above the TV below it.
7792000	7794000	I got a mic stand and sort of put this in the middle.
7794000	7801000	Um, all kinds of stuff, still trying things, looking at Reddit and whatnot, um, to see what other people are suggesting.
7802000	7805000	You know, nothing has fixed it, but you know, it's not awful.
7806000	7808000	And I'm still having a lot of fun.
7809000	7816000	Maybe it's one of those things where they'll fix it with patches. Not that we ever like to necessarily hear that, but you know, it's still new technology.
7817000	7819000	You know, it's, it's getting out there in the public's hands for the first time.
7819000	7824000	So there's going to be issues that come up that for whatever reason didn't get picked up in testing because every living room is different, right?
7825000	7832000	Yeah, exactly. I've got space, so it's really cool. I can like get up close if I really want to, but I mean, I'm still having a lot of fun.
7833000	7838000	My favorite games all seem to play well. Res Infinite, um, what is it?
7839000	7847000	Super Hypercube, Thumper, they all run really well. I've noticed it seems like the best games in my opinion are the ones that are the most abstract.
7847000	7858000	And interesting that you named the exact same games that another friend of mine names as the best VR games that Shane kinda, although he puts the Until Dawn game in there, but he also loves that series.
7859000	7874000	Yeah, I really want to like Until Dawn. It has some great creepy levels. The only problem I'm having with that with the move controllers, no matter what I do, the guns are always pointing off to the left of what I think is center, so I've been having issues with that.
7875000	7876000	Okay.
7877000	7881000	But it's really creepy, so there's that as well.
7882000	7893000	So was there anything on the, not to be negative, but just out of curiosity, are there any PSVR things maybe you didn't enjoy? Because I know Shane called out the luge thing. Is there anything that you're kind of like, eh, skip it?
7893000	7909000	I mean, there's a couple games, like there's a game called The Assembly, which also came out on I believe Vive and Oculus, and it's like I don't even know why they put it in VR, it's just like an average sort of adventure game.
7910000	7917000	But I mean it's not awful in VR, it's just sort of like, I don't know why this is a launch game. It's not bringing anything new to the table.
7918000	7919000	I see.
7920000	7929000	And then, I mean nothing's really been awful. Nothing has made me sick, like super sick aside from the initial run with Job Simulator, so I mean that's good.
7930000	7936000	Well that's good. That's good that at least you're going like, oh my god it was just terrible. That's good for a launch lineup.
7937000	7938000	Definitely.
7938000	7950000	Well I appreciate the follow-up call to hear how your experiences were. Do you think you're going to continue to keep playing Rez throughout the coming weeks, and do you think the VR is going to be a regular part of your gaming routine, or what happens from here?
7951000	7963000	I'm not sure. I mean I've been looking at sort of the upcoming releases. There's like maybe 20 games confirmed for 2016 at least, and some other ones like to be announced 2016, so maybe they'll slip.
7963000	7971000	A couple things look cool in there, but I mean I don't know. I'm having fun right now. I really don't know what it'll be like in the future.
7972000	7979000	That's important at least to be having fun, and hope that your investment was worth it, but it sounds like you're feeling a lot better now than you were last week.
7980000	7990000	Yeah, and I think sort of the unexpected hit is sort of Playroom VR. It's really good, and if you have people to play with particularly, it's really silly, but it's pretty fun to play.
7990000	7996000	All right, awesome. All right, well I am going to let you go MXC so we can get a couple more calls, but thanks for the call. I really appreciate it.
7997000	7998000	No problem.
7998000	7999000	All right, bye.
7999000	8000000	Bye.
8000000	8010000	All right, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, Skypline is open right now, and we have another call coming in, so let's get to it.
8011000	8012000	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8013000	8015000	Hi, this is not MXC.
8016000	8017000	It's actdeft, isn't it?
8018000	8019000	Yeah, it's actdeft.
8020000	8023000	Yeah, I can tell the difference, but that's all right. What's on your mind, buddy?
8024000	8028000	Well, I want to talk about the Nintendo NX rumors like always.
8029000	8037000	Just to be clear, I said that because there's a chatter who said that they sound like the same person, so anyway. You want to talk about Nintendo NX?
8038000	8041000	Yeah, those rumors we always hear every week.
8042000	8043000	Yeah, my favorite.
8043000	8049000	In the announcement of it, I have a speculation somewhat of when it will come out.
8050000	8052000	Oh, should I get my plausibility scale, actdeft?
8053000	8054000	Yeah.
8054000	8057000	All right, let me wheel it in the room. I feel like my plausibility scale now.
8058000	8059000	Plausibility wheel, turn, turn, turn.
8060000	8072000	Show us the lesson that we should make up. I feel like I should have theme music for the plausibility wheel, but in the meantime, we'll roll that in the studio and tell us, please, your tinfoil hat theory.
8073000	8089000	Yeah, basically, and we were talking about this in chat. Nintendo will probably announce the NX until probably the latest January of next year. The earliest, probably December.
8089000	8106000	So, you think it's going to be a wintertime announcement, which I got to admit is a really strange time to do something like that, but we do have PlayStation Expo in that timeframe, and they've learned to release bombshells that week and it works just fine.
8107000	8116000	So, maybe the rules about timing is changing, which is plausible. I think that would rate a six on the plausibility scale.
8116000	8120000	But what are your reasons for saying December, January?
8121000	8137000	Basically, they don't want people to wait for the NX since they still have the Wii U, even though this holiday season only has one game and was already released.
8138000	8143000	But the 3DS has many games coming, especially a big one since it's Pokemon.
8144000	8145000	Right.
8145000	8156000	And they probably don't want people like getting ahead and, oh, I'm going to wait until the NX since they probably want people like buying right now a 3DS with Pokemon.
8157000	8171000	Right. You know, even I discovered today in my lovely, I love my 3DS with the Triforce on it, it's that Zelda one that they had, but I noticed there's a big chip in the front of it now, and I'm like, ugh.
8172000	8173000	It's time to get a new 3DS XL.
8173000	8180000	And that's where I was at, is that, oh, maybe now I'll use this as an excuse to get a new 3DS, but then I'm thinking in the back of my mind, well, wait a minute.
8181000	8183000	Wait a minute. What about all this NX stuff?
8184000	8187000	Nope, still get a new 3DS XL. Let's go shopping for them next week.
8188000	8193000	Ah, this is horrible. I should never set anything on this radio program. Anyway, continue your thought. Please act deaf.
8194000	8204000	No, but yeah, basically it's that. Nintendo doesn't have a reason right now to reveal the NX and say when it's coming out.
8205000	8209000	Even though we probably know it's coming out like in spring of next year.
8210000	8221000	But yeah, Nintendo wants people to buy the products they already have, and also the NES Classic. They also have that, so.
8221000	8233000	That is something they're really pushing. And maybe if that NES Classic sells so freaking well that maybe they can afford the financial loss to bump NX a little further back, but I don't know.
8234000	8244000	I don't know if I want to go down that road. I'm just exhausted when it comes to those two letters. Those are my two least favorite letters in the English language right now. I'm just exhausted.
8245000	8249000	Hey, do you know how they should name the NX?
8249000	8251000	What? The Nintendo Possible.
8252000	8253000	Oh, shut up.
8254000	8260000	No, that would be stupid. Just like the Wii U was stupid. Just like the Wii U was stupid to be honest.
8261000	8277000	JD is actually making a suggestion in chat that I kind of like that we could have a theme song for the plausibility wheel and that it could be Against All Odds from DDR 5th Mix. Get it? Because it's against all odds.
8277000	8279000	It's possible.
8280000	8285000	Let's bring in the wheel of plausibility.
8288000	8290000	Anyway, I tried.
8291000	8296000	Yeah, Nintendo, how could you just walk away from me? How dare you?
8297000	8303000	Alright, act deaf. I'm going to let you go before this show takes turn for the worse. Take care, my friend.
8304000	8305000	Hey, thanks for having me.
8305000	8306000	Alright, thank you. Take care.
8307000	8317000	And it wouldn't get worse because of act deaf. It's worse because of these bad puns that the chat keeps enabling me to do.
8318000	8322000	Let's see, other comments from our chat while we wait and see if we get any more calls.
8323000	8332000	OrangeLawnsRadio on Skype. Let's see, Kaijuto in chat saying that the new 3DS is 100% worth it. It's hand down worth it. All the updates to the system are things that the 3DS needed.
8332000	8339000	Dart Tetsuya says, oh yeah, I'm on board with the NES Classic. I still collect the old games, but having the convenience would be awesome.
8340000	8344000	So, any last minute stories while we wait to see if any other calls drop in here?
8345000	8346000	No.
8347000	8348000	You're out? You're done with it?
8349000	8350000	There's no stories to be had.
8351000	8356000	I'm trying to see if there's anything from, I'm seeing something about Street Fighter 5 could be getting an arcade mode soon.
8356000	8361000	Well, that's nice that they're still patching more modes in Street Fighter 5 months and months after it launched.
8362000	8366000	Apparently Michael Patcher said something about a water or something that people didn't like.
8367000	8371000	And also Alex Trebek made fun of nerds or something. I don't know. I don't care.
8372000	8378000	Yeah, I didn't want to give that Patcher thing the time of day because it's just, it's kind of, it's tabloid news.
8378000	8392000	And plus, I, here we go, I still don't understand why that guy is in the news. I mean, I get that he's the industry expert when it comes to the finance and all this other stuff.
8393000	8399000	But I just, I don't understand why it's always him and in all these different games, journalism sites.
8400000	8407000	It's just, I'm kind of like, why is his opinion any more or less than other people who've been following games for a long, long, long time?
8408000	8411000	And possibly even do investing of their own that know a little bit more about that.
8412000	8418000	But anyway, I'm just going to get off my high horse because I'm going to say something that, that's going to get taken the wrong way.
8419000	8424000	MXC says because Patcher's people send out press releases. That's a very nice way of putting it. I like that.
8425000	8431000	All right, well, since our Skype line is not going off anymore, I guess we are going to go ahead and end the show here a little bit.
8432000	8433000	But we never did FUs.
8434000	8435000	You want to do some FUs of the Week?
8436000	8437000	Not really, but I'm just saying you never did.
8438000	8443000	I was moving them towards the end of the show, but I'm thinking we need to put them somewhere else in the show because I have this.
8444000	8445000	Right at the start.
8446000	8447000	Yeah, right at the start. Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
8448000	8450000	We'll put it after like a story that pisses us off or something.
8451000	8453000	Yeah, it might be a good idea. That's how we used to do it. We need to go back to that.
8454000	8457000	It's just every week, move it after a story that pisses us off. So, let's get angry.
8468000	8472000	This is FU.
8473000	8474000	Loki?
8475000	8484000	My guess is FU to Ingress because I don't want to play, but it's almost pointless with everybody that plays at ridiculous hours at night.
8485000	8493000	So, I don't know. It's irritating. It's like I hear my phone going off and I'm like, I have to go check it and see what happens.
8494000	8495000	I have to go check it.
8495000	8498000	You know what? Turn off notifications. It was the best thing I ever did for Ingress.
8499000	8502000	It's the first step in letting it go a little bit. Trust me.
8503000	8507000	Then you'll feel a lot better because then you're like, I'm playing this on my own terms.
8508000	8511000	Just do what you want, but it's my suggestion. Help me.
8512000	8513000	Is that it?
8514000	8520000	Well, I already kind of did my FU earlier and it went on a little long, so I don't think I need to rehash the territory.
8520000	8527000	So, I guess FU that my flight got delayed by like over a half hour today, but then again, in the scope of things, that's not that long of a delay.
8528000	8532000	And I got to play more Dragon Quest VII, so I'm not that upset at the end of the day.
8533000	8535000	So, that's it. Shane, what about you? Do you have an FU of the week?
8536000	8542000	FU to having to go to work tomorrow when all I want to do is play that stupid demo over and over and over and over and over.
8543000	8548000	And believe me, I will be only playing that. I won't even shiny hunt tomorrow. I will just be playing that demo.
8548000	8549000	Oh, it's that important?
8550000	8552000	Yes. I'm so hyped.
8553000	8563000	And how long will you play it before you go back to collecting shinies? I'm really sad you don't have the 3DS livestream stuff available. I would love to see you do a livestream of it.
8564000	8565000	How much is it?
8566000	8574000	To get like a new 3DS modded or just outright bought with the capture card stuff, it's like $500 something. So, it's like the PSVR.
8575000	8576000	Yeah, that's a lot of it.
8577000	8578000	And I would have loved to do my...
8579000	8586000	I'm not doing enough streaming and I always say I need to do more of it, I need to do more of it, but then it's like, but podcasting, you know, so it's tough.
8587000	8596000	What was I going to say? Oh yeah, I wanted to do it for Sun and Moon, like just chronicle my adventures, but you know...
8597000	8606000	I bet you do pretty well on Twitch too because you already have some built-in people that I think would follow you over there from Pokestop, from Ranger Pride, from this.
8607000	8612000	And I feel weird using this term with you, but you're fans that you've built up through doing these shows.
8613000	8617000	I like making fun of them so they don't stay. Well, and they usually deserve it.
8620000	8625000	But what was the question? Because I just got all excited about talking about the demo again. When will I go back to shiny hunting?
8626000	8633000	Give me a few days. I mean, I'm only three away from my goal that I set for myself for Sun and Moon, so I can kind of take it a little bit more last.
8634000	8635000	But then do you have stretch goals?
8636000	8637000	No, nope. I'm not a Kickstarter. I'm good.
8638000	8639000	So you're just going to end it on...
8640000	8645000	I am going to meet my goal and then not promise anything else and then let everybody being me down.
8646000	8647000	Alright. So...
8647000	8649000	I really wish I hadn't just...
8651000	8661000	Like, I feel compelled to buy a PlayStation VR and so me being me, it's like, I wonder if they've got stock available. And yes, they do.
8662000	8663000	Well, that's good they're not sold out everywhere, I guess.
8664000	8666000	Well, it's not good news for Sony, but good news for us.
8667000	8668000	Well, it's...
8669000	8670000	Alright, anyway.
8671000	8672000	You might have to pick one up.
8672000	8675000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8676000	8677000	We want to thank you guys for listening to our show.
8678000	8681000	And as always, if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, tell a friend or two about the show.
8682000	8684000	Help spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8685000	8689000	But if we're not hearing those voices here on Sunday nights, we can't really share them with the world.
8690000	8691000	So, yeah. Help us grow our family.
8692000	8695000	A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this show.
8696000	8699000	The Google Store or whatever. Just, you know, leave a nice review. We really appreciate it.
8699000	8705000	And we will see you next Sunday. I have to confirm the interview next week.
8706000	8708000	It's been a while since I talked to them, but we do have scheduled.
8709000	8712000	We will have the Cat President developer here next week.
8713000	8718000	That's going to be a lot of fun, especially for you old-school OLR listeners that remember the inside joke in 2008.
8719000	8720000	It's been that long.
8721000	8723000	It's been that long when it was President Cat.
8724000	8727000	When's the next debate? Isn't that coming up pretty soon? I know the last one they had was...
8727000	8734000	With the real President? The one this week. In Vegas, funny enough. So, it is this week.
8735000	8737000	There's always some sort of shit shows, I swear.
8738000	8747000	I just... I don't want to get political, but I'm just going to say my mind's been made up for a very long time, so I don't bother to watch that stuff. Done.
8748000	8750000	It's just like watching Train Crash. That's all it really is.
8751000	8756000	It's fun to watch it just because it's just like, God, what if that happens?
8757000	8761000	I'd rather just start watching Game of Thrones because everybody tells me I need to watch that show.
8762000	8763000	You do need to watch Game of Thrones.
8764000	8766000	See, then that's what I need to be doing instead of watching all that political garbage.
8767000	8769000	Yes, if you haven't watched Game of Thrones, then by all means watch Game of Thrones.
8770000	8772000	If you have watched Game of Thrones, those are still fun to watch.
8773000	8777000	Or Carl Sagan 42 if you like some Mario Maker games. Seriously, he's awesome. Go check him out.
8778000	8779000	Alright, fair enough.
8780000	8785000	Okay, well, we're going to go around and hear everybody's final thoughts for the night before we say goodbye for another seven days.
8785000	8786000	Loki, your final thought?
8787000	8793000	I have to weigh how much my wife will be mad at me versus how much I really want PlayStation VR.
8794000	8795000	We'll see.
8796000	8797000	Good luck.
8798000	8799000	Could it just be a coin flip at that point?
8800000	8803000	It'll be like, oh, yeah, I paid that off last year, so it's fine. It's not like I spent more money on it.
8804000	8809000	Shane, thanks for being here tonight, sitting in, talking about PlayStation VR. Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
8809000	8818000	So hyped for that demo tomorrow, and Tuesday, because then it'll be the American demo, which will be the exact same thing, but there might not be an English language option tomorrow.
8819000	8820000	But I'm okay with that. I'll still get through it, no problem.
8821000	8822000	Am I allowed to play the American demo?
8823000	8832000	Yes, but you still, you have like 30 days basically at this point to beat Sapphire.
8833000	8834000	Or else what?
8834000	8839000	Also, I'm going to just start, I'm going to come over and you're going to be like in the bathroom, but you'll come out to like broken everything.
8840000	8842000	Alan may take issue with that, just so you know.
8843000	8846000	He'll support me on it because you've been working on this for too long.
8847000	8850000	All right. Let's see. My final thought tonight.
8851000	8861000	Oh, if you have a friend or you know some indie developers or something, or somebody, especially, you know, we got some great emailers and callers and so forth,
8862000	8869000	but somebody who hasn't been on the show to talk about whatever they're developing, I do not have any interviews yet booked out past Cat President next week.
8870000	8874000	So I am looking to book guests for November and December. So if you know anybody, send them my way.
8874000	8879000	Twitter, Twitter is a great, I love Twitter, so Twitter is besides the garbage heap that I don't pay attention to on there,
8880000	8883000	but it's a great way to get in touch with me at Sky, S-K-I-E.
8884000	8887000	I think we should try hitting up Landfall games to see if they can, they had Cluster Truck.
8888000	8890000	Oh yeah, yeah. Why not? Pass along their contact info.
8891000	8894000	Or there's that guy that's making the weird bear game, which I will kind of see what that is.
8895000	8898000	It's the physics game where it's, he has dancing bears all the time.
8898000	8905000	I do have a lead on a good one I'll have to tell you about off air, but I don't want to get our listeners too excited because it would be kind of a big one.
8906000	8912000	But anyway, that's it for now. We're going to say goodnight and we will be back in seven days to do it all over again.
8913000	8914000	Thanks for being here. Bye.
