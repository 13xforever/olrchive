Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, you'd probably expect me to talk about the Nintendo Switch, but your hosts will do that for more than 13 seconds. What you may not have heard is the ongoing labored strike by Union voice actors. My time is up for now, but stay tuned for this and plenty more news right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight, episode number 662 for this, October 23rd, 2016. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California. And with me, as always, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi, Loki.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, Steve, I overheard you say a phrase I don't hear you say very often while you were eating dinner before the show, and that was, this might be too much bacon. Is that true?

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, it's not. You can have too much bad bacon. Like, the bacon is just kind of, eh. You know, it's fast food bacon that's just kind of, you know, it should be bacon.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or the bacon they used to have in my college dorms. It's disgusting.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If it's bacon that they, like, deep fry or they crisp up to the point where it's, like, snapping, you can never have too much of that. Or if it's salty. But fast food bacon that's basically been cooked in the morning, sitting there all day long, you can have too much of that.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, well, look, we could talk about bacon for a while, but there's a lot going on tonight. We have a very busy show tonight. Very excited to welcome. I know a lot of our longtime listeners have been looking forward to this.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:56,000
One of the creators, or I believe the creator, of Cat President is here tonight. Not to be confused with President Cat, but we'll talk about that in about 30 minutes with Paul from O'Iraq Studios.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And some other, I believe there's another game he's about ready to release, so we'll talk all about that, as well as Cats and why they would make great presidents and so forth. We will get into that a little later.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:24,000
However, up first, I'm sure the folks listening this week are dying to know. So, what does Loki think of the Nintendo Switch? And in case, for some reason, you only get your gaming news from OLR, which I would find hard to believe, but thank you if that's the case, Nintendo did unveil the NX this week.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, the NX is no more. It is now the Nintendo Switch, and that's the name. And there was a three and a half minute trailer that we got with not even a day's lead time, what they announced Thursday night that they would be posting it Friday morning.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And it was very similar in nature to the Wii U trailer that they showed at E3 years and years ago, where it was actors using the device as Nintendo envisions this to be embraced by the world.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, Nintendo Switch. Loki. First off, Loki, what about the name? What do you think of the name Nintendo Switch?

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's not Wii or Wii U, so they've got points right there.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's a good thing, right?

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not stupid. There you go. It's not a stupid name.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I like the name. I do.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think it's fine.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It doesn't scream console to me, but certainly neither does Wii.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It doesn't scream what the hell?

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's a Wii?

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm surprised they maybe didn't do Game Switch, but maybe that's too close to some... There's probably a company out there already called that. But anyway, that's alright.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm fine with the name Nintendo Switch, and I like that the logo is very different.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
One of the biggest things you notice that they're quote unquote fixing right off the top is they are separating this from the Wii and the Wii U.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Visually, with the name, very big difference, which is interesting considering the fact that in some ways I kind of feel that the Nintendo Switch is what a lot of people thought the Wii U could have been or should have been.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Maybe that the technology wasn't quite ready for, but the fact that the gamepad should go with you anywhere.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But regardless, a lot of the rumors that we've talked about here previously on the show turn out to be true.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Not all of them, certainly, because there was the whole fuckery of a touchpad with no controllers on it, although...

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Or was it the one that was the concept where the controller was the touchpad? Like, you'd have the actual buttons and the image would be underneath, which is stupid.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So that's all out the window. And I was going to say, although, to be fair, since those controllers come off the touchpad, I suppose you could have where it's just the touchpad, although I don't know what game to play.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, technically we don't know that it's a touchpad yet.

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
True, true. We don't know that it's a touchpad yet.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Although it would be stupid not to do that.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I would be very surprised if it wasn't. I guess the question would be, how expensive is it to be a touchpad?

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not much, I don't know.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, in this day and age that technology is very cheap. Anyway, Loki, I'm sure you watched the trailer, 7am Friday morning like a lot of us did. What did you think?

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I thought it was alright. I mean, it's just, I'm not, like, I was expecting a little bit more, I don't know, like, with the Wii and stuff it was more of like a wow factor because it was a different way to play your games.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think taking my system somewhere and playing a game is not necessarily that big a deal to me because I used to do that, shit, I did that when I was in high school with the PlayStation 1 and I've, you know, did it with previous systems before.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So it's not, I mean, it's neat that you can take the controller, I guess, with you and it doesn't seem to stop your game, but I don't know.

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I do like the fact that theoretically it's powerful enough to run games like Skyrim and stuff so hopefully that means that we'll have some third party games on there or even, you know, something better quality.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I mean, because that was a really hurting point for the Wii U.

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, Nintendo did come out with a slide, I don't know if it's from their press site or where, but it's floating around the internet there that shows all these company logos and it's, look at who we're partnering with for the Switch.

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I don't know, I kind of take that with a grain of salt, not that I'm trying to be negative when it comes to Nintendo. I am excited about the Switch, I look forward to it, but I just kind of help, can't help but feel like we saw a slide like this with the Wii U

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and, you know, EA's logo was up there, EA even got on stage with them at E3 and talked about how frickin' great the Wii U was and then what did EA do, put out two games and then dropped it?

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, I remember the...

53
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like, I just...

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, it was even worse than 3DS because they didn't just have game, they didn't have game company names, they had game names on there like Saints Row and DJ Hero and that shit never fuckin' happened, so I was a little bit disappointed there.

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But, I mean, it looks nice as like a portable system, I guess, but it's so huge as it's not really good for a portable system and then the other thing you have to factor in too, it's not like your tablet or your phone because where's the internet?

56
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You have to be on Wi-Fi to use that shit and so all these dreams of people saying, oh, portable Splatoon, no, not unless you're tethered to something.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, I mean, to be fair, a lot of that depends on how much online Nintendo's gonna embrace with this. If Nintendo is doing Wi-Fi, which would make an awful lot of sense, the 3DS does it and so many places have Wi-Fi now like Starbucks, etc.

58
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:52,000
McDonald's, they were doing some giveaway there, so so many places have Wi-Fi now I could see that and we know that, hell, even back to what the Game Boy Advance could do same room multiplayer through the infrared, which I'm sure is all now Bluetooth technology, I'm not worried about multiplayer in the same room by any means for sure with the Switch and I would think Wi-Fi is a given for the internet.

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Look at, I mean, look at the Vita and the 3G on the Vita, that went nowhere.

60
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, it didn't go anywhere.

61
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't see Nintendo really selling cellular, just getting their hands on that. I think they'll probably do Wi-Fi like they do on DS and that'll be fine. I kind of think that's gonna be it.

62
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But the thing, like, the other thing about that too is like what they were showing in the video where there's people, you know, split basically taking the two joy cons and two sides of the controllers and using them to play multiplayer games on a tiny screen.

63
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It just doesn't seem like that's something you're gonna be doing a lot of because that screen is fucking tiny and you're playing it. It's just like that's about as feasible as, oh, hey, did you know that there's sensors built into the Wii U tablet screen that you can use your motion controllers with it to play motion games on that screen?

64
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Did anyone fucking do that? No, they didn't because it's stupid because that screen is so small, it just is not gonna work very well.

65
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I just, I don't see the point. I mean, I guess in that one scenario where they're showing, oh, it's in a car.

66
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It is for the Wii games that they're gonna sell on Virtual Console, trust. The Wii U, the Wii U gamepad has like that same thing in it and that's like the only time I've seen it used is you can optionally use that as your infrared box.

67
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Right, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't make any sense. That's what I'm saying is the screen's so small, it doesn't make sense to do like split screen gaming on it because you're splitting a section screen two ways. That's just dumb.

68
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know. I mean, it didn't really show us much yet other than it doesn't have a stupid name. It looks like the hardware is more powerful.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's all we really know about it and that there's potentially a Mario game, maybe Skyrim, although Bethesda's like, oh, we're not confirming that Skyrim's gonna be on it.

70
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Which reminds me of, oh, hey, Minecraft on the fucking, what was that, the OUYA. Yeah, Minecraft on the OUYA. You know, it's all over again.

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's just, I don't know. I'm not impressed, but I'm not like disappointed, I guess. I have no expectations of it really.

72
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you think the rumors from beforehand that we had that, you know, kind of ended up being plausibly correct, do you think that that all kind of played into it?

73
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Because I know for me, it was like when I saw the trailer, I was like, oh, okay, cool. So they're running with that idea that everybody's been already talking about for a while now.

74
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So it was kind of, in a way, I kind of felt the reveal was anti-climatic in that regard, although, you know, the little bones tossed of a potential Skyrim on this thing, although we don't really know.

75
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I just don't, to me, it's just, it seems like it's a console that you can take with you, cool. I don't see the innovation there aside from it's convenient to take it with me, if I was going to take it with me.

76
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But as far as gameplay-wise, it's basically doing the same shit that fucking Sony and Microsoft are doing. As far as gameplay, I mean, there's no indication of motion controls on there at all.

77
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's like they've gotten rid of that whole thing. There's no indication of a touchpad yet, although it'd be crazy for them not to do that, but it's not a guarantee.

78
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it's just, to me, as the way I described it, it's safe. They're playing it safe. And that's fine, they can do that, but, like, I think we're just looking for, like, to be this impressed, like, the Wii was, like, holy crap.

79
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You know, that's, can you imagine, you know, playing games this way, or like in the 3DS, wow, 3D without glasses, that's going to be crazy impressive.

80
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And all that kind of fell flat, and now it's just like, eh, we're just not really going to try to impress you. It's the system you can take with you.

81
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So it needs the games to really justify it.

82
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It needs the games, and it also needs the price point that makes sense, because they're going to fuck people on the price point, and have a feeling that's going to happen.

83
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I want to make sure we get some of our chatters into, very important, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geese Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

84
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat, live.vognetwork.com, where we have some comments such as Dark Tetsuya mentioning the fact that the switch is a one-syllable word, saying,

85
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think they were just trying to keep it simple and easy to remember. It's one syllable like we was.

86
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So, you know, switch is a very, you know, just a simple word. I can kind of see that perspective, that maybe they didn't want to come up with a complicated name, so they kept it very simple, that makes sense.

87
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's see, Stellarose412 in chat says, there are a fuck ton of third-party partners, super excited.

88
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And yeah, despite what I said about, you know, the Wii U thing and where I said, I don't want to get my hopes up, at the same time, Nintendo is very, very, very strong in the portable market.

89
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And if they've leveraged a lot of that from their portable market to the switch, then that's really only going to be a good thing.

90
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean, Square Enix, as an example, puts out some pretty cool games on 3DS that you really can't get anywhere else.

91
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Right. And that makes sense why they would want a touchscreen on there. And also, it solves the problem, well, there's not a lot of content on the Wii U.

92
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, now we just have the same content that's from both into one platform, basically.

93
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know how I feel about the Wii U. What did you think about the whole fact that it looks like they're doing Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon for Wii U?

94
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Although, just, you know, before people call it out, yes, we had King Boo driving a kart in Mario Kart.

95
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That could be DLC. That could simply be DLC for, you know, later on.

96
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Same thing with Splatoon.

97
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Same thing with Splatoon. That's basically DLC. Is that worth it for purchasing the game all over again? No?

98
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, but the argument would be a lot of people didn't purchase it in the first place, because the Wii U didn't move as much as Nintendo wanted it to.

99
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's fine if they want to make that argument. But here's my problem also, though.

100
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And Vanetta 2 should be there.

101
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, here's my problem, though, with it, is I purchased all my games digitally.

102
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you gonna tell me that I'm once again not gonna be able to move my digital library over to the new system?

103
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Because, like, I get it with the Wii and Wii U titles and stuff like that, but if they pull that shit with Virtual Console again,

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
where I can't play those Virtual Console games on this new system, what the hell?

105
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I mean, that's just stupid.

106
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, well, we had to make this, like, login for our network so we track all your purchases and everything, but it's just not gonna fucking work again.

107
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I mean, see, it's all these things that I need to see what's gonna happen with it, like, answer all these questions before I decide whether I want it or not.

108
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, and I think you do raise some good questions about, I mean, I am not expecting that people who purchase that stuff on Wii U digitally

109
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
are gonna get any sort of deal because the people who got it on disc, when there's no disc drive on that thing, are not gonna get a deal.

110
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I just don't see that happening, period.

111
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And some folks in chat, several folks in chat are saying the Splatoon changes look too big to be DLC.

112
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Some folks thinking that's a new game.

113
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But at the end of the day, we don't know.

114
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We are speculating off of literal seconds of footage, so we don't know.

115
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nintendo will eventually have to say more about what this Splatoon is.

116
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is it a enhanced edition? Is it Splatoon 2? What the hell is it? We're not gonna know for a while, right?

117
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Loki, I would think this is probably the last we hear of the Switch until January.

118
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think that's what they said, and that's stupid, but whatever.

119
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, is it? Because with the holiday season and everybody gonna be looking around for holiday stuff, this is something that's not gonna be on the shelves on the holidays.

120
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So, is it stupid to just kinda let it go till next year? Get people hyped in January?

121
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Right. I think it's gonna be stupid to do that because people can get hyped about the Xbox One or something.

122
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hell, I was looking at it today. They were offering some stuff where the system's $50 off.

123
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They give you $50 on top of that towards a feature purchase and a free game for $250 for an Xbox One.

124
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I was like, shit, maybe I should do that.

125
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I just don't know what the price of this is gonna be, and is it worth purchasing for?

126
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In Skyrim, that's kind of exciting that Skyrim's on a Nintendo system.

127
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Now, as much as I'm championing this thing and I do feel positive about it and everything, that's the one thing where I kinda was like, big fuckin' deal.

128
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Skyrim's an old game.

129
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was on the Xbox 360. It's on the fuckin' PlayStation 3. Big fuckin' deal.

130
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
However, with that, if this is some type of enhanced Skyrim, or if it's the HD Skyrim or whatever,

131
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
but the reality is, PlayStation and Xbox are gonna get it.

132
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I would like to just see something new from Bethesda.

133
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now, rumors are that that's happening with Beyond Good and Evil, right?

134
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We've heard the rumors this week, because that was out previously.

135
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's not Bethesda, though. Beyond Good and Evil?

136
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Crazy moment.

137
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I thought there was something with Bethesda as well.

138
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There was something that was, well, anyway.

139
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Okay, then fine. All that stuff aside, clearly my thought changer railed on that, but all that stuff aside,

140
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I would like to see something maybe new from Bethesda, because,

141
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and my concern is, look, don't hate me because I'm saying this about Skyrim,

142
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
but the reality is, the Wii U launch lineup was Mass Effect, Arkham City,

143
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
all these things that had already come out a year before, and look where that got the Wii U.

144
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So I don't find Skyrim on this thing to be good news.

145
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Bethesda needs to be pushing something current.

146
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now, I suppose, what about, this is gonna sound ridiculous,

147
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but what if it was Elder Scrolls Online?

148
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Because that's still something that Bethesda's trying in that department,

149
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and you're just straight up laughing.

150
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's stupid. No one wants that shit.

151
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Rude. Rude.

152
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
No one wants that, I'm sorry.

153
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But at least, and the reason why I say that-

154
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it can't be online, it can't be Elder Scrolls Online,

155
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
because fucking Nintendo doesn't get online yet.

156
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, we don't know. They didn't say anything about online.

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay, let me tell you this much.

158
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
My expectations of Nintendo's ability to grasp online and actually get it

159
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
is about as high as the fucking announcement of the Switch.

160
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm gonna shut this down right now. Dragon Quest X is a thing.

161
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not a thing here for some reason, but it's a thing.

162
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So, yes, Nintendo is capable of running an MMO.

163
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So, shut it down.

164
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Alright.

165
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I'm sorry, it's not here, so that doesn't count.

166
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, that is, that's a frustration for me, too.

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

168
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
ActDef says, while they did announce the console, we didn't get details about it.

169
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Stoppy says, I'd say we got a lot, just not everything.

170
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's see.

171
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Tigerclaw says, whatever Elder Scrolls they are coming for the Switch,

172
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
it's gonna be some stripped down version with some features missing.

173
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well...

174
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't know about that.

175
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't know about that. No, I don't either.

176
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You know, it may not be this HD remaster that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

177
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
are getting, what, this week, right?

178
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But it could be the older version with some other type of alternative enhancements.

179
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't know.

180
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We don't know yet.

181
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There's a lot of information we don't know about it yet.

182
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean, I was gonna say, one of the things that we saw,

183
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
one of the things they were talking about is that it can actually run Unreal 4.

184
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, if it can run Unreal 4, I mean, I know it's scalable and stuff,

185
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but it could be, I mean, pretty decent.

186
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I just don't know what this is capable of.

187
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I mean, the Zelda game looks pretty, and the Mario game, theoretically,

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I mean, even though we don't know anything about it,

189
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
it could very well just be CG bullshit, look nice.

190
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So, I don't know.

191
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
AlphaCananagram in chat says,

192
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
MeTomo is a good sign of future network of Nintendo.

193
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Ugh. Ugh.

194
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You might want to, maybe Pokémon Go or something, I don't know.

195
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ugh.

196
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Not like MeTomo.

197
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ugh, vomit.

198
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Dungeonbuster says, Skyrim on the Switch is a big thing

199
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
because Bethesda had never brought over any of its flagship games

200
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
to a Nintendo system before.

201
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But do you see why that concerns me, though?

202
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because, again, it's an old game on the new console

203
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that I don't think there's the demand there for that people think.

204
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know what I mean?

205
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't know.

206
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't want Skyrim to be Bethesda's benchmark

207
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
of how well can we do on the Wii.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They do mods and everything, that would be pretty cool

209
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
if they had mod support on there as well.

210
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I guess that'd be cool.

211
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There was another really good comment a minute ago

212
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
that I wanted to get out here.

213
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, here it is.

214
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com, I hope I'm saying this right.

215
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Sorry if I'm not.

216
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Ichbin Maya says,

217
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I would also think that our virtual console purchases

218
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
may be offered again on the Switch at a discounted upgrade rate

219
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
like they offered for the Switch from Wii to Wii U.

220
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So that is a good point that Nintendo already has that technology

221
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
to know what you've bought in the past.

222
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So maybe, if you did buy something digitally,

223
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
maybe you could qualify for a discount.

224
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I just, I don't know.

225
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think it would put Nintendo in a really weird position

226
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
because you're going to have all these people that have it on disc

227
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that wouldn't necessarily qualify unless maybe they, I don't know,

228
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
do some type of like my Nintendo registrations,

229
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
although that's all gone.

230
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't know.

231
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's so weird that you say that, you know,

232
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and how that they have different systems that are capable of different things

233
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that you purchase one game on, you get to play it on all of them,

234
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
like both Xbox and Sony have.

235
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So that the fact that they're not able to do this with, you know,

236
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the 3DS Wii U and Switch is kind of stupid.

237
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So they can get my discounted rate of

238
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't give a shit about their fucking virtual console at that point.

239
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, we'll see.

240
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm willing to let this just kind of sit for a while

241
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
because Nintendo hasn't talked about online.

242
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We'll find out.

243
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know, we just don't know.

244
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We've got, this is all off three and a half minutes,

245
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
but at least it's something finally.

246
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's talk about battery life

247
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
because you're going to have battery life in the stupid little Joy-Cons.

248
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You have battery life in the actual system itself.

249
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's going to be a mess.

250
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Couldn't they all charge each other?

251
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Couldn't that dock charge everything?

252
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Right. That's what I'm thinking it's going to do.

253
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And then the system would charge that.

254
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And then when they showed the two Joy-Cons

255
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
plugged into that grip thing,

256
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm assuming that has a battery in it as well.

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
All the batteries.

258
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
All the batteries!

259
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The Nintendo battery!

260
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The Nintendo battery Switch!

261
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm pretty sure a nice, good charge will take care of all that, though.

262
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What else do we want to talk about on the Switch here real quick?

263
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because there's a lot of news that's kind of like follow up to this as well, right?

264
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We heard about...

265
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's based off of NVIDIA Tech,

266
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
so they're the ones doing the processing design and everything.

267
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So the Tegra thing is true.

268
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's a new Tegra, not the one that runs other stuff.

269
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So that's pretty cool.

270
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So it'll be interesting to see what that can push out.

271
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Confirmed no backwards compatibility with Wii U,

272
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
because there's no disk drive.

273
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Or 3DS.

274
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Not a thing either.

275
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I have to admit,

276
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
see, here's the tricky thing for me is that

277
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm actually viewing the Switch as a portable successor.

278
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And believe me, I know full well that Nintendo has said,

279
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
no, we still plan to support 3DS, and this is the console.

280
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But I don't know if I believe it, per se.

281
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Is that coming from the marketing side, or is that coming from, like, Miyamoto?

282
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
They'll support it while there's people buying the system, that's it.

283
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I mean, because the DS will support it for a long time.

284
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, it's also one of those things where it's like,

285
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
well, we'll support the Nintendo 64 after the GameCube comes out,

286
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but not for very long.

287
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
See, what I would want to see with, like...

288
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't want to see the 3DS continuing.

289
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, I want to see with the Switch, like, ideally what I would have liked the trailer to show me is,

290
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
like, why that system being portable is innovative.

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You know, other than, oh, I can take it with me.

292
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Cool, I guess.

293
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But, like, if they showed me, like, hey, I can take this Pokémon game,

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and I pop it off, and it has GPS built into the system,

295
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and I can walk around and catch Pokémon or something like that,

296
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
like Pokémon Go or something, and then come back and, you know,

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
it adds, like, gameplay to that, not just I can take the same game with me somewhere else.

298
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean, that's... I don't know.

299
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Let's see, looking in chat for more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

300
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm sorry, I love this one.

301
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Dungeon Buster says, I just hope they don't source Samsung for the batteries.

302
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's a good one, I like that.

303
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Then that whole portable playing on the plane thing isn't going to happen

304
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
if Samsung does those batteries.

305
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I heard that they actually had kiosks in airports to try to get you to turn those in,

306
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
if you haven't already, so that's kind of funny.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh my gosh, all right.

308
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Let's see, what else is there?

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Stoppy says, I'd say it's like Game Boy to Game Boy Color.

310
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They're going to support it for a long time with lots of cross and backwards compatibility.

311
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But I don't think... I think it was...

312
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Somebody has said that that cartridge slot is not going to hold the 3DS cart.

313
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Like, it's different, right?

314
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah, it looked different.

315
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So, I don't know if we have the firm details on that,

316
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
but don't assume just because there's a cartridge slot on it that it's playing 3DS stuff.

317
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And maybe that's another reason why I kind of view it as a successor to the portable market,

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
because it is doing the portable cartridges that I'm used to at this point,

319
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and they kind of got rid of the disk thing.

320
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Like, I don't know, I just...

321
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, it can't really do 3DS, because, I mean, how would you do that?

322
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, I guess you would turn the system vertically or sideways.

323
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt also says,

324
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I do see this as a portable experience, like tablet mobile and not a home console.

325
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And then, let's see, AlphaCananagram says,

326
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Nintendo Switch is what the PS Vita should have done better when continuing console games on the go.

327
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's probably a really good point, like, because didn't the Vita kind of...

328
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I seem to remember 1E3, they were doing some type of dungeon crawler,

329
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and the guy, like, paused in the middle of it and kind of continued it on the Vita,

330
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
so they were kind of showing that a little bit.

331
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But we didn't really see a lot of that fully realized, right?

332
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Not really.

333
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So this is maybe taking that a step further, right?

334
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What else do we need to talk about with the Nintendo Switch,

335
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
with the follow-up news that came out after this?

336
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't know, that's pretty much it.

337
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I mean, there's still a lot we don't know about it yet.

338
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay.

339
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Any games that you're hoping to see Nintendo announce,

340
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
like, anything that you would like them to unveil, Loki, that would move you into the fan column?

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Well, I'm always for remasters of games that are actually, I thought, pretty good,

342
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
like on the Wii and stuff, for example.

343
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I love a new Excite Truck game.

344
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm not talking Excite Bots, because fuck them for that game.

345
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I mean, seriously, whoever the asshole that thought putting mini-games in the middle of a fucking race is,

346
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I want to kill him.

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I want to strangle the fucker to death.

348
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I mean, it's just the dumb, it made no fucking sense at all.

349
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So I love a new remaster of, like, an Excite Truck game, because that was actually fun,

350
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and I really enjoyed that.

351
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I think that'd be cool.

352
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Or how about fucking F-Zero?

353
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
If we're going to talk about racing, let's talk about fucking F-Zero.

354
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
F-Zero would be cool.

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
F-Zero.

356
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's how many of those games we've seen in the past decade.

357
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Fucking Zero, and it's really irritating me.

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That would be cool.

359
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You know, a new Metroid would be nice.

360
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Let's see.

361
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Each Ben Mias sharing an article saying,

362
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Nintendo did confirm no DS and 3DS compatibility.

363
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Sharing an article there.

364
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I thought I had read something like that.

365
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
MXC in chat at live.vognetwork.com saying,

366
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm curious as to the storage size of the game cartridges.

367
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Given the ridiculous sizes of some modern games,

368
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
it'll need to be decently large as compared to the 8GB and 4GB game sizes

369
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
of 3DS and Vita respectively.

370
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Those cards ought to be 32GB, don't you think?

371
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That would seem like a relatively, at this point, inexpensive size

372
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
that's going to hold a lot of data, right?

373
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think we need to be pretty big, yeah.

374
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And speaking of pretty big,

375
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
let's hope that they're not fucking retarded with the stupid onboard storage

376
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and giving us 32GB again.

377
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because they can go fuck themselves with their 32GB.

378
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I have a feeling that...

379
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Well, well, well.

380
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay, tinfoil hat.

381
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Could the dock have some of that storage?

382
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Wow, that would be so useful when I take it to go!

383
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh wait, I can't access my storage because it's a fucking home!

384
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What if there's some type of portable memory or something?

385
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I don't know, maybe that's too complicated,

386
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but my concern is because it is something you're taking with you on the go,

387
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you're not going to have exactly a terabyte.

388
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And the fact that all the games are cartridges now.

389
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm not asking for a terabyte. Fucking 256GB or 128GB.

390
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Is that too much to ask?

391
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It might be.

392
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I mean, depending on the size of the games, obviously.

393
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But if it's anything like the Wii U,

394
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
after two or three games on there,

395
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
it's like, oh, sorry, you gotta get external storage now.

396
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's retarded.

397
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I mean, I don't even know how many games I have on my PlayStation 4 right now.

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And those are Blu-Ray games.

399
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And I've got, like, at least 20 games on there.

400
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Let's see, a couple other thoughts here at Live.FogNetwork.com.

401
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
StellarRose412 says, would they maybe have the SD card like the 3DS?

402
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I suppose that's a possibility.

403
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Who knows? Especially with it, and a lot of people, multiple people saying,

404
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
how cheap that type of storage is.

405
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So I suppose anything is possible, right?

406
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That would be nice.

407
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And again, maybe something where you could put it on the dock

408
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and have more memory.

409
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think that might just be too complicated for most people. Who knows?

410
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Anyway, we're going to shift gears here a little bit.

411
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm sure there will be plenty more to talk about on the Nintendo Switch

412
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
in the coming weeks.

413
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But we want to go back and talk about PC gaming for a little bit here

414
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
before we get into our gaming weeks.

415
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because we're going to talk about a PC game that's available on Steam right now.

416
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And it's a game called Cat President.

417
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And we're getting on the line right now.

418
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Paul from, oh, Rock Studios.

419
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And he's going to be joining us to talk about the game Cat President.

420
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And we're trying to get him on the line right now.

421
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I think he's there. Hey, Paul. You there?

422
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Hello. Hey, how's it going?

423
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Great. Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

424
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Hey, thank you very much. I'm very happy to be here.

425
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We are very happy to have you.

426
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is an interview that's been a long time coming

427
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
ever since we first spotted your game on Steam.

428
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So I'm glad you could be here, especially on such a large week

429
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
with the whole Switch reveal and all that stuff.

430
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Surely you're watching that as a gamer, right?

431
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, yeah. I'm paying a little attention.

432
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I mean, my main and only thought that I had while watching that video was

433
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm going to lose all of those parts immediately.

434
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Just right out of the box. They're going to go under the couch.

435
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
They're gone.

436
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
No, considering like everything is detachable.

437
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Or bringing this back to cats.

438
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If anyone has cats like my cat, you leave that on the floor.

439
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That shit is under the couch.

440
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That's a damn good point, Logan.

441
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
All right. So, Paul, tell us about your game, Cat President.

442
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes, okay. It's a visual novel.

443
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
People have compared it to Hataful Boyfriend.

444
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't see the comparison personally, but you know, that's fine.

445
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's a visual novel about the presidential election

446
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and presidential politics, except that all of the candidates are cats

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and there's a very good chance that you will fall in love with them.

448
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Just like you do the pigeons in Hataful Boyfriend.

449
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I think that's probably why you're getting the comparisons.

450
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I guess I can kind of see it. I don't know.

451
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, Hataful Boyfriend is also one of the more well-known visual novels.

452
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, and we kind of copped their art style.

453
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But other than that, totally different.

454
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Speaking of copping things, I need to clear something up here

455
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
for our listeners and some folks who have been listening to the show a long time.

456
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Paul, was any of this inspired by a Wii title from a few years ago?

457
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
No, it wasn't. The first time I even heard about President Cat,

458
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm ashamed to say was in the very first review of Cat President that came out,

459
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
which was on a major website and had some very unfavorable comparisons.

460
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It was a great review. It sounded like that Cat President was the worst thing

461
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that had ever happened to this person in their entire life.

462
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's not nice.

463
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Well, it happens.

464
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, first off, I didn't realize that that review was on a major website.

465
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So first off, that just proves major websites are listening to this show,

466
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
so watch what you say, Loki.

467
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
They all say you've been out of shape if that's going to make their life miserable

468
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
just like playing a game.

469
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Although I also feel kind of bad because you had no idea.

470
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And to be fair, the President Cat thing was years ago,

471
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and I knew when your game came out that obviously this has been a crazy freaking year

472
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
when it comes to elections, so of course somebody made a game

473
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
that is somewhat inspired by the electional stuff.

474
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And who doesn't love cats?

475
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, to be clear, I do hold you 100% responsible for that review.

476
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Well, wait a minute. We're going to blame Jamie.

477
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
She's the one that translated it, and she's not here.

478
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So when in doubt, blame the one that's not here.

479
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, that's fair. Okay. I can accept that.

480
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm going to redirect those complaints to Dark Soccer.

481
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
All right, well, I'm sorry to hear that the review invoked some internet fuckery thing

482
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
that we started, but that person just needs to get over it, I suppose.

483
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But to be clear, also, your game is not action or minigames

484
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
or any of that stuff that we saw with Sukiban Sochowrenawe,

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
which was the President Cat stuff.

486
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
This is a visual novel game.

487
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah, pure text-based decision-making.

488
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You have a lot of dialogue.

489
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Basically, you decide whether you're going to be nice to the candidate or mean to the candidate,

490
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and your reactions kind of determine whether you get the good ending

491
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
where you get to live happily ever after with your new cat friend,

492
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
or if they fire you, you die, stuff like that.

493
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Is this the first game that you've done?

494
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
No, it's the first game we've released on Steam.

495
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We've released a few other small visual novels on itch.io,

496
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
one called My Nigerian Prince, another kind of romance-themed game

497
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
about falling in love with an internet scammer,

498
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and one called Francie Drew, which is a mystery parody of Nancy Drew.

499
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But I also released an FMV game last year,

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
written, directed, starred, camera work, everything 100% by me, black and white game,

501
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
about an awkward person trying to answer his front door

502
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
when there's someone outside and he doesn't know who it is.

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Those all sound awesome.

504
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I know. You have a great sense of humor.

505
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
These all sound amazing.

506
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you.

507
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I hope those major websites that are clearly listening to this program,

508
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I hope they discover your shit through this,

509
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
because it sounds like you've got some genius.

510
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The My Nigerian Prince thing, that is funny.

511
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That is really funny. I'm going to check that out.

512
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
To be fair, I can't claim 100% credit for that,

513
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
or Cat President for that matter.

514
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I work with a partner who does a lot of the writing.

515
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm focused more on the coding, the copy editing, and the cat photoshopping.

516
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Okay, fair enough. So when I say you, I mean your studio. Fair enough.

517
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

518
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And some folks in chat over at live.fognetwork.com

519
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
already finding the link there for My Nigerian Prince.

520
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Well, let's talk about Cat President, though, the one that is on Steam.

521
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So you actually went the Steam Greenlight route with this, right?

522
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, it was a learning experience.

523
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Putting a game through Steam Greenlight,

524
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
pretty much you're never going to be bothered by,

525
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
let's say, negative feedback ever again,

526
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
because you're just going to get tons and tons of comments

527
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
about how terrible your game is, how you're ruining Steam.

528
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's like immersion therapy for people being terrible on the internet, basically.

529
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
If you can get through that without just flipping out, deleting it,

530
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
throwing your computer in the garbage,

531
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you can take anything at that point.

532
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Paul, how do you feel that you personally are the reason

533
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
we don't have Half-Life 3?

534
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, it's 100%.

535
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, I take full credit for ruining Steam.

536
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
If Steam is in the crap hole now, that's my fault.

537
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's absolutely true.

538
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So what inspired?

539
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I know you said that you have another guy that you work with

540
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
that did a lot of the writing, but what inspired this game?

541
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What inspired you to be the Cap President?

542
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
My friend, he plays a lot of Japanese dating sims on his phone,

543
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and he started to notice that there were a lot of comparisons

544
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that you could draw between candidates in the presidential election

545
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and the type of bows that you have in Japanese dating sims.

546
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You have the nice guy, the guy who shouts a lot,

547
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
the young candidate, the pervert,

548
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and that made him think that we could do something with that.

549
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So we started talking on Twitter about the idea,

550
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and then I said, hey, can we make them all cats?

551
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And the rest is history.

552
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That's outstanding. I love that.

553
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And you guys have a new game that you're doing this coming week, right?

554
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yes, yes. Thank you so much for bringing that up.

555
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I have a game that's completely different from everything else I just mentioned.

556
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's a retro-style point-and-click adventure game called The Beard in the Mirror,

557
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
heavily inspired by old Sierra games, LucasArts games,

558
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
the kind of stuff I grew up playing

559
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and the stuff that made me want to get into game development in the first place.

560
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
My wife and I have actually built this one together.

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We've been working on it.

562
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Basically, the entirety of our adult lives,

563
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
this game has existed in the background for us,

564
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and it's finally coming out, and we couldn't be...

565
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know if happy is the right word,

566
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
but more relieved, certainly, that we finally finished it.

567
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I can't help but notice in your Skype little picture

568
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
that you yourself have a beard, and this game is called The Beard in the...

569
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Is this some type of biography?

570
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
To be fair, the main character's name is also Paul,

571
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
but no, my wife started making the game by herself

572
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
before we even started dating, actually,

573
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and she wanted to put me in the game.

574
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We talked a bunch of times about,

575
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
should we change the character's name? Is this getting too weird?

576
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But as the game progressed, as we wrote more,

577
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
as we kind of figured out who the character was,

578
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
he just kind of became his own person.

579
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He's his own character, so yeah.

580
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But Beard does play a significant role in the game.

581
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm not going to say any more than that.

582
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
All right, fair enough.

583
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I was going to say, tell me a little more about the plot,

584
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
but is it too spoilery to tell me much more about the game?

585
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah, pretty much.

586
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm so bad at elevator pitches.

587
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm the worst salesman in general.

588
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm happy to say, here's my game.

589
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If you like it, that's great.

590
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If not, oh well, that's fine.

591
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Maybe you'll find another game you like.

592
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Who cares?

593
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
No, it's, like I said, a retro point-and-click adventure game.

594
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The character is awoken in the middle of the night

595
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
by a mysterious woman who thinks that he should remember him.

596
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
She's like, Paul, Paul, wake up.

597
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Don't you know who I am?

598
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Blah, blah, blah.

599
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And then he wakes up, opens his front door.

600
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
There's a forest out there where there was previously a hallway,

601
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and then the rest of the game is kind of figuring out

602
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
what the hell's going on

603
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
and figuring out what this person kind of wants to do with his life.

604
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
How have you developed your games?

605
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And if you guys have questions for Paul,

606
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
of course our chat room is wide open for questions

607
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

608
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
What tools are you using to develop?

609
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Because I find that interesting that you've been doing a lot of visual novels,

610
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but you're making a very radical switch now

611
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
into a point-and-click adventure game.

612
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So what have you been using to develop?

613
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

614
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We use a couple of different free tools.

615
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean, we use the same thing a lot of beginning studios,

616
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
beginning developers use.

617
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
We use Ren'Py for visual novels

618
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and AGS, Adventure Game Studio,

619
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
for the point-and-click adventure game.

620
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Basically, stuff that requires a minimal knowledge of actual coding involved

621
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
to be perfectly frank.

622
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't know that without this kind of software,

623
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I could code my way out of a paper bag.

624
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Well, I think that's totally okay

625
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
because everybody has to kind of start somewhere on one hand,

626
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and I think there's a lot of huge games.

627
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Isn't Five Nights at Freddy's from one of those types of software

628
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
where you can do it?

629
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think so, yeah, yeah.

630
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And a lot of them,

631
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of a company called Wadjet Eye Games.

632
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
They do a lot of point-and-click adventure games like we're working on,

633
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and all of their stuff is the same program that we use,

634
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Adventure Game Studio.

635
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I think that stuff is just,

636
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and even when you look at something that's quote-unquote serious like Unity,

637
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
there's a lot of plug-and-play components to Unity, right, Loki?

638
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Well, yeah.

639
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

640
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, no, it doesn't matter what you use to get there

641
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
as long as it's what the end product is, really.

642
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Exactly, for sure, for sure.

643
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, I mean, I just think it's great.

644
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We live in a world right now where anyone who can just wake up and say,

645
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I want to make a game,

646
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and they can just download some free tools online and do it.

647
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Like 20 years ago, I mean, I can tell you,

648
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
in high school when I started studying this stuff,

649
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I was like, wow, I'm really wicked bad at this.

650
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There's a lot of math.

651
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And I would never have become a game developer

652
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
if there weren't such easy tools to let you dip your toes in

653
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and just figure out what you're even doing.

654
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I think it's great that we live in that kind of world now.

655
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
All right, let's get to some questions from our chatroom

656
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
live.vog.network.com.

657
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
SSG100Matt is asking,

658
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
where did you get the cat or animal pictures that are,

659
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
because if I remember right, I saw a dog that was wearing cat ears.

660
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah, so the cat pictures actually, it's fun.

661
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I put out the call on Facebook asking for friends to submit cute pictures

662
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
of their cats to put in the game.

663
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And I mean, it was like I was George Bailey at the end of

664
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's a Wonderful Life with cat photos, just tons,

665
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
like cat photos just raining from the heavens.

666
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The one advice that I could offer to any aspiring game developer out there

667
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
is to put your friend's cat in your game,

668
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
because then they will have to tell everyone about it.

669
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's a great promotional tool.

670
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You know what's hilarious about that, and I know he's listening,

671
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
or will be listening on the podcast later this week.

672
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
We have a friend of the show who also does development

673
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
who's also doing a game through Steam Greenlight

674
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that just got greenlit right now, our buddy YYR.

675
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And he put a game out on the Xbox Indie Games called Bungee Ferret Tossing.

676
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And he did something very similar because he had all these

677
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
exploding ferrets in the game.

678
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
He didn't want people to think that it was actually advocating

679
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
violence against animals.

680
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So in the very beginning of the game, he puts this PSA about

681
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
please don't hurt animals.

682
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And he solicited pictures of everybody's animals.

683
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And I think a very similar thing happened.

684
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And that's how my cat got in a video game.

685
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Aww.

686
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So there it is.

687
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yes, and that's just a 100 Matt and Chad says,

688
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
the internet is filled with cat pictures.

689
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Ragenator in chat, by the way, saying,

690
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
yeah, anyone can make a game except Loki.

691
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
He starts making them, but then can't complete them.

692
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Wow.

693
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Hey, I could complete it just fine.

694
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It would just be a piece of garbage and, you know,

695
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't want to release a piece of garbage.

696
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So, I mean, hey, if you want me to release what I have right

697
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
now for that game, by all means, I could do that.

698
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe a broken piece of garbage.

699
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And I really don't feel like I want to release that.

700
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking,

701
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
any plan for a cats versus dogs game or a game wholly

702
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
about bacon?

703
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't know if that means you're going to do a cats

704
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
versus pigs game, but is there more?

705
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Is there time for more cats later on, Paul,

706
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
or is this like an idea that, no, you're one and done?

707
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I mean, we've tossed around the idea of doing some DLC

708
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
episodes starring some of the minor candidates of the game,

709
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
or maybe doing a full sequel, maybe to align with the next

710
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
presidential election.

711
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But that hasn't really gotten beyond the us tweeting ideas

712
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
at one another stage as of yet.

713
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
There are some dogs in the game, though,

714
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and I actually stuck my pet bunny rabbits in as vice

715
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
presidential candidates as well.

716
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I was very, very happy to be able to do that.

717
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh, that's amazing.

718
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
All right, one more call for questions over at our chat room

719
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

720
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And I notice Akdeft is saying a cat president to reelection.

721
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So they're already pitching you ideas over there.

722
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh, I'm going to have to make sure to check that out then

723
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
because we don't have a lot of ideas yet.

724
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So you're going to be releasing the beard in the mirror game

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
really soon.

726
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Have you thought about, you know,

727
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
as these games are starting to sell on Steam and you're kind

728
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
of getting more and more, you've kind of moved from itch.io

729
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to Steam and so forth.

730
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Are you looking at trying to maybe expand even more,

731
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
potentially trying to get into places like the console market?

732
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Is that something on your radar?

733
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
No, not yet.

734
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm pretty happy making my small weirdo games at the moment,

735
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
to be honest.

736
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I really like the ease of access on the computer.

737
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I really like just how simple and straightforward everything

738
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
is.

739
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Like I said, I'm still someone who's kind of learning how to

740
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
do all of this on the fly.

741
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So not at the moment.

742
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I did release, you mentioned Xbox indie games a few minutes

743
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
ago.

744
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I did have a point-and-click adventure game I released there

745
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
several years ago back when the indie games channel was still a

746
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
thing called Life in the Dorms,

747
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
a comedic game about trying to make friends in college,

748
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
basically.

749
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Semi-autobiographical.

750
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I was going to say a lot of these games kind of seem based

751
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
on potential real-life scenarios that then spiral way out of

752
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
control when you sit next to a computer.

753
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And now that just makes me even wonder even more where Cat

754
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
President comes from.

755
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Well, it came from the time my cat ran for president.

756
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Just print, just when they, when they bury this show,

757
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
just print that on the tombstone,

758
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
that little exchange right there.

759
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Just print that on the tombstone.

760
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Let's see.

761
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And look, our chatters are, instead of asking questions,

762
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
they're just throwing around ideas for sequels.

763
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
StellaRose412 says, Cat President 2, the empty podium one.

764
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I don't understand.

765
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Cat President 2, impeachment.

766
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The dog party tries to ouster the current cat president and

767
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
replace with their own candidate.

768
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You could have, you could have instead of the governator,

769
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
because that fricking happened in California,

770
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
instead of the governator, it could be like the puppy-nator.

771
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Or how about this?

772
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Cat President 2, the hunt for Mysis.

773
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, no.

774
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That might be getting a little too real for us.

775
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Shut it down.

776
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We're done.

777
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Thanks for listening.

778
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Good night, everybody.

779
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Let's see.

780
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We have a rage-inator saying, Cat President 2,

781
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
make catnip great again.

782
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Isn't catnip already awesome though?

783
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't think, maybe what Dungeon Buster says a little

784
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
more along those lines.

785
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I tried catnip, but I didn't inhale.

786
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So many great ideas there, but Paul,

787
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
we're going to leave the ideas and the execution to you guys.

788
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It really sounds like you guys are very clever and creative

789
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and have created some visual novels that I hope people will

790
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
give a read or a play, if you will.

791
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So one more kind of shout out.

792
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Where can we follow you?

793
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Where can we find these games?

794
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Where can we track what's coming up from O'Rock Studios?

795
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah, sure.

796
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You can find me on Twitter.

797
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm on there kind of constantly, at Paul M. Franzen.

798
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You can follow our group.

799
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Also on Twitter at O, at O'Rock Studios.

800
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We have O'Rock.com where it kind of has a link to all of our games.

801
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And our whole library of games is basically between itch.io and Steam.

802
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So that's all there.

803
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
All right, well I really wish you the best of luck.

804
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And you know, because we could not have President Cat in the States

805
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
because for some reason they just didn't think it would do well here.

806
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's pretty common because it didn't do well in Japan either.

807
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Well, I still say, I never saw the receipts on that.

808
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But anyway, I want to say thank you for making a presidential cat a reality at least.

809
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
At least in one way or another we do have presidential cats as a reality

810
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
even if really we had nothing to do with it

811
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and we're really just causing you problems because of it.

812
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm still thankful, so.

813
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Hey, we still got a review on a major website at least, so.

814
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Hey, that works.

815
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And the last thought here, and I'll let you go.

816
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
ActDeft is suggesting Cat President 2, grab them by the human.

817
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay, wait, that's actually really good.

818
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And I'm going to write that down.

819
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There you go, all right, look at that.

820
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Look at that, ActDeft, you might be a star.

821
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You better go trademark that before Paul gets to it.

822
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
All right, all joking aside, Paul, thank you so much for being here.

823
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I really appreciate it and best of luck.

824
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And we're going to keep an eye on you and what's coming out of your studio

825
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
since it sounds like you have some really hilarious stuff

826
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and hopefully we'll have you back on the show sometime.

827
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That sounds great, thank you so much for having me.

828
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
All right, no problem, take care.

829
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Bye.

830
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Bye.

831
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
All right, again, that is Cat President, the beard in the mirror.

832
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And what was the Nigerian prince?

833
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
My Nigerian prince.

834
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
My Nigerian prince, that's pretty awesome.

835
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That's great.

836
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Dungeon Buster was a fan of that interview saying great interview,

837
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
love how they came up with the idea for the game.

838
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, I did not realize there was, I mean, obviously I did a little research

839
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and I knew he had a new game coming out,

840
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
but somehow I missed that he had these other games about the Nigerian prince.

841
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That's funny, so good sense of humor over there.

842
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Best of luck to them as it develops.

843
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And I also love the message there that, yes, anybody can make a game

844
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and that there's tools out there to do it and so forth.

845
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And, you know, I think doing a visual novel would be fun.

846
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Maybe I can handle a visual novel.

847
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Probably.

848
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I wouldn't have to do physics.

849
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Physics is where gaming gets scary.

850
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Well.

851
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Of course, I have a good friend that does physics for video games,

852
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
but I just, it's still scary.

853
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I will see, kind of go back on like anything done

854
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
because, you know, it's seriously, it's a mental thing.

855
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I've been trying to get something done, you know,

856
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and trying to figure out how I'm mentally going to be able to focus on something.

857
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And so I found what my problem has been is not that the scope is too big

858
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
because I don't give a shit about the size of the scope.

859
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's about the pieces.

860
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm like, you know, already thinking about how I'm going to optimize an engine

861
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
before I even build an engine, which is stupid.

862
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So what I decided is I'm going to just break it down into incredibly small pieces.

863
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Like, today we're going to make something that I can move in a grid.

864
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Done.

865
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You know, and tomorrow we'll make something that, you know,

866
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I can spawn blocks in a grid and go.

867
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I mean, that's because those smaller chunks I'm able to focus on

868
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
instead of like, crap, I've got to figure out how I'm going to make this like engine run

869
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and I've got to figure out everything before I even start programming.

870
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
No, it's not going to work that way.

871
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
All right, well, I should look into these visual novel development software

872
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
that he was talking about there.

873
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Maybe I can do my dream visual novel game.

874
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah, the one you're thinking about for Five Nights at Freddy's is Click Team Fusion.

875
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And they just had that on Humble Bundle not too long ago.

876
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Let's see, I'm going to do a visual novel, The Co-host Who Couldn't Love Nintendo.

877
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I think I'll do that. I think I'll do that as a visual novel.

878
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That is so untrue.

879
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I loved Nintendo one time.

880
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's just, unfortunately, Nintendo started doing all this weird shit,

881
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
got into some weird crowds, and just...

882
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's hanging out with the wrong cat.

883
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's not the same Nintendo that I used to know a long time ago.

884
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So, best of luck again.

885
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And the beard in the mirror, it looks like our chat room is actually checking that out on Steam right now,

886
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and it is out this Tuesday, so a very timely interview there.

887
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And for our podcast audience, most of you will probably hear this when that game is live,

888
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
so go check that out on Steam.

889
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm sure you can just put it in the search box and you can find that.

890
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Cat president. But My Nigerian Prince is over on itch.io, so check that out over there.

891
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Alright, we're going to get into our gaming weeks before we get into gaming news.

892
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So, let's talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week. Loki.

893
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So, my big gaming week was because on Monday, I decided I'm going to pick up a PlayStation VR, and so I did.

894
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh, so after the show last week, you ended up being kind of sold on VR.

895
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah, so I picked it up and I actually dig it quite a bit.

896
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You know, the control issues that I've seen and stuff, a lot of it's not so bad, but it is kind of broken a little bit.

897
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
For example, there's a really bad problem that they have with the screen drifting.

898
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So, you'll be playing a game and it's slowly drifting to the left for no reason.

899
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's just the issue with the tracking and it's a software issue, which is weird.

900
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I think from what I've heard, it's because you're close to being outside of the distance that the camera can pick you up in or something like that.

901
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And when you're kind of on the outside of that, if you go more towards the center that it's able to pick you up a little bit better.

902
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because I know the way my couch is, which my room is not all that big that I play it in my living room.

903
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I thought I'd be able to sit comfortably on the couch and be able to play it just fine.

904
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But apparently it's just like a few inches shy of being too far away from the camera, which is really silly.

905
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I almost feel like Bobby was talking about that exact same problem on his show last week.

906
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
He was talking almost about a very similar thing.

907
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
That he had to get to sit forward on the couch.

908
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Right, yeah, exactly. And I had to scoot the couch up a little bit.

909
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And I'm always worried to do that because my cat's a retard and she will go behind the couch and lay there or something.

910
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And then I'll scoot the couch back and crush her to the death.

911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So, I mean, I always gotta watch out for the cat trying to kill herself.

912
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But, no, I played, and once again, you know, thank you Shane.

913
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
He's our pusher for when it comes to the gaming stuff.

914
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah, SSG100Matt in chat calling that out.

915
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Shane's hero's power of making people buy things got to Loki.

916
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It's not him that got me to buy it. It's trying it that got me to buy it.

917
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Because if I had tried it, probably at Best Buy, I probably would have picked it up.

918
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I wouldn't have cancelled my pre-order. I would have just had to find some way to be able to pay for it.

919
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So I did pick up, ironically enough, I picked up Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

920
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Which, honestly, that is not a game I'm remotely, like a genre that I'm remotely interested in at all.

921
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't like horror games at all. But this game is fucking awesome.

922
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So I don't know. It's just weird. It's a shooting gallery game that's like,

923
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
my best comparison is it's Toy Story Mania meets Saw is basically what it is.

924
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
See, I would like to play the Toy Story Mania game because Shane did make me play that finally.

925
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I think it was after the show I finally sat down and played that game and I had to stop.

926
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Like, there was just too many jump scares and I was not, I was not having it.

927
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Really? I didn't see it. There wasn't that many jump scares for me.

928
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Okay, but you know he picked the course that was the worst one.

929
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And that, to the opposite of Shane's power or whatever you want to call it, that is the worst thing to do.

930
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
If he knows I don't like scary games, he should have started me on a soft-

931
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They did have some jump scares, but like, it was more of like, you got me. That's pretty funny.

932
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You know, like, you know it's like something's gonna jump out and stuff.

933
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Like, there was, like I played through about three of the levels so far in Rush of Blood.

934
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So the first one you start off, and I think that's the one you had me play here,

935
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
is basically you're going through everything and then you gas at the end.

936
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And so they're kind of teaching the mechanics of the game and stuff and shooting.

937
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So the second level is the one that they have in the actual demo on the PlayStation VR disc,

938
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
which is basically this thing where you go into a slaughterhouse type thing,

939
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and all of a sudden all the pigs come alive and start squealing and the saw is going up.

940
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That was the stage he made me play. It was gross.

941
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah, with the dolls and stuff like that, and like, it's kind of creepy.

942
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
The third stage is like a ghost stage.

943
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And so they've basically got this woman that's shooting crows at you a lot of the time.

944
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And so you have to kind of shoot those away.

945
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But there's one part that's pitch black that you're going through with these mannequins.

946
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It's like the Silent Hill Nurses almost. Like, the mannequins move when you're not looking at them.

947
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And they kind of, like, creep up in your face and stuff. So that was kind of creepy but fun.

948
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's an entertaining type game, and I've actually had quite a bit of fun just playing that.

949
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The other game I picked up was Job Simulator, which, it's a fun game to mess around with,

950
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and my son likes playing it even though he is too short for that game.

951
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So, like, that's one of the things I don't really like about PlayStation VR,

952
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
and this is basically a software thing.

953
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The calibration stuff is not always easy to get to in the middle of a game.

954
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Like, when I was trying to adjust it for him, you know, you can raise and lower the floor so that you're taller or shorter, depending on what that is.

955
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And I really wish they had a way to kind of calibrate that, like they do, I think, with the Vive,

956
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
where you put a controller on the floor, put a controller on top of your head or something like that so they know your height,

957
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and kind of scale everything based on that, or at least make you taller based on that.

958
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Because that would have been really helpful, because I just kind of had to wing it to see if he would be tall enough.

959
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And even still, when I did it uncalibrated, he's like, okay, you got to take the paper out of the thing.

960
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
He's like trying to reach up and grab the paper, and it's just too far away.

961
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Or, oh, you got to get a coffee cup to fill it with coffee, and he couldn't reach the top shelf, which is pretty funny.

962
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
But it's a fun game, but I think it's something, and I kind of was worried about when I bought it, too,

963
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
that I'm going to get bored with really fast.

964
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Like, you play it through all the levels like once or twice, and you're just like, okay, I've seen everything there is to see in this.

965
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So I was a little bit worried of that.

966
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I did play a lot of the demos, though, that were on the demo disc.

967
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So like one of the ones I liked was Drive Club.

968
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
A lot of people say that that makes them sick.

969
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I never had a problem with motion sickness in that game, though.

970
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
What I did find funny, though, about it is it's a game that you're supposed to be sitting down in.

971
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And so I didn't do that.

972
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I stood up or moved my head to the side, so it's like I had my head sticking out of the top of the roof or out the side window and stuff.

973
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
That was kind of silly.

974
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But the game does look like shit graphically.

975
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's just not pretty, but it's all right.

976
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
The one game I really liked the demo for was Eve Valkyrie.

977
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Totally would play that if it was a single-player game.

978
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But I hear the single-player campaign is 30 bucks, the game is $60, and it's a multiplayer game, and I'm not playing that.

979
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But the demo is so fucking awesome.

980
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:11,000
It's just like, man, if this was Colony Wars or something like that, that was a single-player campaign that was several hours long, I would totally be down for this.

981
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But it's just, no, I'm not really into playing a multiplayer online game like that.

982
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I played Rigs, which is all right.

983
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Same kind of thing with that.

984
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It was all right.

985
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It was kind of fun to play.

986
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It would be more fun like an Armored Core-type game, but I just don't want to play a multiplayer online game.

987
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I just am not really interested in that, especially with VR and being kind of not entirely twitchy enough.

988
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I guess it's not that sensitive, but I don't know.

989
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:49,000
The Eve Valkyrie demo, man, even just playing it, you just get so psyched when you're playing it, but it's so short.

990
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm just not going to drop $60 for that short of a campaign, though.

991
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's kind of unfortunate.

992
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I didn't end up playing Rez.

993
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I thought about picking up Rez, but once again, I think that's something, once I play through it, I'm going to be done with it.

994
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That's kind of how I was with the old Rez.

995
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And PlayStation Worlds is just a tech demo, so no, I'm not picking that up either.

996
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You've got to try Thumper, though, if you haven't.

997
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Thumper looked cool.

998
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I may try that.

999
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I don't know.

1000
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
That might be something I may pick up.

1001
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm just going to wait to see what more stuff comes out for it.

1002
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I know there's some rollercoaster games and stuff later on that might be kind of fun, but yeah, I'm very hopeful for it.

1003
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I hope that these tracking issues that they have maybe will be patched out eventually, so I'm hopeful for that.

1004
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Otherwise, the move controllers work okay.

1005
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It does have some trouble, especially in Job Simulator, where you can kind of turn all the way around.

1006
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Obviously, it has trouble tracking the move controllers when they're behind you, so you have some weird stuff that happens with that, but it wasn't terrible.

1007
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It was all right.

1008
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Maya in chat says, VR is one of the first times in my life I felt old and cantankerous and uninterested in tech progress in video games.

1009
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, I'm a little on that side where it's the whole, after I play it for 20 minutes, I need a break.

1010
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That's what I'm worried about with it.

1011
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, I played it for several hours and it wasn't a problem.

1012
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Wow. I saw the VR available at Target, so it's not sold out everywhere.

1013
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
No, it's not.

1014
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I thought about it.

1015
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
GameStop in white is, I just checked to see if they had it on the show.

1016
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I checked to see if any of them had it nearby and one did, so I picked it up and that was that.

1017
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah, I mean, it's not terribly hard to find.

1018
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
It may be okay to wait a little bit because there's not a whole ton of games out for right now.

1019
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
If some of these multiplayer games aren't really what you're looking for, you might want to wait.

1020
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I know they're supposed to be adding a VR mode to TrackMania, which that I can see is vomit-inducing,

1021
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
but I do want to play that because TrackMania was an awesome game.

1022
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That's weird that you say there's not a lot of games when that list we read the other week was gigantic.

1023
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
There's a lot of one-trick pony-type games, right?

1024
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's also coming soon stuff and a lot of them are just like, for example, the Star Wars one that they have with Battlefront.

1025
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That's just a patch to Battlefront, so if you own Battlefront, you get that.

1026
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But I'm not paying $60 for a tech demo.

1027
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
All right, fair enough. A good question here before we move on.

1028
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
SSJ100Matt says, did Mrs. Loki or the kids try it out?

1029
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah, my wife tried it out. I put her on the PlayStation Worlds demo that they had,

1030
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
so it's basically the C1 where they drop you down in a cage and you're kind of just drifting down looking at fish.

1031
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Actually, I think my youngest son would probably like that, but he didn't want to put the headset on.

1032
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
My oldest son, he wanted to try Job Simulator, but his hands are too small for the Move Controller,

1033
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
so he has a hard time reaching the triggers.

1034
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
He still had fun with it, but it's just too hard for him to play, I think, because those controllers are too big for him.

1035
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And did Mrs. Loki go, I'm okay with you spending the money after playing the demo?

1036
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Oh no, I just told her that I sold my Oculus Rift to pay for it, which is what I'm going to do.

1037
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I just haven't quite done it in that order yet.

1038
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Okay, okay. All right.

1039
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Because honestly, my Rift, I haven't played it in a long time. It's just sitting in a bag, so you might as well sell it.

1040
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Sure.

1041
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Eventually I'll get a Vive or something and I don't need that.

1042
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Fair enough. All right, anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

1043
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Just Singress. I've been trying to not play as much, but unfortunately I've played more, so yeah.

1044
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I kind of know those feels, but that's all right. Moving on to my gaming week.

1045
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Honestly, it's been a lot of the MMO space. I've still been playing World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV, kind of juggling those games,

1046
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
especially despite some of the things I was saying about Fan Fest last week.

1047
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Even though the event itself had issues, I still felt very motivated, and probably a lot of that was hanging out with some of my people that I play the game online with.

1048
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Just the general fact that I just think that game is really great, and it keeps expanding with these patches on things to do, so I've been still playing that.

1049
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I try not to completely lose sight of the consoles and stuff, but the one other game that did divert me for a little bit this week on PC,

1050
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
you know I had to check out Civilization VI.

1051
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Of course.

1052
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It was released this weekend, so of course I had to check it out.

1053
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Now unfortunately I was out of town all day yesterday, and that would have normally been my time to spend some more quality time with a game that was released on Friday.

1054
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So I couldn't really spend a lot of time with Civ VI, but I played a little bit.

1055
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I have a tradition, as I've done with Civ V, and when the expansions came out for that, I will do a new game as the Queen of England, because that's how I always play Civilization.

1056
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So I started a new game in Civ VI as the Queen of England, and I have to say, I was kind of not ready for how different it feels.

1057
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And I realized that, okay, it's a sequel. They need to do some things that are different.

1058
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But even Civ V, I was like, okay, Civ V just feels like, you know, it's kind of like Civ IV, but now it's a lot of hexagons, and okay, they've changed some of the rules too.

1059
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
There's some other things.

1060
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:05,000
But like Civ VI, I don't know what it is with the whole fact that, you know, now when you have your, they're not settlers, or not settlers, but workers are now builders.

1061
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And the builders, you can't just automate anymore. You have to kind of strategically choose what type of building goes in what square in your city,

1062
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and that's very new for a Civ game, and that really made me stop and think.

1063
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And then now, there's not just a tech tree, but like culture has a tree that's different from what it was in Civ V, where it was more like a talent tree.

1064
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Now it's like straight up enhancements as well.

1065
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So a lot of those differences really kind of left my head spinning, and I'm like, all right, I need to really roll this back and like start as a,

1066
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I know it asks you in the beginning of the game, are you new to games, are you new to the series, or are you new to Civilization?

1067
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And kind of tailors the tutorial built on that. I kind of feel like I need to go back and say, I'm new to all these games to really kind of get the stuff from the ground up,

1068
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
because I just felt, boy, I felt lost and out of it. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it.

1069
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I still, I kind of actually think that's a good thing, that it's so different that it made me really stop and think.

1070
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But, you know, the presentation and everything, it still felt very Civ, and I know I'm going to have a lot of fun with this.

1071
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So I'm going to continue to explore this game, lol pun, in the coming days.

1072
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I just, I honestly maybe spent like an hour and a half tops with it the other day.

1073
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So I feel like I'm not at a stage where I can really critique the game.

1074
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I can just say that, you know, wow, I was really kind of woo at first at how different it was from Civ 5.

1075
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But I'm also really looking forward to being able to play online with some other people and losing an entire weekend to Civilization 6,

1076
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
because that's what these games do to us.

1077
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'm sure there will likely come a day where Bobby and I play that game for a very, very,

1078
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
and maybe we can have, because I know Spike from Game Buoy and some of his friends,

1079
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I think First Mate Slidekick, I know they all played, we used to play Civ 5.

1080
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So I'm sure we could set up some type of like VOG Hostathon.

1081
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I don't, when's the Extra Life event? I think Extra Life is the weekend I'm in Chicago, though.

1082
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But maybe kind of around that we could do some type of marathon event for a charity, some good cause.

1083
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And it would be very easy to spend all day playing Civ 6.

1084
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Anyway, we'll have to check everybody's schedules and see if we can work something out.

1085
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Let's see, going into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1086
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Kaijuto says, I heard Civ 6 is horseshit.

1087
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, I didn't feel that from the first little bit that I played.

1088
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I did read a review online that said, it said something completely different than my first impression.

1089
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
The review I read said it's really similar to Civ 5.

1090
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And like, I didn't get that at all.

1091
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But maybe I didn't play, I mean, I played a bit of Civ 5.

1092
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
But I didn't play it a long, long, long time like a lot of people did.

1093
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something there.

1094
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let's see, DungeonBuster says, I won Civ 6, but I've been playing Shadow Warrior 2.

1095
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
SSG100Matt says, I forgot Civ 6 came out.

1096
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's for the best, I didn't get it right away.

1097
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Otherwise, I would turn around and realize that it's Tuesday and I still want to do one more turn.

1098
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And Kaijuto is saying, people are saying they turned Civ into a tablet game.

1099
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That was like Civilization Revolutions, wasn't it though?

1100
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yeah, that was the tablet game.

1101
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
See, but here's the crazy thing.

1102
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
They also had Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.

1103
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I really liked that game for what it was.

1104
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Like, I didn't see it as a tablet game so much as I saw it as like a...

1105
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It was more like the original Civilization than anything else they'd put out around that time.

1106
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And because maybe I remember the original Civilization the best,

1107
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and that's the one that really made me fall in love with the series,

1108
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
maybe that's why I'm a little bit partial to it, but I don't know.

1109
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I guess I could see though, I mean, if all you're using is your mouse for point and clicking,

1110
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, you could probably do the same thing on a tablet.

1111
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But I didn't really walk away with that impression that like, oh, this was designed for an iPad.

1112
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Like, it seems to look better than that on my monitor.

1113
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I didn't walk away with that impression.

1114
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So, SSG100Matt says, is it a different jump like Civ IV to Civ V to Civ Revolution,

1115
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
or Civ V to Civ Beyond Earth?

1116
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I would say for Civ VI, I would say it's kind of like...

1117
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I guess Civ V to Beyond Earth is a decent comparison,

1118
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
but Beyond Earth was still in the Civ V engine, so there was a lot of feeling in that.

1119
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And this one is definitely, you know, they've kind of gone back and reinvented everything,

1120
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
but I would say that comparison is probably a little closer,

1121
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
because Civ IV and V were really stripped down for Civ Revolution,

1122
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
and I don't think this game's been stripped down at all.

1123
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So, anyway, that's my initial thoughts on a few quick minutes with Civilization VI.

1124
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So, let's get into some housekeeping, and then we'll get into the news.

1125
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
First, we will not be having a show on November 13th.

1126
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's Veterans Day weekend. I will be out of town.

1127
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
However, we will be doing something, because we have to have an Episode 665 of some sort

1128
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
to keep us on track to have Episode 666 on 20 November.

1129
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So, we will do something pre-recorded.

1130
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It just might be a shorter show, but it won't be live.

1131
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So, you folks that turn out here live, you'll undoubtedly get to hear something new

1132
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
at 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock that night, depending on your time zone,

1133
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
but it won't be live, just so you know.

1134
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,

1135
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
or we are on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

1136
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Gaming news, there was a lot of it. Let's get to it. Loki.

1137
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah, so, apparently the SAG-AFTRA unit has officially called for a voice actor strike

1138
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
against several gaming companies, including Activision, EA, and Take-Two.

1139
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:39,000
They did say that this is due to, I guess, failing to renegotiate their contracts

1140
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
with the terms that they wanted.

1141
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Basically, this could possibly affect games that went into production after February 17th of 2015.

1142
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
So, maybe some of these games that are on the slate for next year and stuff.

1143
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's kind of unfortunate.

1144
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I know that some of the names I saw on there, they had quite a few well-known voice actors

1145
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
that are a part of that.

1146
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I know I saw Jennifer Hale on the list.

1147
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Will Wheaton had an article about it on his blog, even though I don't think,

1148
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
well, I guess he is participating in it one way or another,

1149
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
although he doesn't do a lot of voice acting.

1150
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I know he's done some for games.

1151
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
So, yeah, it's definitely impacting.

1152
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
There was also a list out there of what games it impacts,

1153
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and it does not affect Mass Effect Andromeda,

1154
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
but I would imagine because the voice acting in that game has probably already been sealed up.

1155
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
They're not doing any more work on that.

1156
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
But if there were to be DLC to come for that game, then that would be at a pause,

1157
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
depending on how far they are with that.

1158
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
But I think a lot of us are hoping they work out these differences relatively quickly

1159
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
so that this doesn't get...

1160
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Right, because I remember the acting strike, or the writer strike that they had for TV and stuff,

1161
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
that kind of fucked up a lot of shit.

1162
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, that killed the TV show Heroes. Remember that?

1163
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah, well, season two kind of sucked too, but you know, that's here.

1164
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Well, that was the season that got abbreviated by the strike.

1165
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
It was supposed to go longer, but it didn't. Anyway.

1166
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Thank God they cut it short, put it out of its misery. Shit, man.

1167
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
What do you think? I've been reading a little bit on the strike,

1168
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and our buddy Rama texted me to a Facebook post that a prominent voice actor has made,

1169
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
and I do get a lot of their concerns. I mean, especially when we talk about the whole fact that,

1170
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
you know, four hours of screaming, you know, and recording those voices,

1171
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
that is going to take a toll on the voice.

1172
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
You know, when we do this show here, you know, we can do this for three hours, but...

1173
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I like the feeling of three hours of screaming sometimes.

1174
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Sometimes you do, and I don't know how your voice doesn't hurt the next day.

1175
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But for the most part, maybe Loki aside, we're not sitting here screaming constantly

1176
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
for the entire time the show is on.

1177
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But I will tell you this. You guys have all heard this show,

1178
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
is that you guys know that sometimes I host sometimes, and I do that type of stuff.

1179
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I host theater, specifically a lot of Rocky Horror,

1180
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
although that's going to be more cult movies in December.

1181
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
But actually, funny enough, here in SAC, we have a Rocky Horror show coming up next week.

1182
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So I can tell you right now, when I host Rocky Horror on Saturday night,

1183
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,000
that's not even three hours. That's like maybe 30 minutes of me having to use a very loud,

1184
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
boisterous voice while I'm doing the pre-show and doing some light stand-up

1185
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and doing the initiations and things like that. That's like 30 minutes, maybe.

1186
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I will come in here on Sunday and my voice will sound like this.

1187
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Like, I will not have a good voice.

1188
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So I can't imagine doing something like that for, I mean, God, two hours, let alone four.

1189
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Especially if you're doing, like, weird voices and stuff. Who knows?

1190
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It's even harder when you change up your voice.

1191
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So a lot of those safety concerns I get, and I also understand a lot of the concerns

1192
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
when it comes to the secrecy of the projects that are involved.

1193
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And they did make a very good point about, like, sometimes the things are so clamped down

1194
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
that they can't really necessarily get a sense of what the character is and all this other stuff.

1195
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And so, I mean, reading the post made a lot of sense.

1196
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And the Wil Wheaton post is really good, too, in laying that all out there.

1197
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Now, I also, just so you know, I also can see a little bit of it from the other side

1198
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
where they're saying, why should the actors get residual payments

1199
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
when nobody else who works on the game and develops the game gets residual payments?

1200
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yeah, I kind of, you know.

1201
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I don't know. And a lot of the response I feel like I'm seeing, at least based on comments,

1202
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
so take it with a grain of salt, but a lot of the response I'm seeing is,

1203
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
well, maybe those people need to ask for it, too.

1204
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I don't know. I can sort of see where the residual payment, like, I get that.

1205
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Especially, like, if you're marketing your game based on the fact that, let's say,

1206
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Mark Hamill is back doing The Joker, and that's a big selling point for your game,

1207
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
then, yeah, he's probably entitled to some residuals.

1208
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
But I'm not saying that the programmers and some of the people behind the scenes

1209
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
don't necessarily deserve some of those as well.

1210
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But I think the more immediate thing that they really need to figure out is some of these safety concerns.

1211
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
You know, the safety with the motion capture, the safety with the four hours of screaming and all this stuff.

1212
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I do think there's a valid argument to be made there.

1213
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
This contract hasn't really been looked at since, what, the 90s?

1214
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It was probably the last time they did this.

1215
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
When Tim Curry was starring in Gabriel Knight was how long ago, and not that remake.

1216
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I could do a whole show on that.

1217
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But anyway, when Tim Curry was doing Gabriel Knight, it was just different then.

1218
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It was completely different than the industry is now.

1219
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So I can see why a lot of this needs to be reevaluated.

1220
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Regardless, I hope they're able to solve it sooner rather than later.

1221
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And especially these safety issues.

1222
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So, we'll see.

1223
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1224
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Raginator says, I wouldn't mind three hours of Sky's diva rants on OLR.

1225
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Be careful what you ask for.

1226
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,000
SSG100Matt says, from what I've heard from going to voice acting panels,

1227
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
some of these developers can really screw over these actors.

1228
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Like making them do all the yelling and screaming lines in the beginning of the sessions,

1229
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and not the end, resulting in ruined voices for a while.

1230
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
ActDef says, basically, Voice Actors Guild needs to be on par with the Screen Actors Guild,

1231
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
or almost on par.

1232
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Well, that's kind of what this is, because SAG is Screen Actors Guild,

1233
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
so a lot of these folks are represented by Screen Actors Guild,

1234
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
which merged a few years ago with AFTRA, which, sorry guys in the industry,

1235
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
don't be mad if I get this wrong,

1236
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
but I think covers a lot more of the Broadway talent, like live theater and those sorts of things.

1237
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
There's probably more to it as well.

1238
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But generally, it just involves acting in all different types of forms,

1239
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and that would, of course, be an umbrella for voice acting as well.

1240
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So, anyhow, I hope they're able to figure that out,

1241
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
because, again, you know, we're going to feel it with some of the game releases,

1242
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
and if you think we've got a drought of games this year,

1243
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I mean, if this goes on for a while, that could cause some games to get delayed.

1244
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I mean, it could cause, I don't know.

1245
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Do you think AAA studios would look to using non-union talent?

1246
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I know this is a highly controversial issue that we probably have no authority to speak on whatsoever,

1247
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
but it's not stopping Twitter from doing it,

1248
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:24,000
so do you think that these AAA companies would be bold enough to use non-union talent?

1249
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I'm telling you, Gilbert Gottfried's going to get so much work now.

1250
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Gilbert Gottfried's under SAG, though.

1251
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
He would be able to do it.

1252
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
You'll see more contests like the one BioWare had a couple weeks ago to get in the mat.

1253
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Remember when we acted out that scene on air?

1254
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Which, by the way, no phone call from EA.

1255
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Isn't that disappointing?

1256
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That's so disappointing, Louie.

1257
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Anyway, all right.

1258
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Moving on, let's talk about one of those games that could be impacted.

1259
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
This is Rumor, tinfoil hat.

1260
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Get out the wheel of plausibility for this one.

1261
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Oh, wait. Oh, didn't we have a theme song for the wheel of plausibility?

1262
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I think we did.

1263
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
It's time to spin the wheel of plausibility.

1264
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
All right, I'm already over that song.

1265
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Could Diablo IV be something that is revealed at BlizzCon 2016?

1266
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Could it? Because it is a Blizzard game.

1267
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Therefore, yes, it could be.

1268
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And apparently what's causing all this is a four-sided die.

1269
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It's a D4 die that I get.

1270
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Is that being found in a BlizzCon bag or what?

1271
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I guess something.

1272
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
They're finding a D4 die is somehow associated with BlizzCon and Blizzard.

1273
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And I guess the numbers are printed wrong on this die.

1274
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And the dates that it reads are the dates for BlizzCon 2016, November 4th.

1275
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So could Diablo IV be happening on November 4th?

1276
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Also, I guess somebody had spotted, somebody over at PC Gamer was reporting that David Breivik,

1277
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:07,000
who is a project lead on Diablo II, and senior producer Bill Roper were spotted at Blizzard headquarters.

1278
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And this is just adding fuel to the fire.

1279
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So could Diablo be happening at BlizzCon, Diablo IV?

1280
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Well, here's the thing.

1281
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Something Diablo is happening at BlizzCon.

1282
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It makes complete fucking sense.

1283
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
World of Warcraft's expansion released two months ago.

1284
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
They're not going to release a new expansion.

1285
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
They're not even going to announce a new expansion for Warcraft.

1286
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I mean, this isn't Sims we're talking about here.

1287
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Overwatch, I feel, is still a little new.

1288
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
You might get your new character.

1289
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,000
This whole Sombra thing might happen at BlizzCon, but I don't see any radical changes with Overwatch.

1290
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Maybe StarCraft, there's been those rumors of a remaster.

1291
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I don't know, but this really leaves Diablo as the franchise that is going to have some attention paid to it this year.

1292
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But Diablo IV? I don't know.

1293
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I kind of think it's an expansion for Diablo III.

1294
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Because the story at the end of the last expansion was kind of left wide open for in Act 6.

1295
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I suppose that could go into a new game.

1296
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I suppose there's a lot of reasons why Blizzard might want to just jump into Diablo IV.

1297
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And a lot of it is probably tied to the fact that there is still negative stigma around Diablo III because of the way it was when it launched in the Auction House and all that stuff.

1298
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Even though Diablo III now is completely different from when it launched.

1299
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And I think it's a game that's definitely worth checking out.

1300
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
But I just don't know. I have a hard time believing it's all the way to Diablo IV.

1301
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I tend to think it's a new expansion before I think it's Diablo IV.

1302
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,000
But if it is Diablo IV, cool. I guess I'll be curious to see what kind of changes and updates they make to it.

1303
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But Loki, you don't really care because you don't play Diablo, huh?

1304
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I don't, unfortunately.

1305
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You know, all that stuff is on consoles, too, though.

1306
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I know. Every time I see a game, I tend to buy it, but I just never do.

1307
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,000
S2100matt in chat says, just sitting here waiting for a Lost Vikings sequel. Maybe someday.

1308
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:13,000
By the way, speaking of Blizzard, their Battle.net launcher, which of course is used on PC to launch the various multiplayer games such as Diablo or World of Warcraft.

1309
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It just added voice chat into it.

1310
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Yeah, we're not supposed to call it Battle.net anymore. Remember that?

1311
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
No, it's still Battle.net to me, so I'm breaking the rule.

1312
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
The Battle.net launcher has added voice chat into it.

1313
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So Blizzard voice is what they're calling it.

1314
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And it is a voice chat that will work across the different multiplayer titles.

1315
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
So it's kind of like Steam's voice chat since, you know, Blizzard games aren't on Steam and you have the separate launcher for it.

1316
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So you can talk to friends or even friends of friends inside or even outside of games as long as you have the Battle.net program open.

1317
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And this will allow you to talk to people like, so I could be playing World of Warcraft and my buddy could be playing Overwatch and I could talk to them across those games.

1318
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Which, I mean, it's Xbox Live on your PC for things that are through the Battle.net launcher.

1319
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So they're talking about high quality voice and superior stability.

1320
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I'd be very curious what this is going to do for things like Warcraft rating.

1321
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Because we used to use Ventrilo, but I would imagine services like that are starting to fade.

1322
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Especially now that Discord has a pretty good voice chat in it and that's becoming an option for a lot of gamers.

1323
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
A lot of my Final Fantasy XIV stuff is going to Discord.

1324
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And then I know, you know, now that these games have it built in is a big thing for people as well.

1325
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So, anyway.

1326
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Also, you are not able to talk to friends that are, excuse me, you can't talk to people that are not in your friends list during random pickup games.

1327
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
That still has to be enabled, I would imagine, by the game.

1328
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So I guess you can do it in Overwatch, but you can't do it in, say, Diablo.

1329
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
World of Warcraft at one time had voice chat built into it, but it was awful.

1330
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I wonder if they haven't stripped it out of the game to replace with this.

1331
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So, anyway.

1332
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That is what's going on with Blizzard.

1333
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Of course, their big convention is, what, less than two weeks away at this point.

1334
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So I'm sure we'll hear plenty more very soon.

1335
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Meanwhile, Loki, other big gaming news this week.

1336
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah, so this week, not only actually the same day as the Switch video they had.

1337
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
They had the first trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2.

1338
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So that'll be coming out fall of 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1339
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Nothing announced yet for, like, PC.

1340
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:43,000
But one of the things that they did announce was that there's gonna be select content for Red Dead Redemption 2 that'll come first to PlayStation 4.

1341
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So they're gonna have a brand new online multiplayer experience that'll be coming first to PlayStation 4.

1342
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So the way I picture that is just, like, Grand Theft Auto Online.

1343
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I'm guessing that they're talking about, like, content.

1344
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Like, how they do the free expansion, not free expansions, but, like, free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online.

1345
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So that'll be similar with, like, Red Dead Online or whatever the case may be for that.

1346
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Cool.

1347
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I mean, the trailer was pretty.

1348
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Definitely something they'll pick up when it comes out.

1349
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And that's important, a pretty trailer.

1350
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
We don't know too much about it, but it sure looks nice.

1351
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I mean, that's all we have to go by.

1352
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Yeah, I don't know. I have to admit, I didn't really get super into the last Red Dead Redemption.

1353
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But I thought it was neat.

1354
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:37,000
But, you know, again, it's just one of those games that MMOs keep me away from playing and all the other stuff that I tend to play as well.

1355
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So there you go.

1356
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,000
However, one game that I did take a little time out to play, and I need to go back and play it again a little more, is Doom.

1357
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Because Doom now has an arcade mode in it.

1358
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Yes, that's right. Doom got an update this week.

1359
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
It was the fourth free update that they've done on Steam.

1360
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And it added the arcade mode.

1361
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Arcade mode now unlocks all guns, suit upgrades, runes, and you now play in a multiplayer-based scoring system that rewards aggression and accuracy.

1362
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
You play every level with all guns, runes, and equipment fully unlocked.

1363
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:19,000
You compete against friends and players worldwide for the highest score by attacking demons quickly, avoiding attacks, and grabbing multipliers on the way.

1364
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So I guess it's a more fast-paced thing.

1365
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I want to check this out. It sounds pretty cool.

1366
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And there also is another Doom multiplayer pack called Hell Followed that's coming out on October 27th.

1367
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
So man, they're keeping the updates coming for that new Doom game.

1368
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Which, you know, it really is one of the better releases of the year, I think, which was kind of surprising.

1369
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Because I think with a lot of these reboots, sometimes they miss the mark, but Doom's pretty awesome.

1370
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And the fact that they continue to support it with a good balance between free and DLC and paid stuff, I think just does the game even more credit, to be honest.

1371
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So, snaps for you folks making Doom.

1372
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Moving on, Loki.

1373
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Alright, so this is kind of unfortunate, but United Friends Games has apparently shut down.

1374
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:20,000
United Friends Games, they were responsible for some of the Sony games, ModNation Racers, Little Big Planet Karting, and then more recently Sleeping Dogs.

1375
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And apparently they were working on a multiplayer brawler game called Smash and Grab.

1376
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:34,000
But I guess it just recently hit Steam Early Access, but I'm guessing now that...

1377
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I don't know. Is that not being finished now? Like most Steam Early Access games, I guess?

1378
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

1379
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yeah, it's never good news when game studios close, you know?

1380
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah. So apparently, yeah, they rumored to be closing based off of, I guess, a post on NeoGaf, and then GameSpot had confirmed it with somebody close to the studio, so that's unfortunate.

1381
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Alright, moving on to some news out of Sony and what's going on with PlayStation tournaments.

1382
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Earlier this week, Sony announced that they are teaming up with ESL, which is a gaming network, and they're going to be hosting a digital, month-long basketball tournament.

1383
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And this is going to be through NBA 2K17.

1384
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So from October 27th, which is this coming week, through November 26th, there are going to be major cup rounds every Saturday.

1385
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And the tournament is based on NBA 2K17.

1386
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,000
If you're one of the top three players at the end of the tournament, you get a prize pack with PlayStation gear, controllers, and all that good stuff.

1387
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Of course, if you want to participate, you do need the game to be able to play.

1388
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You do have to have a PlayStation Plus subscription, I imagine, so you can play online.

1389
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And you do want to get an account with the ESL gaming site.

1390
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So you have to register for the tournament beforehand at ESL, and then you're automatically prompted when your time to compete comes.

1391
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
No idea how large the player pool's going to be.

1392
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Everything, though, they are saying one versus one.

1393
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And Sony wants to expand this with other tournaments moving forward.

1394
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
So that's kind of cool.

1395
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And Microsoft, of course, did something similar at Game Developers Conference when they talked about the Xbox Live tournament platform, which allows folks to make tournaments via Xbox Live.

1396
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So it's only logical that Sony kind of makes a similar step with this.

1397
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Of course, since sports games aren't really up my alley, I can appreciate that they exist and that they bring a lot more gamers into the market.

1398
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
But so this particular tournament, I can't say I'm getting super excited about.

1399
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But, you know, maybe it would be cool if there were tournaments for other types of games as well, not just necessarily sports games.

1400
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And I'm sure we will see that if things like this do well.

1401
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So to be continued, maybe I'll get a tournament for Diablo 4 in 2019. Who knows?

1402
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Who knows?

1403
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
All right. Loki, before we get to the classic game of the week, what do you have?

1404
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So there was a mod that was made for Grand Theft Auto 5 that was kind of silly.

1405
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It replaced the sticky mines or the C4 that you have with a Samsung Galaxy Note.

1406
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Because, you know, that's silly. Someone basically can throw that and it sticks to something and it explodes.

1407
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And so they had a video that was on YouTube. And then, of course, it got a DMCA takedown from Samsung and they didn't apparently like it too much.

1408
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:39,000
However, recently, YouTube, though, has reinstated the video because the creator filed a counterclaim against Samsung.

1409
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
But so you can go check it out.

1410
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:52,000
That's kind of unfortunate that people are using DMCA to, you know, well, what? Abusive automated systems on YouTube? You don't say.

1411
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Did you see that whole thing? I think it was Reddit or Twitter or somebody had this linked.

1412
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But like some guys got a threatening email that said, give us a thousand dollars or we're going to get your we're going to copyright strike your YouTube channel out of existence.

1413
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And they did it. They didn't pay the thousand dollars. They got they got copyright striked out of existence.

1414
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And that really just makes me go, wow, I don't want to ever.

1415
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yeah. Isn't that wonderful that YouTube heroes exist so that we can now have people do that even quicker?

1416
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
That's so fucking fantastic, YouTube.

1417
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Yeah. YouTube needs to fix this. There needs to be recourse against fakers.

1418
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And I think stuff like this is only just going to make this happen even even faster.

1419
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
At least I hope it does. Or else YouTube is going to, you know, some folks are trying to up the competition now.

1420
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
There's what? There's this vid me is something newer that's coming out.

1421
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
The Twitch for gaming Twitch allowing the uploads on their side now. That's pretty big step.

1422
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So, I mean, YouTube kind of needs to figure this out or they're going to.

1423
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:56,000
It's just it's being abused. And the bad thing about it, too, is it's, you know, one of their complaints, the channel that got taken down.

1424
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,000
They're saying that, you know, if they were a larger channel, YouTube would have resolved this already.

1425
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:09,000
But because their numbers are smaller, that YouTube doesn't give a shit about them. And I kind of feel that's the case.

1426
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Oh, for sure. For sure. There needs to be some type of legal recourse that these guys can take with the fakers.

1427
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And yeah, could they even I know this might sound ridiculous, but I have to throw it out there.

1428
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Could they could they attempt to like sue? This is crazy.

1429
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:33,000
But sue YouTube for lost income that their videos could be granting because it was fake and that they have evidence that they were blackmailed or whatever.

1430
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Well, I don't really know if they can. I mean, because I'm not a lawyer. That should be obvious.

1431
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Well, they have a lawyer that's already helping out Ryan Morrison, the video game attorney. He's, you know, kind of jumped in to help him out.

1432
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:57,000
They contacted Fupo, which is that H3H3 Productions created a bunch of different YouTubers created this like account that those guys can't fix every single start.

1433
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It shouldn't be their job to fix it. It should be YouTube's.

1434
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Right. But YouTube is a fucking clusterfuck. So they just. They can't. There's too many things going on, but there's not a humans checking all this shit.

1435
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Yeah. No, I guess there's no easy answer. All right. Well, let's let's travel back to a simpler time.

1436
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,000
We're going to go back to a time when you didn't have YouTube and copyright strike or any of that stuff.

1437
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:29,000
It's time to go to the classic game of the week.

1438
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:38,000
But regretfully, our magic machine is broken this week and there is no radio magic this week to bring dark soccer to the show this week.

1439
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So I apologize for that, but we'll work on getting that fixed so that we can have her here next week.

1440
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,000
So we're going to do what we do when dark soccer is off for other reasons other than a long term absence.

1441
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Which, by the way, I did hear from her this week, at least.

1442
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And she does think that things are going to work out where she will be able to come back to the show in January.

1443
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I think this early January. So around the holidays.

1444
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
So that's good. But we're going to do what we did usually when she would miss out on the show.

1445
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And I'm going to pick a classic game of the week or Loki would.

1446
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
But we decided I'll do it this week. Maybe to my Halo pick.

1447
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:15,000
But, you know, I said I don't want to get that phone call. I do not want that phone call.

1448
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So let's get to the classic game of the week. And I picked a game on the Game Boy.

1449
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And it's a it's a game that I remember. I figured it was a Nintendo week.

1450
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So I'll do something with the Game Boy. And this is a game that I remember playing an awful lot of when it first came out.

1451
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And it's called Moto Cross Maniacs is the name of this. Did you ever play Moto Cross Maniacs on the Game Boy?

1452
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Old school member, old school title on the Game Boy.

1453
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
It was a game that was by Konami. And it was kind of which is interesting because I had no idea that it was by.

1454
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Sorry, the audio on that is really loud. Sorry. I had no idea that that was a Konami game.

1455
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Although, yeah, I still remember this kind of hear it in the audio because it looks like it could be like a sequel to.

1456
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Excitebike. Excitebike, doesn't it? And I think that's part of the reason I picked it up was originally when I was younger is because it looked like it was like a sequel to Excitebike.

1457
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:13,000
It was actually by Ultra Games, which was Konami. That was Konami. That was the way they got around things in the US.

1458
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:20,000
But anyway, what you do in this game is you control a motorcycle and it moves pretty much in one direction, which is similar to Excitebike.

1459
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
But in Excitebike, you could kind of you have that fakie 3D effect where you can move up and down the different lanes.

1460
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
No, Motocross Maniacs doesn't have that. Remember, this was on the original black and white Game Boy. It wasn't that complex.

1461
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But what it had instead was that, you know, you could do all these wheelies and you were flying on ramps.

1462
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And not only were you flying on like normal ramps, but you were flying on stuff that didn't exist in real life, like loops and like double, like you'd hop from one loop to another loop and be flying all around.

1463
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You know, it was just it was fun to play when I was a kid. You would use your nitro boost just at the right time when you're going over one of these slopes and you would go flying.

1464
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Now, that was a lot like Excitebike on the NES. So that's where some of those comparisons come from.

1465
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
But some of these levels are just like insane with the type of stuff that they're doing.

1466
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And of course, ridiculous things that would not exist in real life, like platforms floating in midair.

1467
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But who cares? It's a video game. It's the Game Boy. See, look at that, Logie. Two loops. See that in the video right there? Two loops.

1468
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Oh, my God.

1469
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I got hit back to back. Whoa, that's like Sonic the Hedgehog right there. But on a Game Boy.

1470
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Anyway, you control the motorcycle and you can move the front wheel upwards or downwards.

1471
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
You do have a limited amount of fuel, but they call it a time bar in the game.

1472
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And so you have to complete the course before you run out of fuel.

1473
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
You do have a limited amount of speed boosts and there are letters like NTR.

1474
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I'm sorry. NTR is actually what you see in the bottom of the screen. NTR is short for Nitro.

1475
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,000
But you can pick up more boosts like N, which is additional boosts.

1476
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
There's also extra fuel, which is the T. There is special tires, which is the R.

1477
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And then there's also an S that's increased speed. So that'll help you move even faster.

1478
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
You can also do combos by doing like front flips and back flips.

1479
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:16,000
And doing combos will get you a flying booster, which you'll see the little word jet appear.

1480
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
That will let you jump super high if you actually use super boosts.

1481
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Also what was really cool about this game, again, for the Game Boy, which was released in North America.

1482
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
By the way, this game was out January 1990 in North America.

1483
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And this was one of the earlier releases. It wasn't a launch title, but it was right around.

1484
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:41,000
It was the next wave of games. Japan, this game was out on September 20th of 1989.

1485
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But there were multiple paths that you could go in some of the levels.

1486
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
The first level is pretty straightforward, but then later on you had multiple directions that you could go in.

1487
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
And one of the directions would have other power-ups in it as well.

1488
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So you had to get those boosts down and use your nitros just at the right time.

1489
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So you could fly different ways and get through the different courses.

1490
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
There are eight levels in the game, which of course get harder and harder as you move along.

1491
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You can select any level at the beginning of the game.

1492
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
There's also A, B, and C difficulty level, which will change the time that you have to complete.

1493
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
And then there is single player, single versus computer, and single player versus second player.

1494
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Where the second player will appear as a silhouette behind you.

1495
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And you might remember in the days when the Game Boy was first released, it was huge on that link cable, right?

1496
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So you'd use the link cable to link up to another Game Boy, and then you could actually play against somebody head to head.

1497
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And there's that little Game Link logo right on the box to let you know that you could do that.

1498
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
And there's really not... I mean, it was a Game Boy game, so it was pretty simple, but it was one that I remember owning and really enjoying.

1499
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
So that's why I picked it as the Classic Game of the Week.

1500
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Moto Cross Maniacs is the Classic Game of the Week.

1501
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Loki, you never played it at all.

1502
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I may have. I never had a Game Boy. My friend did.

1503
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
So I may have played it on his, but it's... God, that was years ago.

1504
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I do want to say, you know what this also... The game reminds me of Uniracers, which came out a long time later on Super Nintendo.

1505
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But that was a Nintendo, or at least one of their in-house dev teams that did that, if I remember right.

1506
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So that felt a lot like this.

1507
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,000
This game in some ways I think was ahead of its time, but the Game Boy platform kind of limits what it can do, I think.

1508
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Because, you know, the Game Boy was a real simple piece of hardware.

1509
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
You know, it couldn't do super complex stuff.

1510
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
So, there it is.

1511
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Moto Cross Maniacs. Check that out.

1512
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Although I don't know if it's aged well.

1513
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I don't know if you play it in an emulator, you're going to get the same thrill that you get on an actual Game Boy.

1514
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
But I think it is on Virtual Console. I could be wrong, but I think you can't get that on Virtual Console.

1515
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Yeah, that would be a nice game we'd have a remake of, would be Uniracers. I like that game.

1516
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Oh, Uniracers was fun. I love the game. I should have done that as Classic Game of the Week. Maybe next time.

1517
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Yep. Maybe next time.

1518
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Although, next time we want to hear Dark Sakura back here through the magic of radio.

1519
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:00,000
But anyway, since we didn't have the magic machine working this week, we are going to take a quick music break.

1520
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
But we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1521
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
We've got rapid fire news in stores this week, the mailbag, although I'm not sure if we had anything in there.

1522
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
A few more stories, and of course, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1523
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
All that is coming up when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1524
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 662 for this October the 23rd of 2016.

1525
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
And boy, that felt weird. It's been weeks since we've taken a music break.

1526
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
And you know, I miss Dark Sakura. I wish she was still here so we could take music breaks more often.

1527
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
But that was nice. I know I can't play these on the podcast feed because otherwise it's copyright and all that stuff.

1528
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
But we played the new Christopher Tin song from Civilization VI.

1529
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
If you guys haven't heard it, it's out there on YouTube. You can check it out very easy.

1530
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Or, you know, just check out Civilization VI.

1531
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
But the song that he does in that game, which translates to the Dream of Flight,

1532
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,000
which I believe is the music on the menu music, is really good.

1533
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And a lot of our chat responded very positively to that.

1534
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
A lot of folks didn't even realize he had done contributions for Civilization VI.

1535
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So there you go. I'm glad we could have done that there, at least for you live listeners.

1536
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
For you podcast folks, though, you get a whole internet out there. I'm sure you will find it.

1537
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
But be sure you join us here live sometimes. You don't miss out on that stuff.

1538
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Sunday nights, of course, at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1539
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And yes, I know if you don't watch The Walking Dead, some bitch is going to spoil it for you.

1540
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
But you know what? I've never seen an episode of that show, so I don't know what everybody's getting so excited about.

1541
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I just don't. But hey, that's fine. That's fine.

1542
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
There's a lot of shows now. I don't know if you've had the same experience, Loki,

1543
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
but having this show on Sunday nights has ruined so much TV for me.

1544
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I never get to see Game of Thrones. I never see Walking Dead.

1545
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
What's the other show that's on Sunday nights on AMC?

1546
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Is there another big one? I don't know.

1547
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:00,000
But there's all these Sunday night shows that I never get to see and I just don't get as excited about.

1548
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I don't know.

1549
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
There's always Netflix.

1550
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I'm sure they're fine shows. I'm not shading them or whatever.

1551
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
It's just, you know, we're doing this instead. It's all good.

1552
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Maya in chat says Westworld. Is that another Sunday night show? I haven't heard a lot about that.

1553
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Yeah, that's what some of the watch was, Westworld.

1554
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I've heard that one too. For me, it's like, I got to do Netflix shows.

1555
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That's like Stranger Things. That was great because it was also, it was only eight episodes.

1556
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You can watch Black Mirror. That's another good one. We just started watching season three of that.

1557
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I think Shane was talking about that like right after we taped Pokestop Podcast this morning,

1558
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
is that he was talking about the, which by the way, new episode of Pokestop.

1559
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Kind of like Twilight Zone about technology.

1560
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Is it from the UK too?

1561
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Yeah.

1562
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Okay. That's what I thought. Yeah, he was talking about that and he said he's a really big fan of that.

1563
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
So I have to check that out.

1564
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Season three has been okay. The first episode of season three I did not like. It was kind of boring.

1565
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
The other ones have been all right.

1566
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
All right. I got it. There's a ton of documentaries on Netflix I want to watch too.

1567
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Like there's, I don't know if you guys get into documentaries.

1568
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Well, they were starting to put Disney movies on there now.

1569
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Like modern Disney movies like Zootopia is on there. My kids can't stop watching that.

1570
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Oh yeah. That was a big deal.

1571
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So I'm looking forward to when like the Marvel movies come out.

1572
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:18,000
All right. Let's do some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on in the industry. Loki.

1573
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So you'll be happy to know that finally that time has happened.

1574
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,000
The Last Guardian has gone gold. So yes, there won't be any more delays.

1575
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Although I am quite surprised that it's gone gold now.

1576
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,000
What being the middle of October yet the game is not coming out for another, you know, month.

1577
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
You know, December is when it's due out now.

1578
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:44,000
So, but hey, there shouldn't be any more delays.

1579
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Well that's good.

1580
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah.

1581
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And maybe the day one patch will be minimal.

1582
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Hopefully. And then of course there's a report that the HTC Vive has sold more than 140,000 units.

1583
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So that's not too bad.

1584
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I'm curious to see how much the other platforms have sold in PlayStation VR.

1585
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
They're saying, you know, they're expecting to sell 2.6 million units by the end of this year.

1586
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
So yeah, I mean that's only a good thing.

1587
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,000
More units being out there means more people wanting to develop for those platforms, meaning more content.

1588
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Agree. You don't think the fact that it's all split across different platforms is going to hurt anybody?

1589
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I don't think so right now because really PC wise you've got Oculus and Vive.

1590
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And a lot of those games kind of work with each other.

1591
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I mean they've got, you know, they're either support both or I don't know.

1592
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I don't think it's going to be that big a difference.

1593
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And even with like the PlayStation VR you kind of have a little bit of both of that.

1594
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
You have some of those, you know, sitting experiences and you have some that are like kind of in a little play space.

1595
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Kind of like the room stuff with Vive.

1596
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm sure it's not as intricate as the Vive stuff because I know it's a lot more powerful hardware.

1597
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
But I think it'll be interesting. It's going to be about getting that price point down.

1598
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I think eventually maybe in a couple years once those prices come down then a lot more people will be able to try it out.

1599
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:17,000
But then again, you know, if they are compelling enough for you to get it, people don't have problems paying that Apple price or the price of a new phone.

1600
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
So, you know, it's all about being compelling enough for you to want to have that piece of hardware.

1601
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
True.

1602
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Or being cheap enough to it being not such a risk to try it.

1603
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
True.

1604
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Alright, well let's talk about Xbox One backwards compatibility.

1605
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
You know, you got to give credit where credit's due and Microsoft has really done an amazing job.

1606
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And I'm so disappointed that I don't see backwards compatibility reports for PlayStation. I mean honestly.

1607
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Yeah, I really thought that would have lit a fire under Sony to do the same thing.

1608
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Although I guess if Sony is still quote unquote winning the war, they're not as motivated to have to do that.

1609
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
But I will give credit, big credit to Microsoft for sticking by this backwards compatibility thing.

1610
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Like I would have been surprised at all if they did it for a couple months and then quit.

1611
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Because that's kind of what Microsoft used to do.

1612
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
But this is very nice that they're still making this happen.

1613
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That they're still trickling out more games.

1614
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And this week we got a big one.

1615
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Orange Box went to the backwards compatibility list this week.

1616
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That's huge.

1617
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That's Portal.

1618
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That's Team Fortress. That's Half-Life.

1619
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
You know, there's a lot of heavy hitter games in that.

1620
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Which I think was our favorite game of the year that came out.

1621
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
That was a great... I'm looking for Valve to do another box set.

1622
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Wouldn't that be amazing if they did another box set that had like Portal 3 and Half-Life 3?

1623
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It's Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3 and Explode internet.

1624
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Oh my god, the internet would just like collapse. Like worse than it did over the weekend.

1625
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
It would just be... wow.

1626
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
But anyway, I'm not going to get too ahead of myself.

1627
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:51,000
The good news is, you know what, despite its age, the Orange Box is still a very solid set to play.

1628
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Granted, Team Fortress has changed a lot, so I don't know about that one so much.

1629
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:02,000
But, you know, for Portal alone, and for the Half-Life series, which is fucking great too, being on Xbox 360.

1630
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I mean, it's just a solid list.

1631
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Also, by the way though, Joe Danger 2 the movie...

1632
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I don't know what the fuck that is. What is Joe Danger 2?

1633
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Joe Danger is a game where you're kind of doing like stunts.

1634
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
So it's Hello Games other games.

1635
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Oh, that's where that's from. It's Hello Games other games. That's right.

1636
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
So they have Joe Danger and Joe Danger 2 the movie.

1637
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Is that why Hello Games went radio silent on everything else?

1638
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Is they were too busy prepping this game for backwards compatibility?

1639
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Where the fuck did they go? Where the fuck did Sean go?

1640
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Where did he go?

1641
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Do you think he took the money and ran? Do you think he's in another country right now?

1642
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
No, I doubt that.

1643
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I hope the dude's okay too. You know, I can say that and joke kind of tongue-in-cheek.

1644
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
But I also kind of wonder, did maybe a lot of this negative feedback really...

1645
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,000
It's okay. I mean, I seriously wouldn't be too bent out of shape about it. I mean, look at Spore.

1646
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I mean, come on.

1647
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
That's true. And you know what? Will Wright is and will always be one of the all-time greats in game development.

1648
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
That's right.

1649
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
If Sean Wright can make a Spore, then you can make a No Man's Sky, I guess.

1650
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Loki, coming from you, that's a very, very nice way to put it.

1651
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I think is a great, positive message for Sean Murray.

1652
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Because I'm sure he's out there listening.

1653
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Perhaps the journalists out there listening can relay that message for us to...

1654
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,000
No, they're too busy writing articles about how a game about cats as a visual novel has ruined their life.

1655
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Galaga Legion is also backwards compatible on Xbox One.

1656
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It was no Pac-Man Championship Edition, which I think is what they were trying to emulate in a way.

1657
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
But it's worth a look. It's worth your time.

1658
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
A lot of people got into the Galaga Legion.

1659
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
So those got added to backwards compatibility.

1660
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Pokemon Go got an update as well.

1661
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Pokemon Go had an update this week that dealt with the Plus.

1662
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
The Plus, actually, they were saying it didn't do a great job at distinguishing PokeStops from Pokemon.

1663
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
And so forth.

1664
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So, yeah, I do notice the vibrations in that thing are different now.

1665
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So you can notice what's different.

1666
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:11,000
And also you can specify within the Pokemon Go app if you want to get just notifications for the actual Pokemon, for the PokeStops, or both.

1667
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
So that's something for me to keep in mind.

1668
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Because I am so low on PokeBalls right now that I'm thinking about maybe I need to run over to a place where there's a ton of PokeStops here.

1669
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Either downtown or Old Fair Oaks or something.

1670
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And just set that to PokeStop only mode and load up.

1671
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Because I am out of PokeBalls.

1672
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I have honestly not played Pokemon Go in weeks.

1673
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
You know, I talked about this on PokeStop podcasts.

1674
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I don't want to double talk myself too much.

1675
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
But I have been really motivated thanks to the Plus.

1676
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I've been using it for more of my walking and exercise.

1677
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I'm hatching a lot of Pokemon.

1678
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I'm not taking it that seriously.

1679
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I'm just kind of using it as like a Fitbit for even bigger nerds.

1680
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
And it's working for that purpose.

1681
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,000
So that's why I get really irritated when I see all this stuff that's like Pokemon Go is dead and all this stuff.

1682
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I'm like, but it's motivating me to exercise more.

1683
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So for that alone, it's kind of a win.

1684
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So just stop being a fucking cynical gamer community and let games be, I guess.

1685
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't know.

1686
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1687
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
We've got to talk about what's in stores this week.

1688
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
What's on the shelves this week, Loki?

1689
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Actually, because we're in that busy fourth quarter.

1690
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,000
So starting this week, we've got Corpse Party for 3DS.

1691
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1692
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Exile's End on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1693
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Hide and Shriek on PC.

1694
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I literally read that as Hide and Shrek when I first saw that.

1695
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It's like, why are they making a Shrek game?

1696
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Ginger Beyond the Crystal on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1697
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Just Dance 2017 coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

1698
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:03,000
King's Quest Chapter 5, The Good Night on PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

1699
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Trillion, God of Destruction on PC.

1700
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
World of Final Fantasy on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1701
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Yomawari, Night Alone on PC and Vita.

1702
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Clockwork Empires on PC and Mac.

1703
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Alice VR on PC and basically all the other Vive and Rift platforms.

1704
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Berserk on PS3, PlayStation 4, and Vita.

1705
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Crow's Burning Edge on PlayStation 4.

1706
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Neo Atlas 1469 on Vita.

1707
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Through the Woods on PC.

1708
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Weeping Doll on PlayStation VR.

1709
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Carnival Games VR on the Vive and PlayStation VR.

1710
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse coming out later in the week on PC as well.

1711
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And then for some reason they have all these games releasing on that Friday, which is Titanfall 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1712
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,000
The Yellow Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1713
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:17,000
And then finally Hitman Hokkaido on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1714
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I wonder if game releases won't switch to Fridays, because music did a couple years ago.

1715
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Like all the new releases are on Friday.

1716
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'm sure you were following the fact that Lady Gaga put out a new album on Friday.

1717
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I don't think it really necessarily follows that, because all the other media like movies and stuff come out on Tuesdays.

1718
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
They release dates on Tuesday.

1719
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
But then again, they like to do these event things on Fridays and stuff, and I don't know.

1720
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Well, heading over to Japan and looking at the releases there.

1721
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Over in Japan on the PlayStation 4, Sword Art Online Hollow Realization is out in a limited edition this week.

1722
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
World of Final Fantasy is also out in Japan this week.

1723
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And there is a game called Crow's Burning Edge.

1724
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Mafia III gets its Japanese release as well.

1725
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
This is all on the 27th, which is a pretty busy day.

1726
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Let's see, Just Dance 2017 out as well.

1727
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I'm sorry, that's not Japan specific.

1728
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That is other parts of Asia.

1729
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
But then we also have, let's see, Psycho, nope.

1730
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Sorry, that is also, I've got them all mixed up here.

1731
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Berserk Musou is the other one that is out in Japan this week on the 27th.

1732
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Heading on over to the Wii U.

1733
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Yep, still pretty quiet on the Wii U.

1734
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:40,000
There's no releases, so we might be just removing these until there's something really, really big coming out in Japan.

1735
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
But on the PlayStation Vita, still going.

1736
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Did you know World of Final Fantasy is out on the Vita in Japan?

1737
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
That is happening on the Vita in Japan.

1738
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That is also out on the 27th.

1739
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Neo Atlas 1469 also on the Vita.

1740
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Which, you know, just to backtrack a little bit, I think that kind of says a lot about this whole Switch thing.

1741
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,000
The fact that the Vita is still so big in Japan, I really think that Switch concept is going to go even further in Japan than it is here.

1742
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I really do.

1743
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
There's still tons of Vita games coming out here.

1744
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
It just seems like, but it seems like the portable life, especially.

1745
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I want to say this week, there was more Vita games coming out than there were 3DS games.

1746
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Interesting.

1747
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Alright, well, other Japanese releases this week on the Vita.

1748
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Neo Atlas 1469 and Saka Agari Hurricane Portable gets a limited edition.

1749
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Also, that same Sword Art Online Hollow Realization also comes out on the Vita this week.

1750
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
So, busy, busy week on the Vita.

1751
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
And lastly, just checking the Nintendo 3DS, where there are still some releases.

1752
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Just a few things.

1753
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
We have Sonic Tune Fire and Ice.

1754
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And then we have Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari SP.

1755
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:53,000
And Kamiwaza Wanda Kirikira Ichibangai Kipatsu comes out this week.

1756
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Those are the Japanese release dates.

1757
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
How about the UK, Loki?

1758
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC.

1759
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
World of Final Fantasy on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1760
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And Carnival Games VR on PC.

1761
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
And I would imagine PlayStation VR as well.

1762
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
It's kind of more abridged there.

1763
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Just responding to what I had said there about the Japanese perspective.

1764
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Mikuma JP in our chat from Japan lending that perspective over at live.vognetware.com saying,

1765
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I can see that sky, but too big to carry around.

1766
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
So, you know, the fact that it's going to be bigger than the 3DS.

1767
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So, people don't... Do men not have purses in Japan?

1768
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Because they have them here.

1769
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
They don't call them purses, of course, but they're man bags.

1770
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
They're messenger bags.

1771
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Thank you, messenger bags.

1772
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
The message I'm sending is that I'm a woman.

1773
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Yeah.

1774
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
But the over-the-shoulder bags and that.

1775
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
More men are carrying those.

1776
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
That is the thing.

1777
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Granted, you can take it with you, but it's not all that portable.

1778
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Really, the only advantage is that it has a screen attached to it.

1779
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
But, shit, I used to carry my systems around in a bag.

1780
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And if it had a screen attached to it, it would be basically the same thing they're doing right there.

1781
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Maya calls them merces.

1782
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Yes, I've heard that name too, but, you know, you can't go to a place like...

1783
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Who sells, like, fossil?

1784
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
You don't go there and ask for a mers.

1785
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
You ask for a handbag or a, you know, a carrying case or something like that.

1786
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Akuma JP says, yes, but we like to travel light.

1787
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Oh, that's fair. That's fair.

1788
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Kaijuto is saying, everyone has a backpack here.

1789
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So, no issue. That's true.

1790
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
A lot of people, if you don't use something that's over one shoulder, it's over both, like a backpack.

1791
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Or you carry it on one shoulder, and that's how you get light scoliosis like I had in high school.

1792
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1793
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Did we do the UK releases? Yes, we did, didn't we?

1794
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So, I think we're to the mailbag segment. How does that sound?

1795
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
We're gonna get to the mailbag.

1796
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Every week, you guys email us.

1797
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

1798
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
and we like to pull out your emails and read some of our favorites here on air.

1799
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Although, I believe this week, we didn't have anything because I looked earlier.

1800
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Yep, it is an empty mailbag. It's a desert. It's a wasteland.

1801
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
So, this is where I ask the listeners, why don't you love us?

1802
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Why don't you love us? Send an email. Tell us what you think about the Switch.

1803
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Come on, there's been a lot of stuff on that. Are you gonna get Red Dead 2?

1804
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
What about Diablo 4? Is it gonna be Diablo 4 or is it a Diablo 3 expansion?

1805
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I'd like to hear from some voice actors. I know we have a few of them listening.

1806
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
What do you think about all that strike business going on?

1807
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,000
And actdeaf says, we do, in response to loving us, we just don't like writing.

1808
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Twitter has ruined everybody.

1809
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You can say things in more than 140 characters. It's okay.

1810
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Alright, that's fine. No mail this week, so we will just table that till next time.

1811
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Next week will be the Halloween show, because Halloween is Monday, right?

1812
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,000
So, next week will be our Halloween show, so you can send us a scary, scary story.

1813
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Send us a scary story to read on air, but it has to involve video games.

1814
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
So, it has to be like that one time you broke your console or threw a Wiimote through your TV.

1815
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
That'll be fun.

1816
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Let's get to a few more stories, and then we'll get to your calls.

1817
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Loki.

1818
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
So, another page of this seems like a great idea for television.

1819
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Apparently, they are adapting Candy Crush, yes, Candy Crush, into an hour-long game show for CBS.

1820
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's gonna, they haven't really said when it's gonna premiere, but the format will consist of two teams of two.

1821
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
They'll be competing on an interactive game board.

1822
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:52,000
And, you know, we are huge fans of Candy Crush, and like so many others, we know the rush of advancing to the next level of the game.

1823
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:59,000
We're excited to work with Lionsgate and King to adapt one of the world's most popular and entertaining game franchises for television,

1824
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:06,000
to make it available to its massive, passionate fan base who can watch and play along at home.

1825
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Can't they use that hour to, like, put Big Brother over the top on TV, or the Star Trek series that they're doing on TV?

1826
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Do they have to give an hour to fucking Candy Crush, really?

1827
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
They've had weirder game show ideas.

1828
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:27,000
My favorite of the recent, you know, because I don't really watch live TV, but back when I, in fact, I got a cancel cable.

1829
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I've been meaning to cancel the cable portion.

1830
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,000
They give you, you know, a better deal if you buy cable and the internet versus just the internet.

1831
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And, like, I only use the internet, so I've said, well, if I can get cable and the internet, and it's still cheaper than what I'm paying for just internet, then sure, why not, let's do it.

1832
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
So I decided to watch some live TV when I first put it on.

1833
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Of course, then I unhooked my cable box, and I'm like, fuck this shit.

1834
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:56,000
But one of the shows that they had on there, and I'm not really sure what the premise of the show was, but it was, I think, people answering trivia questions or something like that.

1835
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And they had, like, valuables of theirs on a conveyor belt that would fall off a building and smash on the ground.

1836
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And I'm a big fan of dropping things onto the ground, so that show was kind of cool.

1837
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:16,000
But, yeah, Candy Crush, go fuck King, and seriously, CBS, fuck you guys for even giving them the light of day for that shit.

1838
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I still can't believe that whole thing where people would do the shapes with the wall.

1839
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
What the hell was that show called?

1840
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Oh, through the wall or something like that?

1841
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Yeah, that was, um, I don't, but see, like, once again, like, the Japanese game show was funny, whereas this, you know, show was stupid.

1842
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Like, when they bring it over to America, it's fucking lame.

1843
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I just don't understand why, like, they can't make the goofiness of that.

1844
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I mean, the closest thing we got was Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, which is basically just a goofy redub of, you know, Takashi's Castle.

1845
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
But, like, if they actually took it seriously, it would be stupid.

1846
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Now, here's the other thing I don't understand, okay? CBS, if I'm not mistaken, CBS, Viacom, same thing, right?

1847
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Viacom owns MTV, MTV owns Logo, so CBS could theoretically be airing RuPaul's Drag Race.

1848
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah, but then that would expose gays to the mainstream audience, and then we can't have that.

1849
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Okay, but Candy Crush, alright, look, in fact, we haven't done this in a very long time.

1850
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
You know what we need to do? We need to take a poll.

1851
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,000
We need to do a live poll right now here at The Voice of Geeks Network, VagaNetwork.com.

1852
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:38,000
We're gonna go and ask this poll, and, uh, it's up live over at Live.VagaNetwork.com.

1853
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,000
What would you rather watch on CBS?

1854
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:49,000
You can choose the first answer, Candy Crush, or you can choose the second answer, RuPaul's Drag Race.

1855
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Vote now.

1856
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
We'll get the listener's final answer in just a moment.

1857
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I vote C, actually, which is Silent Library, because that show is hilarious on MTV, and I'd rather watch that.

1858
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Have you ever seen that show?

1859
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I think I have.

1860
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,000
See, that show right there was the closest show that I could see that was, like, a Japanese game show.

1861
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It was basically, they had to be quiet in a library, and they would have a task that they would have to do that was ridiculous,

1862
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
or, like, painful, or just gross, that they would have to do while being quiet.

1863
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
That was the premise of the show. No one won anything, it's just silly.

1864
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And that's what that show, like, through the, uh, you know, whatever they called it in Japan, the one where you go through the wall,

1865
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
it was just a silly show.

1866
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
The whole point is that I can complete it, hooray for me.

1867
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
You know, it's not like, I'm gonna win money.

1868
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
It was just trying to beat it, just for the sake of beating it.

1869
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Alright, uh, we're gonna, we're asking that question again.

1870
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
This is your last chance to vote live.vognetwork.com.

1871
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
If you don't see the poll, I guess refresh the page.

1872
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
But people are voting, so I know the answers are coming in.

1873
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Uh, so check that out and you can vote live.

1874
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
We'll get to, uh, the, uh, the answer here in a minute.

1875
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And it's, it's, it is not unanimous, I'll put it that way, does that even surprise me?

1876
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
So, we'll get to that in a minute.

1877
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Which would you rather watch on CBS, Candy Crush or RuPaul's Drag Race?

1878
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Alright, uh, so, I'm sure a lot of you experienced this last week, but it did, uh, it did incorporate gaming into it.

1879
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:21,000
And that was the fact that there was a large DDoS attack, a very large DDoS attack, which of course is direct denial of service attacks.

1880
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And it did affect PlayStation Network.

1881
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Uh, and this was because PlayStation Network is a part of Dyne, D-Y-N, is that, am I saying that right?

1882
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
The, the name of the company on the East Coast that, that provides, uh, a lot of internet coverage to a lot of big websites.

1883
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:41,000
They got hit with a massive DDoS attack, which, I mean, this is so big that now apparently the Department of Homeland Security is involved.

1884
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:52,000
They're saying that it was something where, like, devices in your home, like a camera or a, I don't know, a, a baby monitor or some shit that has IP address.

1885
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Somehow they're getting malware on these devices and they were being used in the attack as well.

1886
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Um, the attacks have stopped, but it certainly made people stop for a minute. I mean, I was pissed off. I couldn't use Twitter for hours and hours.

1887
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I was a real, I didn't realize how fucking addicted to Twitter I was until that DDoS attack took down Twitter for a good chunk of the morning and most of the afternoon on Friday.

1888
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:18,000
But, uh, obviously gamers were affected as well. So, Loki, you're laughing over there. You laughing about the DDoS or what?

1889
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,000
I'm just, like, picturing, like, Twitter, or not Twitter, uh, malware in a printer or something like that.

1890
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Well, yeah, it's, I, whoa.

1891
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Baby monitor malware.

1892
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Well, it's, it's crazy to think, you know, if that stuff, uh, can be turned and used on, you know, other places, that's almost, you know, it's kind of scary, especially with how much our society relies on the internet.

1893
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:46,000
This is probably causing a lot of people to kind of stop and go, whoa, hopefully our government is kind of looking at that and going, well, not everything needs to be on the internet.

1894
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
So, um, yeah, we'll see. Anyway, uh, I have a feeling-

1895
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,000
We gotta, that's why we need to invade your computer to find those hackers and catch that 4chan.

1896
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Uh, I, I unfortunately don't think this is the last we're gonna see of it either. I think there's, uh, probably more to come from these attacks, so be ready for it.

1897
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I don't know, can, can they ever stop DDoS attacks?

1898
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I thought one way that they were doing it, like, you would see that cloud flare thing comes up and sometimes it asks for a, um, cause, like, that's what they did with the Pokemon Go.

1899
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Uh, they asked for all the CAPTCHA codes, right? Every time you ping the server, so it, like, slows it down tremendously.

1900
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I guess other sites can't do that?

1901
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:28,000
That's funny. I thought the whole slowing down tremendously was just a feature of Pokemon Go.

1902
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Oh, shut up. Uh, DungeonBuster in chat says, uh, over at Live.FogNetwork.com says, let's make everything internet smart from DVDs to toasters.

1903
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
But what about security? Who attacks toasters?

1904
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Uh, SSG100Matt says, I wonder if this is connected to those lizard squad kids getting charged for their attack on SOTY recently.

1905
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I don't think anyone's really claimed responsibility, have they? Or no, they did on Twitter, didn't they? But it was a different group, right?

1906
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Yeah, who knows, who knows. Anyway, I know what I give a shit about and that is our live poll.

1907
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
What would you rather watch on CBS? Candy Crush or RuPaul's Drag Race?

1908
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And the poll is at an end, and believe it or not, Candy Crush got 37% of the vote.

1909
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:18,000
So, Candy Crush with 37% of the vote, RuPaul's Drag, actually, uh, it's 37 and a half percent of the vote.

1910
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:24,000
RuPaul's Drag Race was 62 and a half percent of the vote, so that's almost, almost a 30 you would rather watch Candy Crush.

1911
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Well, you know what?

1912
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,000
That's a third less, you know, I hope I have for humanity.

1913
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I hope you're happy with that decision. Enjoy your crap television. Alright, that was just a silly fun poll.

1914
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I realize we haven't done a poll in a long, long time, so I'm glad we could do that there, so.

1915
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Part of listening live over at vognetwork.com. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you have for us?

1916
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Alright, so, this is pretty awesome. I'm waiting, you know, because it's only twice a year that we get to see this,

1917
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:02,000
but I usually watch it in the archives and everything, but they have the information on the Lineup for Awesome Games Stunt Quick 2017,

1918
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:08,000
and, uh, some of the games, you know, of course, it's gonna be running through January 18th through the 15th,

1919
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:15,000
and the schedule has been finalized. I haven't heard Flocko saying anything about the PT run,

1920
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,000
so I'm gonna assume that, unfortunately, he didn't quite make it in there.

1921
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I looked at the schedule, and it was not there, I'm sorry to say.

1922
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:29,000
That's unfortunate. But yeah, they have all the blocks so you can go check it out and everything.

1923
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I haven't quite gotten a chance to take a look and see if there's anything that really stood out.

1924
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:44,000
But I really, honestly, I just like watching all of it, because it's just fun watching, especially watching them play the games

1925
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
and talk about what they're doing to kind of, the different strats and everything for it.

1926
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
For sure.

1927
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:58,000
It's fascinating. That, I would rather watch on TV, versus their stupid Candy Crush Saga shit.

1928
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:07,000
And seriously, it's an hour long! I mean, goddamn, I mean, shit, just put two reruns of Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy on there instead.

1929
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I mean, that'd be better.

1930
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Next time I do a poll, I'll put that in there, but I really think if anything was gonna be 100 to 0,

1931
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
it would be awesome games done quick, versus Candy Crush. So, there you go.

1932
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the marathon, even if poor Flaco is still not in it.

1933
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
But keep trying, Flaco! He's gonna keep trying until he gets in. I know it. Don't give up. You can do it.

1934
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Hey, maybe this is a game we'll see speedrun in the future, because this is something way out of Nintendo's archives.

1935
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:41,000
This is a game that was for the Satellaview that was unearthed just recently.

1936
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:47,000
You know, this Satellaview, if you didn't already know, that was a Japanese-only peripheral that existed for the Famicom.

1937
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Super Famicom, excuse me, which was their version, of course, of the Super Nintendo.

1938
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,000
And it allowed you to basically download games through satellite, basically.

1939
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,000
One of the games that was released on it was called The Legend of Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets.

1940
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:10,000
That game was originally only broadcast in Japanese, but now there are language patches available in English, French, and German.

1941
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:16,000
You can check that out at BSZelda. That does not stand for what BS stands for, usually.

1942
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,000
But that was part of the name of the Satellaview.

1943
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
But BSZelda.zeldalegends.net. They have the file there, so you can check that out.

1944
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
English, French, and German patches.

1945
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I can't tell from the screenshots, was that a Super Nintendo game?

1946
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
It is a Super Nintendo game. It was Super Famicom originally, of course.

1947
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:37,000
But yeah, obviously the look and feel is very similar to Link to the Past.

1948
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
See, that's like, that kind of shit, I wish, like, you know how we see these remasters of different things?

1949
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Just like, do like, a, not necessarily remaster, but like, you know, kind of like,

1950
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Hey, it's Link to the Past and this, you know, on top of it.

1951
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Or just fucking put this out on Virtual Console.

1952
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Obviously, there's people out there that want it.

1953
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
And this has a whole, there's a timer on it.

1954
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Like, you know, even though it's very clearly like a Link to the Past, there's a timer on it.

1955
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:05,000
You know, so there's like, speed, ironically enough, speed running that's happening in this.

1956
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:10,000
So, anyway, originally the game was broadcast in four one-hour chunks.

1957
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
And yeah, it was broadcast at a specific time, once a week, and you could only access that game at that time.

1958
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
So, that's, wow.

1959
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
And the broadcast was streamed audio that had voice acting and orchestrated music.

1960
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Yeah, very, very weird technology at the time.

1961
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
So now, anyway, it's available and you can check that out if you want.

1962
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,000
There it is. There's also YouTubes out there, of course, if you want to see a little bit more on that.

1963
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I think that's cool, though, that something was unearthed after all this time.

1964
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
And that was some neat technology at the time.

1965
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I think the closest thing we had to it was the Sega Channel.

1966
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Which obviously was not a Nintendo thing, but it was, you know.

1967
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Something else I saw that was unearthed was, I guess, a ROM for the SNES version of Rayman.

1968
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I did see that. Yeah, I missed putting that on a show this week.

1969
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
But yeah, there was a Super Nintendo Rayman, apparently, that was unearthed this week.

1970
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
And apparently ran at 60 frames per second and it was pretty awesome.

1971
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
That's awesome.

1972
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing some of that as well.

1973
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Cool. Well, I think it's time for us to take your calls.

1974
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
So, if you'd like to give us a call, you can right now on Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1975
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1976
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,000
The Skype line is open for your calls right now and it's already lighting up.

1977
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
My gosh, people were just waiting to get in here tonight.

1978
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Let's do it.

1979
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1980
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture.

1981
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Hello, Brad, my friend. How are you?

1982
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Oh, peachy keen, just a little tired from setting this new thing up.

1983
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Oh, yeah, you're in the midst of a studio renovation, right?

1984
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Yeah, we'll move. Yeah, yeah.

1985
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Oh, wow. I hope we can do something similar here at OLR, maybe.

1986
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I think it might finally be time to replace the computer.

1987
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,000
As much as I've dragged my feet on that, it's probably time.

1988
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Oh, God, how many years has that been now?

1989
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
A while. Here's the thing. Here's the thing.

1990
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Christmas and New Year's Day are on Sundays this year, or this coming year, whatever you want to say.

1991
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
So I have a feeling it's going to kind of force us to take a little break from OLR.

1992
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Granted, we could do some pre-recorded stuff, but I think our audience would forgive us if we took a nice big break for the holidays.

1993
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Oh, take a break for the holidays, for God's sake.

1994
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Yeah, exactly. And so I think that might be the time we kind of do some.

1995
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Now, obviously, I rent this house, so we can't do anything crazy like painting the walls like you're doing,

1996
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:30,000
but I think that might be a good time for us to take a break and do some of those upgrades and changes.

1997
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I just had to make the first call from the new studio to you guys.

1998
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Oh, fuck. SSJ. Sorry, excuse me, Brad. SSJ 100 Matt brings up a good point.

1999
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,000
MAGFest is the week right after New Year's. We may end up being gone for a month.

2000
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I don't know, guys. I don't know. Would OLR people be pissed if we were gone for a month? I don't know.

2001
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Not this one. I mean, you guys need a break.

2002
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I appreciate that. We'll see. I don't know what's going to happen. Maybe we can look at doing something pre-recorded.

2003
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I don't know. We have to get through episode 666 first, and then we'll talk about what's going to happen come the holidays and MAGFest and all that other stuff.

2004
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
But anyway, Brad.

2005
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I did have to call with the game though. Have you played PolitiCats?

2006
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I haven't played PolitiCats yet. I've just had a million other things going on.

2007
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
But I know you've been telling me about this. Tell the listeners about this.

2008
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Oh my God. You're this cat, and you run for various offices. You start from town clerk.

2009
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:32,000
You can work your way up through district attorney and mayor. You eventually get harder and harder, but I assume you can move up.

2010
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:38,000
And now they've added leaderboards, and there's a 24-hour running game.

2011
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:47,000
If you're in such-and-such a tier, you get little bonuses at the end of that 24 hours. And now they've done a Halloween update.

2012
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,000
And what's in the Halloween update?

2013
02:10:50,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Oh, it's all cosmetic stuff, but there's little witches costumes you can unlock, and the graphics are cobwebs and just goofy Halloween-themed type stuff.

2014
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But it's a fun little clicker game.

2015
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Alright, I'm going to have to check that out at some point. You know I love my clickers. And I think I finally ran out of steam on a non-stop night.

2016
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I think I finally kind of stopped playing that and checking on it as much as I was, but for a clicker game that was a lot of fun.

2017
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
And that was something you recommended, so I don't see why I won't check out PolitiCats.

2018
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Now one of my buddies on Twitter, I will say this, speaking of cats, recommended an app today that's called, what is this, Weather Kitty.

2019
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:35,000
And all it is, it's like a replacement for your weather app, which there's like 5 billion weather apps on the phone, I know, not that exciting.

2020
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:44,000
But it replaces it with what is going on with the weather, and a picture of a cat that matches the weather.

2021
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Oh, this is so adorable, the picture changed. So it's saying right now it's 63 degrees in Sacramento, and there's a little cat sleeping at a night, like a little night city, which obviously isn't Sacramento, but a little night cityscape there. Isn't that adorable, Loki?

2022
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Yes.

2023
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I will have to check this out.

2024
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
There you go.

2025
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
As long as it's more accurate than AccuWeather, then yeah.

2026
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Well, that's not hard to beat sometimes.

2027
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:14,000
My favorite is when I check one of those weather apps, and it's like, it's partially cloudy, and all this, and I look outside, it's fucking raining.

2028
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,000
It's raining right now, and it's like clear and sunny, and it's like, no it's not.

2029
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Although, technically, different parts of the city can see rain versus, but anyway, I won't get into that level of it.

2030
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Oh, for like three weeks after DragonCon, I was still getting Atlanta reports.

2031
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I don't care anymore.

2032
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Yeah, my weather app has, or the one I was using before it, I think Weather Channel or something, before I was using the cats,

2033
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I think had Atlanta as one of the cities in it, just because I know I go there at least once a year.

2034
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:49,000
That was in there. L.A. is in there, because I was going there a lot. Yeah, road trips, fun.

2035
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
But games, take some more calls, get back to games.

2036
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
I will, I will.

2037
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,000
But political, oh my god, the Halloween thing is just too much.

2038
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,000
But Brad, there's no better time to play a game than when you're on an airplane waiting to go to another city.

2039
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Do you know how much Dragon Quest VII I played while I was traveling?

2040
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Hopefully not on a Note 7.

2041
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:12,000
No, not on a, no, Dragon Quest VII was on 3DS, so we were fine.

2042
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Alright, I'll catch you guys later.

2043
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Alright, take care my friend.

2044
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Peace.

2045
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Bye.

2046
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2047
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
We have another call coming in, let's get to it.

2048
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2049
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Hey, this is Raging Eater.

2050
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Hello my friend, how are you?

2051
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I'm pretty good, how about yourself?

2052
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I'm alright, I'm alright.

2053
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
What's up, what's on your mind tonight?

2054
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Well, one question, and before I get to it, a few minutes ago you were talking about the Satellaview and whatnot.

2055
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Yeah.

2056
02:13:48,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Well, aside from the Sega Channel, which I definitely remember hearing about, if memory serves, there was something else that came out right around the same time.

2057
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:07,000
It came out for both Super Nintendo and the Genesis, if I remember right.

2058
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I think it was called, what, X-Band or something like that?

2059
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Yes, yes, there was that thing as well.

2060
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
You're right, there was X-Band, I think it was kind of a similar thing as well.

2061
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Yep.

2062
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Yeah, I honestly don't remember much about it.

2063
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:38,000
The only thing I kind of sort of recall is that there were kind of rudimentary lobbies, a little bit of a chat, I think, and of course obviously you could play your games online.

2064
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I never got a chance to try it myself because my parents wouldn't allow us, but the technology was there though.

2065
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Alright, good to know, good to know. So what was the question you had tonight?

2066
02:14:53,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Well, obviously the two of you, I wouldn't necessarily see everyone in chat, but the vast majority of the people that were in chat are at least to some degree or another into PC gaming.

2067
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:22,000
To what extent, that's up to the individual, but at least some people like to play PC games.

2068
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:38,000
My question is for the two of you and of course for chat, what were the games or games that got you into PC gaming and why?

2069
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Great question. What were the games that got you into PC gaming and why? I'll start while Loki thinks about that.

2070
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Well, see, my story was a little different because I was kind of enabled by the Commodore 64, which was prior to PCs, but that was still a home computer, so it was a PC of sorts, but not an actual PC, if that makes sense.

2071
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:14,000
So Commodore 64 was really kind of what enabled me with games, I think even before Nintendo Entertainment System, because sure, I had an Atari 2600, but I probably spent more time on the Commodore 64, because the complexity of the games you could do on the Commodore 64 was even more so.

2072
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:21,000
And especially the music, the sound chip in the Commodore 64 was divine, and you had some great music in there.

2073
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:36,000
So yeah, I think that was really the gateway that then took me into PC games, but the earliest PC games I remember playing were a lot of the old Sierra stuff, like King's Quest IV and those sorts of point and click adventure games.

2074
02:16:36,000 --> 02:17:02,000
The original Civilization was huge for me. But you know what really sold me on PC, like way back when and something I was really into Rage Nator? It wasn't even so much the games as it was, and I know we've joked about this on the show before, but it was Prodigy, was what really sold me on like, we need a PC in this house, you know, I'm like 12 years old trying to convince my parents, we really need a PC in this house, because Prodigy allowed me to be online and like talk to people.

2075
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:15,000
And as somebody who was, believe it or not, a little bit shocked sometimes, because I got picked on a lot in school, I kind of was drawn early to the fact that I could kind of, you know, post on these bulletin boards online.

2076
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:24,000
And then I got into the whole BBS thing, which is a whole other story, but I didn't really find out about that until well after, I think I found out about those on Prodigy.

2077
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Or maybe it was my dad, actually my dad, there used to be like a newspaper they published here locally, and like the last page of the paper had all the numbers to the BBS's, so I think my dad used to always kind of collect those and tell me I should be participating in them, but not to call long distance or my mother would lose her mind, which is all true.

2078
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:54,000
But anyway, so yeah, I guess that's kind of my answer. I don't know if there's really one game I can put my finger on and say this is the reason I needed a PC, but these were all things that really made me a PC gamer. What about you, Loki?

2079
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Shareware, that kind of got me into it. But like first PC was just basically, it was kind of a gift from somebody, like they didn't want their old PC, so I had like SimCity on that.

2080
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:23,000
But you know, like purchasing games, a lot of that was driven by shareware, and playing a lot of the shareware demos back then were like pretty substantial, and you know Castle Wolfenstein, that's just one whole campaign, I mean that's quite a lot of game.

2081
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:36,000
So it was kind of that, and then you know, like BBS's and stuff, and then finally once the internet came around and you know, doing all that. But yeah, it definitely was driven by just playing shareware games.

2082
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:42,000
And what was some of your favorite, I loved the shareware games too, like Commander Keen, that shit was off the hook.

2083
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
ZZT, long live!

2084
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Yeah, ZZT was awesome. You know, and also like PC Gamer Magazine, you know a lot of the demos and stuff when they're in there.

2085
02:18:52,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So, you know, I didn't have that powerful of a PC at the time, it had 4 megs of RAM, but it was, you know, back then you had to do all sorts of crazy shit to your, you know, different config sys and auto execute bat files to get stuff to run to allocate memory correctly.

2086
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:18,000
And all that bullshit that you had to go through, so getting Doom to run, you know, just wouldn't really run on what I had.

2087
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:32,000
But you know, Wolfenstein was fun, eventually when I got my own PC, you know, Duke Nukem 3D, I don't know, it was just a lot of, mostly I played console games, but you know, I did a lot of stuff on PC.

2088
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Command Conquer, Red Alert.

2089
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Ragenator, what about you real quick? And your kiddies, by the way, which of course you see on the cam there. What about you, Ragenator, before we let you go?

2090
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Well, it's kind of a complicated answer. The short version is it's, well, twofold. Everyone knows the BS I had to deal with with my consoles back in 2012.

2091
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
That's one reason why I got into PC gaming.

2092
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:13,000
And of course, you know, one thing that you always harped on for the longest time is Steam sales, Steam sales, Steam sales, you know.

2093
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Now, in cheap games, you know, and plus, you know, not only that, but I always heard about, you know, games being better on PC, be it like Duke Nukem 3D or the Doom series or the Quake series.

2094
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Plus, certain games like Diablo 2 never came to console, so I kind of figured, what the hell, if I'm going to have to choose between getting a PC versus getting a console,

2095
02:20:44,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I might as well go with PC. I'll probably save money in the process, long run, and get to play superior versions of whatever game. Plus, I'll get to play games like Diablo 2. So, so far I've been loving it.

2096
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in another call here before we call it a night, but thank you as always for your question.

2097
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Sure. Have a nice night.

2098
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:21,000
You too. And pet those kitties that were in the background there. Let's get to another call. Wow, our phone is, like, ringing off the hook tonight. Hi, you're on Orangeworm's radio. Who's this?

2099
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Hey, what's going on, everybody? It's Ranma.

2100
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Hey, Ranma. What's up, buddy?

2101
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Oh, not a lot, not a lot, but we need to put on another pot of coffee right now.

2102
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Uh-oh. What's up?

2103
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Switch.

2104
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Oh, the Nintendo Switch. What do you want to say about it?

2105
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Where do I start?

2106
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I don't know. What were your thoughts? We'll start with, what was your reaction to the trailer?

2107
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:58,000
The Nintendo Switch is going to be an overpriced piece of junk powered by a customized, underpowered processor.

2108
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Ouch. So, you're not a fan.

2109
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
No, I am not.

2110
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:11,000
What about the games, though, Ranma? I mean, if they have the must-have games on it, isn't the rest of it not going to matter?

2111
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:20,000
In a way, I say the same thing about the Wii U. Yes, the Wii U is $2.99. There are at least ten games on it that I want.

2112
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:29,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, $2.99. There's at least three games on each of those consoles that I want.

2113
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:37,000
The only difference is, I'd sooner gyrate towards those, because it's technologically a lot more powerful, and I know it can do something with it, you know?

2114
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Whereas the Wii U, yes, has great games, but it's sitting in the corner eating paste.

2115
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:45,000
So, the Nintendo Switch really has to come out for the right price.

2116
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Yes, and I already said it. If the Switch doesn't drop at $200, I'm not buying it. Simple as that.

2117
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:57,000
I think, though, Ranma, $1.99 could be a realistic price for the Switch.

2118
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:03,000
No, I don't think so. $2.50 at least. If not more, I would say $2.99, probably.

2119
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I think it really depends. I think the big question mark is the dock. For me, it's the dock.

2120
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:13,000
The dock has no tech in it. I don't think it has anything in it.

2121
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Well, that's what it comes down to. If the dock is doing anything, then it's going to cost more.

2122
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:26,000
If the dock is doing nothing except being a pass-through for the TV, then it will cost less, I think.

2123
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,000
All I can see from the dock, it's a pass-through with two USBs.

2124
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Now, my thought was, okay, when you put it in the dock, the dock has more memory, better chipset, and all this other stuff.

2125
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And I think that's awesome because right now Alienware has something similar.

2126
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:49,000
If you buy this high-end laptop, they have a special docking bay where you connect your laptop to it,

2127
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:54,000
and there is a much more powerful video card in it and other stuff, and you can really do some serious gaming.

2128
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
But from what I've been told, it's just a pass-through. That's all it is.

2129
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Interesting. I could see $249, Brad from Pod Culture says $249 with a pack-in game. I could see that as well.

2130
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:14,000
$249 with a pack-in game? No, I still won't. Because when it goes to price point, let me tell you something.

2131
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I just started this side project, and I had to pick up a low-end tablet.

2132
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:28,000
So I went out and bought a low-end Windows 10 tablet that doubles as a laptop, more of a tablet,

2133
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:39,000
and I paid about $130 for it. This thing has 2GB of RAM, 64GB of memory, video quality resolution is average by best.

2134
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:45,000
What I see on this, it's not even close to the Switch. Now, they're pushing $41.

2135
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:54,000
They put it up 1920x1080p, that's what they want. This thing's going to have at least 4GB of memory to run the OS,

2136
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,000
to run the applications, to run the games. Storage? No.

2137
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I really see, in order for Nintendo to really make this shine, they've got to take one hell of a loss on each one sold.

2138
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Which Nintendo usually doesn't do.

2139
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Right. The only time they've done that is when the 3DS first came out. Yes, they were making money off of it,

2140
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:22,000
but then they had to cut the price down to take a loss, now they're making a profit. Same thing with the Wii U, you know?

2141
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Act F does confirm the dock will be included. Nintendo Japan already confirmed it.

2142
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:34,000
So we had theorized one of our many Wheel of Plausibility scenarios that the dock and the thing could be sold separately,

2143
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
but I think that's back when we thought it was two separate systems in one ecosystem,

2144
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:47,000
and I think that talk kind of started to die down when the rumors about it being a Switch basically started to pick up.

2145
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:55,000
But anyway, the good news is, at least we know. This is what I wish Nintendo would have done a month ago,

2146
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:01,000
but is it going to change the fact that I'll be there pre-ordering the system to pick up in March? No.

2147
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,000
They can do whatever they want, I suppose, but sometimes I just kind of look at it and go,

2148
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:11,000
why are you doing this to me, Nintendo? But you know what? If they sell a ton of them, it doesn't really matter what I think.

2149
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
If they sell a ton of them, yeah. Because honestly, I'm not getting one, because you know what?

2150
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I already carry around my work tablet. I already carry around my side tablet. I also carry around my 3DS.

2151
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I also carry around my phone. There is no room in my bag for another gaming tablet, and whoever buys it,

2152
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:38,000
you better hope and pray that it doesn't get damaged, because the way I see a tablet, that's a one-hole cohesive unit.

2153
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Sometimes that screen, that whole thing is getting replaced.

2154
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Yeah. I need to see more games, and I guess I'll be waiting until January.

2155
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I mean, I'm pretty confident just being the gaming nerd I am. I'm going to get one.

2156
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
But I really, really want to see the games to get me more excited about it.

2157
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Look, when you get one, me, Loki, Matt, Acta, we're going to redo that whole Genesis commercial when Matt got a Genesis.

2158
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:07,000
We're going to redo that whole thing. We're going to knock on the door and be like,

2159
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I heard Sky got a Switch, and we're going to redo that whole commercial. That's what we're going to do.

2160
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Well, you know what? The hands-on experience sold Loki a PlayStation VR, so anything is possible. Anything is possible.

2161
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go to try to fish for one more call before we wrap up, but thanks for the call.

2162
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Hey, no problem, dude.

2163
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session or else.

2164
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Oh, yeah. Rob, one more thing.

2165
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
What?

2166
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Take the vacation. Anime Jam Session does it every year. Take the vacation. You earned it. You all deserve it.

2167
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,000
If anyone has a problem with it, send them to me. I'll set them straight.

2168
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I appreciate that deeply. I just have a feeling the podcaster in me is not going to let us go three weeks with no content,

2169
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:51,000
but inevitably we'll have to probably go three weeks with no live content. I just don't see how we get around that,

2170
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
unless we do a show New Year's Day, which is possible. Anything is possible. We'll see.

2171
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
It's too early for me to think about, so guys, please don't take anything I'm saying.

2172
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:07,000
There's a lot of stuff going through my head when it comes to this show, and a lot of decisions are made very knee-jerk sometimes,

2173
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
so we'll talk in December.

2174
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Rob, I'll tell you this. At MAGFest, if you're getting that mindset, I'm dragging you to the bar, and I'm shoving shots down your throat.

2175
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Can we do that anyway?

2176
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Yes.

2177
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,000
All right, sounds good. All right, take care, my friend.

2178
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Later.

2179
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
All right, bye.

2180
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:30,000
All right, we'll see if we can squeeze in one more call. 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2181
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Loki, any last minute stories to share with us? I feel like there's a lot we didn't really get around to tonight.

2182
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:40,000
There's some information. It's rumored that there's going to be a new Brothers in Arms game that's in work,

2183
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:45,000
and a new Far Cry Blood Dragon because they were spotted on that SAG-AFTRA list.

2184
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Oh, okay. Even though a lot of the SAG-AFTRA lists used codenames. There's a lot of codenames.

2185
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,000
A lot of codenames, yeah, but those apparently weren't.

2186
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Gotcha. Anything else to share?

2187
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,000
No. That's about it.

2188
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Well, things are pretty quiet on the Skype side, so I think we will close it down and close up shop for the night.

2189
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:14,000
We've had a lot of shorter shows recently. I don't know if that's because Jamie not being here and not having that third opinion is shortening things down or what's going on.

2190
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,000
If we just have less to say or if there's less gaming news, I don't know, but that's that.

2191
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:26,000
We're going to wrap things up tonight, but we will be back to do it again in seven days, a Halloween episode, so we'll talk about scary games a little bit.

2192
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I don't have an interview booked yet, but I'm going to try to see if I can't get something for next week, especially if this voice actor thing continues another week.

2193
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I think I would really love to hear, but I also kind of want to be able to cover both sides without starting an argument, so I want to be able to kind of do that respectfully.

2194
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:48,000
But I want to see if we can't do something like that next week, but who knows? Stay tuned.

2195
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Obviously, at the same time, I don't want to cover it because I want it to be resolved on Monday or Tuesday.

2196
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,000
That's what I would really like to happen, but we'll see. Anyhow, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2197
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Thank you so much for listening to our show, and thank you for downloading it and listening to it live.

2198
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Please consider telling a friend about the show. Spread the word, because Orange Launch Radio is the show where every gamer has a voice, but not if we don't have them here.

2199
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:21,000
So tell a friend about the show and spread the word. A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes and all that stuff goes an awful long way as well.

2200
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Loki, shoot, any final thoughts tonight?

2201
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I don't know. I guess I'll try to work on my game this week. I say that every week and it doesn't end up happening, so I'll try again.

2202
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Well, I need to get around to getting Dragon Quest Builders, because I bought that game because I like the demo so much.

2203
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:50,000
This is my final thought. I like the game so much, or I like the demo so much, I bought the game, even though I bought it with the slow shipping so I could get the extra credit on it.

2204
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Because I knew I'd be in Vegas, I wasn't in a hurry to play it. But boy, I really am not in a rush to play it, because it's still sitting there waiting for me to play. I just haven't gotten around to it.

2205
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Maybe tonight. We'll see, now that I have 20 extra minutes than I usually have. We'll see.

2206
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Anyway, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. We will see you in seven days to do it all over again. Have a great week everybody, happy gaming, and take care.

2207
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:28,000
If you'd like to join us for a live show, tune into fognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.

See you next week.

2210
02:31:50,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Music.
