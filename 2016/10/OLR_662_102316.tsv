0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, you'd probably expect me to talk about the Nintendo Switch, but your hosts will do that for more than 13 seconds. What you may not have heard is the ongoing labored strike by Union voice actors. My time is up for now, but stay tuned for this and plenty more news right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	52000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight, episode number 662 for this, October 23rd, 2016. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California. And with me, as always, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
52000	53000	Hello.
53000	54000	Hi, Loki.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	63000	So, Steve, I overheard you say a phrase I don't hear you say very often while you were eating dinner before the show, and that was, this might be too much bacon. Is that true?
63000	75000	Well, it's not. You can have too much bad bacon. Like, the bacon is just kind of, eh. You know, it's fast food bacon that's just kind of, you know, it should be bacon.
75000	78000	Or the bacon they used to have in my college dorms. It's disgusting.
78000	91000	If it's bacon that they, like, deep fry or they crisp up to the point where it's, like, snapping, you can never have too much of that. Or if it's salty. But fast food bacon that's basically been cooked in the morning, sitting there all day long, you can have too much of that.
91000	102000	Alright, well, look, we could talk about bacon for a while, but there's a lot going on tonight. We have a very busy show tonight. Very excited to welcome. I know a lot of our longtime listeners have been looking forward to this.
102000	116000	One of the creators, or I believe the creator, of Cat President is here tonight. Not to be confused with President Cat, but we'll talk about that in about 30 minutes with Paul from O'Iraq Studios.
116000	126000	And some other, I believe there's another game he's about ready to release, so we'll talk all about that, as well as Cats and why they would make great presidents and so forth. We will get into that a little later.
126000	144000	However, up first, I'm sure the folks listening this week are dying to know. So, what does Loki think of the Nintendo Switch? And in case, for some reason, you only get your gaming news from OLR, which I would find hard to believe, but thank you if that's the case, Nintendo did unveil the NX this week.
144000	157000	So, the NX is no more. It is now the Nintendo Switch, and that's the name. And there was a three and a half minute trailer that we got with not even a day's lead time, what they announced Thursday night that they would be posting it Friday morning.
157000	171000	And it was very similar in nature to the Wii U trailer that they showed at E3 years and years ago, where it was actors using the device as Nintendo envisions this to be embraced by the world.
171000	177000	So, Nintendo Switch. Loki. First off, Loki, what about the name? What do you think of the name Nintendo Switch?
177000	182000	It's not Wii or Wii U, so they've got points right there.
182000	184000	That's a good thing, right?
184000	188000	It's not stupid. There you go. It's not a stupid name.
188000	190000	I like the name. I do.
190000	191000	I think it's fine.
191000	195000	It doesn't scream console to me, but certainly neither does Wii.
195000	197000	It doesn't scream what the hell?
197000	198000	Yeah.
198000	199000	What's a Wii?
199000	208000	I'm surprised they maybe didn't do Game Switch, but maybe that's too close to some... There's probably a company out there already called that. But anyway, that's alright.
208000	212000	I'm fine with the name Nintendo Switch, and I like that the logo is very different.
212000	221000	One of the biggest things you notice that they're quote unquote fixing right off the top is they are separating this from the Wii and the Wii U.
221000	237000	Visually, with the name, very big difference, which is interesting considering the fact that in some ways I kind of feel that the Nintendo Switch is what a lot of people thought the Wii U could have been or should have been.
237000	242000	Maybe that the technology wasn't quite ready for, but the fact that the gamepad should go with you anywhere.
242000	249000	But regardless, a lot of the rumors that we've talked about here previously on the show turn out to be true.
249000	257000	Not all of them, certainly, because there was the whole fuckery of a touchpad with no controllers on it, although...
257000	265000	Or was it the one that was the concept where the controller was the touchpad? Like, you'd have the actual buttons and the image would be underneath, which is stupid.
265000	276000	So that's all out the window. And I was going to say, although, to be fair, since those controllers come off the touchpad, I suppose you could have where it's just the touchpad, although I don't know what game to play.
276000	279000	Well, technically we don't know that it's a touchpad yet.
279000	281000	True, true. We don't know that it's a touchpad yet.
281000	283000	Although it would be stupid not to do that.
283000	288000	I would be very surprised if it wasn't. I guess the question would be, how expensive is it to be a touchpad?
288000	289000	Not much, I don't know.
289000	298000	Yeah, in this day and age that technology is very cheap. Anyway, Loki, I'm sure you watched the trailer, 7am Friday morning like a lot of us did. What did you think?
298000	311000	I thought it was alright. I mean, it's just, I'm not, like, I was expecting a little bit more, I don't know, like, with the Wii and stuff it was more of like a wow factor because it was a different way to play your games.
311000	326000	I think taking my system somewhere and playing a game is not necessarily that big a deal to me because I used to do that, shit, I did that when I was in high school with the PlayStation 1 and I've, you know, did it with previous systems before.
326000	337000	So it's not, I mean, it's neat that you can take the controller, I guess, with you and it doesn't seem to stop your game, but I don't know.
337000	350000	I do like the fact that theoretically it's powerful enough to run games like Skyrim and stuff so hopefully that means that we'll have some third party games on there or even, you know, something better quality.
350000	354000	I mean, because that was a really hurting point for the Wii U.
355000	365000	Well, Nintendo did come out with a slide, I don't know if it's from their press site or where, but it's floating around the internet there that shows all these company logos and it's, look at who we're partnering with for the Switch.
365000	379000	And I don't know, I kind of take that with a grain of salt, not that I'm trying to be negative when it comes to Nintendo. I am excited about the Switch, I look forward to it, but I just kind of help, can't help but feel like we saw a slide like this with the Wii U
379000	390000	and, you know, EA's logo was up there, EA even got on stage with them at E3 and talked about how frickin' great the Wii U was and then what did EA do, put out two games and then dropped it?
390000	391000	Yes, I remember the...
391000	393000	Like, I just...
393000	407000	Yeah, it was even worse than 3DS because they didn't just have game, they didn't have game company names, they had game names on there like Saints Row and DJ Hero and that shit never fuckin' happened, so I was a little bit disappointed there.
407000	426000	But, I mean, it looks nice as like a portable system, I guess, but it's so huge as it's not really good for a portable system and then the other thing you have to factor in too, it's not like your tablet or your phone because where's the internet?
426000	434000	You have to be on Wi-Fi to use that shit and so all these dreams of people saying, oh, portable Splatoon, no, not unless you're tethered to something.
434000	449000	Well, I mean, to be fair, a lot of that depends on how much online Nintendo's gonna embrace with this. If Nintendo is doing Wi-Fi, which would make an awful lot of sense, the 3DS does it and so many places have Wi-Fi now like Starbucks, etc.
449000	472000	McDonald's, they were doing some giveaway there, so so many places have Wi-Fi now I could see that and we know that, hell, even back to what the Game Boy Advance could do same room multiplayer through the infrared, which I'm sure is all now Bluetooth technology, I'm not worried about multiplayer in the same room by any means for sure with the Switch and I would think Wi-Fi is a given for the internet.
473000	477000	Look at, I mean, look at the Vita and the 3G on the Vita, that went nowhere.
477000	478000	No, it didn't go anywhere.
478000	488000	I don't see Nintendo really selling cellular, just getting their hands on that. I think they'll probably do Wi-Fi like they do on DS and that'll be fine. I kind of think that's gonna be it.
488000	499000	But the thing, like, the other thing about that too is like what they were showing in the video where there's people, you know, split basically taking the two joy cons and two sides of the controllers and using them to play multiplayer games on a tiny screen.
500000	517000	It just doesn't seem like that's something you're gonna be doing a lot of because that screen is fucking tiny and you're playing it. It's just like that's about as feasible as, oh, hey, did you know that there's sensors built into the Wii U tablet screen that you can use your motion controllers with it to play motion games on that screen?
517000	524000	Did anyone fucking do that? No, they didn't because it's stupid because that screen is so small, it just is not gonna work very well.
526000	531000	I just, I don't see the point. I mean, I guess in that one scenario where they're showing, oh, it's in a car.
531000	543000	It is for the Wii games that they're gonna sell on Virtual Console, trust. The Wii U, the Wii U gamepad has like that same thing in it and that's like the only time I've seen it used is you can optionally use that as your infrared box.
543000	555000	Right, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't make any sense. That's what I'm saying is the screen's so small, it doesn't make sense to do like split screen gaming on it because you're splitting a section screen two ways. That's just dumb.
557000	565000	I don't know. I mean, it didn't really show us much yet other than it doesn't have a stupid name. It looks like the hardware is more powerful.
566000	575000	That's all we really know about it and that there's potentially a Mario game, maybe Skyrim, although Bethesda's like, oh, we're not confirming that Skyrim's gonna be on it.
575000	584000	Which reminds me of, oh, hey, Minecraft on the fucking, what was that, the OUYA. Yeah, Minecraft on the OUYA. You know, it's all over again.
585000	596000	It's just, I don't know. I'm not impressed, but I'm not like disappointed, I guess. I have no expectations of it really.
596000	605000	Do you think the rumors from beforehand that we had that, you know, kind of ended up being plausibly correct, do you think that that all kind of played into it?
605000	612000	Because I know for me, it was like when I saw the trailer, I was like, oh, okay, cool. So they're running with that idea that everybody's been already talking about for a while now.
612000	623000	So it was kind of, in a way, I kind of felt the reveal was anti-climatic in that regard, although, you know, the little bones tossed of a potential Skyrim on this thing, although we don't really know.
623000	634000	I just don't, to me, it's just, it seems like it's a console that you can take with you, cool. I don't see the innovation there aside from it's convenient to take it with me, if I was going to take it with me.
634000	645000	But as far as gameplay-wise, it's basically doing the same shit that fucking Sony and Microsoft are doing. As far as gameplay, I mean, there's no indication of motion controls on there at all.
645000	652000	It's like they've gotten rid of that whole thing. There's no indication of a touchpad yet, although it'd be crazy for them not to do that, but it's not a guarantee.
653000	665000	So it's just, to me, as the way I described it, it's safe. They're playing it safe. And that's fine, they can do that, but, like, I think we're just looking for, like, to be this impressed, like, the Wii was, like, holy crap.
665000	673000	You know, that's, can you imagine, you know, playing games this way, or like in the 3DS, wow, 3D without glasses, that's going to be crazy impressive.
673000	680000	And all that kind of fell flat, and now it's just like, eh, we're just not really going to try to impress you. It's the system you can take with you.
680000	682000	So it needs the games to really justify it.
682000	688000	It needs the games, and it also needs the price point that makes sense, because they're going to fuck people on the price point, and have a feeling that's going to happen.
688000	698000	I want to make sure we get some of our chatters into, very important, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geese Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
698000	709000	And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat, live.vognetwork.com, where we have some comments such as Dark Tetsuya mentioning the fact that the switch is a one-syllable word, saying,
709000	714000	I think they were just trying to keep it simple and easy to remember. It's one syllable like we was.
714000	725000	So, you know, switch is a very, you know, just a simple word. I can kind of see that perspective, that maybe they didn't want to come up with a complicated name, so they kept it very simple, that makes sense.
725000	731000	Let's see, Stellarose412 in chat says, there are a fuck ton of third-party partners, super excited.
731000	742000	And yeah, despite what I said about, you know, the Wii U thing and where I said, I don't want to get my hopes up, at the same time, Nintendo is very, very, very strong in the portable market.
742000	749000	And if they've leveraged a lot of that from their portable market to the switch, then that's really only going to be a good thing.
749000	755000	I mean, Square Enix, as an example, puts out some pretty cool games on 3DS that you really can't get anywhere else.
755000	763000	Right. And that makes sense why they would want a touchscreen on there. And also, it solves the problem, well, there's not a lot of content on the Wii U.
763000	768000	Well, now we just have the same content that's from both into one platform, basically.
768000	776000	I don't know how I feel about the Wii U. What did you think about the whole fact that it looks like they're doing Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon for Wii U?
776000	783000	Although, just, you know, before people call it out, yes, we had King Boo driving a kart in Mario Kart.
783000	787000	That could be DLC. That could simply be DLC for, you know, later on.
787000	788000	Same thing with Splatoon.
788000	794000	Same thing with Splatoon. That's basically DLC. Is that worth it for purchasing the game all over again? No?
794000	800000	Well, but the argument would be a lot of people didn't purchase it in the first place, because the Wii U didn't move as much as Nintendo wanted it to.
800000	803000	That's fine if they want to make that argument. But here's my problem also, though.
803000	805000	And Vanetta 2 should be there.
805000	811000	Okay, here's my problem, though, with it, is I purchased all my games digitally.
811000	816000	Are you gonna tell me that I'm once again not gonna be able to move my digital library over to the new system?
816000	826000	Because, like, I get it with the Wii and Wii U titles and stuff like that, but if they pull that shit with Virtual Console again,
826000	832000	where I can't play those Virtual Console games on this new system, what the hell?
832000	834000	I mean, that's just stupid.
834000	844000	Oh, well, we had to make this, like, login for our network so we track all your purchases and everything, but it's just not gonna fucking work again.
844000	854000	I mean, see, it's all these things that I need to see what's gonna happen with it, like, answer all these questions before I decide whether I want it or not.
854000	861000	Yeah, and I think you do raise some good questions about, I mean, I am not expecting that people who purchase that stuff on Wii U digitally
861000	867000	are gonna get any sort of deal because the people who got it on disc, when there's no disc drive on that thing, are not gonna get a deal.
867000	869000	I just don't see that happening, period.
869000	875000	And some folks in chat, several folks in chat are saying the Splatoon changes look too big to be DLC.
875000	877000	Some folks thinking that's a new game.
877000	879000	But at the end of the day, we don't know.
879000	883000	We are speculating off of literal seconds of footage, so we don't know.
883000	886000	Nintendo will eventually have to say more about what this Splatoon is.
886000	893000	Is it a enhanced edition? Is it Splatoon 2? What the hell is it? We're not gonna know for a while, right?
893000	898000	Loki, I would think this is probably the last we hear of the Switch until January.
898000	902000	I think that's what they said, and that's stupid, but whatever.
902000	910000	Well, is it? Because with the holiday season and everybody gonna be looking around for holiday stuff, this is something that's not gonna be on the shelves on the holidays.
910000	915000	So, is it stupid to just kinda let it go till next year? Get people hyped in January?
915000	921000	Right. I think it's gonna be stupid to do that because people can get hyped about the Xbox One or something.
921000	926000	Hell, I was looking at it today. They were offering some stuff where the system's $50 off.
926000	932000	They give you $50 on top of that towards a feature purchase and a free game for $250 for an Xbox One.
932000	935000	I was like, shit, maybe I should do that.
935000	941000	I just don't know what the price of this is gonna be, and is it worth purchasing for?
942000	946000	In Skyrim, that's kind of exciting that Skyrim's on a Nintendo system.
946000	953000	Now, as much as I'm championing this thing and I do feel positive about it and everything, that's the one thing where I kinda was like, big fuckin' deal.
953000	956000	Skyrim's an old game.
956000	961000	It was on the Xbox 360. It's on the fuckin' PlayStation 3. Big fuckin' deal.
961000	968000	However, with that, if this is some type of enhanced Skyrim, or if it's the HD Skyrim or whatever,
968000	971000	but the reality is, PlayStation and Xbox are gonna get it.
971000	974000	I would like to just see something new from Bethesda.
974000	982000	Now, rumors are that that's happening with Beyond Good and Evil, right?
982000	985000	We've heard the rumors this week, because that was out previously.
985000	987000	That's not Bethesda, though. Beyond Good and Evil?
987000	991000	Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Crazy moment.
991000	995000	I thought there was something with Bethesda as well.
996000	998000	There was something that was, well, anyway.
998000	1003000	Okay, then fine. All that stuff aside, clearly my thought changer railed on that, but all that stuff aside,
1003000	1007000	I would like to see something maybe new from Bethesda, because,
1007000	1011000	and my concern is, look, don't hate me because I'm saying this about Skyrim,
1011000	1017000	but the reality is, the Wii U launch lineup was Mass Effect, Arkham City,
1017000	1021000	all these things that had already come out a year before, and look where that got the Wii U.
1021000	1024000	So I don't find Skyrim on this thing to be good news.
1024000	1027000	Bethesda needs to be pushing something current.
1027000	1034000	Now, I suppose, what about, this is gonna sound ridiculous,
1034000	1036000	but what if it was Elder Scrolls Online?
1038000	1043000	Because that's still something that Bethesda's trying in that department,
1043000	1046000	and you're just straight up laughing.
1046000	1049000	That's stupid. No one wants that shit.
1049000	1050000	Rude. Rude.
1050000	1051000	No one wants that, I'm sorry.
1051000	1053000	But at least, and the reason why I say that-
1053000	1056000	And it can't be online, it can't be Elder Scrolls Online,
1056000	1058000	because fucking Nintendo doesn't get online yet.
1058000	1062000	Well, we don't know. They didn't say anything about online.
1062000	1063000	Okay, let me tell you this much.
1063000	1070000	My expectations of Nintendo's ability to grasp online and actually get it
1070000	1074000	is about as high as the fucking announcement of the Switch.
1074000	1077000	I'm gonna shut this down right now. Dragon Quest X is a thing.
1077000	1080000	It's not a thing here for some reason, but it's a thing.
1080000	1082000	So, yes, Nintendo is capable of running an MMO.
1082000	1084000	So, shut it down.
1084000	1085000	Alright.
1085000	1087000	No, I'm sorry, it's not here, so that doesn't count.
1087000	1092000	Well, that is, that's a frustration for me, too.
1092000	1096000	Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1096000	1101000	ActDef says, while they did announce the console, we didn't get details about it.
1101000	1104000	Stoppy says, I'd say we got a lot, just not everything.
1104000	1106000	Let's see.
1106000	1110000	Tigerclaw says, whatever Elder Scrolls they are coming for the Switch,
1110000	1113000	it's gonna be some stripped down version with some features missing.
1113000	1114000	Well...
1114000	1115000	I don't know about that.
1115000	1117000	I don't know about that. No, I don't either.
1117000	1121000	You know, it may not be this HD remaster that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
1121000	1123000	are getting, what, this week, right?
1123000	1127000	But it could be the older version with some other type of alternative enhancements.
1127000	1128000	I don't know.
1128000	1129000	We don't know yet.
1129000	1133000	There's a lot of information we don't know about it yet.
1133000	1137000	I mean, I was gonna say, one of the things that we saw,
1137000	1141000	one of the things they were talking about is that it can actually run Unreal 4.
1141000	1145000	So, if it can run Unreal 4, I mean, I know it's scalable and stuff,
1145000	1149000	but it could be, I mean, pretty decent.
1149000	1151000	I just don't know what this is capable of.
1151000	1155000	I mean, the Zelda game looks pretty, and the Mario game, theoretically,
1155000	1157000	I mean, even though we don't know anything about it,
1157000	1160000	it could very well just be CG bullshit, look nice.
1160000	1162000	So, I don't know.
1162000	1163000	AlphaCananagram in chat says,
1163000	1166000	MeTomo is a good sign of future network of Nintendo.
1166000	1168000	Ugh. Ugh.
1168000	1171000	You might want to, maybe Pokémon Go or something, I don't know.
1171000	1172000	Ugh.
1172000	1173000	Not like MeTomo.
1173000	1174000	Ugh, vomit.
1174000	1177000	Dungeonbuster says, Skyrim on the Switch is a big thing
1177000	1180000	because Bethesda had never brought over any of its flagship games
1180000	1181000	to a Nintendo system before.
1181000	1184000	But do you see why that concerns me, though?
1184000	1187000	Because, again, it's an old game on the new console
1187000	1191000	that I don't think there's the demand there for that people think.
1191000	1192000	You know what I mean?
1192000	1193000	I don't know.
1193000	1195000	I don't want Skyrim to be Bethesda's benchmark
1195000	1197000	of how well can we do on the Wii.
1197000	1199000	They do mods and everything, that would be pretty cool
1199000	1201000	if they had mod support on there as well.
1201000	1202000	I guess that'd be cool.
1202000	1204000	There was another really good comment a minute ago
1204000	1205000	that I wanted to get out here.
1205000	1206000	Oh, here it is.
1206000	1209000	Over at live.vognetwork.com, I hope I'm saying this right.
1209000	1210000	Sorry if I'm not.
1210000	1211000	Ichbin Maya says,
1211000	1215000	I would also think that our virtual console purchases
1215000	1219000	may be offered again on the Switch at a discounted upgrade rate
1219000	1222000	like they offered for the Switch from Wii to Wii U.
1222000	1225000	So that is a good point that Nintendo already has that technology
1225000	1227000	to know what you've bought in the past.
1227000	1230000	So maybe, if you did buy something digitally,
1230000	1232000	maybe you could qualify for a discount.
1232000	1234000	I just, I don't know.
1234000	1236000	I think it would put Nintendo in a really weird position
1236000	1238000	because you're going to have all these people that have it on disc
1238000	1241000	that wouldn't necessarily qualify unless maybe they, I don't know,
1241000	1244000	do some type of like my Nintendo registrations,
1244000	1246000	although that's all gone.
1246000	1247000	I don't know.
1247000	1249000	It's so weird that you say that, you know,
1249000	1253000	and how that they have different systems that are capable of different things
1253000	1256000	that you purchase one game on, you get to play it on all of them,
1256000	1260000	like both Xbox and Sony have.
1260000	1264000	So that the fact that they're not able to do this with, you know,
1264000	1268000	the 3DS Wii U and Switch is kind of stupid.
1268000	1270000	So they can get my discounted rate of
1270000	1273000	I don't give a shit about their fucking virtual console at that point.
1273000	1274000	Well, we'll see.
1274000	1277000	I'm willing to let this just kind of sit for a while
1277000	1279000	because Nintendo hasn't talked about online.
1279000	1280000	We'll find out.
1280000	1281000	You know, we just don't know.
1281000	1284000	We've got, this is all off three and a half minutes,
1284000	1286000	but at least it's something finally.
1286000	1288000	Let's talk about battery life
1288000	1291000	because you're going to have battery life in the stupid little Joy-Cons.
1291000	1294000	You have battery life in the actual system itself.
1294000	1296000	It's going to be a mess.
1296000	1298000	Couldn't they all charge each other?
1298000	1301000	Couldn't that dock charge everything?
1301000	1302000	Right. That's what I'm thinking it's going to do.
1302000	1304000	And then the system would charge that.
1304000	1306000	And then when they showed the two Joy-Cons
1306000	1307000	plugged into that grip thing,
1307000	1310000	I'm assuming that has a battery in it as well.
1310000	1311000	All the batteries.
1311000	1313000	All the batteries!
1313000	1314000	The Nintendo battery!
1314000	1316000	The Nintendo battery Switch!
1316000	1321000	I'm pretty sure a nice, good charge will take care of all that, though.
1321000	1323000	What else do we want to talk about on the Switch here real quick?
1323000	1326000	Because there's a lot of news that's kind of like follow up to this as well, right?
1326000	1327000	We heard about...
1327000	1328000	It's based off of NVIDIA Tech,
1328000	1333000	so they're the ones doing the processing design and everything.
1333000	1335000	So the Tegra thing is true.
1335000	1338000	It's a new Tegra, not the one that runs other stuff.
1338000	1339000	So that's pretty cool.
1339000	1342000	So it'll be interesting to see what that can push out.
1342000	1345000	Confirmed no backwards compatibility with Wii U,
1345000	1347000	because there's no disk drive.
1347000	1349000	Or 3DS.
1349000	1350000	Not a thing either.
1350000	1352000	I have to admit,
1352000	1356000	see, here's the tricky thing for me is that
1356000	1360000	I'm actually viewing the Switch as a portable successor.
1360000	1364000	And believe me, I know full well that Nintendo has said,
1364000	1368000	no, we still plan to support 3DS, and this is the console.
1368000	1372000	But I don't know if I believe it, per se.
1372000	1376000	Is that coming from the marketing side, or is that coming from, like, Miyamoto?
1376000	1379000	They'll support it while there's people buying the system, that's it.
1379000	1382000	I mean, because the DS will support it for a long time.
1382000	1384000	Yeah, it's also one of those things where it's like,
1384000	1388000	well, we'll support the Nintendo 64 after the GameCube comes out,
1388000	1389000	but not for very long.
1389000	1391000	See, what I would want to see with, like...
1391000	1393000	I don't want to see the 3DS continuing.
1393000	1397000	Well, I want to see with the Switch, like, ideally what I would have liked the trailer to show me is,
1397000	1401000	like, why that system being portable is innovative.
1401000	1404000	You know, other than, oh, I can take it with me.
1404000	1406000	Cool, I guess.
1406000	1410000	But, like, if they showed me, like, hey, I can take this Pokémon game,
1410000	1413000	and I pop it off, and it has GPS built into the system,
1413000	1416000	and I can walk around and catch Pokémon or something like that,
1416000	1419000	like Pokémon Go or something, and then come back and, you know,
1419000	1426000	it adds, like, gameplay to that, not just I can take the same game with me somewhere else.
1426000	1428000	I mean, that's... I don't know.
1428000	1432000	Let's see, looking in chat for more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
1432000	1433000	I'm sorry, I love this one.
1433000	1438000	Dungeon Buster says, I just hope they don't source Samsung for the batteries.
1438000	1439000	That's a good one, I like that.
1439000	1442000	Then that whole portable playing on the plane thing isn't going to happen
1442000	1444000	if Samsung does those batteries.
1444000	1447000	I heard that they actually had kiosks in airports to try to get you to turn those in,
1447000	1450000	if you haven't already, so that's kind of funny.
1450000	1451000	Oh my gosh, all right.
1451000	1454000	Let's see, what else is there?
1454000	1457000	Stoppy says, I'd say it's like Game Boy to Game Boy Color.
1457000	1461000	They're going to support it for a long time with lots of cross and backwards compatibility.
1461000	1463000	But I don't think... I think it was...
1463000	1466000	Somebody has said that that cartridge slot is not going to hold the 3DS cart.
1466000	1468000	Like, it's different, right?
1468000	1469000	Yeah, it looked different.
1469000	1471000	So, I don't know if we have the firm details on that,
1471000	1477000	but don't assume just because there's a cartridge slot on it that it's playing 3DS stuff.
1477000	1482000	And maybe that's another reason why I kind of view it as a successor to the portable market,
1482000	1486000	because it is doing the portable cartridges that I'm used to at this point,
1486000	1488000	and they kind of got rid of the disk thing.
1488000	1489000	Like, I don't know, I just...
1489000	1492000	Well, it can't really do 3DS, because, I mean, how would you do that?
1492000	1497000	I mean, I guess you would turn the system vertically or sideways.
1497000	1499000	Let's see, SSJ100Matt also says,
1499000	1505000	I do see this as a portable experience, like tablet mobile and not a home console.
1505000	1507000	And then, let's see, AlphaCananagram says,
1507000	1515000	Nintendo Switch is what the PS Vita should have done better when continuing console games on the go.
1515000	1519000	That's probably a really good point, like, because didn't the Vita kind of...
1519000	1522000	I seem to remember 1E3, they were doing some type of dungeon crawler,
1522000	1525000	and the guy, like, paused in the middle of it and kind of continued it on the Vita,
1525000	1526000	so they were kind of showing that a little bit.
1526000	1529000	But we didn't really see a lot of that fully realized, right?
1529000	1530000	Not really.
1530000	1533000	So this is maybe taking that a step further, right?
1533000	1537000	What else do we need to talk about with the Nintendo Switch,
1537000	1539000	with the follow-up news that came out after this?
1543000	1545000	I don't know, that's pretty much it.
1545000	1547000	I mean, there's still a lot we don't know about it yet.
1547000	1548000	Okay.
1548000	1552000	Any games that you're hoping to see Nintendo announce,
1552000	1558000	like, anything that you would like them to unveil, Loki, that would move you into the fan column?
1558000	1563000	Well, I'm always for remasters of games that are actually, I thought, pretty good,
1563000	1565000	like on the Wii and stuff, for example.
1565000	1568000	I love a new Excite Truck game.
1568000	1572000	I'm not talking Excite Bots, because fuck them for that game.
1572000	1579000	I mean, seriously, whoever the asshole that thought putting mini-games in the middle of a fucking race is,
1580000	1581000	I want to kill him.
1581000	1584000	I want to strangle the fucker to death.
1584000	1588000	I mean, it's just the dumb, it made no fucking sense at all.
1588000	1593000	So I love a new remaster of, like, an Excite Truck game, because that was actually fun,
1593000	1594000	and I really enjoyed that.
1594000	1596000	I think that'd be cool.
1596000	1598000	Or how about fucking F-Zero?
1598000	1601000	If we're going to talk about racing, let's talk about fucking F-Zero.
1601000	1602000	F-Zero would be cool.
1602000	1603000	F-Zero.
1604000	1607000	That's how many of those games we've seen in the past decade.
1607000	1609000	Fucking Zero, and it's really irritating me.
1609000	1611000	That would be cool.
1611000	1614000	You know, a new Metroid would be nice.
1614000	1615000	Let's see.
1615000	1619000	Each Ben Mias sharing an article saying,
1619000	1622000	Nintendo did confirm no DS and 3DS compatibility.
1622000	1623000	Sharing an article there.
1623000	1625000	I thought I had read something like that.
1625000	1628000	MXC in chat at live.vognetwork.com saying,
1628000	1631000	I'm curious as to the storage size of the game cartridges.
1631000	1634000	Given the ridiculous sizes of some modern games,
1634000	1638000	it'll need to be decently large as compared to the 8GB and 4GB game sizes
1638000	1641000	of 3DS and Vita respectively.
1641000	1645000	Those cards ought to be 32GB, don't you think?
1645000	1650000	That would seem like a relatively, at this point, inexpensive size
1650000	1653000	that's going to hold a lot of data, right?
1653000	1655000	I think we need to be pretty big, yeah.
1655000	1658000	And speaking of pretty big,
1658000	1663000	let's hope that they're not fucking retarded with the stupid onboard storage
1663000	1665000	and giving us 32GB again.
1665000	1668000	Because they can go fuck themselves with their 32GB.
1668000	1670000	I have a feeling that...
1670000	1673000	Well, well, well.
1673000	1675000	Okay, tinfoil hat.
1675000	1677000	Could the dock have some of that storage?
1677000	1680000	Wow, that would be so useful when I take it to go!
1680000	1683000	Oh wait, I can't access my storage because it's a fucking home!
1683000	1686000	What if there's some type of portable memory or something?
1686000	1688000	I don't know, maybe that's too complicated,
1688000	1691000	but my concern is because it is something you're taking with you on the go,
1691000	1693000	you're not going to have exactly a terabyte.
1693000	1695000	And the fact that all the games are cartridges now.
1695000	1700000	I'm not asking for a terabyte. Fucking 256GB or 128GB.
1700000	1702000	Is that too much to ask?
1702000	1703000	It might be.
1703000	1705000	I mean, depending on the size of the games, obviously.
1705000	1707000	But if it's anything like the Wii U,
1707000	1709000	after two or three games on there,
1709000	1712000	it's like, oh, sorry, you gotta get external storage now.
1712000	1713000	That's retarded.
1713000	1717000	I mean, I don't even know how many games I have on my PlayStation 4 right now.
1717000	1719000	And those are Blu-Ray games.
1719000	1722000	And I've got, like, at least 20 games on there.
1724000	1728000	Let's see, a couple other thoughts here at Live.FogNetwork.com.
1728000	1732000	StellarRose412 says, would they maybe have the SD card like the 3DS?
1732000	1735000	I suppose that's a possibility.
1735000	1738000	Who knows? Especially with it, and a lot of people, multiple people saying,
1738000	1740000	how cheap that type of storage is.
1740000	1742000	So I suppose anything is possible, right?
1742000	1744000	That would be nice.
1744000	1747000	And again, maybe something where you could put it on the dock
1747000	1749000	and have more memory.
1749000	1752000	I think that might just be too complicated for most people. Who knows?
1752000	1755000	Anyway, we're going to shift gears here a little bit.
1755000	1758000	I'm sure there will be plenty more to talk about on the Nintendo Switch
1758000	1759000	in the coming weeks.
1759000	1762000	But we want to go back and talk about PC gaming for a little bit here
1762000	1764000	before we get into our gaming weeks.
1764000	1768000	Because we're going to talk about a PC game that's available on Steam right now.
1768000	1771000	And it's a game called Cat President.
1771000	1773000	And we're getting on the line right now.
1773000	1775000	Paul from, oh, Rock Studios.
1775000	1780000	And he's going to be joining us to talk about the game Cat President.
1780000	1782000	And we're trying to get him on the line right now.
1782000	1784000	And I think he's there. Hey, Paul. You there?
1784000	1786000	Hello. Hey, how's it going?
1786000	1787000	Great. Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.
1787000	1789000	Hey, thank you very much. I'm very happy to be here.
1789000	1791000	We are very happy to have you.
1791000	1793000	This is an interview that's been a long time coming
1793000	1795000	ever since we first spotted your game on Steam.
1795000	1798000	So I'm glad you could be here, especially on such a large week
1798000	1801000	with the whole Switch reveal and all that stuff.
1801000	1803000	Surely you're watching that as a gamer, right?
1803000	1805000	Oh, yeah. I'm paying a little attention.
1805000	1809000	I mean, my main and only thought that I had while watching that video was
1809000	1812000	I'm going to lose all of those parts immediately.
1812000	1815000	Just right out of the box. They're going to go under the couch.
1815000	1816000	They're gone.
1816000	1818000	No, considering like everything is detachable.
1818000	1820000	Or bringing this back to cats.
1820000	1823000	If anyone has cats like my cat, you leave that on the floor.
1823000	1825000	That shit is under the couch.
1825000	1827000	That's a damn good point, Logan.
1827000	1831000	All right. So, Paul, tell us about your game, Cat President.
1831000	1834000	Yes, okay. It's a visual novel.
1834000	1837000	People have compared it to Hataful Boyfriend.
1837000	1840000	I don't see the comparison personally, but you know, that's fine.
1840000	1843000	It's a visual novel about the presidential election
1843000	1848000	and presidential politics, except that all of the candidates are cats
1848000	1852000	and there's a very good chance that you will fall in love with them.
1852000	1857000	Just like you do the pigeons in Hataful Boyfriend.
1857000	1860000	I think that's probably why you're getting the comparisons.
1860000	1862000	I guess I can kind of see it. I don't know.
1862000	1865000	Well, Hataful Boyfriend is also one of the more well-known visual novels.
1865000	1867000	Yeah, and we kind of copped their art style.
1867000	1869000	But other than that, totally different.
1869000	1874000	Speaking of copping things, I need to clear something up here
1874000	1878000	for our listeners and some folks who have been listening to the show a long time.
1878000	1884000	Paul, was any of this inspired by a Wii title from a few years ago?
1884000	1887000	No, it wasn't. The first time I even heard about President Cat,
1887000	1893000	I'm ashamed to say was in the very first review of Cat President that came out,
1893000	1899000	which was on a major website and had some very unfavorable comparisons.
1899000	1903000	It was a great review. It sounded like that Cat President was the worst thing
1903000	1906000	that had ever happened to this person in their entire life.
1906000	1908000	That's not nice.
1908000	1910000	Well, it happens.
1910000	1915000	Well, first off, I didn't realize that that review was on a major website.
1915000	1919000	So first off, that just proves major websites are listening to this show,
1919000	1921000	so watch what you say, Loki.
1921000	1923000	They all say you've been out of shape if that's going to make their life miserable
1923000	1925000	just like playing a game.
1925000	1928000	Although I also feel kind of bad because you had no idea.
1928000	1930000	And to be fair, the President Cat thing was years ago,
1930000	1935000	and I knew when your game came out that obviously this has been a crazy freaking year
1935000	1939000	when it comes to elections, so of course somebody made a game
1939000	1941000	that is somewhat inspired by the electional stuff.
1941000	1943000	And who doesn't love cats?
1943000	1947000	Well, to be clear, I do hold you 100% responsible for that review.
1949000	1951000	Well, wait a minute. We're going to blame Jamie.
1951000	1953000	She's the one that translated it, and she's not here.
1953000	1956000	So when in doubt, blame the one that's not here.
1956000	1958000	Okay, that's fair. Okay. I can accept that.
1958000	1960000	I'm going to redirect those complaints to Dark Soccer.
1960000	1964000	All right, well, I'm sorry to hear that the review invoked some internet fuckery thing
1964000	1969000	that we started, but that person just needs to get over it, I suppose.
1969000	1973000	But to be clear, also, your game is not action or minigames
1973000	1977000	or any of that stuff that we saw with Sukiban Sochowrenawe,
1977000	1979000	which was the President Cat stuff.
1979000	1981000	This is a visual novel game.
1981000	1984000	Yeah, pure text-based decision-making.
1984000	1986000	You have a lot of dialogue.
1986000	1990000	Basically, you decide whether you're going to be nice to the candidate or mean to the candidate,
1990000	1993000	and your reactions kind of determine whether you get the good ending
1993000	1996000	where you get to live happily ever after with your new cat friend,
1996000	2000000	or if they fire you, you die, stuff like that.
2000000	2003000	Is this the first game that you've done?
2003000	2006000	No, it's the first game we've released on Steam.
2006000	2010000	We've released a few other small visual novels on itch.io,
2010000	2014000	one called My Nigerian Prince, another kind of romance-themed game
2014000	2017000	about falling in love with an internet scammer,
2017000	2022000	and one called Francie Drew, which is a mystery parody of Nancy Drew.
2022000	2026000	But I also released an FMV game last year,
2026000	2031000	written, directed, starred, camera work, everything 100% by me, black and white game,
2031000	2034000	about an awkward person trying to answer his front door
2034000	2037000	when there's someone outside and he doesn't know who it is.
2037000	2039000	Those all sound awesome.
2039000	2041000	I know. You have a great sense of humor.
2041000	2043000	These all sound amazing.
2043000	2044000	Thank you.
2044000	2047000	I hope those major websites that are clearly listening to this program,
2047000	2049000	I hope they discover your shit through this,
2049000	2051000	because it sounds like you've got some genius.
2051000	2053000	The My Nigerian Prince thing, that is funny.
2053000	2055000	That is really funny. I'm going to check that out.
2055000	2057000	To be fair, I can't claim 100% credit for that,
2057000	2059000	or Cat President for that matter.
2059000	2062000	I work with a partner who does a lot of the writing.
2062000	2066000	I'm focused more on the coding, the copy editing, and the cat photoshopping.
2066000	2069000	Okay, fair enough. So when I say you, I mean your studio. Fair enough.
2069000	2071000	Yeah, yeah, sure.
2071000	2074000	And some folks in chat over at live.fognetwork.com
2074000	2077000	already finding the link there for My Nigerian Prince.
2077000	2080000	Well, let's talk about Cat President, though, the one that is on Steam.
2080000	2083000	So you actually went the Steam Greenlight route with this, right?
2083000	2088000	Yeah, it was a learning experience.
2088000	2091000	Putting a game through Steam Greenlight,
2091000	2095000	pretty much you're never going to be bothered by,
2095000	2097000	let's say, negative feedback ever again,
2097000	2100000	because you're just going to get tons and tons of comments
2100000	2103000	about how terrible your game is, how you're ruining Steam.
2103000	2107000	It's like immersion therapy for people being terrible on the internet, basically.
2107000	2111000	If you can get through that without just flipping out, deleting it,
2111000	2113000	throwing your computer in the garbage,
2113000	2115000	you can take anything at that point.
2115000	2117000	Paul, how do you feel that you personally are the reason
2117000	2119000	we don't have Half-Life 3?
2119000	2121000	Oh, it's 100%.
2121000	2123000	Oh, I take full credit for ruining Steam.
2123000	2126000	If Steam is in the crap hole now, that's my fault.
2126000	2128000	That's absolutely true.
2130000	2132000	So what inspired?
2132000	2135000	I know you said that you have another guy that you work with
2135000	2138000	that did a lot of the writing, but what inspired this game?
2138000	2140000	What inspired you to be the Cap President?
2140000	2144000	My friend, he plays a lot of Japanese dating sims on his phone,
2144000	2148000	and he started to notice that there were a lot of comparisons
2148000	2151000	that you could draw between candidates in the presidential election
2151000	2155000	and the type of bows that you have in Japanese dating sims.
2155000	2159000	You have the nice guy, the guy who shouts a lot,
2159000	2162000	the young candidate, the pervert,
2162000	2166000	and that made him think that we could do something with that.
2166000	2169000	So we started talking on Twitter about the idea,
2169000	2171000	and then I said, hey, can we make them all cats?
2171000	2173000	And the rest is history.
2173000	2175000	That's outstanding. I love that.
2175000	2181000	And you guys have a new game that you're doing this coming week, right?
2181000	2183000	Yes, yes. Thank you so much for bringing that up.
2183000	2187000	I have a game that's completely different from everything else I just mentioned.
2187000	2193000	It's a retro-style point-and-click adventure game called The Beard in the Mirror,
2193000	2196000	heavily inspired by old Sierra games, LucasArts games,
2196000	2198000	the kind of stuff I grew up playing
2198000	2202000	and the stuff that made me want to get into game development in the first place.
2202000	2204000	My wife and I have actually built this one together.
2204000	2206000	We've been working on it.
2206000	2210000	Basically, the entirety of our adult lives,
2210000	2213000	this game has existed in the background for us,
2213000	2215000	and it's finally coming out, and we couldn't be...
2215000	2218000	I don't know if happy is the right word,
2218000	2221000	but more relieved, certainly, that we finally finished it.
2221000	2224000	I can't help but notice in your Skype little picture
2224000	2227000	that you yourself have a beard, and this game is called The Beard in the...
2227000	2230000	Is this some type of biography?
2230000	2233000	To be fair, the main character's name is also Paul,
2233000	2238000	but no, my wife started making the game by herself
2238000	2240000	before we even started dating, actually,
2240000	2245000	and she wanted to put me in the game.
2245000	2247000	We talked a bunch of times about,
2247000	2249000	should we change the character's name? Is this getting too weird?
2249000	2252000	But as the game progressed, as we wrote more,
2252000	2254000	as we kind of figured out who the character was,
2254000	2256000	he just kind of became his own person.
2256000	2259000	He's his own character, so yeah.
2259000	2264000	But Beard does play a significant role in the game.
2264000	2265000	I'm not going to say any more than that.
2265000	2266000	All right, fair enough.
2266000	2269000	I was going to say, tell me a little more about the plot,
2269000	2271000	but is it too spoilery to tell me much more about the game?
2271000	2273000	Yeah, pretty much.
2273000	2276000	I'm so bad at elevator pitches.
2276000	2278000	I'm the worst salesman in general.
2278000	2280000	I'm happy to say, here's my game.
2280000	2281000	If you like it, that's great.
2281000	2283000	If not, oh well, that's fine.
2283000	2285000	Maybe you'll find another game you like.
2285000	2287000	Who cares?
2287000	2290000	No, it's, like I said, a retro point-and-click adventure game.
2290000	2293000	The character is awoken in the middle of the night
2293000	2297000	by a mysterious woman who thinks that he should remember him.
2297000	2299000	She's like, Paul, Paul, wake up.
2299000	2300000	Don't you know who I am?
2300000	2301000	Blah, blah, blah.
2301000	2304000	And then he wakes up, opens his front door.
2304000	2307000	There's a forest out there where there was previously a hallway,
2307000	2309000	and then the rest of the game is kind of figuring out
2309000	2311000	what the hell's going on
2311000	2315000	and figuring out what this person kind of wants to do with his life.
2315000	2317000	How have you developed your games?
2317000	2319000	And if you guys have questions for Paul,
2319000	2321000	of course our chat room is wide open for questions
2321000	2323000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
2323000	2325000	What tools are you using to develop?
2325000	2328000	Because I find that interesting that you've been doing a lot of visual novels,
2328000	2330000	but you're making a very radical switch now
2330000	2332000	into a point-and-click adventure game.
2332000	2334000	So what have you been using to develop?
2334000	2335000	Oh, yeah, sure.
2335000	2337000	We use a couple of different free tools.
2337000	2340000	I mean, we use the same thing a lot of beginning studios,
2340000	2341000	beginning developers use.
2341000	2343000	We use Ren'Py for visual novels
2343000	2345000	and AGS, Adventure Game Studio,
2345000	2347000	for the point-and-click adventure game.
2347000	2353000	Basically, stuff that requires a minimal knowledge of actual coding involved
2353000	2355000	to be perfectly frank.
2355000	2357000	I don't know that without this kind of software,
2357000	2359000	I could code my way out of a paper bag.
2359000	2361000	Well, I think that's totally okay
2361000	2363000	because everybody has to kind of start somewhere on one hand,
2363000	2365000	and I think there's a lot of huge games.
2365000	2368000	Isn't Five Nights at Freddy's from one of those types of software
2368000	2369000	where you can do it?
2369000	2370000	I think so, yeah, yeah.
2370000	2371000	And a lot of them,
2371000	2374000	I don't know if you've ever heard of a company called Wadjet Eye Games.
2374000	2376000	They do a lot of point-and-click adventure games like we're working on,
2376000	2379000	and all of their stuff is the same program that we use,
2379000	2380000	Adventure Game Studio.
2380000	2382000	I think that stuff is just,
2382000	2385000	and even when you look at something that's quote-unquote serious like Unity,
2385000	2389000	there's a lot of plug-and-play components to Unity, right, Loki?
2389000	2390000	Well, yeah.
2390000	2391000	Oh, sorry, go ahead.
2391000	2393000	Oh, no, it doesn't matter what you use to get there
2393000	2396000	as long as it's what the end product is, really.
2396000	2397000	Exactly, for sure, for sure.
2397000	2399000	Yeah, I mean, I just think it's great.
2399000	2402000	We live in a world right now where anyone who can just wake up and say,
2402000	2403000	I want to make a game,
2403000	2406000	and they can just download some free tools online and do it.
2406000	2409000	Like 20 years ago, I mean, I can tell you,
2409000	2411000	in high school when I started studying this stuff,
2411000	2414000	I was like, wow, I'm really wicked bad at this.
2414000	2416000	There's a lot of math.
2416000	2418000	And I would never have become a game developer
2418000	2421000	if there weren't such easy tools to let you dip your toes in
2421000	2424000	and just figure out what you're even doing.
2424000	2427000	I think it's great that we live in that kind of world now.
2427000	2429000	All right, let's get to some questions from our chatroom
2429000	2430000	live.vog.network.com.
2430000	2432000	SSG100Matt is asking,
2432000	2434000	where did you get the cat or animal pictures that are,
2434000	2438000	because if I remember right, I saw a dog that was wearing cat ears.
2438000	2441000	Yeah, so the cat pictures actually, it's fun.
2441000	2446000	I put out the call on Facebook asking for friends to submit cute pictures
2446000	2448000	of their cats to put in the game.
2448000	2452000	And I mean, it was like I was George Bailey at the end of
2452000	2454000	It's a Wonderful Life with cat photos, just tons,
2454000	2457000	like cat photos just raining from the heavens.
2457000	2462000	The one advice that I could offer to any aspiring game developer out there
2462000	2465000	is to put your friend's cat in your game,
2465000	2467000	because then they will have to tell everyone about it.
2467000	2469000	It's a great promotional tool.
2469000	2472000	You know what's hilarious about that, and I know he's listening,
2472000	2474000	or will be listening on the podcast later this week.
2474000	2476000	We have a friend of the show who also does development
2476000	2478000	who's also doing a game through Steam Greenlight
2478000	2480000	that just got greenlit right now, our buddy YYR.
2480000	2484000	And he put a game out on the Xbox Indie Games called Bungee Ferret Tossing.
2484000	2487000	And he did something very similar because he had all these
2487000	2488000	exploding ferrets in the game.
2488000	2491000	He didn't want people to think that it was actually advocating
2491000	2492000	violence against animals.
2492000	2495000	So in the very beginning of the game, he puts this PSA about
2495000	2496000	please don't hurt animals.
2496000	2499000	And he solicited pictures of everybody's animals.
2499000	2501000	And I think a very similar thing happened.
2501000	2504000	And that's how my cat got in a video game.
2504000	2505000	Aww.
2505000	2506000	So there it is.
2506000	2508000	Yes, and that's just a 100 Matt and Chad says,
2508000	2511000	the internet is filled with cat pictures.
2511000	2513000	Ragenator in chat, by the way, saying,
2513000	2515000	yeah, anyone can make a game except Loki.
2515000	2517000	He starts making them, but then can't complete them.
2517000	2518000	Wow.
2518000	2520000	Hey, I could complete it just fine.
2520000	2523000	It would just be a piece of garbage and, you know,
2523000	2525000	I don't want to release a piece of garbage.
2525000	2528000	So, I mean, hey, if you want me to release what I have right
2528000	2531000	now for that game, by all means, I could do that.
2531000	2532000	Maybe a broken piece of garbage.
2532000	2535000	And I really don't feel like I want to release that.
2535000	2538000	Ragenator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com is asking,
2538000	2542000	any plan for a cats versus dogs game or a game wholly
2542000	2543000	about bacon?
2543000	2545000	I don't know if that means you're going to do a cats
2545000	2548000	versus pigs game, but is there more?
2548000	2550000	Is there time for more cats later on, Paul,
2550000	2552000	or is this like an idea that, no, you're one and done?
2552000	2556000	I mean, we've tossed around the idea of doing some DLC
2556000	2559000	episodes starring some of the minor candidates of the game,
2559000	2562000	or maybe doing a full sequel, maybe to align with the next
2562000	2563000	presidential election.
2563000	2567000	But that hasn't really gotten beyond the us tweeting ideas
2567000	2569000	at one another stage as of yet.
2569000	2571000	There are some dogs in the game, though,
2571000	2574000	and I actually stuck my pet bunny rabbits in as vice
2574000	2576000	presidential candidates as well.
2576000	2581000	I was very, very happy to be able to do that.
2581000	2582000	Oh, that's amazing.
2582000	2585000	All right, one more call for questions over at our chat room
2585000	2587000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
2587000	2591000	And I notice Akdeft is saying a cat president to reelection.
2591000	2594000	So they're already pitching you ideas over there.
2594000	2596000	Oh, I'm going to have to make sure to check that out then
2596000	2599000	because we don't have a lot of ideas yet.
2599000	2603000	So you're going to be releasing the beard in the mirror game
2603000	2604000	really soon.
2604000	2605000	Have you thought about, you know,
2605000	2609000	as these games are starting to sell on Steam and you're kind
2609000	2612000	of getting more and more, you've kind of moved from itch.io
2612000	2613000	to Steam and so forth.
2613000	2616000	Are you looking at trying to maybe expand even more,
2616000	2619000	potentially trying to get into places like the console market?
2619000	2621000	Is that something on your radar?
2621000	2622000	No, not yet.
2622000	2625000	I'm pretty happy making my small weirdo games at the moment,
2625000	2626000	to be honest.
2626000	2629000	I really like the ease of access on the computer.
2629000	2632000	I really like just how simple and straightforward everything
2632000	2633000	is.
2633000	2636000	Like I said, I'm still someone who's kind of learning how to
2636000	2637000	do all of this on the fly.
2637000	2638000	So not at the moment.
2638000	2642000	I did release, you mentioned Xbox indie games a few minutes
2642000	2643000	ago.
2643000	2647000	I did have a point-and-click adventure game I released there
2647000	2651000	several years ago back when the indie games channel was still a
2651000	2653000	thing called Life in the Dorms,
2653000	2658000	a comedic game about trying to make friends in college,
2658000	2659000	basically.
2659000	2661000	Semi-autobiographical.
2661000	2664000	I was going to say a lot of these games kind of seem based
2664000	2667000	on potential real-life scenarios that then spiral way out of
2667000	2669000	control when you sit next to a computer.
2669000	2672000	And now that just makes me even wonder even more where Cat
2672000	2673000	President comes from.
2673000	2678000	Well, it came from the time my cat ran for president.
2678000	2681000	Just print, just when they, when they bury this show,
2681000	2683000	just print that on the tombstone,
2683000	2684000	that little exchange right there.
2684000	2686000	Just print that on the tombstone.
2686000	2687000	Let's see.
2687000	2690000	And look, our chatters are, instead of asking questions,
2690000	2692000	they're just throwing around ideas for sequels.
2693000	2697000	StellaRose412 says, Cat President 2, the empty podium one.
2697000	2698000	I don't understand.
2698000	2702000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Cat President 2, impeachment.
2702000	2705000	The dog party tries to ouster the current cat president and
2705000	2707000	replace with their own candidate.
2707000	2710000	You could have, you could have instead of the governator,
2710000	2712000	because that fricking happened in California,
2712000	2715000	instead of the governator, it could be like the puppy-nator.
2715000	2716000	Or how about this?
2716000	2719000	Cat President 2, the hunt for Mysis.
2720000	2721000	Oh, no.
2721000	2723000	That might be getting a little too real for us.
2723000	2724000	Shut it down.
2724000	2725000	We're done.
2725000	2726000	Thanks for listening.
2726000	2727000	Good night, everybody.
2729000	2730000	Let's see.
2730000	2732000	We have a rage-inator saying, Cat President 2,
2732000	2734000	make catnip great again.
2734000	2736000	Isn't catnip already awesome though?
2736000	2738000	I don't think, maybe what Dungeon Buster says a little
2738000	2739000	more along those lines.
2739000	2741000	I tried catnip, but I didn't inhale.
2743000	2745000	So many great ideas there, but Paul,
2745000	2748000	we're going to leave the ideas and the execution to you guys.
2748000	2752000	It really sounds like you guys are very clever and creative
2752000	2755000	and have created some visual novels that I hope people will
2755000	2758000	give a read or a play, if you will.
2758000	2761000	So one more kind of shout out.
2761000	2762000	Where can we follow you?
2762000	2763000	Where can we find these games?
2763000	2765000	Where can we track what's coming up from O'Rock Studios?
2765000	2766000	Yeah, sure.
2766000	2768000	You can find me on Twitter.
2768000	2772000	I'm on there kind of constantly, at Paul M. Franzen.
2772000	2773000	You can follow our group.
2773000	2777000	Also on Twitter at O, at O'Rock Studios.
2777000	2780000	We have O'Rock.com where it kind of has a link to all of our games.
2780000	2786000	And our whole library of games is basically between itch.io and Steam.
2786000	2787000	So that's all there.
2787000	2790000	All right, well I really wish you the best of luck.
2790000	2794000	And you know, because we could not have President Cat in the States
2794000	2797000	because for some reason they just didn't think it would do well here.
2797000	2799000	It's pretty common because it didn't do well in Japan either.
2799000	2803000	Well, I still say, I never saw the receipts on that.
2803000	2808000	But anyway, I want to say thank you for making a presidential cat a reality at least.
2808000	2812000	At least in one way or another we do have presidential cats as a reality
2812000	2815000	even if really we had nothing to do with it
2815000	2817000	and we're really just causing you problems because of it.
2817000	2819000	I'm still thankful, so.
2819000	2822000	Hey, we still got a review on a major website at least, so.
2822000	2823000	Hey, that works.
2823000	2825000	And the last thought here, and I'll let you go.
2825000	2829000	ActDeft is suggesting Cat President 2, grab them by the human.
2829000	2832000	Okay, wait, that's actually really good.
2832000	2833000	And I'm going to write that down.
2833000	2834000	There you go, all right, look at that.
2834000	2836000	Look at that, ActDeft, you might be a star.
2836000	2838000	You better go trademark that before Paul gets to it.
2838000	2841000	All right, all joking aside, Paul, thank you so much for being here.
2841000	2843000	I really appreciate it and best of luck.
2843000	2845000	And we're going to keep an eye on you and what's coming out of your studio
2845000	2847000	since it sounds like you have some really hilarious stuff
2847000	2849000	and hopefully we'll have you back on the show sometime.
2849000	2851000	That sounds great, thank you so much for having me.
2851000	2852000	All right, no problem, take care.
2852000	2853000	Bye.
2853000	2854000	Bye.
2854000	2858000	All right, again, that is Cat President, the beard in the mirror.
2858000	2861000	And what was the Nigerian prince?
2861000	2862000	My Nigerian prince.
2862000	2864000	My Nigerian prince, that's pretty awesome.
2864000	2865000	That's great.
2865000	2868000	Dungeon Buster was a fan of that interview saying great interview,
2868000	2870000	love how they came up with the idea for the game.
2870000	2874000	Yeah, I did not realize there was, I mean, obviously I did a little research
2874000	2876000	and I knew he had a new game coming out,
2876000	2879000	but somehow I missed that he had these other games about the Nigerian prince.
2879000	2882000	That's funny, so good sense of humor over there.
2882000	2884000	Best of luck to them as it develops.
2884000	2888000	And I also love the message there that, yes, anybody can make a game
2888000	2891000	and that there's tools out there to do it and so forth.
2891000	2895000	And, you know, I think doing a visual novel would be fun.
2895000	2897000	Maybe I can handle a visual novel.
2897000	2898000	Probably.
2898000	2899000	I wouldn't have to do physics.
2899000	2901000	Physics is where gaming gets scary.
2901000	2902000	Well.
2902000	2905000	Of course, I have a good friend that does physics for video games,
2905000	2910000	but I just, it's still scary.
2910000	2912000	I will see, kind of go back on like anything done
2912000	2915000	because, you know, it's seriously, it's a mental thing.
2915000	2918000	I've been trying to get something done, you know,
2918000	2922000	and trying to figure out how I'm mentally going to be able to focus on something.
2922000	2928000	And so I found what my problem has been is not that the scope is too big
2928000	2930000	because I don't give a shit about the size of the scope.
2930000	2932000	It's about the pieces.
2932000	2935000	I'm like, you know, already thinking about how I'm going to optimize an engine
2935000	2938000	before I even build an engine, which is stupid.
2938000	2943000	So what I decided is I'm going to just break it down into incredibly small pieces.
2943000	2948000	Like, today we're going to make something that I can move in a grid.
2948000	2949000	Done.
2949000	2952000	You know, and tomorrow we'll make something that, you know,
2952000	2955000	I can spawn blocks in a grid and go.
2955000	2959000	I mean, that's because those smaller chunks I'm able to focus on
2959000	2962000	instead of like, crap, I've got to figure out how I'm going to make this like engine run
2962000	2965000	and I've got to figure out everything before I even start programming.
2965000	2967000	No, it's not going to work that way.
2967000	2971000	All right, well, I should look into these visual novel development software
2971000	2972000	that he was talking about there.
2972000	2975000	Maybe I can do my dream visual novel game.
2975000	2978000	Yeah, the one you're thinking about for Five Nights at Freddy's is Click Team Fusion.
2978000	2982000	And they just had that on Humble Bundle not too long ago.
2982000	2986000	Let's see, I'm going to do a visual novel, The Co-host Who Couldn't Love Nintendo.
2986000	2988000	I think I'll do that. I think I'll do that as a visual novel.
2988000	2990000	That is so untrue.
2990000	2992000	I loved Nintendo one time.
2992000	2996000	It's just, unfortunately, Nintendo started doing all this weird shit,
2996000	2999000	got into some weird crowds, and just...
2999000	3000000	It's hanging out with the wrong cat.
3000000	3003000	It's not the same Nintendo that I used to know a long time ago.
3003000	3005000	So, best of luck again.
3005000	3009000	And the beard in the mirror, it looks like our chat room is actually checking that out on Steam right now,
3009000	3015000	and it is out this Tuesday, so a very timely interview there.
3015000	3019000	And for our podcast audience, most of you will probably hear this when that game is live,
3019000	3021000	so go check that out on Steam.
3021000	3023000	I'm sure you can just put it in the search box and you can find that.
3023000	3028000	Cat president. But My Nigerian Prince is over on itch.io, so check that out over there.
3028000	3032000	Alright, we're going to get into our gaming weeks before we get into gaming news.
3032000	3036000	So, let's talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week. Loki.
3036000	3048000	So, my big gaming week was because on Monday, I decided I'm going to pick up a PlayStation VR, and so I did.
3048000	3052000	Oh, so after the show last week, you ended up being kind of sold on VR.
3052000	3056000	Yeah, so I picked it up and I actually dig it quite a bit.
3056000	3065000	You know, the control issues that I've seen and stuff, a lot of it's not so bad, but it is kind of broken a little bit.
3065000	3070000	For example, there's a really bad problem that they have with the screen drifting.
3070000	3075000	So, you'll be playing a game and it's slowly drifting to the left for no reason.
3075000	3080000	It's just the issue with the tracking and it's a software issue, which is weird.
3080000	3089000	I think from what I've heard, it's because you're close to being outside of the distance that the camera can pick you up in or something like that.
3089000	3096000	And when you're kind of on the outside of that, if you go more towards the center that it's able to pick you up a little bit better.
3096000	3101000	Because I know the way my couch is, which my room is not all that big that I play it in my living room.
3102000	3106000	I thought I'd be able to sit comfortably on the couch and be able to play it just fine.
3106000	3113000	But apparently it's just like a few inches shy of being too far away from the camera, which is really silly.
3113000	3117000	I almost feel like Bobby was talking about that exact same problem on his show last week.
3117000	3119000	He was talking almost about a very similar thing.
3119000	3122000	That he had to get to sit forward on the couch.
3122000	3126000	Right, yeah, exactly. And I had to scoot the couch up a little bit.
3126000	3132000	And I'm always worried to do that because my cat's a retard and she will go behind the couch and lay there or something.
3132000	3134000	And then I'll scoot the couch back and crush her to the death.
3134000	3139000	So, I mean, I always gotta watch out for the cat trying to kill herself.
3139000	3143000	But, no, I played, and once again, you know, thank you Shane.
3143000	3146000	He's our pusher for when it comes to the gaming stuff.
3146000	3149000	Yeah, SSG100Matt in chat calling that out.
3149000	3152000	Shane's hero's power of making people buy things got to Loki.
3152000	3158000	It's not him that got me to buy it. It's trying it that got me to buy it.
3158000	3163000	Because if I had tried it, probably at Best Buy, I probably would have picked it up.
3163000	3167000	I wouldn't have cancelled my pre-order. I would have just had to find some way to be able to pay for it.
3167000	3173000	So I did pick up, ironically enough, I picked up Until Dawn Rush of Blood.
3173000	3180000	Which, honestly, that is not a game I'm remotely, like a genre that I'm remotely interested in at all.
3180000	3185000	I don't like horror games at all. But this game is fucking awesome.
3185000	3189000	So I don't know. It's just weird. It's a shooting gallery game that's like,
3189000	3195000	my best comparison is it's Toy Story Mania meets Saw is basically what it is.
3195000	3200000	See, I would like to play the Toy Story Mania game because Shane did make me play that finally.
3200000	3203000	I think it was after the show I finally sat down and played that game and I had to stop.
3203000	3207000	Like, there was just too many jump scares and I was not, I was not having it.
3207000	3209000	Really? I didn't see it. There wasn't that many jump scares for me.
3209000	3212000	Okay, but you know he picked the course that was the worst one.
3212000	3218000	And that, to the opposite of Shane's power or whatever you want to call it, that is the worst thing to do.
3218000	3221000	If he knows I don't like scary games, he should have started me on a soft-
3221000	3226000	They did have some jump scares, but like, it was more of like, you got me. That's pretty funny.
3226000	3229000	You know, like, you know it's like something's gonna jump out and stuff.
3229000	3234000	Like, there was, like I played through about three of the levels so far in Rush of Blood.
3234000	3238000	So the first one you start off, and I think that's the one you had me play here,
3238000	3244000	is basically you're going through everything and then you gas at the end.
3244000	3247000	And so they're kind of teaching the mechanics of the game and stuff and shooting.
3247000	3253000	So the second level is the one that they have in the actual demo on the PlayStation VR disc,
3253000	3257000	which is basically this thing where you go into a slaughterhouse type thing,
3257000	3261000	and all of a sudden all the pigs come alive and start squealing and the saw is going up.
3261000	3263000	That was the stage he made me play. It was gross.
3263000	3266000	Yeah, with the dolls and stuff like that, and like, it's kind of creepy.
3266000	3269000	The third stage is like a ghost stage.
3269000	3275000	And so they've basically got this woman that's shooting crows at you a lot of the time.
3275000	3277000	And so you have to kind of shoot those away.
3277000	3281000	But there's one part that's pitch black that you're going through with these mannequins.
3281000	3286000	It's like the Silent Hill Nurses almost. Like, the mannequins move when you're not looking at them.
3286000	3291000	And they kind of, like, creep up in your face and stuff. So that was kind of creepy but fun.
3291000	3296000	It's an entertaining type game, and I've actually had quite a bit of fun just playing that.
3296000	3301000	The other game I picked up was Job Simulator, which, it's a fun game to mess around with,
3301000	3305000	and my son likes playing it even though he is too short for that game.
3305000	3309000	So, like, that's one of the things I don't really like about PlayStation VR,
3309000	3311000	and this is basically a software thing.
3311000	3316000	The calibration stuff is not always easy to get to in the middle of a game.
3316000	3324000	Like, when I was trying to adjust it for him, you know, you can raise and lower the floor so that you're taller or shorter, depending on what that is.
3324000	3329000	And I really wish they had a way to kind of calibrate that, like they do, I think, with the Vive,
3329000	3334000	where you put a controller on the floor, put a controller on top of your head or something like that so they know your height,
3334000	3339000	and kind of scale everything based on that, or at least make you taller based on that.
3339000	3343000	Because that would have been really helpful, because I just kind of had to wing it to see if he would be tall enough.
3343000	3350000	And even still, when I did it uncalibrated, he's like, okay, you got to take the paper out of the thing.
3350000	3354000	He's like trying to reach up and grab the paper, and it's just too far away.
3354000	3358000	Or, oh, you got to get a coffee cup to fill it with coffee, and he couldn't reach the top shelf, which is pretty funny.
3358000	3363000	But it's a fun game, but I think it's something, and I kind of was worried about when I bought it, too,
3363000	3366000	that I'm going to get bored with really fast.
3366000	3371000	Like, you play it through all the levels like once or twice, and you're just like, okay, I've seen everything there is to see in this.
3371000	3373000	So I was a little bit worried of that.
3373000	3376000	I did play a lot of the demos, though, that were on the demo disc.
3376000	3378000	So like one of the ones I liked was Drive Club.
3378000	3381000	A lot of people say that that makes them sick.
3381000	3384000	I never had a problem with motion sickness in that game, though.
3384000	3387000	What I did find funny, though, about it is it's a game that you're supposed to be sitting down in.
3387000	3389000	And so I didn't do that.
3389000	3396000	I stood up or moved my head to the side, so it's like I had my head sticking out of the top of the roof or out the side window and stuff.
3396000	3397000	That was kind of silly.
3397000	3400000	But the game does look like shit graphically.
3400000	3404000	It's just not pretty, but it's all right.
3404000	3409000	The one game I really liked the demo for was Eve Valkyrie.
3409000	3412000	Totally would play that if it was a single-player game.
3412000	3419000	But I hear the single-player campaign is 30 bucks, the game is $60, and it's a multiplayer game, and I'm not playing that.
3419000	3422000	But the demo is so fucking awesome.
3422000	3431000	It's just like, man, if this was Colony Wars or something like that, that was a single-player campaign that was several hours long, I would totally be down for this.
3431000	3437000	But it's just, no, I'm not really into playing a multiplayer online game like that.
3437000	3439000	I played Rigs, which is all right.
3439000	3441000	Same kind of thing with that.
3441000	3443000	It was all right.
3443000	3444000	It was kind of fun to play.
3444000	3450000	It would be more fun like an Armored Core-type game, but I just don't want to play a multiplayer online game.
3450000	3458000	I just am not really interested in that, especially with VR and being kind of not entirely twitchy enough.
3458000	3461000	I guess it's not that sensitive, but I don't know.
3461000	3469000	The Eve Valkyrie demo, man, even just playing it, you just get so psyched when you're playing it, but it's so short.
3469000	3472000	I'm just not going to drop $60 for that short of a campaign, though.
3472000	3475000	It's kind of unfortunate.
3476000	3479000	I didn't end up playing Rez.
3479000	3485000	I thought about picking up Rez, but once again, I think that's something, once I play through it, I'm going to be done with it.
3485000	3487000	That's kind of how I was with the old Rez.
3487000	3491000	And PlayStation Worlds is just a tech demo, so no, I'm not picking that up either.
3491000	3493000	You've got to try Thumper, though, if you haven't.
3493000	3495000	Thumper looked cool.
3495000	3497000	I may try that.
3497000	3499000	I don't know.
3499000	3501000	That might be something I may pick up.
3501000	3504000	I'm just going to wait to see what more stuff comes out for it.
3504000	3509000	I know there's some rollercoaster games and stuff later on that might be kind of fun, but yeah, I'm very hopeful for it.
3509000	3515000	I hope that these tracking issues that they have maybe will be patched out eventually, so I'm hopeful for that.
3515000	3518000	Otherwise, the move controllers work okay.
3518000	3522000	It does have some trouble, especially in Job Simulator, where you can kind of turn all the way around.
3522000	3531000	Obviously, it has trouble tracking the move controllers when they're behind you, so you have some weird stuff that happens with that, but it wasn't terrible.
3531000	3533000	It was all right.
3533000	3540000	Maya in chat says, VR is one of the first times in my life I felt old and cantankerous and uninterested in tech progress in video games.
3540000	3546000	Yeah, I'm a little on that side where it's the whole, after I play it for 20 minutes, I need a break.
3546000	3548000	That's what I'm worried about with it.
3548000	3550000	Oh, I played it for several hours and it wasn't a problem.
3550000	3554000	Wow. I saw the VR available at Target, so it's not sold out everywhere.
3554000	3556000	No, it's not.
3556000	3558000	I thought about it.
3558000	3562000	GameStop in white is, I just checked to see if they had it on the show.
3562000	3567000	I checked to see if any of them had it nearby and one did, so I picked it up and that was that.
3567000	3571000	Yeah, I mean, it's not terribly hard to find.
3571000	3576000	It may be okay to wait a little bit because there's not a whole ton of games out for right now.
3576000	3581000	If some of these multiplayer games aren't really what you're looking for, you might want to wait.
3581000	3588000	I know they're supposed to be adding a VR mode to TrackMania, which that I can see is vomit-inducing,
3588000	3592000	but I do want to play that because TrackMania was an awesome game.
3592000	3596000	That's weird that you say there's not a lot of games when that list we read the other week was gigantic.
3596000	3598000	There's a lot of one-trick pony-type games, right?
3598000	3604000	It's also coming soon stuff and a lot of them are just like, for example, the Star Wars one that they have with Battlefront.
3604000	3607000	That's just a patch to Battlefront, so if you own Battlefront, you get that.
3607000	3610000	But I'm not paying $60 for a tech demo.
3610000	3614000	All right, fair enough. A good question here before we move on.
3614000	3617000	SSJ100Matt says, did Mrs. Loki or the kids try it out?
3617000	3624000	Yeah, my wife tried it out. I put her on the PlayStation Worlds demo that they had,
3624000	3630000	so it's basically the C1 where they drop you down in a cage and you're kind of just drifting down looking at fish.
3630000	3634000	Actually, I think my youngest son would probably like that, but he didn't want to put the headset on.
3634000	3640000	My oldest son, he wanted to try Job Simulator, but his hands are too small for the Move Controller,
3640000	3642000	so he has a hard time reaching the triggers.
3642000	3648000	He still had fun with it, but it's just too hard for him to play, I think, because those controllers are too big for him.
3648000	3653000	And did Mrs. Loki go, I'm okay with you spending the money after playing the demo?
3653000	3659000	Oh no, I just told her that I sold my Oculus Rift to pay for it, which is what I'm going to do.
3659000	3661000	I just haven't quite done it in that order yet.
3661000	3662000	Okay, okay. All right.
3662000	3669000	Because honestly, my Rift, I haven't played it in a long time. It's just sitting in a bag, so you might as well sell it.
3669000	3670000	Sure.
3670000	3673000	Eventually I'll get a Vive or something and I don't need that.
3673000	3677000	Fair enough. All right, anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
3677000	3682000	Just Singress. I've been trying to not play as much, but unfortunately I've played more, so yeah.
3682000	3687000	I kind of know those feels, but that's all right. Moving on to my gaming week.
3687000	3694000	Honestly, it's been a lot of the MMO space. I've still been playing World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV, kind of juggling those games,
3694000	3699000	especially despite some of the things I was saying about Fan Fest last week.
3699000	3707000	Even though the event itself had issues, I still felt very motivated, and probably a lot of that was hanging out with some of my people that I play the game online with.
3707000	3716000	Just the general fact that I just think that game is really great, and it keeps expanding with these patches on things to do, so I've been still playing that.
3716000	3722000	I try not to completely lose sight of the consoles and stuff, but the one other game that did divert me for a little bit this week on PC,
3722000	3726000	you know I had to check out Civilization VI.
3726000	3727000	Of course.
3727000	3730000	It was released this weekend, so of course I had to check it out.
3730000	3738000	Now unfortunately I was out of town all day yesterday, and that would have normally been my time to spend some more quality time with a game that was released on Friday.
3738000	3743000	So I couldn't really spend a lot of time with Civ VI, but I played a little bit.
3743000	3752000	I have a tradition, as I've done with Civ V, and when the expansions came out for that, I will do a new game as the Queen of England, because that's how I always play Civilization.
3752000	3760000	So I started a new game in Civ VI as the Queen of England, and I have to say, I was kind of not ready for how different it feels.
3760000	3765000	And I realized that, okay, it's a sequel. They need to do some things that are different.
3766000	3774000	But even Civ V, I was like, okay, Civ V just feels like, you know, it's kind of like Civ IV, but now it's a lot of hexagons, and okay, they've changed some of the rules too.
3774000	3775000	There's some other things.
3775000	3785000	But like Civ VI, I don't know what it is with the whole fact that, you know, now when you have your, they're not settlers, or not settlers, but workers are now builders.
3785000	3793000	And the builders, you can't just automate anymore. You have to kind of strategically choose what type of building goes in what square in your city,
3793000	3796000	and that's very new for a Civ game, and that really made me stop and think.
3796000	3805000	And then now, there's not just a tech tree, but like culture has a tree that's different from what it was in Civ V, where it was more like a talent tree.
3805000	3807000	Now it's like straight up enhancements as well.
3807000	3814000	So a lot of those differences really kind of left my head spinning, and I'm like, all right, I need to really roll this back and like start as a,
3814000	3821000	I know it asks you in the beginning of the game, are you new to games, are you new to the series, or are you new to Civilization?
3821000	3830000	And kind of tailors the tutorial built on that. I kind of feel like I need to go back and say, I'm new to all these games to really kind of get the stuff from the ground up,
3830000	3835000	because I just felt, boy, I felt lost and out of it. But that doesn't mean I didn't like it.
3835000	3841000	I still, I kind of actually think that's a good thing, that it's so different that it made me really stop and think.
3841000	3847000	But, you know, the presentation and everything, it still felt very Civ, and I know I'm going to have a lot of fun with this.
3847000	3852000	So I'm going to continue to explore this game, lol pun, in the coming days.
3852000	3856000	I just, I honestly maybe spent like an hour and a half tops with it the other day.
3856000	3860000	So I feel like I'm not at a stage where I can really critique the game.
3860000	3865000	I can just say that, you know, wow, I was really kind of woo at first at how different it was from Civ 5.
3865000	3872000	But I'm also really looking forward to being able to play online with some other people and losing an entire weekend to Civilization 6,
3872000	3874000	because that's what these games do to us.
3874000	3880000	I'm sure there will likely come a day where Bobby and I play that game for a very, very,
3880000	3883000	and maybe we can have, because I know Spike from Game Buoy and some of his friends,
3883000	3887000	I think First Mate Slidekick, I know they all played, we used to play Civ 5.
3887000	3890000	So I'm sure we could set up some type of like VOG Hostathon.
3890000	3895000	I don't, when's the Extra Life event? I think Extra Life is the weekend I'm in Chicago, though.
3895000	3900000	But maybe kind of around that we could do some type of marathon event for a charity, some good cause.
3900000	3903000	And it would be very easy to spend all day playing Civ 6.
3903000	3907000	Anyway, we'll have to check everybody's schedules and see if we can work something out.
3907000	3911000	Let's see, going into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3911000	3915000	Kaijuto says, I heard Civ 6 is horseshit.
3915000	3919000	Well, I didn't feel that from the first little bit that I played.
3919000	3924000	I did read a review online that said, it said something completely different than my first impression.
3924000	3927000	The review I read said it's really similar to Civ 5.
3927000	3929000	And like, I didn't get that at all.
3929000	3934000	But maybe I didn't play, I mean, I played a bit of Civ 5.
3934000	3937000	But I didn't play it a long, long, long time like a lot of people did.
3937000	3939000	Maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something there.
3939000	3944000	Let's see, DungeonBuster says, I won Civ 6, but I've been playing Shadow Warrior 2.
3944000	3948000	SSG100Matt says, I forgot Civ 6 came out.
3948000	3950000	It's for the best, I didn't get it right away.
3950000	3954000	Otherwise, I would turn around and realize that it's Tuesday and I still want to do one more turn.
3955000	3958000	And Kaijuto is saying, people are saying they turned Civ into a tablet game.
3960000	3962000	That was like Civilization Revolutions, wasn't it though?
3962000	3964000	Yeah, that was the tablet game.
3964000	3966000	See, but here's the crazy thing.
3966000	3970000	They also had Civilization Revolution on the Xbox 360.
3970000	3973000	And I really liked that game for what it was.
3973000	3976000	Like, I didn't see it as a tablet game so much as I saw it as like a...
3976000	3981000	It was more like the original Civilization than anything else they'd put out around that time.
3981000	3984000	And because maybe I remember the original Civilization the best,
3984000	3986000	and that's the one that really made me fall in love with the series,
3986000	3990000	maybe that's why I'm a little bit partial to it, but I don't know.
3990000	3995000	I guess I could see though, I mean, if all you're using is your mouse for point and clicking,
3995000	3997000	I mean, you could probably do the same thing on a tablet.
3997000	4002000	But I didn't really walk away with that impression that like, oh, this was designed for an iPad.
4002000	4005000	Like, it seems to look better than that on my monitor.
4005000	4007000	I didn't walk away with that impression.
4007000	4014000	So, SSG100Matt says, is it a different jump like Civ IV to Civ V to Civ Revolution,
4014000	4017000	or Civ V to Civ Beyond Earth?
4017000	4025000	I would say for Civ VI, I would say it's kind of like...
4025000	4028000	I guess Civ V to Beyond Earth is a decent comparison,
4028000	4033000	but Beyond Earth was still in the Civ V engine, so there was a lot of feeling in that.
4033000	4038000	And this one is definitely, you know, they've kind of gone back and reinvented everything,
4038000	4041000	but I would say that comparison is probably a little closer,
4041000	4045000	because Civ IV and V were really stripped down for Civ Revolution,
4045000	4048000	and I don't think this game's been stripped down at all.
4048000	4055000	So, anyway, that's my initial thoughts on a few quick minutes with Civilization VI.
4055000	4059000	So, let's get into some housekeeping, and then we'll get into the news.
4059000	4063000	First, we will not be having a show on November 13th.
4063000	4065000	That's Veterans Day weekend. I will be out of town.
4065000	4072000	However, we will be doing something, because we have to have an Episode 665 of some sort
4072000	4075000	to keep us on track to have Episode 666 on 20 November.
4075000	4079000	So, we will do something pre-recorded.
4079000	4081000	It just might be a shorter show, but it won't be live.
4081000	4086000	So, you folks that turn out here live, you'll undoubtedly get to hear something new
4086000	4089000	at 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock that night, depending on your time zone,
4089000	4090000	but it won't be live, just so you know.
4090000	4093000	Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r,
4093000	4097000	or we are on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
4097000	4100000	Gaming news, there was a lot of it. Let's get to it. Loki.
4100000	4107000	Yeah, so, apparently the SAG-AFTRA unit has officially called for a voice actor strike
4107000	4112000	against several gaming companies, including Activision, EA, and Take-Two.
4112000	4119000	They did say that this is due to, I guess, failing to renegotiate their contracts
4119000	4121000	with the terms that they wanted.
4121000	4131000	Basically, this could possibly affect games that went into production after February 17th of 2015.
4131000	4136000	So, maybe some of these games that are on the slate for next year and stuff.
4136000	4138000	That's kind of unfortunate.
4138000	4145000	I know that some of the names I saw on there, they had quite a few well-known voice actors
4145000	4147000	that are a part of that.
4147000	4150000	I know I saw Jennifer Hale on the list.
4150000	4154000	Will Wheaton had an article about it on his blog, even though I don't think,
4154000	4156000	well, I guess he is participating in it one way or another,
4156000	4159000	although he doesn't do a lot of voice acting.
4159000	4161000	I know he's done some for games.
4161000	4164000	So, yeah, it's definitely impacting.
4164000	4167000	There was also a list out there of what games it impacts,
4167000	4170000	and it does not affect Mass Effect Andromeda,
4170000	4174000	but I would imagine because the voice acting in that game has probably already been sealed up.
4174000	4176000	They're not doing any more work on that.
4176000	4181000	But if there were to be DLC to come for that game, then that would be at a pause,
4181000	4183000	depending on how far they are with that.
4183000	4187000	But I think a lot of us are hoping they work out these differences relatively quickly
4187000	4189000	so that this doesn't get...
4189000	4194000	Right, because I remember the acting strike, or the writer strike that they had for TV and stuff,
4194000	4196000	that kind of fucked up a lot of shit.
4196000	4200000	Yeah, that killed the TV show Heroes. Remember that?
4200000	4205000	Yeah, well, season two kind of sucked too, but you know, that's here.
4205000	4207000	Well, that was the season that got abbreviated by the strike.
4207000	4209000	It was supposed to go longer, but it didn't. Anyway.
4209000	4213000	Thank God they cut it short, put it out of its misery. Shit, man.
4213000	4217000	What do you think? I've been reading a little bit on the strike,
4217000	4224000	and our buddy Rama texted me to a Facebook post that a prominent voice actor has made,
4224000	4229000	and I do get a lot of their concerns. I mean, especially when we talk about the whole fact that,
4229000	4233000	you know, four hours of screaming, you know, and recording those voices,
4233000	4235000	that is going to take a toll on the voice.
4235000	4240000	You know, when we do this show here, you know, we can do this for three hours, but...
4240000	4242000	I like the feeling of three hours of screaming sometimes.
4242000	4245000	Sometimes you do, and I don't know how your voice doesn't hurt the next day.
4245000	4249000	But for the most part, maybe Loki aside, we're not sitting here screaming constantly
4249000	4251000	for the entire time the show is on.
4251000	4254000	But I will tell you this. You guys have all heard this show,
4254000	4259000	is that you guys know that sometimes I host sometimes, and I do that type of stuff.
4259000	4262000	I host theater, specifically a lot of Rocky Horror,
4262000	4264000	although that's going to be more cult movies in December.
4264000	4269000	But actually, funny enough, here in SAC, we have a Rocky Horror show coming up next week.
4269000	4273000	So I can tell you right now, when I host Rocky Horror on Saturday night,
4273000	4279000	that's not even three hours. That's like maybe 30 minutes of me having to use a very loud,
4279000	4282000	boisterous voice while I'm doing the pre-show and doing some light stand-up
4282000	4288000	and doing the initiations and things like that. That's like 30 minutes, maybe.
4288000	4291000	I will come in here on Sunday and my voice will sound like this.
4291000	4293000	Like, I will not have a good voice.
4293000	4298000	So I can't imagine doing something like that for, I mean, God, two hours, let alone four.
4298000	4300000	Especially if you're doing, like, weird voices and stuff. Who knows?
4300000	4303000	It's even harder when you change up your voice.
4303000	4308000	So a lot of those safety concerns I get, and I also understand a lot of the concerns
4308000	4312000	when it comes to the secrecy of the projects that are involved.
4312000	4316000	And they did make a very good point about, like, sometimes the things are so clamped down
4316000	4320000	that they can't really necessarily get a sense of what the character is and all this other stuff.
4320000	4323000	And so, I mean, reading the post made a lot of sense.
4323000	4326000	And the Wil Wheaton post is really good, too, in laying that all out there.
4326000	4331000	Now, I also, just so you know, I also can see a little bit of it from the other side
4331000	4335000	where they're saying, why should the actors get residual payments
4335000	4339000	when nobody else who works on the game and develops the game gets residual payments?
4339000	4341000	Yeah, I kind of, you know.
4341000	4347000	I don't know. And a lot of the response I feel like I'm seeing, at least based on comments,
4347000	4350000	so take it with a grain of salt, but a lot of the response I'm seeing is,
4350000	4353000	well, maybe those people need to ask for it, too.
4353000	4360000	I don't know. I can sort of see where the residual payment, like, I get that.
4360000	4365000	Especially, like, if you're marketing your game based on the fact that, let's say,
4365000	4369000	Mark Hamill is back doing The Joker, and that's a big selling point for your game,
4369000	4373000	then, yeah, he's probably entitled to some residuals.
4373000	4376000	But I'm not saying that the programmers and some of the people behind the scenes
4376000	4379000	don't necessarily deserve some of those as well.
4379000	4384000	But I think the more immediate thing that they really need to figure out is some of these safety concerns.
4384000	4389000	You know, the safety with the motion capture, the safety with the four hours of screaming and all this stuff.
4389000	4392000	I do think there's a valid argument to be made there.
4392000	4396000	This contract hasn't really been looked at since, what, the 90s?
4396000	4398000	It was probably the last time they did this.
4398000	4404000	When Tim Curry was starring in Gabriel Knight was how long ago, and not that remake.
4404000	4406000	I could do a whole show on that.
4406000	4411000	But anyway, when Tim Curry was doing Gabriel Knight, it was just different then.
4411000	4414000	It was completely different than the industry is now.
4414000	4418000	So I can see why a lot of this needs to be reevaluated.
4418000	4422000	Regardless, I hope they're able to solve it sooner rather than later.
4422000	4425000	And especially these safety issues.
4425000	4427000	So, we'll see.
4427000	4431000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4431000	4436000	Raginator says, I wouldn't mind three hours of Sky's diva rants on OLR.
4436000	4438000	Be careful what you ask for.
4438000	4444000	SSG100Matt says, from what I've heard from going to voice acting panels,
4444000	4447000	some of these developers can really screw over these actors.
4447000	4451000	Like making them do all the yelling and screaming lines in the beginning of the sessions,
4451000	4454000	and not the end, resulting in ruined voices for a while.
4454000	4460000	ActDef says, basically, Voice Actors Guild needs to be on par with the Screen Actors Guild,
4460000	4461000	or almost on par.
4461000	4464000	Well, that's kind of what this is, because SAG is Screen Actors Guild,
4464000	4467000	so a lot of these folks are represented by Screen Actors Guild,
4467000	4473000	which merged a few years ago with AFTRA, which, sorry guys in the industry,
4473000	4474000	don't be mad if I get this wrong,
4474000	4479000	but I think covers a lot more of the Broadway talent, like live theater and those sorts of things.
4479000	4480000	There's probably more to it as well.
4480000	4484000	But generally, it just involves acting in all different types of forms,
4484000	4487000	and that would, of course, be an umbrella for voice acting as well.
4487000	4491000	So, anyhow, I hope they're able to figure that out,
4491000	4495000	because, again, you know, we're going to feel it with some of the game releases,
4495000	4498000	and if you think we've got a drought of games this year,
4499000	4504000	I mean, if this goes on for a while, that could cause some games to get delayed.
4504000	4506000	I mean, it could cause, I don't know.
4506000	4510000	Do you think AAA studios would look to using non-union talent?
4511000	4515000	I know this is a highly controversial issue that we probably have no authority to speak on whatsoever,
4515000	4517000	but it's not stopping Twitter from doing it,
4517000	4524000	so do you think that these AAA companies would be bold enough to use non-union talent?
4524000	4527000	I'm telling you, Gilbert Gottfried's going to get so much work now.
4527000	4529000	Gilbert Gottfried's under SAG, though.
4529000	4531000	He would be able to do it.
4531000	4535000	You'll see more contests like the one BioWare had a couple weeks ago to get in the mat.
4535000	4537000	Remember when we acted out that scene on air?
4537000	4539000	Which, by the way, no phone call from EA.
4539000	4540000	Isn't that disappointing?
4540000	4542000	That's so disappointing, Louie.
4542000	4544000	Anyway, all right.
4544000	4549000	Moving on, let's talk about one of those games that could be impacted.
4549000	4551000	This is Rumor, tinfoil hat.
4551000	4555000	Get out the wheel of plausibility for this one.
4557000	4560000	Oh, wait. Oh, didn't we have a theme song for the wheel of plausibility?
4560000	4561000	I think we did.
4565000	4570000	It's time to spin the wheel of plausibility.
4570000	4572000	All right, I'm already over that song.
4572000	4577000	Could Diablo IV be something that is revealed at BlizzCon 2016?
4577000	4579000	Could it? Because it is a Blizzard game.
4579000	4581000	Therefore, yes, it could be.
4581000	4586000	And apparently what's causing all this is a four-sided die.
4586000	4590000	It's a D4 die that I get.
4590000	4593000	Is that being found in a BlizzCon bag or what?
4593000	4594000	I guess something.
4594000	4600000	They're finding a D4 die is somehow associated with BlizzCon and Blizzard.
4600000	4604000	And I guess the numbers are printed wrong on this die.
4604000	4609000	And the dates that it reads are the dates for BlizzCon 2016, November 4th.
4609000	4613000	So could Diablo IV be happening on November 4th?
4613000	4619000	Also, I guess somebody had spotted, somebody over at PC Gamer was reporting that David Breivik,
4619000	4627000	who is a project lead on Diablo II, and senior producer Bill Roper were spotted at Blizzard headquarters.
4627000	4630000	And this is just adding fuel to the fire.
4630000	4634000	So could Diablo be happening at BlizzCon, Diablo IV?
4634000	4636000	Well, here's the thing.
4636000	4639000	Something Diablo is happening at BlizzCon.
4639000	4641000	It makes complete fucking sense.
4641000	4644000	World of Warcraft's expansion released two months ago.
4644000	4647000	They're not going to release a new expansion.
4647000	4649000	They're not even going to announce a new expansion for Warcraft.
4649000	4651000	I mean, this isn't Sims we're talking about here.
4651000	4654000	Overwatch, I feel, is still a little new.
4654000	4656000	You might get your new character.
4656000	4662000	This whole Sombra thing might happen at BlizzCon, but I don't see any radical changes with Overwatch.
4662000	4666000	Maybe StarCraft, there's been those rumors of a remaster.
4666000	4672000	I don't know, but this really leaves Diablo as the franchise that is going to have some attention paid to it this year.
4672000	4675000	But Diablo IV? I don't know.
4675000	4679000	I kind of think it's an expansion for Diablo III.
4679000	4684000	Because the story at the end of the last expansion was kind of left wide open for in Act 6.
4684000	4687000	I suppose that could go into a new game.
4687000	4693000	I suppose there's a lot of reasons why Blizzard might want to just jump into Diablo IV.
4693000	4702000	And a lot of it is probably tied to the fact that there is still negative stigma around Diablo III because of the way it was when it launched in the Auction House and all that stuff.
4702000	4707000	Even though Diablo III now is completely different from when it launched.
4707000	4710000	And I think it's a game that's definitely worth checking out.
4710000	4715000	But I just don't know. I have a hard time believing it's all the way to Diablo IV.
4715000	4718000	I tend to think it's a new expansion before I think it's Diablo IV.
4718000	4725000	But if it is Diablo IV, cool. I guess I'll be curious to see what kind of changes and updates they make to it.
4725000	4729000	But Loki, you don't really care because you don't play Diablo, huh?
4729000	4731000	I don't, unfortunately.
4731000	4734000	You know, all that stuff is on consoles, too, though.
4734000	4738000	I know. Every time I see a game, I tend to buy it, but I just never do.
4738000	4744000	S2100matt in chat says, just sitting here waiting for a Lost Vikings sequel. Maybe someday.
4744000	4753000	By the way, speaking of Blizzard, their Battle.net launcher, which of course is used on PC to launch the various multiplayer games such as Diablo or World of Warcraft.
4753000	4757000	It just added voice chat into it.
4757000	4760000	Yeah, we're not supposed to call it Battle.net anymore. Remember that?
4760000	4764000	No, it's still Battle.net to me, so I'm breaking the rule.
4764000	4768000	The Battle.net launcher has added voice chat into it.
4768000	4771000	So Blizzard voice is what they're calling it.
4771000	4775000	And it is a voice chat that will work across the different multiplayer titles.
4775000	4780000	So it's kind of like Steam's voice chat since, you know, Blizzard games aren't on Steam and you have the separate launcher for it.
4780000	4788000	So you can talk to friends or even friends of friends inside or even outside of games as long as you have the Battle.net program open.
4788000	4797000	And this will allow you to talk to people like, so I could be playing World of Warcraft and my buddy could be playing Overwatch and I could talk to them across those games.
4797000	4805000	Which, I mean, it's Xbox Live on your PC for things that are through the Battle.net launcher.
4805000	4809000	So they're talking about high quality voice and superior stability.
4809000	4815000	I'd be very curious what this is going to do for things like Warcraft rating.
4815000	4820000	Because we used to use Ventrilo, but I would imagine services like that are starting to fade.
4820000	4825000	Especially now that Discord has a pretty good voice chat in it and that's becoming an option for a lot of gamers.
4825000	4828000	A lot of my Final Fantasy XIV stuff is going to Discord.
4828000	4834000	And then I know, you know, now that these games have it built in is a big thing for people as well.
4834000	4836000	So, anyway.
4836000	4846000	Also, you are not able to talk to friends that are, excuse me, you can't talk to people that are not in your friends list during random pickup games.
4846000	4849000	That still has to be enabled, I would imagine, by the game.
4849000	4853000	So I guess you can do it in Overwatch, but you can't do it in, say, Diablo.
4853000	4857000	World of Warcraft at one time had voice chat built into it, but it was awful.
4857000	4861000	I wonder if they haven't stripped it out of the game to replace with this.
4861000	4863000	So, anyway.
4863000	4865000	That is what's going on with Blizzard.
4865000	4870000	Of course, their big convention is, what, less than two weeks away at this point.
4870000	4873000	So I'm sure we'll hear plenty more very soon.
4873000	4875000	Meanwhile, Loki, other big gaming news this week.
4875000	4881000	Yeah, so this week, not only actually the same day as the Switch video they had.
4881000	4885000	They had the first trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2.
4885000	4891000	So that'll be coming out fall of 2017 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4891000	4894000	Nothing announced yet for, like, PC.
4894000	4903000	But one of the things that they did announce was that there's gonna be select content for Red Dead Redemption 2 that'll come first to PlayStation 4.
4903000	4912000	So they're gonna have a brand new online multiplayer experience that'll be coming first to PlayStation 4.
4912000	4915000	So the way I picture that is just, like, Grand Theft Auto Online.
4915000	4917000	I'm guessing that they're talking about, like, content.
4917000	4923000	Like, how they do the free expansion, not free expansions, but, like, free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online.
4923000	4927000	So that'll be similar with, like, Red Dead Online or whatever the case may be for that.
4927000	4929000	Cool.
4929000	4931000	I mean, the trailer was pretty.
4931000	4934000	Definitely something they'll pick up when it comes out.
4934000	4936000	And that's important, a pretty trailer.
4936000	4939000	We don't know too much about it, but it sure looks nice.
4939000	4942000	I mean, that's all we have to go by.
4942000	4949000	Yeah, I don't know. I have to admit, I didn't really get super into the last Red Dead Redemption.
4949000	4951000	But I thought it was neat.
4951000	4957000	But, you know, again, it's just one of those games that MMOs keep me away from playing and all the other stuff that I tend to play as well.
4957000	4959000	So there you go.
4959000	4965000	However, one game that I did take a little time out to play, and I need to go back and play it again a little more, is Doom.
4965000	4969000	Because Doom now has an arcade mode in it.
4969000	4971000	Yes, that's right. Doom got an update this week.
4971000	4974000	It was the fourth free update that they've done on Steam.
4974000	4976000	And it added the arcade mode.
4976000	4987000	Arcade mode now unlocks all guns, suit upgrades, runes, and you now play in a multiplayer-based scoring system that rewards aggression and accuracy.
4987000	4991000	You play every level with all guns, runes, and equipment fully unlocked.
4991000	4999000	You compete against friends and players worldwide for the highest score by attacking demons quickly, avoiding attacks, and grabbing multipliers on the way.
4999000	5001000	So I guess it's a more fast-paced thing.
5001000	5003000	I want to check this out. It sounds pretty cool.
5003000	5010000	And there also is another Doom multiplayer pack called Hell Followed that's coming out on October 27th.
5010000	5014000	So man, they're keeping the updates coming for that new Doom game.
5014000	5021000	Which, you know, it really is one of the better releases of the year, I think, which was kind of surprising.
5021000	5026000	Because I think with a lot of these reboots, sometimes they miss the mark, but Doom's pretty awesome.
5026000	5037000	And the fact that they continue to support it with a good balance between free and DLC and paid stuff, I think just does the game even more credit, to be honest.
5037000	5041000	So, snaps for you folks making Doom.
5041000	5043000	Moving on, Loki.
5043000	5050000	Alright, so this is kind of unfortunate, but United Friends Games has apparently shut down.
5050000	5060000	United Friends Games, they were responsible for some of the Sony games, ModNation Racers, Little Big Planet Karting, and then more recently Sleeping Dogs.
5060000	5066000	And apparently they were working on a multiplayer brawler game called Smash and Grab.
5066000	5074000	But I guess it just recently hit Steam Early Access, but I'm guessing now that...
5074000	5082000	I don't know. Is that not being finished now? Like most Steam Early Access games, I guess?
5082000	5085000	Yeah, that's unfortunate.
5085000	5090000	Yeah, it's never good news when game studios close, you know?
5090000	5104000	Yeah. So apparently, yeah, they rumored to be closing based off of, I guess, a post on NeoGaf, and then GameSpot had confirmed it with somebody close to the studio, so that's unfortunate.
5104000	5112000	Alright, moving on to some news out of Sony and what's going on with PlayStation tournaments.
5113000	5122000	Earlier this week, Sony announced that they are teaming up with ESL, which is a gaming network, and they're going to be hosting a digital, month-long basketball tournament.
5122000	5125000	And this is going to be through NBA 2K17.
5125000	5133000	So from October 27th, which is this coming week, through November 26th, there are going to be major cup rounds every Saturday.
5133000	5136000	And the tournament is based on NBA 2K17.
5136000	5142000	If you're one of the top three players at the end of the tournament, you get a prize pack with PlayStation gear, controllers, and all that good stuff.
5142000	5146000	Of course, if you want to participate, you do need the game to be able to play.
5146000	5149000	You do have to have a PlayStation Plus subscription, I imagine, so you can play online.
5149000	5154000	And you do want to get an account with the ESL gaming site.
5154000	5161000	So you have to register for the tournament beforehand at ESL, and then you're automatically prompted when your time to compete comes.
5161000	5163000	No idea how large the player pool's going to be.
5163000	5166000	Everything, though, they are saying one versus one.
5166000	5171000	And Sony wants to expand this with other tournaments moving forward.
5171000	5173000	So that's kind of cool.
5173000	5182000	And Microsoft, of course, did something similar at Game Developers Conference when they talked about the Xbox Live tournament platform, which allows folks to make tournaments via Xbox Live.
5182000	5187000	So it's only logical that Sony kind of makes a similar step with this.
5187000	5196000	Of course, since sports games aren't really up my alley, I can appreciate that they exist and that they bring a lot more gamers into the market.
5196000	5200000	But so this particular tournament, I can't say I'm getting super excited about.
5200000	5207000	But, you know, maybe it would be cool if there were tournaments for other types of games as well, not just necessarily sports games.
5207000	5210000	And I'm sure we will see that if things like this do well.
5210000	5216000	So to be continued, maybe I'll get a tournament for Diablo 4 in 2019. Who knows?
5217000	5218000	Who knows?
5218000	5221000	All right. Loki, before we get to the classic game of the week, what do you have?
5221000	5225000	So there was a mod that was made for Grand Theft Auto 5 that was kind of silly.
5225000	5234000	It replaced the sticky mines or the C4 that you have with a Samsung Galaxy Note.
5234000	5240000	Because, you know, that's silly. Someone basically can throw that and it sticks to something and it explodes.
5240000	5249000	And so they had a video that was on YouTube. And then, of course, it got a DMCA takedown from Samsung and they didn't apparently like it too much.
5249000	5259000	However, recently, YouTube, though, has reinstated the video because the creator filed a counterclaim against Samsung.
5259000	5261000	But so you can go check it out.
5261000	5272000	That's kind of unfortunate that people are using DMCA to, you know, well, what? Abusive automated systems on YouTube? You don't say.
5272000	5276000	Did you see that whole thing? I think it was Reddit or Twitter or somebody had this linked.
5276000	5285000	But like some guys got a threatening email that said, give us a thousand dollars or we're going to get your we're going to copyright strike your YouTube channel out of existence.
5285000	5290000	And they did it. They didn't pay the thousand dollars. They got they got copyright striked out of existence.
5290000	5293000	And that really just makes me go, wow, I don't want to ever.
5293000	5299000	Yeah. Isn't that wonderful that YouTube heroes exist so that we can now have people do that even quicker?
5299000	5301000	That's so fucking fantastic, YouTube.
5301000	5306000	Yeah. YouTube needs to fix this. There needs to be recourse against fakers.
5306000	5311000	And I think stuff like this is only just going to make this happen even even faster.
5311000	5316000	At least I hope it does. Or else YouTube is going to, you know, some folks are trying to up the competition now.
5316000	5319000	There's what? There's this vid me is something newer that's coming out.
5319000	5325000	The Twitch for gaming Twitch allowing the uploads on their side now. That's pretty big step.
5325000	5329000	So, I mean, YouTube kind of needs to figure this out or they're going to.
5329000	5336000	It's just it's being abused. And the bad thing about it, too, is it's, you know, one of their complaints, the channel that got taken down.
5336000	5342000	They're saying that, you know, if they were a larger channel, YouTube would have resolved this already.
5342000	5349000	But because their numbers are smaller, that YouTube doesn't give a shit about them. And I kind of feel that's the case.
5349000	5354000	Oh, for sure. For sure. There needs to be some type of legal recourse that these guys can take with the fakers.
5354000	5360000	And yeah, could they even I know this might sound ridiculous, but I have to throw it out there.
5360000	5365000	Could they could they attempt to like sue? This is crazy.
5365000	5373000	But sue YouTube for lost income that their videos could be granting because it was fake and that they have evidence that they were blackmailed or whatever.
5373000	5378000	Well, I don't really know if they can. I mean, because I'm not a lawyer. That should be obvious.
5378000	5385000	Well, they have a lawyer that's already helping out Ryan Morrison, the video game attorney. He's, you know, kind of jumped in to help him out.
5385000	5397000	They contacted Fupo, which is that H3H3 Productions created a bunch of different YouTubers created this like account that those guys can't fix every single start.
5397000	5400000	It shouldn't be their job to fix it. It should be YouTube's.
5400000	5410000	Right. But YouTube is a fucking clusterfuck. So they just. They can't. There's too many things going on, but there's not a humans checking all this shit.
5410000	5417000	Yeah. No, I guess there's no easy answer. All right. Well, let's let's travel back to a simpler time.
5417000	5423000	We're going to go back to a time when you didn't have YouTube and copyright strike or any of that stuff.
5423000	5429000	It's time to go to the classic game of the week.
5429000	5438000	But regretfully, our magic machine is broken this week and there is no radio magic this week to bring dark soccer to the show this week.
5438000	5443000	So I apologize for that, but we'll work on getting that fixed so that we can have her here next week.
5443000	5449000	So we're going to do what we do when dark soccer is off for other reasons other than a long term absence.
5449000	5451000	Which, by the way, I did hear from her this week, at least.
5451000	5456000	And she does think that things are going to work out where she will be able to come back to the show in January.
5456000	5459000	I think this early January. So around the holidays.
5459000	5463000	So that's good. But we're going to do what we did usually when she would miss out on the show.
5463000	5466000	And I'm going to pick a classic game of the week or Loki would.
5466000	5469000	But we decided I'll do it this week. Maybe to my Halo pick.
5469000	5475000	But, you know, I said I don't want to get that phone call. I do not want that phone call.
5475000	5479000	So let's get to the classic game of the week. And I picked a game on the Game Boy.
5479000	5483000	And it's a it's a game that I remember. I figured it was a Nintendo week.
5483000	5489000	So I'll do something with the Game Boy. And this is a game that I remember playing an awful lot of when it first came out.
5489000	5497000	And it's called Moto Cross Maniacs is the name of this. Did you ever play Moto Cross Maniacs on the Game Boy?
5497000	5501000	Old school member, old school title on the Game Boy.
5501000	5506000	It was a game that was by Konami. And it was kind of which is interesting because I had no idea that it was by.
5506000	5511000	Sorry, the audio on that is really loud. Sorry. I had no idea that that was a Konami game.
5511000	5517000	Although, yeah, I still remember this kind of hear it in the audio because it looks like it could be like a sequel to.
5518000	5527000	Excitebike. Excitebike, doesn't it? And I think that's part of the reason I picked it up was originally when I was younger is because it looked like it was like a sequel to Excitebike.
5527000	5533000	It was actually by Ultra Games, which was Konami. That was Konami. That was the way they got around things in the US.
5533000	5540000	But anyway, what you do in this game is you control a motorcycle and it moves pretty much in one direction, which is similar to Excitebike.
5540000	5546000	But in Excitebike, you could kind of you have that fakie 3D effect where you can move up and down the different lanes.
5546000	5552000	No, Motocross Maniacs doesn't have that. Remember, this was on the original black and white Game Boy. It wasn't that complex.
5552000	5558000	But what it had instead was that, you know, you could do all these wheelies and you were flying on ramps.
5558000	5571000	And not only were you flying on like normal ramps, but you were flying on stuff that didn't exist in real life, like loops and like double, like you'd hop from one loop to another loop and be flying all around.
5571000	5579000	You know, it was just it was fun to play when I was a kid. You would use your nitro boost just at the right time when you're going over one of these slopes and you would go flying.
5579000	5584000	Now, that was a lot like Excitebike on the NES. So that's where some of those comparisons come from.
5584000	5588000	But some of these levels are just like insane with the type of stuff that they're doing.
5588000	5593000	And of course, ridiculous things that would not exist in real life, like platforms floating in midair.
5594000	5599000	But who cares? It's a video game. It's the Game Boy. See, look at that, Logie. Two loops. See that in the video right there? Two loops.
5599000	5600000	Oh, my God.
5600000	5605000	I got hit back to back. Whoa, that's like Sonic the Hedgehog right there. But on a Game Boy.
5605000	5612000	Anyway, you control the motorcycle and you can move the front wheel upwards or downwards.
5612000	5616000	You do have a limited amount of fuel, but they call it a time bar in the game.
5616000	5619000	And so you have to complete the course before you run out of fuel.
5619000	5624000	You do have a limited amount of speed boosts and there are letters like NTR.
5624000	5629000	I'm sorry. NTR is actually what you see in the bottom of the screen. NTR is short for Nitro.
5629000	5636000	But you can pick up more boosts like N, which is additional boosts.
5636000	5641000	There's also extra fuel, which is the T. There is special tires, which is the R.
5641000	5646000	And then there's also an S that's increased speed. So that'll help you move even faster.
5646000	5650000	You can also do combos by doing like front flips and back flips.
5650000	5656000	And doing combos will get you a flying booster, which you'll see the little word jet appear.
5656000	5659000	That will let you jump super high if you actually use super boosts.
5659000	5665000	Also what was really cool about this game, again, for the Game Boy, which was released in North America.
5665000	5669000	By the way, this game was out January 1990 in North America.
5669000	5673000	And this was one of the earlier releases. It wasn't a launch title, but it was right around.
5673000	5681000	It was the next wave of games. Japan, this game was out on September 20th of 1989.
5681000	5686000	But there were multiple paths that you could go in some of the levels.
5686000	5690000	The first level is pretty straightforward, but then later on you had multiple directions that you could go in.
5690000	5694000	And one of the directions would have other power-ups in it as well.
5694000	5698000	So you had to get those boosts down and use your nitros just at the right time.
5698000	5702000	So you could fly different ways and get through the different courses.
5702000	5706000	There are eight levels in the game, which of course get harder and harder as you move along.
5706000	5708000	You can select any level at the beginning of the game.
5708000	5713000	There's also A, B, and C difficulty level, which will change the time that you have to complete.
5713000	5719000	And then there is single player, single versus computer, and single player versus second player.
5719000	5723000	Where the second player will appear as a silhouette behind you.
5723000	5728000	And you might remember in the days when the Game Boy was first released, it was huge on that link cable, right?
5728000	5733000	So you'd use the link cable to link up to another Game Boy, and then you could actually play against somebody head to head.
5733000	5738000	And there's that little Game Link logo right on the box to let you know that you could do that.
5738000	5744000	And there's really not... I mean, it was a Game Boy game, so it was pretty simple, but it was one that I remember owning and really enjoying.
5744000	5747000	So that's why I picked it as the Classic Game of the Week.
5747000	5750000	Moto Cross Maniacs is the Classic Game of the Week.
5750000	5752000	Loki, you never played it at all.
5752000	5755000	I may have. I never had a Game Boy. My friend did.
5755000	5760000	So I may have played it on his, but it's... God, that was years ago.
5760000	5767000	I do want to say, you know what this also... The game reminds me of Uniracers, which came out a long time later on Super Nintendo.
5767000	5771000	But that was a Nintendo, or at least one of their in-house dev teams that did that, if I remember right.
5771000	5773000	So that felt a lot like this.
5773000	5780000	This game in some ways I think was ahead of its time, but the Game Boy platform kind of limits what it can do, I think.
5780000	5784000	Because, you know, the Game Boy was a real simple piece of hardware.
5784000	5786000	You know, it couldn't do super complex stuff.
5786000	5788000	So, there it is.
5788000	5791000	Moto Cross Maniacs. Check that out.
5791000	5793000	Although I don't know if it's aged well.
5793000	5797000	I don't know if you play it in an emulator, you're going to get the same thrill that you get on an actual Game Boy.
5797000	5801000	But I think it is on Virtual Console. I could be wrong, but I think you can't get that on Virtual Console.
5801000	5805000	Yeah, that would be a nice game we'd have a remake of, would be Uniracers. I like that game.
5805000	5808000	Oh, Uniracers was fun. I love the game. I should have done that as Classic Game of the Week. Maybe next time.
5808000	5810000	Yep. Maybe next time.
5810000	5815000	Although, next time we want to hear Dark Sakura back here through the magic of radio.
5815000	5820000	But anyway, since we didn't have the magic machine working this week, we are going to take a quick music break.
5820000	5823000	But we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5823000	5828000	We've got rapid fire news in stores this week, the mailbag, although I'm not sure if we had anything in there.
5828000	5832000	A few more stories, and of course, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5832000	5836000	All that is coming up when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5838000	5851000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 662 for this October the 23rd of 2016.
5851000	5855000	And boy, that felt weird. It's been weeks since we've taken a music break.
5855000	5860000	And you know, I miss Dark Sakura. I wish she was still here so we could take music breaks more often.
5860000	5866000	But that was nice. I know I can't play these on the podcast feed because otherwise it's copyright and all that stuff.
5866000	5870000	But we played the new Christopher Tin song from Civilization VI.
5870000	5874000	If you guys haven't heard it, it's out there on YouTube. You can check it out very easy.
5874000	5876000	Or, you know, just check out Civilization VI.
5876000	5881000	But the song that he does in that game, which translates to the Dream of Flight,
5881000	5885000	which I believe is the music on the menu music, is really good.
5885000	5888000	And a lot of our chat responded very positively to that.
5888000	5892000	A lot of folks didn't even realize he had done contributions for Civilization VI.
5892000	5895000	So there you go. I'm glad we could have done that there, at least for you live listeners.
5895000	5899000	For you podcast folks, though, you get a whole internet out there. I'm sure you will find it.
5899000	5903000	But be sure you join us here live sometimes. You don't miss out on that stuff.
5903000	5906000	Sunday nights, of course, at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
5906000	5910000	And yes, I know if you don't watch The Walking Dead, some bitch is going to spoil it for you.
5910000	5916000	But you know what? I've never seen an episode of that show, so I don't know what everybody's getting so excited about.
5916000	5919000	I just don't. But hey, that's fine. That's fine.
5919000	5923000	There's a lot of shows now. I don't know if you've had the same experience, Loki,
5923000	5927000	but having this show on Sunday nights has ruined so much TV for me.
5927000	5930000	I never get to see Game of Thrones. I never see Walking Dead.
5930000	5933000	What's the other show that's on Sunday nights on AMC?
5933000	5935000	Is there another big one? I don't know.
5935000	5940000	But there's all these Sunday night shows that I never get to see and I just don't get as excited about.
5940000	5941000	I don't know.
5941000	5942000	There's always Netflix.
5942000	5945000	I'm sure they're fine shows. I'm not shading them or whatever.
5945000	5948000	It's just, you know, we're doing this instead. It's all good.
5948000	5952000	Maya in chat says Westworld. Is that another Sunday night show? I haven't heard a lot about that.
5952000	5955000	Yeah, that's what some of the watch was, Westworld.
5955000	5958000	I've heard that one too. For me, it's like, I got to do Netflix shows.
5958000	5963000	That's like Stranger Things. That was great because it was also, it was only eight episodes.
5963000	5968000	You can watch Black Mirror. That's another good one. We just started watching season three of that.
5968000	5973000	I think Shane was talking about that like right after we taped Pokestop Podcast this morning,
5973000	5977000	is that he was talking about the, which by the way, new episode of Pokestop.
5977000	5981000	Kind of like Twilight Zone about technology.
5981000	5983000	Is it from the UK too?
5983000	5984000	Yeah.
5984000	5987000	Okay. That's what I thought. Yeah, he was talking about that and he said he's a really big fan of that.
5987000	5988000	So I have to check that out.
5988000	5992000	Season three has been okay. The first episode of season three I did not like. It was kind of boring.
5992000	5994000	The other ones have been all right.
5994000	5999000	All right. I got it. There's a ton of documentaries on Netflix I want to watch too.
5999000	6002000	Like there's, I don't know if you guys get into documentaries.
6002000	6004000	Well, they were starting to put Disney movies on there now.
6004000	6007000	Like modern Disney movies like Zootopia is on there. My kids can't stop watching that.
6007000	6009000	Oh yeah. That was a big deal.
6009000	6011000	So I'm looking forward to when like the Marvel movies come out.
6011000	6018000	All right. Let's do some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on in the industry. Loki.
6018000	6022000	So you'll be happy to know that finally that time has happened.
6022000	6027000	The Last Guardian has gone gold. So yes, there won't be any more delays.
6027000	6030000	Although I am quite surprised that it's gone gold now.
6030000	6036000	What being the middle of October yet the game is not coming out for another, you know, month.
6036000	6039000	You know, December is when it's due out now.
6039000	6044000	So, but hey, there shouldn't be any more delays.
6044000	6046000	Well that's good.
6046000	6047000	Yeah.
6047000	6049000	And maybe the day one patch will be minimal.
6049000	6056000	Hopefully. And then of course there's a report that the HTC Vive has sold more than 140,000 units.
6056000	6059000	So that's not too bad.
6060000	6065000	I'm curious to see how much the other platforms have sold in PlayStation VR.
6065000	6069000	They're saying, you know, they're expecting to sell 2.6 million units by the end of this year.
6069000	6073000	So yeah, I mean that's only a good thing.
6073000	6079000	More units being out there means more people wanting to develop for those platforms, meaning more content.
6079000	6085000	Agree. You don't think the fact that it's all split across different platforms is going to hurt anybody?
6085000	6091000	I don't think so right now because really PC wise you've got Oculus and Vive.
6091000	6093000	And a lot of those games kind of work with each other.
6093000	6097000	I mean they've got, you know, they're either support both or I don't know.
6097000	6099000	I don't think it's going to be that big a difference.
6099000	6104000	And even with like the PlayStation VR you kind of have a little bit of both of that.
6104000	6108000	You have some of those, you know, sitting experiences and you have some that are like kind of in a little play space.
6109000	6112000	Kind of like the room stuff with Vive.
6112000	6118000	I'm sure it's not as intricate as the Vive stuff because I know it's a lot more powerful hardware.
6118000	6123000	But I think it'll be interesting. It's going to be about getting that price point down.
6123000	6129000	I think eventually maybe in a couple years once those prices come down then a lot more people will be able to try it out.
6129000	6137000	But then again, you know, if they are compelling enough for you to get it, people don't have problems paying that Apple price or the price of a new phone.
6138000	6143000	So, you know, it's all about being compelling enough for you to want to have that piece of hardware.
6143000	6144000	True.
6144000	6147000	Or being cheap enough to it being not such a risk to try it.
6147000	6148000	True.
6148000	6151000	Alright, well let's talk about Xbox One backwards compatibility.
6151000	6155000	You know, you got to give credit where credit's due and Microsoft has really done an amazing job.
6155000	6160000	And I'm so disappointed that I don't see backwards compatibility reports for PlayStation. I mean honestly.
6160000	6164000	Yeah, I really thought that would have lit a fire under Sony to do the same thing.
6164000	6169000	Although I guess if Sony is still quote unquote winning the war, they're not as motivated to have to do that.
6169000	6174000	But I will give credit, big credit to Microsoft for sticking by this backwards compatibility thing.
6174000	6178000	Like I would have been surprised at all if they did it for a couple months and then quit.
6178000	6180000	Because that's kind of what Microsoft used to do.
6180000	6184000	But this is very nice that they're still making this happen.
6184000	6186000	That they're still trickling out more games.
6186000	6188000	And this week we got a big one.
6188000	6191000	Orange Box went to the backwards compatibility list this week.
6191000	6192000	That's huge.
6192000	6193000	That's Portal.
6193000	6196000	That's Team Fortress. That's Half-Life.
6196000	6199000	You know, there's a lot of heavy hitter games in that.
6199000	6203000	Which I think was our favorite game of the year that came out.
6203000	6207000	That was a great... I'm looking for Valve to do another box set.
6207000	6212000	Wouldn't that be amazing if they did another box set that had like Portal 3 and Half-Life 3?
6212000	6216000	It's Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3 and Explode internet.
6216000	6220000	Oh my god, the internet would just like collapse. Like worse than it did over the weekend.
6221000	6223000	It would just be... wow.
6223000	6225000	But anyway, I'm not going to get too ahead of myself.
6225000	6231000	The good news is, you know what, despite its age, the Orange Box is still a very solid set to play.
6231000	6235000	Granted, Team Fortress has changed a lot, so I don't know about that one so much.
6235000	6242000	But, you know, for Portal alone, and for the Half-Life series, which is fucking great too, being on Xbox 360.
6242000	6244000	I mean, it's just a solid list.
6244000	6248000	Also, by the way though, Joe Danger 2 the movie...
6248000	6252000	I don't know what the fuck that is. What is Joe Danger 2?
6252000	6255000	Joe Danger is a game where you're kind of doing like stunts.
6255000	6258000	So it's Hello Games other games.
6258000	6262000	Oh, that's where that's from. It's Hello Games other games. That's right.
6262000	6265000	So they have Joe Danger and Joe Danger 2 the movie.
6265000	6267000	Is that why Hello Games went radio silent on everything else?
6267000	6271000	Is they were too busy prepping this game for backwards compatibility?
6271000	6274000	Where the fuck did they go? Where the fuck did Sean go?
6274000	6276000	Where did he go?
6276000	6280000	Do you think he took the money and ran? Do you think he's in another country right now?
6280000	6283000	No, I doubt that.
6283000	6287000	I hope the dude's okay too. You know, I can say that and joke kind of tongue-in-cheek.
6287000	6291000	But I also kind of wonder, did maybe a lot of this negative feedback really...
6291000	6296000	It's okay. I mean, I seriously wouldn't be too bent out of shape about it. I mean, look at Spore.
6296000	6297000	I mean, come on.
6297000	6302000	That's true. And you know what? Will Wright is and will always be one of the all-time greats in game development.
6303000	6304000	That's right.
6304000	6307000	If Sean Wright can make a Spore, then you can make a No Man's Sky, I guess.
6307000	6311000	Loki, coming from you, that's a very, very nice way to put it.
6311000	6314000	I think is a great, positive message for Sean Murray.
6314000	6316000	Because I'm sure he's out there listening.
6316000	6320000	Perhaps the journalists out there listening can relay that message for us to...
6320000	6325000	No, they're too busy writing articles about how a game about cats as a visual novel has ruined their life.
6326000	6329000	Galaga Legion is also backwards compatible on Xbox One.
6329000	6333000	It was no Pac-Man Championship Edition, which I think is what they were trying to emulate in a way.
6333000	6336000	But it's worth a look. It's worth your time.
6336000	6339000	A lot of people got into the Galaga Legion.
6339000	6341000	So those got added to backwards compatibility.
6341000	6344000	Pokemon Go got an update as well.
6344000	6349000	Pokemon Go had an update this week that dealt with the Plus.
6349000	6354000	The Plus, actually, they were saying it didn't do a great job at distinguishing PokeStops from Pokemon.
6354000	6356000	And so forth.
6356000	6360000	So, yeah, I do notice the vibrations in that thing are different now.
6360000	6362000	So you can notice what's different.
6362000	6371000	And also you can specify within the Pokemon Go app if you want to get just notifications for the actual Pokemon, for the PokeStops, or both.
6371000	6373000	So that's something for me to keep in mind.
6373000	6381000	Because I am so low on PokeBalls right now that I'm thinking about maybe I need to run over to a place where there's a ton of PokeStops here.
6381000	6383000	Either downtown or Old Fair Oaks or something.
6383000	6387000	And just set that to PokeStop only mode and load up.
6387000	6389000	Because I am out of PokeBalls.
6389000	6391000	I have honestly not played Pokemon Go in weeks.
6391000	6394000	You know, I talked about this on PokeStop podcasts.
6394000	6396000	I don't want to double talk myself too much.
6396000	6398000	But I have been really motivated thanks to the Plus.
6398000	6400000	I've been using it for more of my walking and exercise.
6400000	6402000	I'm hatching a lot of Pokemon.
6402000	6404000	I'm not taking it that seriously.
6404000	6408000	I'm just kind of using it as like a Fitbit for even bigger nerds.
6408000	6410000	And it's working for that purpose.
6410000	6415000	So that's why I get really irritated when I see all this stuff that's like Pokemon Go is dead and all this stuff.
6415000	6420000	I'm like, but it's motivating me to exercise more.
6420000	6423000	So for that alone, it's kind of a win.
6423000	6429000	So just stop being a fucking cynical gamer community and let games be, I guess.
6429000	6430000	I don't know.
6430000	6433000	Anyway, let's move on.
6433000	6435000	We've got to talk about what's in stores this week.
6435000	6437000	What's on the shelves this week, Loki?
6437000	6439000	Actually, because we're in that busy fourth quarter.
6439000	6443000	So starting this week, we've got Corpse Party for 3DS.
6443000	6448000	Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6448000	6452000	Exile's End on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6452000	6454000	Hide and Shriek on PC.
6454000	6457000	I literally read that as Hide and Shrek when I first saw that.
6457000	6460000	It's like, why are they making a Shrek game?
6460000	6464000	Ginger Beyond the Crystal on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6464000	6474000	Just Dance 2017 coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.
6474000	6483000	King's Quest Chapter 5, The Good Night on PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.
6483000	6486000	Trillion, God of Destruction on PC.
6486000	6491000	World of Final Fantasy on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6491000	6496000	Yomawari, Night Alone on PC and Vita.
6496000	6500000	Clockwork Empires on PC and Mac.
6500000	6508000	Alice VR on PC and basically all the other Vive and Rift platforms.
6508000	6514000	Berserk on PS3, PlayStation 4, and Vita.
6514000	6518000	Crow's Burning Edge on PlayStation 4.
6518000	6521000	Neo Atlas 1469 on Vita.
6521000	6524000	Through the Woods on PC.
6524000	6528000	Weeping Doll on PlayStation VR.
6528000	6533000	Carnival Games VR on the Vive and PlayStation VR.
6533000	6537000	Dragon Ball Xenoverse coming out later in the week on PC as well.
6537000	6545000	And then for some reason they have all these games releasing on that Friday, which is Titanfall 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6545000	6550000	The Yellow Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6550000	6557000	And then finally Hitman Hokkaido on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6557000	6563000	I wonder if game releases won't switch to Fridays, because music did a couple years ago.
6563000	6565000	Like all the new releases are on Friday.
6565000	6570000	I'm sure you were following the fact that Lady Gaga put out a new album on Friday.
6570000	6575000	I don't think it really necessarily follows that, because all the other media like movies and stuff come out on Tuesdays.
6575000	6576000	They release dates on Tuesday.
6576000	6580000	But then again, they like to do these event things on Fridays and stuff, and I don't know.
6580000	6586000	Well, heading over to Japan and looking at the releases there.
6586000	6592000	Over in Japan on the PlayStation 4, Sword Art Online Hollow Realization is out in a limited edition this week.
6592000	6595000	World of Final Fantasy is also out in Japan this week.
6595000	6599000	And there is a game called Crow's Burning Edge.
6599000	6601000	Mafia III gets its Japanese release as well.
6601000	6604000	This is all on the 27th, which is a pretty busy day.
6604000	6608000	Let's see, Just Dance 2017 out as well.
6608000	6611000	I'm sorry, that's not Japan specific.
6611000	6612000	That is other parts of Asia.
6612000	6618000	But then we also have, let's see, Psycho, nope.
6618000	6620000	Sorry, that is also, I've got them all mixed up here.
6620000	6626000	Berserk Musou is the other one that is out in Japan this week on the 27th.
6626000	6630000	Heading on over to the Wii U.
6630000	6633000	Yep, still pretty quiet on the Wii U.
6633000	6640000	There's no releases, so we might be just removing these until there's something really, really big coming out in Japan.
6640000	6642000	But on the PlayStation Vita, still going.
6642000	6645000	Did you know World of Final Fantasy is out on the Vita in Japan?
6645000	6647000	That is happening on the Vita in Japan.
6647000	6649000	That is also out on the 27th.
6649000	6652000	Neo Atlas 1469 also on the Vita.
6652000	6659000	Which, you know, just to backtrack a little bit, I think that kind of says a lot about this whole Switch thing.
6659000	6666000	The fact that the Vita is still so big in Japan, I really think that Switch concept is going to go even further in Japan than it is here.
6666000	6667000	I really do.
6667000	6670000	There's still tons of Vita games coming out here.
6670000	6673000	It just seems like, but it seems like the portable life, especially.
6673000	6677000	I want to say this week, there was more Vita games coming out than there were 3DS games.
6677000	6678000	Interesting.
6679000	6682000	Alright, well, other Japanese releases this week on the Vita.
6682000	6688000	Neo Atlas 1469 and Saka Agari Hurricane Portable gets a limited edition.
6688000	6693000	Also, that same Sword Art Online Hollow Realization also comes out on the Vita this week.
6693000	6695000	So, busy, busy week on the Vita.
6695000	6700000	And lastly, just checking the Nintendo 3DS, where there are still some releases.
6700000	6701000	Just a few things.
6701000	6703000	We have Sonic Tune Fire and Ice.
6703000	6707000	And then we have Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari SP.
6707000	6713000	And Kamiwaza Wanda Kirikira Ichibangai Kipatsu comes out this week.
6713000	6716000	Those are the Japanese release dates.
6716000	6718000	How about the UK, Loki?
6718000	6723000	Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC.
6723000	6725000	World of Final Fantasy on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
6725000	6728000	And Carnival Games VR on PC.
6728000	6730000	And I would imagine PlayStation VR as well.
6730000	6732000	It's kind of more abridged there.
6732000	6737000	Just responding to what I had said there about the Japanese perspective.
6737000	6743000	Mikuma JP in our chat from Japan lending that perspective over at live.vognetware.com saying,
6743000	6746000	I can see that sky, but too big to carry around.
6746000	6749000	So, you know, the fact that it's going to be bigger than the 3DS.
6749000	6753000	So, people don't... Do men not have purses in Japan?
6753000	6755000	Because they have them here.
6755000	6758000	They don't call them purses, of course, but they're man bags.
6758000	6760000	They're messenger bags.
6760000	6761000	Thank you, messenger bags.
6761000	6763000	The message I'm sending is that I'm a woman.
6763000	6764000	Yeah.
6764000	6766000	But the over-the-shoulder bags and that.
6766000	6768000	More men are carrying those.
6768000	6770000	That is the thing.
6770000	6773000	Granted, you can take it with you, but it's not all that portable.
6773000	6776000	Really, the only advantage is that it has a screen attached to it.
6776000	6781000	But, shit, I used to carry my systems around in a bag.
6781000	6786000	And if it had a screen attached to it, it would be basically the same thing they're doing right there.
6786000	6788000	Maya calls them merces.
6788000	6792000	Yes, I've heard that name too, but, you know, you can't go to a place like...
6792000	6794000	Who sells, like, fossil?
6794000	6796000	You don't go there and ask for a mers.
6796000	6801000	You ask for a handbag or a, you know, a carrying case or something like that.
6801000	6804000	Akuma JP says, yes, but we like to travel light.
6804000	6806000	Oh, that's fair. That's fair.
6806000	6808000	Kaijuto is saying, everyone has a backpack here.
6808000	6809000	So, no issue. That's true.
6809000	6813000	A lot of people, if you don't use something that's over one shoulder, it's over both, like a backpack.
6813000	6818000	Or you carry it on one shoulder, and that's how you get light scoliosis like I had in high school.
6820000	6824000	Anyway, let's move on.
6824000	6826000	Did we do the UK releases? Yes, we did, didn't we?
6826000	6829000	So, I think we're to the mailbag segment. How does that sound?
6829000	6831000	We're gonna get to the mailbag.
6831000	6839000	Every week, you guys email us.
6839000	6843000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
6843000	6848000	and we like to pull out your emails and read some of our favorites here on air.
6848000	6851000	Although, I believe this week, we didn't have anything because I looked earlier.
6851000	6855000	Yep, it is an empty mailbag. It's a desert. It's a wasteland.
6855000	6858000	So, this is where I ask the listeners, why don't you love us?
6859000	6863000	Why don't you love us? Send an email. Tell us what you think about the Switch.
6863000	6866000	Come on, there's been a lot of stuff on that. Are you gonna get Red Dead 2?
6866000	6869000	What about Diablo 4? Is it gonna be Diablo 4 or is it a Diablo 3 expansion?
6869000	6872000	I'd like to hear from some voice actors. I know we have a few of them listening.
6872000	6876000	What do you think about all that strike business going on?
6876000	6882000	And actdeaf says, we do, in response to loving us, we just don't like writing.
6882000	6885000	Twitter has ruined everybody.
6885000	6889000	You can say things in more than 140 characters. It's okay.
6889000	6894000	Alright, that's fine. No mail this week, so we will just table that till next time.
6894000	6900000	Next week will be the Halloween show, because Halloween is Monday, right?
6900000	6905000	So, next week will be our Halloween show, so you can send us a scary, scary story.
6905000	6908000	Send us a scary story to read on air, but it has to involve video games.
6908000	6913000	So, it has to be like that one time you broke your console or threw a Wiimote through your TV.
6913000	6914000	That'll be fun.
6914000	6917000	Let's get to a few more stories, and then we'll get to your calls.
6917000	6920000	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Loki.
6920000	6924000	So, another page of this seems like a great idea for television.
6924000	6933000	Apparently, they are adapting Candy Crush, yes, Candy Crush, into an hour-long game show for CBS.
6933000	6939000	It's gonna, they haven't really said when it's gonna premiere, but the format will consist of two teams of two.
6939000	6943000	They'll be competing on an interactive game board.
6943000	6952000	And, you know, we are huge fans of Candy Crush, and like so many others, we know the rush of advancing to the next level of the game.
6952000	6959000	We're excited to work with Lionsgate and King to adapt one of the world's most popular and entertaining game franchises for television,
6959000	6966000	to make it available to its massive, passionate fan base who can watch and play along at home.
6966000	6973000	Can't they use that hour to, like, put Big Brother over the top on TV, or the Star Trek series that they're doing on TV?
6973000	6977000	Do they have to give an hour to fucking Candy Crush, really?
6977000	6980000	They've had weirder game show ideas.
6980000	6987000	My favorite of the recent, you know, because I don't really watch live TV, but back when I, in fact, I got a cancel cable.
6987000	6989000	I've been meaning to cancel the cable portion.
6989000	6994000	They give you, you know, a better deal if you buy cable and the internet versus just the internet.
6994000	7002000	And, like, I only use the internet, so I've said, well, if I can get cable and the internet, and it's still cheaper than what I'm paying for just internet, then sure, why not, let's do it.
7002000	7005000	So I decided to watch some live TV when I first put it on.
7005000	7008000	Of course, then I unhooked my cable box, and I'm like, fuck this shit.
7008000	7016000	But one of the shows that they had on there, and I'm not really sure what the premise of the show was, but it was, I think, people answering trivia questions or something like that.
7017000	7023000	And they had, like, valuables of theirs on a conveyor belt that would fall off a building and smash on the ground.
7023000	7028000	And I'm a big fan of dropping things onto the ground, so that show was kind of cool.
7028000	7036000	But, yeah, Candy Crush, go fuck King, and seriously, CBS, fuck you guys for even giving them the light of day for that shit.
7036000	7041000	I still can't believe that whole thing where people would do the shapes with the wall.
7041000	7042000	What the hell was that show called?
7042000	7045000	Oh, through the wall or something like that?
7045000	7056000	Yeah, that was, um, I don't, but see, like, once again, like, the Japanese game show was funny, whereas this, you know, show was stupid.
7056000	7060000	Like, when they bring it over to America, it's fucking lame.
7060000	7064000	I just don't understand why, like, they can't make the goofiness of that.
7064000	7071000	I mean, the closest thing we got was Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, which is basically just a goofy redub of, you know, Takashi's Castle.
7072000	7076000	But, like, if they actually took it seriously, it would be stupid.
7076000	7082000	Now, here's the other thing I don't understand, okay? CBS, if I'm not mistaken, CBS, Viacom, same thing, right?
7082000	7091000	Viacom owns MTV, MTV owns Logo, so CBS could theoretically be airing RuPaul's Drag Race.
7091000	7096000	Yeah, but then that would expose gays to the mainstream audience, and then we can't have that.
7096000	7101000	Okay, but Candy Crush, alright, look, in fact, we haven't done this in a very long time.
7101000	7104000	You know what we need to do? We need to take a poll.
7104000	7110000	We need to do a live poll right now here at The Voice of Geeks Network, VagaNetwork.com.
7111000	7118000	We're gonna go and ask this poll, and, uh, it's up live over at Live.VagaNetwork.com.
7118000	7121000	What would you rather watch on CBS?
7121000	7129000	You can choose the first answer, Candy Crush, or you can choose the second answer, RuPaul's Drag Race.
7130000	7131000	Vote now.
7132000	7136000	We'll get the listener's final answer in just a moment.
7136000	7142000	I vote C, actually, which is Silent Library, because that show is hilarious on MTV, and I'd rather watch that.
7142000	7143000	Have you ever seen that show?
7143000	7144000	I think I have.
7144000	7150000	See, that show right there was the closest show that I could see that was, like, a Japanese game show.
7150000	7156000	It was basically, they had to be quiet in a library, and they would have a task that they would have to do that was ridiculous,
7156000	7161000	or, like, painful, or just gross, that they would have to do while being quiet.
7161000	7164000	That was the premise of the show. No one won anything, it's just silly.
7164000	7169000	And that's what that show, like, through the, uh, you know, whatever they called it in Japan, the one where you go through the wall,
7169000	7171000	it was just a silly show.
7171000	7175000	The whole point is that I can complete it, hooray for me.
7175000	7177000	You know, it's not like, I'm gonna win money.
7177000	7181000	It was just trying to beat it, just for the sake of beating it.
7182000	7185000	Alright, uh, we're gonna, we're asking that question again.
7185000	7188000	This is your last chance to vote live.vognetwork.com.
7188000	7191000	If you don't see the poll, I guess refresh the page.
7191000	7193000	But people are voting, so I know the answers are coming in.
7193000	7195000	Uh, so check that out and you can vote live.
7195000	7198000	We'll get to, uh, the, uh, the answer here in a minute.
7198000	7202000	And it's, it's, it is not unanimous, I'll put it that way, does that even surprise me?
7202000	7204000	So, we'll get to that in a minute.
7204000	7207000	Which would you rather watch on CBS, Candy Crush or RuPaul's Drag Race?
7207000	7214000	Alright, uh, so, I'm sure a lot of you experienced this last week, but it did, uh, it did incorporate gaming into it.
7214000	7221000	And that was the fact that there was a large DDoS attack, a very large DDoS attack, which of course is direct denial of service attacks.
7221000	7224000	And it did affect PlayStation Network.
7224000	7229000	Uh, and this was because PlayStation Network is a part of Dyne, D-Y-N, is that, am I saying that right?
7229000	7234000	The, the name of the company on the East Coast that, that provides, uh, a lot of internet coverage to a lot of big websites.
7234000	7241000	They got hit with a massive DDoS attack, which, I mean, this is so big that now apparently the Department of Homeland Security is involved.
7241000	7252000	They're saying that it was something where, like, devices in your home, like a camera or a, I don't know, a, a baby monitor or some shit that has IP address.
7252000	7257000	Somehow they're getting malware on these devices and they were being used in the attack as well.
7257000	7264000	Um, the attacks have stopped, but it certainly made people stop for a minute. I mean, I was pissed off. I couldn't use Twitter for hours and hours.
7264000	7272000	I was a real, I didn't realize how fucking addicted to Twitter I was until that DDoS attack took down Twitter for a good chunk of the morning and most of the afternoon on Friday.
7272000	7278000	But, uh, obviously gamers were affected as well. So, Loki, you're laughing over there. You laughing about the DDoS or what?
7278000	7283000	I'm just, like, picturing, like, Twitter, or not Twitter, uh, malware in a printer or something like that.
7283000	7285000	Well, yeah, it's, I, whoa.
7285000	7287000	Baby monitor malware.
7287000	7298000	Well, it's, it's crazy to think, you know, if that stuff, uh, can be turned and used on, you know, other places, that's almost, you know, it's kind of scary, especially with how much our society relies on the internet.
7298000	7306000	This is probably causing a lot of people to kind of stop and go, whoa, hopefully our government is kind of looking at that and going, well, not everything needs to be on the internet.
7307000	7310000	So, um, yeah, we'll see. Anyway, uh, I have a feeling-
7310000	7316000	We gotta, that's why we need to invade your computer to find those hackers and catch that 4chan.
7316000	7325000	Uh, I, I unfortunately don't think this is the last we're gonna see of it either. I think there's, uh, probably more to come from these attacks, so be ready for it.
7325000	7328000	I don't know, can, can they ever stop DDoS attacks?
7328000	7335000	I thought one way that they were doing it, like, you would see that cloud flare thing comes up and sometimes it asks for a, um, cause, like, that's what they did with the Pokemon Go.
7335000	7340000	Uh, they asked for all the CAPTCHA codes, right? Every time you ping the server, so it, like, slows it down tremendously.
7340000	7343000	I guess other sites can't do that?
7343000	7348000	That's funny. I thought the whole slowing down tremendously was just a feature of Pokemon Go.
7348000	7356000	Oh, shut up. Uh, DungeonBuster in chat says, uh, over at Live.FogNetwork.com says, let's make everything internet smart from DVDs to toasters.
7356000	7360000	But what about security? Who attacks toasters?
7360000	7367000	Uh, SSG100Matt says, I wonder if this is connected to those lizard squad kids getting charged for their attack on SOTY recently.
7367000	7373000	I don't think anyone's really claimed responsibility, have they? Or no, they did on Twitter, didn't they? But it was a different group, right?
7373000	7378000	Yeah, who knows, who knows. Anyway, I know what I give a shit about and that is our live poll.
7378000	7383000	What would you rather watch on CBS? Candy Crush or RuPaul's Drag Race?
7383000	7390000	And the poll is at an end, and believe it or not, Candy Crush got 37% of the vote.
7390000	7398000	So, Candy Crush with 37% of the vote, RuPaul's Drag, actually, uh, it's 37 and a half percent of the vote.
7398000	7404000	RuPaul's Drag Race was 62 and a half percent of the vote, so that's almost, almost a 30 you would rather watch Candy Crush.
7404000	7406000	Well, you know what?
7406000	7410000	That's a third less, you know, I hope I have for humanity.
7410000	7416000	I hope you're happy with that decision. Enjoy your crap television. Alright, that was just a silly fun poll.
7416000	7421000	I realize we haven't done a poll in a long, long time, so I'm glad we could do that there, so.
7421000	7427000	Part of listening live over at vognetwork.com. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you have for us?
7427000	7435000	Alright, so, this is pretty awesome. I'm waiting, you know, because it's only twice a year that we get to see this,
7435000	7442000	but I usually watch it in the archives and everything, but they have the information on the Lineup for Awesome Games Stunt Quick 2017,
7442000	7448000	and, uh, some of the games, you know, of course, it's gonna be running through January 18th through the 15th,
7448000	7455000	and the schedule has been finalized. I haven't heard Flocko saying anything about the PT run,
7455000	7459000	so I'm gonna assume that, unfortunately, he didn't quite make it in there.
7459000	7463000	I looked at the schedule, and it was not there, I'm sorry to say.
7463000	7469000	That's unfortunate. But yeah, they have all the blocks so you can go check it out and everything.
7469000	7474000	I haven't quite gotten a chance to take a look and see if there's anything that really stood out.
7474000	7484000	But I really, honestly, I just like watching all of it, because it's just fun watching, especially watching them play the games
7484000	7489000	and talk about what they're doing to kind of, the different strats and everything for it.
7489000	7490000	For sure.
7490000	7498000	It's fascinating. That, I would rather watch on TV, versus their stupid Candy Crush Saga shit.
7498000	7507000	And seriously, it's an hour long! I mean, goddamn, I mean, shit, just put two reruns of Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy on there instead.
7507000	7509000	I mean, that'd be better.
7509000	7515000	Next time I do a poll, I'll put that in there, but I really think if anything was gonna be 100 to 0,
7515000	7520000	it would be awesome games done quick, versus Candy Crush. So, there you go.
7520000	7524000	Anyway, I'm looking forward to the marathon, even if poor Flaco is still not in it.
7524000	7528000	But keep trying, Flaco! He's gonna keep trying until he gets in. I know it. Don't give up. You can do it.
7528000	7534000	Hey, maybe this is a game we'll see speedrun in the future, because this is something way out of Nintendo's archives.
7534000	7541000	This is a game that was for the Satellaview that was unearthed just recently.
7541000	7547000	You know, this Satellaview, if you didn't already know, that was a Japanese-only peripheral that existed for the Famicom.
7547000	7550000	Super Famicom, excuse me, which was their version, of course, of the Super Nintendo.
7550000	7555000	And it allowed you to basically download games through satellite, basically.
7555000	7562000	One of the games that was released on it was called The Legend of Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets.
7562000	7570000	That game was originally only broadcast in Japanese, but now there are language patches available in English, French, and German.
7570000	7576000	You can check that out at BSZelda. That does not stand for what BS stands for, usually.
7576000	7579000	But that was part of the name of the Satellaview.
7579000	7583000	But BSZelda.zeldalegends.net. They have the file there, so you can check that out.
7583000	7586000	English, French, and German patches.
7586000	7589000	I can't tell from the screenshots, was that a Super Nintendo game?
7589000	7592000	It is a Super Nintendo game. It was Super Famicom originally, of course.
7592000	7597000	But yeah, obviously the look and feel is very similar to Link to the Past.
7597000	7602000	See, that's like, that kind of shit, I wish, like, you know how we see these remasters of different things?
7602000	7607000	Just like, do like, a, not necessarily remaster, but like, you know, kind of like,
7607000	7610000	Hey, it's Link to the Past and this, you know, on top of it.
7610000	7613000	Or just fucking put this out on Virtual Console.
7613000	7615000	Obviously, there's people out there that want it.
7615000	7617000	And this has a whole, there's a timer on it.
7617000	7620000	Like, you know, even though it's very clearly like a Link to the Past, there's a timer on it.
7620000	7625000	You know, so there's like, speed, ironically enough, speed running that's happening in this.
7625000	7630000	So, anyway, originally the game was broadcast in four one-hour chunks.
7630000	7636000	And yeah, it was broadcast at a specific time, once a week, and you could only access that game at that time.
7636000	7637000	So, that's, wow.
7637000	7642000	And the broadcast was streamed audio that had voice acting and orchestrated music.
7642000	7646000	Yeah, very, very weird technology at the time.
7646000	7650000	So now, anyway, it's available and you can check that out if you want.
7650000	7654000	There it is. There's also YouTubes out there, of course, if you want to see a little bit more on that.
7655000	7658000	I think that's cool, though, that something was unearthed after all this time.
7658000	7660000	And that was some neat technology at the time.
7660000	7663000	I think the closest thing we had to it was the Sega Channel.
7663000	7666000	Which obviously was not a Nintendo thing, but it was, you know.
7666000	7673000	Something else I saw that was unearthed was, I guess, a ROM for the SNES version of Rayman.
7674000	7677000	I did see that. Yeah, I missed putting that on a show this week.
7677000	7680000	But yeah, there was a Super Nintendo Rayman, apparently, that was unearthed this week.
7680000	7683000	And apparently ran at 60 frames per second and it was pretty awesome.
7683000	7684000	That's awesome.
7684000	7687000	Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing some of that as well.
7687000	7690000	Cool. Well, I think it's time for us to take your calls.
7690000	7695000	So, if you'd like to give us a call, you can right now on Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7695000	7698000	That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7698000	7703000	The Skype line is open for your calls right now and it's already lighting up.
7703000	7705000	My gosh, people were just waiting to get in here tonight.
7705000	7706000	Let's do it.
7706000	7708000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7708000	7709000	Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture.
7709000	7711000	Hello, Brad, my friend. How are you?
7711000	7715000	Oh, peachy keen, just a little tired from setting this new thing up.
7715000	7718000	Oh, yeah, you're in the midst of a studio renovation, right?
7718000	7720000	Yeah, we'll move. Yeah, yeah.
7720000	7724000	Oh, wow. I hope we can do something similar here at OLR, maybe.
7724000	7727000	I think it might finally be time to replace the computer.
7727000	7731000	As much as I've dragged my feet on that, it's probably time.
7731000	7734000	Oh, God, how many years has that been now?
7734000	7736000	A while. Here's the thing. Here's the thing.
7736000	7743000	Christmas and New Year's Day are on Sundays this year, or this coming year, whatever you want to say.
7743000	7747000	So I have a feeling it's going to kind of force us to take a little break from OLR.
7747000	7753000	Granted, we could do some pre-recorded stuff, but I think our audience would forgive us if we took a nice big break for the holidays.
7753000	7756000	Oh, take a break for the holidays, for God's sake.
7756000	7759000	Yeah, exactly. And so I think that might be the time we kind of do some.
7759000	7763000	Now, obviously, I rent this house, so we can't do anything crazy like painting the walls like you're doing,
7763000	7770000	but I think that might be a good time for us to take a break and do some of those upgrades and changes.
7770000	7775000	I just had to make the first call from the new studio to you guys.
7775000	7780000	Oh, fuck. SSJ. Sorry, excuse me, Brad. SSJ 100 Matt brings up a good point.
7780000	7784000	MAGFest is the week right after New Year's. We may end up being gone for a month.
7784000	7789000	I don't know, guys. I don't know. Would OLR people be pissed if we were gone for a month? I don't know.
7789000	7791000	Not this one. I mean, you guys need a break.
7791000	7796000	I appreciate that. We'll see. I don't know what's going to happen. Maybe we can look at doing something pre-recorded.
7796000	7804000	I don't know. We have to get through episode 666 first, and then we'll talk about what's going to happen come the holidays and MAGFest and all that other stuff.
7804000	7805000	But anyway, Brad.
7805000	7809000	I did have to call with the game though. Have you played PolitiCats?
7809000	7813000	I haven't played PolitiCats yet. I've just had a million other things going on.
7813000	7815000	But I know you've been telling me about this. Tell the listeners about this.
7816000	7823000	Oh my God. You're this cat, and you run for various offices. You start from town clerk.
7823000	7832000	You can work your way up through district attorney and mayor. You eventually get harder and harder, but I assume you can move up.
7832000	7838000	And now they've added leaderboards, and there's a 24-hour running game.
7838000	7847000	If you're in such-and-such a tier, you get little bonuses at the end of that 24 hours. And now they've done a Halloween update.
7847000	7850000	And what's in the Halloween update?
7850000	7863000	Oh, it's all cosmetic stuff, but there's little witches costumes you can unlock, and the graphics are cobwebs and just goofy Halloween-themed type stuff.
7863000	7866000	But it's a fun little clicker game.
7866000	7871000	Alright, I'm going to have to check that out at some point. You know I love my clickers. And I think I finally ran out of steam on a non-stop night.
7871000	7877000	I think I finally kind of stopped playing that and checking on it as much as I was, but for a clicker game that was a lot of fun.
7877000	7880000	And that was something you recommended, so I don't see why I won't check out PolitiCats.
7880000	7888000	Now one of my buddies on Twitter, I will say this, speaking of cats, recommended an app today that's called, what is this, Weather Kitty.
7888000	7895000	And all it is, it's like a replacement for your weather app, which there's like 5 billion weather apps on the phone, I know, not that exciting.
7895000	7904000	But it replaces it with what is going on with the weather, and a picture of a cat that matches the weather.
7904000	7918000	Oh, this is so adorable, the picture changed. So it's saying right now it's 63 degrees in Sacramento, and there's a little cat sleeping at a night, like a little night city, which obviously isn't Sacramento, but a little night cityscape there. Isn't that adorable, Loki?
7918000	7919000	Yes.
7919000	7921000	I will have to check this out.
7921000	7922000	There you go.
7922000	7925000	As long as it's more accurate than AccuWeather, then yeah.
7925000	7928000	Well, that's not hard to beat sometimes.
7928000	7934000	My favorite is when I check one of those weather apps, and it's like, it's partially cloudy, and all this, and I look outside, it's fucking raining.
7934000	7937000	It's raining right now, and it's like clear and sunny, and it's like, no it's not.
7937000	7945000	Although, technically, different parts of the city can see rain versus, but anyway, I won't get into that level of it.
7945000	7949000	Oh, for like three weeks after DragonCon, I was still getting Atlanta reports.
7950000	7952000	I don't care anymore.
7952000	7957000	Yeah, my weather app has, or the one I was using before it, I think Weather Channel or something, before I was using the cats,
7957000	7962000	I think had Atlanta as one of the cities in it, just because I know I go there at least once a year.
7962000	7969000	That was in there. L.A. is in there, because I was going there a lot. Yeah, road trips, fun.
7969000	7972000	But games, take some more calls, get back to games.
7972000	7973000	I will, I will.
7973000	7977000	But political, oh my god, the Halloween thing is just too much.
7977000	7982000	But Brad, there's no better time to play a game than when you're on an airplane waiting to go to another city.
7982000	7985000	Do you know how much Dragon Quest VII I played while I was traveling?
7985000	7987000	Hopefully not on a Note 7.
7987000	7992000	No, not on a, no, Dragon Quest VII was on 3DS, so we were fine.
7992000	7994000	Alright, I'll catch you guys later.
7994000	7995000	Alright, take care my friend.
7995000	7996000	Peace.
7996000	7997000	Bye.
7997000	8002000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8002000	8004000	We have another call coming in, let's get to it.
8004000	8006000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8006000	8008000	Hey, this is Raging Eater.
8008000	8010000	Hello my friend, how are you?
8010000	8012000	I'm pretty good, how about yourself?
8012000	8014000	I'm alright, I'm alright.
8014000	8016000	What's up, what's on your mind tonight?
8016000	8027000	Well, one question, and before I get to it, a few minutes ago you were talking about the Satellaview and whatnot.
8027000	8028000	Yeah.
8028000	8040000	Well, aside from the Sega Channel, which I definitely remember hearing about, if memory serves, there was something else that came out right around the same time.
8040000	8047000	It came out for both Super Nintendo and the Genesis, if I remember right.
8047000	8050000	I think it was called, what, X-Band or something like that?
8050000	8053000	Yes, yes, there was that thing as well.
8053000	8056000	You're right, there was X-Band, I think it was kind of a similar thing as well.
8056000	8057000	Yep.
8057000	8061000	Yeah, I honestly don't remember much about it.
8061000	8078000	The only thing I kind of sort of recall is that there were kind of rudimentary lobbies, a little bit of a chat, I think, and of course obviously you could play your games online.
8078000	8089000	I never got a chance to try it myself because my parents wouldn't allow us, but the technology was there though.
8089000	8092000	Alright, good to know, good to know. So what was the question you had tonight?
8093000	8110000	Well, obviously the two of you, I wouldn't necessarily see everyone in chat, but the vast majority of the people that were in chat are at least to some degree or another into PC gaming.
8110000	8122000	To what extent, that's up to the individual, but at least some people like to play PC games.
8122000	8138000	My question is for the two of you and of course for chat, what were the games or games that got you into PC gaming and why?
8138000	8144000	Great question. What were the games that got you into PC gaming and why? I'll start while Loki thinks about that.
8144000	8157000	Well, see, my story was a little different because I was kind of enabled by the Commodore 64, which was prior to PCs, but that was still a home computer, so it was a PC of sorts, but not an actual PC, if that makes sense.
8158000	8174000	So Commodore 64 was really kind of what enabled me with games, I think even before Nintendo Entertainment System, because sure, I had an Atari 2600, but I probably spent more time on the Commodore 64, because the complexity of the games you could do on the Commodore 64 was even more so.
8174000	8181000	And especially the music, the sound chip in the Commodore 64 was divine, and you had some great music in there.
8181000	8196000	So yeah, I think that was really the gateway that then took me into PC games, but the earliest PC games I remember playing were a lot of the old Sierra stuff, like King's Quest IV and those sorts of point and click adventure games.
8196000	8222000	The original Civilization was huge for me. But you know what really sold me on PC, like way back when and something I was really into Rage Nator? It wasn't even so much the games as it was, and I know we've joked about this on the show before, but it was Prodigy, was what really sold me on like, we need a PC in this house, you know, I'm like 12 years old trying to convince my parents, we really need a PC in this house, because Prodigy allowed me to be online and like talk to people.
8222000	8235000	And as somebody who was, believe it or not, a little bit shocked sometimes, because I got picked on a lot in school, I kind of was drawn early to the fact that I could kind of, you know, post on these bulletin boards online.
8235000	8244000	And then I got into the whole BBS thing, which is a whole other story, but I didn't really find out about that until well after, I think I found out about those on Prodigy.
8244000	8260000	Or maybe it was my dad, actually my dad, there used to be like a newspaper they published here locally, and like the last page of the paper had all the numbers to the BBS's, so I think my dad used to always kind of collect those and tell me I should be participating in them, but not to call long distance or my mother would lose her mind, which is all true.
8260000	8274000	But anyway, so yeah, I guess that's kind of my answer. I don't know if there's really one game I can put my finger on and say this is the reason I needed a PC, but these were all things that really made me a PC gamer. What about you, Loki?
8274000	8288000	Shareware, that kind of got me into it. But like first PC was just basically, it was kind of a gift from somebody, like they didn't want their old PC, so I had like SimCity on that.
8288000	8303000	But you know, like purchasing games, a lot of that was driven by shareware, and playing a lot of the shareware demos back then were like pretty substantial, and you know Castle Wolfenstein, that's just one whole campaign, I mean that's quite a lot of game.
8303000	8316000	So it was kind of that, and then you know, like BBS's and stuff, and then finally once the internet came around and you know, doing all that. But yeah, it definitely was driven by just playing shareware games.
8316000	8322000	And what was some of your favorite, I loved the shareware games too, like Commander Keen, that shit was off the hook.
8323000	8325000	ZZT, long live!
8325000	8332000	Yeah, ZZT was awesome. You know, and also like PC Gamer Magazine, you know a lot of the demos and stuff when they're in there.
8332000	8351000	So, you know, I didn't have that powerful of a PC at the time, it had 4 megs of RAM, but it was, you know, back then you had to do all sorts of crazy shit to your, you know, different config sys and auto execute bat files to get stuff to run to allocate memory correctly.
8351000	8358000	And all that bullshit that you had to go through, so getting Doom to run, you know, just wouldn't really run on what I had.
8358000	8372000	But you know, Wolfenstein was fun, eventually when I got my own PC, you know, Duke Nukem 3D, I don't know, it was just a lot of, mostly I played console games, but you know, I did a lot of stuff on PC.
8372000	8375000	Command Conquer, Red Alert.
8375000	8381000	Ragenator, what about you real quick? And your kiddies, by the way, which of course you see on the cam there. What about you, Ragenator, before we let you go?
8381000	8394000	Well, it's kind of a complicated answer. The short version is it's, well, twofold. Everyone knows the BS I had to deal with with my consoles back in 2012.
8395000	8398000	That's one reason why I got into PC gaming.
8398000	8413000	And of course, you know, one thing that you always harped on for the longest time is Steam sales, Steam sales, Steam sales, you know.
8413000	8431000	Now, in cheap games, you know, and plus, you know, not only that, but I always heard about, you know, games being better on PC, be it like Duke Nukem 3D or the Doom series or the Quake series.
8432000	8444000	Plus, certain games like Diablo 2 never came to console, so I kind of figured, what the hell, if I'm going to have to choose between getting a PC versus getting a console,
8444000	8464000	I might as well go with PC. I'll probably save money in the process, long run, and get to play superior versions of whatever game. Plus, I'll get to play games like Diablo 2. So, so far I've been loving it.
8464000	8470000	Alright. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in another call here before we call it a night, but thank you as always for your question.
8470000	8472000	Sure. Have a nice night.
8472000	8481000	You too. And pet those kitties that were in the background there. Let's get to another call. Wow, our phone is, like, ringing off the hook tonight. Hi, you're on Orangeworm's radio. Who's this?
8481000	8483000	Hey, what's going on, everybody? It's Ranma.
8483000	8485000	Hey, Ranma. What's up, buddy?
8485000	8490000	Oh, not a lot, not a lot, but we need to put on another pot of coffee right now.
8490000	8492000	Uh-oh. What's up?
8492000	8494000	Switch.
8494000	8498000	Oh, the Nintendo Switch. What do you want to say about it?
8498000	8501000	Where do I start?
8502000	8507000	I don't know. What were your thoughts? We'll start with, what was your reaction to the trailer?
8507000	8518000	The Nintendo Switch is going to be an overpriced piece of junk powered by a customized, underpowered processor.
8518000	8520000	Ouch. So, you're not a fan.
8520000	8522000	No, I am not.
8522000	8531000	What about the games, though, Ranma? I mean, if they have the must-have games on it, isn't the rest of it not going to matter?
8531000	8540000	In a way, I say the same thing about the Wii U. Yes, the Wii U is $2.99. There are at least ten games on it that I want.
8540000	8549000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, $2.99. There's at least three games on each of those consoles that I want.
8549000	8557000	The only difference is, I'd sooner gyrate towards those, because it's technologically a lot more powerful, and I know it can do something with it, you know?
8557000	8561000	Whereas the Wii U, yes, has great games, but it's sitting in the corner eating paste.
8561000	8565000	So, the Nintendo Switch really has to come out for the right price.
8565000	8572000	Yes, and I already said it. If the Switch doesn't drop at $200, I'm not buying it. Simple as that.
8572000	8577000	I think, though, Ranma, $1.99 could be a realistic price for the Switch.
8577000	8583000	No, I don't think so. $2.50 at least. If not more, I would say $2.99, probably.
8583000	8589000	I think it really depends. I think the big question mark is the dock. For me, it's the dock.
8589000	8593000	The dock has no tech in it. I don't think it has anything in it.
8593000	8599000	Well, that's what it comes down to. If the dock is doing anything, then it's going to cost more.
8599000	8606000	If the dock is doing nothing except being a pass-through for the TV, then it will cost less, I think.
8606000	8610000	All I can see from the dock, it's a pass-through with two USBs.
8610000	8619000	Now, my thought was, okay, when you put it in the dock, the dock has more memory, better chipset, and all this other stuff.
8619000	8623000	And I think that's awesome because right now Alienware has something similar.
8623000	8629000	If you buy this high-end laptop, they have a special docking bay where you connect your laptop to it,
8629000	8634000	and there is a much more powerful video card in it and other stuff, and you can really do some serious gaming.
8634000	8638000	But from what I've been told, it's just a pass-through. That's all it is.
8638000	8648000	Interesting. I could see $249, Brad from Pod Culture says $249 with a pack-in game. I could see that as well.
8648000	8654000	$249 with a pack-in game? No, I still won't. Because when it goes to price point, let me tell you something.
8654000	8659000	I just started this side project, and I had to pick up a low-end tablet.
8660000	8668000	So I went out and bought a low-end Windows 10 tablet that doubles as a laptop, more of a tablet,
8668000	8679000	and I paid about $130 for it. This thing has 2GB of RAM, 64GB of memory, video quality resolution is average by best.
8679000	8685000	What I see on this, it's not even close to the Switch. Now, they're pushing $41.
8685000	8694000	They put it up 1920x1080p, that's what they want. This thing's going to have at least 4GB of memory to run the OS,
8694000	8700000	to run the applications, to run the games. Storage? No.
8700000	8707000	I really see, in order for Nintendo to really make this shine, they've got to take one hell of a loss on each one sold.
8707000	8709000	Which Nintendo usually doesn't do.
8709000	8715000	Right. The only time they've done that is when the 3DS first came out. Yes, they were making money off of it,
8715000	8722000	but then they had to cut the price down to take a loss, now they're making a profit. Same thing with the Wii U, you know?
8722000	8728000	Act F does confirm the dock will be included. Nintendo Japan already confirmed it.
8728000	8734000	So we had theorized one of our many Wheel of Plausibility scenarios that the dock and the thing could be sold separately,
8734000	8738000	but I think that's back when we thought it was two separate systems in one ecosystem,
8738000	8747000	and I think that talk kind of started to die down when the rumors about it being a Switch basically started to pick up.
8747000	8755000	But anyway, the good news is, at least we know. This is what I wish Nintendo would have done a month ago,
8755000	8761000	but is it going to change the fact that I'll be there pre-ordering the system to pick up in March? No.
8761000	8765000	They can do whatever they want, I suppose, but sometimes I just kind of look at it and go,
8765000	8771000	why are you doing this to me, Nintendo? But you know what? If they sell a ton of them, it doesn't really matter what I think.
8771000	8777000	If they sell a ton of them, yeah. Because honestly, I'm not getting one, because you know what?
8777000	8784000	I already carry around my work tablet. I already carry around my side tablet. I also carry around my 3DS.
8784000	8791000	I also carry around my phone. There is no room in my bag for another gaming tablet, and whoever buys it,
8791000	8798000	you better hope and pray that it doesn't get damaged, because the way I see a tablet, that's a one-hole cohesive unit.
8798000	8801000	Sometimes that screen, that whole thing is getting replaced.
8801000	8806000	Yeah. I need to see more games, and I guess I'll be waiting until January.
8806000	8810000	I mean, I'm pretty confident just being the gaming nerd I am. I'm going to get one.
8810000	8815000	But I really, really want to see the games to get me more excited about it.
8815000	8823000	Look, when you get one, me, Loki, Matt, Acta, we're going to redo that whole Genesis commercial when Matt got a Genesis.
8823000	8827000	We're going to redo that whole thing. We're going to knock on the door and be like,
8827000	8831000	I heard Sky got a Switch, and we're going to redo that whole commercial. That's what we're going to do.
8831000	8839000	Well, you know what? The hands-on experience sold Loki a PlayStation VR, so anything is possible. Anything is possible.
8839000	8843000	All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go to try to fish for one more call before we wrap up, but thanks for the call.
8843000	8844000	Hey, no problem, dude.
8844000	8846000	Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session or else.
8846000	8848000	Oh, yeah. Rob, one more thing.
8848000	8849000	What?
8849000	8854000	Take the vacation. Anime Jam Session does it every year. Take the vacation. You earned it. You all deserve it.
8854000	8857000	If anyone has a problem with it, send them to me. I'll set them straight.
8857000	8865000	I appreciate that deeply. I just have a feeling the podcaster in me is not going to let us go three weeks with no content,
8865000	8871000	but inevitably we'll have to probably go three weeks with no live content. I just don't see how we get around that,
8871000	8875000	unless we do a show New Year's Day, which is possible. Anything is possible. We'll see.
8875000	8880000	It's too early for me to think about, so guys, please don't take anything I'm saying.
8880000	8887000	There's a lot of stuff going through my head when it comes to this show, and a lot of decisions are made very knee-jerk sometimes,
8887000	8889000	so we'll talk in December.
8889000	8895000	Rob, I'll tell you this. At MAGFest, if you're getting that mindset, I'm dragging you to the bar, and I'm shoving shots down your throat.
8895000	8896000	Can we do that anyway?
8896000	8897000	Yes.
8897000	8901000	All right, sounds good. All right, take care, my friend.
8901000	8902000	Later.
8902000	8903000	All right, bye.
8903000	8910000	All right, we'll see if we can squeeze in one more call. 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8910000	8915000	Loki, any last minute stories to share with us? I feel like there's a lot we didn't really get around to tonight.
8915000	8920000	There's some information. It's rumored that there's going to be a new Brothers in Arms game that's in work,
8920000	8925000	and a new Far Cry Blood Dragon because they were spotted on that SAG-AFTRA list.
8925000	8931000	Oh, okay. Even though a lot of the SAG-AFTRA lists used codenames. There's a lot of codenames.
8931000	8934000	A lot of codenames, yeah, but those apparently weren't.
8934000	8937000	Gotcha. Anything else to share?
8937000	8941000	No. That's about it.
8941000	8947000	Well, things are pretty quiet on the Skype side, so I think we will close it down and close up shop for the night.
8947000	8954000	We've had a lot of shorter shows recently. I don't know if that's because Jamie not being here and not having that third opinion is shortening things down or what's going on.
8954000	8958000	If we just have less to say or if there's less gaming news, I don't know, but that's that.
8958000	8966000	We're going to wrap things up tonight, but we will be back to do it again in seven days, a Halloween episode, so we'll talk about scary games a little bit.
8967000	8974000	I don't have an interview booked yet, but I'm going to try to see if I can't get something for next week, especially if this voice actor thing continues another week.
8974000	8982000	I think I would really love to hear, but I also kind of want to be able to cover both sides without starting an argument, so I want to be able to kind of do that respectfully.
8982000	8988000	But I want to see if we can't do something like that next week, but who knows? Stay tuned.
8988000	8993000	Obviously, at the same time, I don't want to cover it because I want it to be resolved on Monday or Tuesday.
8993000	8999000	That's what I would really like to happen, but we'll see. Anyhow, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
8999000	9006000	Thank you so much for listening to our show, and thank you for downloading it and listening to it live.
9006000	9013000	Please consider telling a friend about the show. Spread the word, because Orange Launch Radio is the show where every gamer has a voice, but not if we don't have them here.
9013000	9021000	So tell a friend about the show and spread the word. A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes and all that stuff goes an awful long way as well.
9021000	9024000	Loki, shoot, any final thoughts tonight?
9024000	9036000	I don't know. I guess I'll try to work on my game this week. I say that every week and it doesn't end up happening, so I'll try again.
9036000	9042000	Well, I need to get around to getting Dragon Quest Builders, because I bought that game because I like the demo so much.
9042000	9050000	This is my final thought. I like the game so much, or I like the demo so much, I bought the game, even though I bought it with the slow shipping so I could get the extra credit on it.
9050000	9057000	Because I knew I'd be in Vegas, I wasn't in a hurry to play it. But boy, I really am not in a rush to play it, because it's still sitting there waiting for me to play. I just haven't gotten around to it.
9057000	9061000	Maybe tonight. We'll see, now that I have 20 extra minutes than I usually have. We'll see.
9061000	9071000	Anyway, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. We will see you in seven days to do it all over again. Have a great week everybody, happy gaming, and take care.
9080000	9088000	If you'd like to join us for a live show, tune into fognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.
9088000	9099000	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
9102000	9103000	See you next week.
9110000	9135000	Music.
