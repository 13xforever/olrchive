00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, after complete silence, some tweets rock Hello Games

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And are you ready to wait until 2017 for more info on Nintendo Switch?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 663

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For this, October the 30th of 2016, my name is Rob Roberts

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Joining you live from our studio to talk about all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And with me this week, say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Fine

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, Halloween's tomorrow

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Are you going to be taking the kids out for trick or treating and all that?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes, I will be

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What are you dressing up as?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not dressing up as anything

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What? Have you got that? Are you too old for Halloween? Is that what's happened?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, I just overdid it last year, so I'm not doing anything this year

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, you overdid it last year?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, because I stayed up for 24 hours straight to make that Lego Deadpool costume

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right, I remember that, oh yeah, okay, so you earned your year off

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, so I'm taking the year off

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But unfortunately, no tingle, 14 years in a row

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I wanted to get one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes that are the rage on the internet

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I see a lot of those, yeah

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So that would have been fun

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think I saw some picture of an inflatable T-Rex riding a T-Rex at some, like, theme park or something, I don't know

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That would be funny

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That would be hilarious

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You mentioned real quick, I mean, you might be gonna talk about this in your gaming week, I suppose, but I'm gonna bring it up now

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You mentioned you were at a social gathering last night

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
As, you know, the interesting thing with Halloween being on a Monday this year

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There was Halloween parties Friday night, Halloween parties Saturday night

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There's probably some Halloween parties tonight

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then there's actual Halloween on Monday

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, I know you went to a social gathering and you were doing the PlayStation VR

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How was that received in a party type setting?

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's alright, I mean, there was some people that wanted to try it

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mostly the people that have already tried it before

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xtafur got to try it for the first time

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, of course, the first one you had to have him play was Kitchen

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Which is Resident Evil 7, basically

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know why they call it, I guess Kitchen was the working name before they revealed it

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Kitchen demo, but that was funny, watching him jump

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't make it, like, five seconds to that demo

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Like, the very first gory thing that happened, I noped the fuck out of that demo

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I did

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then I set up Rush of Blood

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Which you've really been raving about that game

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, I love that game

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, we played, or I had

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Was it Flocko Jones play

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It was one of the levels in there

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
With, like, a witch thing that, like, fires crows at you or something

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And so there was a few moments, like, there was

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's also the one that has, like, kind of the Silent Hill type room

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where there's these mannequins that will

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You look away from them, they move

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, that type of thing

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, that was funny

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just watching him, you know, jump at all the jump scares and stuff

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I don't like jump scares, I don't do it

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, I always find them hilarious

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It didn't necessarily scare me, I just kind of laugh at them

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's kind of fun

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Fair enough

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But it's a fun game, though

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Alright, well not joining us tonight, of course, Dark Sakura

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She is still on leave from the show

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But she will hopefully be, actually, I think we're going to hear from her

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In a couple of weeks

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I know she's planning on being here for episode 666

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And we're going to be taping 665 in advance

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And I think she's going to be here for that

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, yeah, we'll have Dark Sakura back in the studio real soon

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I know she misses you all, but her aim is improving

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But if you are listening live, of course

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You should join us in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Even though Bobby was also off tonight

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Halloween is just throwing everything off

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just throwing off everybody's rhythm

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But a big hello to those of you that are in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Stoppy, I think, talking about work on Monday

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Saying in chat, I have some co-workers who are going to dress up

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
News to me, I thought they were dressing up as something all year

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, they're trying to find an apartment

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm not even that young, but it's a bunch of older people

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And they always want to like, okay, the whole floor is going to do a theme

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm like, fuck that

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because it's always some lame ass theme

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Like, you know, the last time, last year it was

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, we're all going to dress up like celebrities

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm like, fuck that, I'm dressing up as Lego Deadpool

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Which is sort of a celebrity

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sort of a celebrity

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But this year they're doing like 80s musicians

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm like, no, no

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm not going to do it

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, you can't talk until I introduce you

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's say hello

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We have some other folks in the studio

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I should probably introduce them

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because clearly they have something to say

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So we have a couple other people joining us tonight

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll start over here because this guy's here every week

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So he's nothing special

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Say hello to Shane, everybody

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He's joining us here

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not holding up my mic near my mouth

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Shane is protesting but not holding the mic near his mouth

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, then I can't ask you about your shiny collection

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And supposedly, what, you got to 100 shinies, right?

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, I got to my 100 shinies

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What was your 100th shiny that you got on Pokemon?

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What was it?

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hello

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm thinking

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You don't know?

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I would have thought this was a landmark occasion

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That you would celebrate

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it was like days ago

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, I'm trying to remember, I got that

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You know the old saying, you never forget your 100th Pokemon

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It was some sort of fished-up Pokemon

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I know that much

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, so you did use the fish trick

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, for the last three I did fishing

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was just like, screw it, I'm going to do that

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, okay

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Alright, so we'll just say Magikarp

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because you don't know

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, it wasn't a Magikarp

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I already had that

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It wouldn't have mattered

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright, well congratulations

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Congratulations on a 100 shiny Pokemon

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not sure what else to ask you about

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Solidarity is our guest

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Nope, that's fine

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Alright, so I'm brand new to the show

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Has never been here in studio before

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But I know it's been listening for a little while

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Say hello everybody, welcome to the show tonight

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
JD?

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hi there

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hi, how are you?

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Pretty good

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Good, welcome to the show

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, video games, you play them, right?

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I sure do

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Good, you're at the right place

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But you, we were talking a little bit beforehand

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because I was asking if you'd played like Thumper on PlayStation 4

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But you don't really own new consoles, right?

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're still rocking the classics?

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, I mean, I keep up with stuff on Steam

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So when stuff goes on sale, I pick things up

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But yeah, I mean, my most recent consoles are a Wii and a PS2

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, so old school stuff?

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A little bit, at this point it's old school stuff?

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I mean, it's weird to me to think of it like that

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But yeah, it is

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So do you consider yourself more of a PC gamer then

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you're keeping up with stuff mostly on Steam?

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, I mean, I also, I play Guild Wars 2 a lot

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So that's definitely a current title

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But yeah, I would say the new stuff coming out, I'm a PC gamer

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, nice

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Which is pretty much safe at this point

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Because most of the games that come out nowadays that are worth getting are on PC

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That is really true

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You know, well, Microsoft has their whole thing with, you know, Xbox One

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And like Windows 10 is like one platform, basically

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And you buy a game one place, you get them on both

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I mean, you know, what, like Forza Horizon 3 you should be able to get on PC, right?

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just, I'm behind, I still haven't picked up that game

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I almost did today, Shane tried

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, there was a lot of like deals trying to be made, but

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay, so here's the problem

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm at Target, which is having the whole buy two, get one free video game thing

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And for some reason, Shane has decided that I need to take advantage of this deal

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't know what he gets out of it, but he's just

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was just bored

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He's just decided he wants to watch me drop $100 on video games

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It'd be like $120 plus tax, because games are $60

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Fine, fine

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But here's the problem, is I wanted to get, I was like

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, I'll get Forza Horizon 3, that's obvious

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll get that one, because I need to get that still

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll get Skyrim Special Edition, why not? I'm curious enough

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, I would be all over that on Xbox One

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm kind of hesitant on PlayStation 4

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well I do have an Xbox One, and so I'd probably pick it up over there

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Just because of the whole modding situation

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So okay, fine, those two, but then I couldn't figure out a third game that I want

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right, that I didn't already have

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now that's the problem guys, it's the one that I didn't already have

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Because you could say, oh Civ 6 just came out, well I already bought that

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I bought that before the sale happened

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And usually, you know, I'm pretty good to myself

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
When a new game comes out that I want, I get it

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I didn't really have three games in the backlog to get

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
World of Final Fantasy?

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Shane had suggested that, but I'm sorry

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That demo did not sway me on the game

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And even when we were watching people play it on Twitch, I wasn't feeling it

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not feeling World of Final Fantasy, I'm sorry to say

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll be all over Final Fantasy 15 when that comes out

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But that's not part of the sale, so that's an issue isn't it?

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Over in chat at live.fognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy says

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Shane, spend money, give me your credit card, Skye

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, yeah it sometimes goes like that

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well actually it was JD that came up with a brilliant idea on how to make this work

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
JD suggested, well why don't you buy the two games

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And then get that third free game and then sell it to Shane

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And I was like, okay, I'm liking this idea

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We'll split the cost

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And then they had a fight about how to split the cost, so it didn't happen

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then we had a fight about how to split the cost

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because Shane was like, hell yeah, I'll take a free game

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I'm like, wait a minute, it doesn't work like that

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is not me buying two games, so you get the free game

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But then I offered up, I have Forza Horizon 3

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
On a demo, or not a demo, but a code

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I haven't used it yet, so I offered that up for the free game

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, but the problem is, when he offered up Forza Horizon 3

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I said, great, now we're back to the same problem

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll buy Skyrim, and then what?

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I still don't have another game to get

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, then we fought in the middle of Target for a good 30 minutes

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And JD had to watch all this, and it was really awkward

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But, you know, welcome to my life, JD

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was funny

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, JD, you play the PC stuff and you play some of the classic consoles

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You could have gotten Paper Mario

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know, that was suggested, and that was probably the closest

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Where I was like, I might pick up Paper Mario

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But for some reason, I didn't see it in the Wii U section, did you?

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't think I even looked for it

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't even think I saw it

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Isn't it a 3DS game?

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, okay, that's a Wii U game

255
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, I mean, it's very similar to the last 3DS game

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Shut up

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But you've talked about, now we'll talk about the Switch later on tonight

258
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And obviously there was a whole lot of Switch talk last week

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But JD, you're feeling the Switch announcement, right?

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, no, I'm really looking forward to it

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean, especially with the handheld capability

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Because I started out, when I started on consoles, I started with the Game Boy

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So, I mean, I've been playing handhelds for a long time

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing, you know, a more powerful handheld

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah

266
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I know another reason that, you know, you've started listening to OLR

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And gotten to know us and everything is that you are a big fan of music games, right?

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So tell us, like, how did the music game thing, let's do a throwback episode tonight

270
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, wow

271
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How did the music game thing start? Like, what was your first music game? Was it DDR?

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, so I started with DDR

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, which mix?

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was Fifth Mix

275
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Fifth Mix

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Which is still one of my favorites

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Uh-huh

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I mean, they, anyway, there's a lot of Dance Mania songs on there

279
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And just all of the licensing that they did in the earlier era of DDR was a lot of fun

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Were you one of those people posting on DDR Freak back in the day, like some of us?

281
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Every so often

282
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Every so often? Awesome

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What was your username on there, JD?

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't even know if it's still there

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm just curious if I was like, did I ever see him when I was, I never asked you this, like what was your name there?

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I was Sky, that's why I still

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, this is ages ago, but I think my username was GameBoyGuy13

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay, wow, okay, that's old school

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right?

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay, I think I remember you under that name listening to this show

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh my god

292
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think I do, I think I do, name sounds familiar

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This really is a throwback episode

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I know, I know

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So, okay, so you started on DDR Fifth Mix, and then, so what other music games, so do you buy the, like you said you have PlayStation 2

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So do you buy all the, because they stopped making Mania 2DX during the PlayStation 2 era, do you import all that stuff?

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, so I have the home version copies of the 2DX titles and the DDR ones

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I used to have a PS1 because a lot of the DDR titles were only, the earlier ones up through Fifth Mix were only released on PlayStation in Japan

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So, when I was in high school I had them, but I don't anymore for various reasons

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But, yeah, mostly I just have a 2DX, because I have a US Konami controller for the 2DX

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I have, I don't have DDR pads anymore, they didn't survive a cross-country move

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So, I've been, you know, it's on my to-do list is to pick up a new pad, so, and get it home set up

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You grew up in Orlando

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's right

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And then you, did you live in Kansas?

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, I went to college in the Central Valley

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay, and then you, now you live in San Francisco

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's right

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, so that was your cross-country, got it

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yep

311
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Got it, got it

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, let's see, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, Fifth is a good place to start, though you miss out on Fourth Plus

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There was a Fourth Plus arcade machine, like when I was going out and about in Orlando, and Rocky's Replay was the name of the place

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And they had Fourth Plus for a long time, so when I would go out, you know, with my friends and go play DDR, that was one of the places I'd go

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I got very familiar with Fourth Plus

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now one thing I find kind of interesting is that, you know, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we kind of, I don't want to say we stopped playing DDR

317
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh yep, I'm playing tons of DDR

318
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But we kind of, we kind of, like, we kind of did, like it's one of those things though, but like obviously now with the round one, kind of having these arcade games that I used to be really into in my 20s, kind of making a resurgence again

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And like the types of arcades I was into 10 years ago, 15 years ago when the show started, like now that that's making a resurgence, I'm kind of into it again

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But otherwise, I don't usually like seek out DDR machines, but you do, right? You still like regularly go to arcades and play DDR, right?

321
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Not as regularly as I'd like to, because there aren't really any convenient to me, and I think that's, you know, a sign of there not being as many arcades anymore as there used to be

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I mean, I have to still use website databases to find them, I'm not just going to randomly run across a machine

323
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Have you checked out Ace yet in Dave and Busters?

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh I forget it's a Dave and Busters, that's another thing in Roseville, JD

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We were talking earlier about how all of the fun stuff is in Roseville, apparently

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But then I'm like, but Roseville isn't fun, like Roseville will shut down at 10 o'clock and then, now it sucks

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So it's just funny, we were like, we could go to Dunkin Donuts, oh it's in Roseville, we go to Golf Land, it's in Roseville, Mongolian Roseville

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everything's in fucking Roseville

329
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They have Krispy Kreme in there open 24 hours

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's true, they have pumpkin spice donuts this week too, it was amazing

331
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Anyway, I could talk about food all night long, but we should probably take the healthier option and continue talking about DDR

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We could talk about food gaming

333
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Food gaming? What's food gaming?

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well there's various games about food, I mean there's Cooking Mama, there's Cook Serve Delicious, all sorts of fun stuff

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There was one guy I saw a YouTube video of playing Overwatch with a controller made out of bananas through Arduino

336
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So that's food gaming

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I guess, I guess that's a type of food gaming

338
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Or we could just have a 100 second kitchen battle

339
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I see what you did there

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are you one of those guys that drops the names of songs into conversations and goes, get it?

341
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wasn't that a meme a while ago?

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It was a LiveJournal community

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh god, so LiveJournal, you have had your life changed by LiveJournal just like the rest of us

344
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh yeah

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, oh man, I met Alan on LiveJournal and Orange Lounge Radio probably still has a LiveJournal community

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't remember the last time it was updated

347
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't even remember what it was

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It was either Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You couldn't get OLR?

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't think we got OLR, no I think it was probably Taken or something

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So yeah, awesome

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So I'm not sure what else to ask you about

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So you go to arcades and you play sometimes DDR but not as often as you used to

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Ever since Playland Japan opened in Japantown a couple years ago

355
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I've gone there and they have a popin music machine

356
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
In Orlando you couldn't find popin anywhere

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And now that I'm in the Bay Area it's a lot easier to find

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And so I've started playing popin a bit

359
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But you have yet to, even though you're in the Bay Area, you have yet to go to any of these round ones

360
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Right, because I live in San Francisco, I don't have a car

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And all of these round ones are way out on the edges of the area

362
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So it's impossible to get to on transit

363
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So just so you know, I brought up our LiveJournal community

364
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Which is at orangelounge.livejournal.com

365
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And the last entry we made was Sunday, June 21st, 2009

366
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh wow

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And that was, the announcement there was

368
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The new URL to find OLR is at radio.allgames.com

369
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because that must have been the date that we flipped over to AllGames from Live 365

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So, which was our home before we were here at VOG Network

371
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So, just kind of funny that that's the last time the LiveJournal community was used

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Although that's a pretty important update

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah

374
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I should probably make an update that says, just in case you were looking here

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, I think they have another show on now, Sundays at 6

376
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which is fine, I'm sure it's a fine show, but we've moved somewhere else

377
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, LiveJournal

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know what's going on on LiveJournal anymore

379
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh no they didn't, community, right?

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I think, oh no they didn't, it's probably the only thing going on on LiveJournal right now

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And Russian chat

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, okay, yeah, there's definitely, there's always been a large Russian community on LiveJournal

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But it's mostly taken over the site because of ownership changes

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Hmm

385
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Pokemon collectors on LiveJournal, it's really active

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So I guess there's still the communities, some of the communities still have a presence over there

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But I kind of, I kind of miss LiveJournal in some ways

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We were talking about this a little bit, is that

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You know, I know Facebook I think kind of killed it for a lot of people

390
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because with Facebook it was so easy from your mobile phone to post pictures, to post other things

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But Facebook, it sucks, like I don't know how else to put it

392
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Like it's one of those necessary things I have to do

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's so full of garbage right now

394
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It is so full of garbage

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But it sucks because I feel that honestly, if I didn't check Facebook

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I would not know that like some of my friends are expecting kids or getting married or things like that

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Like I would miss that if I did not have Facebook now

398
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Exactly, and I didn't check that and then when I had to help them move

399
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I was like, oh, you're having a baby, okay

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, right

401
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I mean, I even find out about family stuff from Facebook sometimes

402
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Like, you know, it's, people use it, but that's all they use

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But the problem with Facebook is that it's not chronological

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You can miss things, you know

405
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Exactly

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Even if you're reading the site

407
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You have to have, he can sort it with the top stories

408
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Or he can do chronological

409
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Chronological is default

410
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then Facebook's like, fuck you, we want ad revenue

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We're gonna fuck that sorting shit all up

412
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And it's just gonna shuffle everything

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And, yeah

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah, it's rough, it's rough

415
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And thank you Alex P. Carson in chat says

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
OMG, I love Rob on Facebook

417
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I don't post, like, I wouldn't dare post

418
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know, I feel like maybe I have gotten political

419
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
political stuff is, like, gay rights stuff

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Which, you know, you're not gonna dare speak up on my Facebook

421
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
anti that stuff, right?

422
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I think I've tried very hard not to dip my toe into the whole

423
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
like, presidential race

424
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Because, like, I just, I fucking can't

425
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Like, there's enough of it everywhere else on Facebook

426
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So instead, I like to post things like

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think just this past week

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It was announced that ABBA is doing something in 2017

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They're not reuniting, but they might be

430
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And yes, OMG, I can fucking tie ABBA to gaming this week

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is the best week ever since SingStar ABBA came out

432
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, that's been out for a while

433
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I know, right?

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But when has ABBA been in games?

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And so, ok, but this week they announced that ABBA's gonna be doing something

436
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And it sounds like it might be a VR type of experience

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Or it could be, it may be AR

438
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And, like, part of, like, they obviously aren't releasing a lot of details

439
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And they're not going to till next year

440
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But one of the things that crossed my mind was this whole hologram thing

441
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Like, remember when Tupac was at Coachella a couple years ago?

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Remember that?

443
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Or if Jamie was here, I'm sure she would talk about gorillas when they play live

444
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Or Hatsune Miku

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You people, I'm sure you know Hatsune Miku

446
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh man, that VR demo was terrible

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I like the game

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I like the game

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But the concept of the concert is so interesting to me

450
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's not bad, just interesting because it's, I don't want to say it's all fake

451
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But it kind of is

452
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Like, I guess the music is played live by musicians

453
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But all these projections are fake

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's so interesting to me

455
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So I don't know if that's the type of thing that ABBA's doing

456
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But they could be leveraging gaming technology

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like a VR headset

458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
To bring ABBA current

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Which would be awesome because the greatest music ever made

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I mean, as long as they're making new music, I'll be happy

461
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
They're in their 70s

462
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Those girls' voices, Agnetha and Anthea

463
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Cher is that old and she's making new music

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I think it always auto-tune the show

465
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So when are we going to embrace Vocaloid Tupac?

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know

467
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why would we do that when he's not dead?

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe with Prince

469
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because Prince has all this unreleased music

470
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So eventually whenever they wiggle out the licenses

471
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Or David Bowie

472
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Those are two artists right there

473
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This year has fucking sucked

474
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There's been so many people that have passed

475
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And those obviously are two all-time greats

476
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But also the thing that those two have in common

477
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is that they were always in tune

478
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
With technological advances and things like that

479
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like both of them were

480
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Like what David Bowie had a game

481
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Prince had, when he was in his symbol

482
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The love symbol phase

483
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He had some type of interactive CD-ROM

484
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Live journal page

485
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Actually, if I'm not mistaken

486
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Didn't Prince have the largest internet presence

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Like in the 90s when the internet was first growing

488
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Like the largest fandom was Prince

489
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I feel like I read that somewhere

490
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But anyway, doesn't matter

491
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
My point is that

492
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You're right, that same type of technology

493
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean we're having a laugh about Tupac

494
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And Coachella and all this stuff

495
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But that same type of technology

496
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I could totally see like a Bowie or a Prince type experience

497
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Especially if they're opening

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Paisley Park

499
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
To tourists now

500
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like imagine if you could actually see

501
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Prince playing on a

502
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't know how big that place is

503
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If it had a stage or anything like that

504
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But imagine if you could go in a room and see Prince

505
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Working or something

506
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Crazy technology

507
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's very crazy

508
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster in Chat says

509
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Bowie was an Omicron

510
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
One of Quantic Dream's earliest games

511
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Right, absolutely

512
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Vidpower at live.vognetwork.com says

513
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I remember that Letterman Hatsune performance

514
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Sad that Letterman was so confused

515
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I can imagine, I mean

516
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Also, wasn't that the point where Letterman kind of had

517
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
One foot out the door, like he knew his end date

518
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And he knew Colbert was coming into play

519
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So he was kind of like, over it

520
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He was phoning it in that last year

521
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's see, Rageinator says

522
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Abba, greatest music ever, Skye, surely you jest

523
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Metallica

524
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Can you imagine like

525
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Queen?

526
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
There's also a SingStar Queen diss

527
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There is a SingStar Queen diss, now okay

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If you're talking about Queen versus Abba

529
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay, now we're having a contest

530
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You know, like, fucking Hologram

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Freddie Mercury, I mean that'd be fucking amazing

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hologram Michael Jackson, I mean if we're gonna

533
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Exactly, let's just do it all

534
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But Rageinator says Metallica and Stone Temple

535
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Pilots greater than Abba, first of all

536
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Look

537
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
First of all, everybody has different tastes

538
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I could agree with the Stone Temple Pilots one

539
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But I want to point this out

540
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I was at Blizzcon a couple years ago

541
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Metallica was the headliner

542
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So like, we could have got like, seats

543
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Or, well, nobody sits in a Metallica concert

544
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But we could have been right there, like in the front

545
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Mashing with everybody

546
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We chose to go to the bar instead

547
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So, I'm sorry

548
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Cause that probably really angers you to hear that

549
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But I would fully expect that if the

550
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The roles were reversed

551
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And it was an Abba concert, you'd be telling me the same thing

552
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You'd be like, you know what Rob, I went to the bar instead

553
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And, you know, that's fine

554
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Cause everybody's into what they're into

555
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So, and Tigerclaw says they are

556
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Different styles of music, that's very true

557
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's very, very true

558
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Alright, anyhow

559
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, so JD, one question I always ask

560
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Of guests, and after this we'll move on and talk about

561
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Our gaming weeks, but one question I always ask

562
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Of guests is

563
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What is your favorite

564
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Video game of all time

565
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You can only pick one

566
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
All the others will be killed

567
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Just kidding, no, you can only pick one

568
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What is your favorite video game of

569
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
All time

570
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Not that I'm putting them on the spot or anything

571
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Favorite video game

572
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Favorite video game, that's what we talk about here

573
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
At OLRP Games

574
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
If we're just going

575
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Based on replayability

576
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And that, I mean

577
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
P-Cross can keep me fascinated for hours

578
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay, good choice

579
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And there's so many varieties of P-Cross as well

580
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I like the ones where you draw a picture a lot

581
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Better than the ones that are just, you know

582
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Use the logic and complete the grid

583
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because I like making pretty pictures

584
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Of course, who doesn't?

585
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
People out there are weird

586
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, it does, I mean even Nintendo

587
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Even made Mario P-Cross early on

588
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Wasn't it like a Game Boy game or something?

589
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And they also

590
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Recently, yeah, they recently

591
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Had a Zelda P-Cross

592
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
As a, you could get it with Miitomo points

593
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That was my first exposure to P-Cross

594
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Because I was playing Miitomo pretty hard

595
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Those first couple months, I finally fell off

596
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But you're still playing Miitomo, right?

597
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Occasionally

598
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, so my sister

599
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Got a new iPhone and now she has

600
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The memory for apps

601
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So she's started Miitomo

602
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I've kind of picked it up again

603
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Partly to comment and like her answers

604
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
To give her coins, because I know how important that is

605
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
When you're getting started

606
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But also it's a good way for us to keep in touch

607
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Because she's still in Orlando

608
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And, you know, we don't talk as much as I'd like to

609
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So that's one way for us to keep it

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's kind of interesting that of all things it's Miitomo

611
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But, you know

612
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Well, it's not just Miitomo, it's Twitter, it's texting

613
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's a lot of things

614
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I think a lot of people have a story like this

615
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Like when Alan and I were first dating

616
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And Alan was living in San Francisco and I was here

617
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Playing World of Warcraft together was a way

618
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We could quote-unquote hang out

619
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Even though we weren't necessarily hanging out

620
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You know what I mean?

621
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
MMOs and video games lend itself very well

622
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
In that space to help bridge those distances

623
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Definitely

624
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I mean, I would get her playing Guild Wars

625
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
If I didn't want her to have

626
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know, I want her to do well in school

627
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Oh, you play Guild Wars?

628
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean, I played the original Guild Wars

629
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Starting in like 2006

630
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And when the new one came out

631
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
All of my friends in my guild moved over as well

632
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's cool

633
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I have Guild Wars 2, I don't have the expansion

634
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I have the original Guild Wars 2, but I didn't play it very long

635
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It came out at a weird time

636
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I feel like there was a lot of stuff coming out all at once

637
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
My computer at the time was struggling with it

638
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Really?

639
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah, I need to go back and play it now

640
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Because I got a souped up computer a couple years ago

641
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That can play whatever

642
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So yeah, I should go back and do

643
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Guild Wars 2 at some point

644
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It'd be fun

645
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You can be on any server

646
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You're not limited

647
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's limited by region

648
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
If you're in North America, you can only play with North American servers

649
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
If you're in EU, you can only play with EU people

650
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That's not that bad

651
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But that's the only restriction

652
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There is one game mode called World v World

653
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Which is

654
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's a pretty unique mechanic

655
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Where it's like sieging and stuff

656
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So your one server

657
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Is fighting a one-on-one-on-one battle

658
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So there are three different servers at a time

659
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I remember playing one of those

660
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's like 60 people in there at once

661
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I think the map cap is something like 200

662
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh my god, yeah, I remember playing that

663
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
All these people, it was PVP on a massive scale

664
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Right, so it's PVP

665
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But there's a big environmental component to it

666
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because you're wearing down forts and such

667
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yes

668
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not just go kill each other

669
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's break down the walls

670
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
There's catapults and rams and things like that

671
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's the only place where

672
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Server actually makes a difference

673
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Because if you're on one server and your friend's on another

674
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You can't play together

675
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There's no guessing for that

676
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And wasn't that something where

677
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You would level sync too

678
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Even if you're level 5

679
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You get bumped up to max level

680
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So everybody can compete on equal ground

681
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Max level is 80

682
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And all of the competitive modes

683
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
World v World and standard PVP

684
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Which is 5 on 5

685
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
All of those are at max level

686
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So you don't have to worry about

687
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh I'm underleveled for this match

688
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's not a concern for the most part

689
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's cool

690
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
There's also no monthly fee

691
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Which makes it a good game for

692
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh I have a copy of this but I don't have to subscribe to it

693
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I can just pick it up and play it however much I want

694
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And then leave it with no cost

695
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I know that that's made Guild Wars

696
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Attractive to a lot of people as the model

697
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And in fact the base game

698
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Has gone free to play in the past year

699
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
When they released the new expansion

700
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Gotcha

701
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
In fact I think Loki kind of wishes

702
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Square Enix would pay attention to how well that model

703
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Has worked for Guild Wars

704
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And adopt it with things such as Final Fantasy 11

705
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They're never going to do it with 11 because they have 14

706
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
14 makes them too much money but

707
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah it would be nice

708
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Probably should check out

709
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Elder Scrolls Online because they went

710
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
See I really didn't like Elder Scrolls Online

711
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I didn't either

712
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I just couldn't get into it

713
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I couldn't get into it either

714
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That was the disappointing part because I really liked

715
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Elder Scrolls Skyrim

716
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And Oblivion but

717
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Online just not

718
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Not feeling it

719
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I understand

720
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah so that whole conversation from

721
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
P-Cross your favorite game

722
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Which if you haven't

723
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Spent your Nintendo points

724
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Which people are probably collecting by signing

725
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Into the eShop every week and stuff

726
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If you are check out that

727
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Zelda P-Cross you can get a free one

728
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And that will kind of introduce you to what those puzzles are

729
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If nothing else

730
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That was my gateway drug

731
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I believe our pal

732
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Bobby Blackwolf is really into those P-Cross games too

733
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because I know he says they're

734
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Kind of cheap they're only like 3 or 4 bucks

735
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
A pop right?

736
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think he buys them when they come out

737
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I play them on my phone and there's any number of apps

738
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
On the Google store

739
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I think of P-Cross

740
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Think of P-Cross as synonymous

741
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
With Nintendo

742
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Which is interesting because P-Cross has

743
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
As like a picture crossword which is what it comes from

744
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Has been around since pen and paper

745
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Like you can you know before it was

746
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
A video game it was just a puzzle

747
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So now I'm going to go

748
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Download 5,000 P-Cross apps on my phone

749
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Later and I'm going to have you to blame

750
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'd give you Rex but you're on iPhone

751
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But have you downloaded PolitiCats yet?

752
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I did not download PolitiCats

753
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I haven't either

754
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But we probably should do that first

755
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
No I guess we'll talk about our gaming

756
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And get sucked into yet another clicker game

757
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I know that's kind of my hesitation

758
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't need another clicker game

759
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I've finally gotten free though from

760
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Nonstop Night I've lost interest in it

761
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah I kind of fell off that too

762
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So maybe it's time to go

763
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Time to get into some PolitiCats

764
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Brad will be very happy

765
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Pod Culture is back this week

766
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
After a long break

767
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So make Brad happy this week

768
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Get some PolitiCats action going on

769
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Alright well let's talk about

770
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The games we have been playing this week

771
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Actually

772
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah in a segment we call the

773
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
How was your gaming week?

774
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm losing it guys

775
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay look just disclaimer

776
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And I warned you this would happen last week

777
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I was up until 3am last night because we had a rocky show

778
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Which JD was in town to see

779
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I hope you had a good time

780
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I highly recommend it

781
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And you kind of got to see the other side of Rob Roberts

782
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side

783
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's right the Beautifully Unique Sparkle Pony side of me

784
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Hosting that show

785
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And my voice today

786
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Is kind of shot and I'm just like my energy

787
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Is like drained

788
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
From last night so

789
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
If I'm like out of it tonight admittedly

790
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yes I am

791
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Because we talked about that whole Halloween on Friday

792
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Halloween on Saturday

793
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So I am a little drained this week

794
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So let's talk a little bit about how was your gaming week

795
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week

796
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Well thankfully I've actually played quite a bit this week

797
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So I was playing

798
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I didn't get to play a whole ton of

799
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
PlayStation VR but I did play

800
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
A ton of it this weekend

801
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Just basically the get ready for

802
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The party that was on Saturday

803
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So I played through Rush of Blood

804
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Previously I played through like the third level

805
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And then I just finished it

806
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
This week so

807
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That was fun I really do enjoy that game

808
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's probably my favorite game on

809
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
PlayStation VR so far

810
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Along with that I did play some of the other demos

811
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
On there I got to see the

812
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Kitchen demo being played which

813
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Is alright I think it was pretty cool

814
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Probably would have been a little bit more scary

815
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Actually wearing the headset for that

816
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I did pick up

817
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Rez so I'll probably be playing some of that this week

818
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But I haven't actually played any of it yet

819
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I tried Thumper

820
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Which I thought was pretty cool

821
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So that might be one I pick up later on

822
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It was pretty difficult

823
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So I don't know we'll see

824
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And then

825
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't know I've been browsing the store a lot

826
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Because I've been like at my work

827
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
They do these kind of

828
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Incentive things where like someone will give you

829
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
An award for doing something that you're

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Normally not supposed to be in charge of

831
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And kind of you know discretionary

832
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Efforts and so they'll give you like a certificate

833
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And then this

834
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
They call it a Tango card which is basically

835
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
This universal gift card that you go on a website

836
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And redeem for something so I've been using it

837
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
For PlayStation money

838
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So I've

839
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Been getting games with that

840
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And so

841
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I've been kind of browsing the store figuring out what I want to buy next

842
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Because

843
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There's not a whole lot of the new stuff

844
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Coming out that really interests me

845
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I thought about doing

846
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I think it was called

847
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Windlands or something like that

848
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's some like parkour

849
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Grappling hook exploration

850
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Game but I hear it's kind of boring

851
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And I mean it looks neat

852
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's just kind of

853
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Running low on content

854
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh I did try Battlezone that was the other one

855
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That I played the demo for and that was pretty cool

856
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Once again though 60 bucks for that

857
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't know that's a bit expensive

858
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And then

859
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I did play some non VR stuff

860
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I played more cluster trucks

861
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Because I was trying to see if the

862
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Free Halloween update was available

863
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But I think that's only on PC

864
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So I haven't dug into my PC copy yet

865
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But I played a little bit more of that

866
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Passed some more levels

867
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And I got to

868
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The future land now

869
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Which is incredibly hard

870
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because a lot of them involve jumping down holes

871
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
To get the things

872
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's frustrating and hard

873
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But it's fun

874
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That would be an awesome VR game

875
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And then Ingress

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I did try a little bit of Pokemon Go

877
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Because of the Halloween update

878
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I played it for like 5 minutes

879
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And already lost interest

880
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I've been loving the Halloween update

881
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But again with the Pogo Plus

882
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And me just having an interest in general

883
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
To try to do more walking

884
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I just feel like Pokemon Go has been a great motivator for me

885
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And I've been loving this Halloween event

886
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because it's not just double candy from catches

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's double candy from eggs

888
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Double candy from the candy factory

889
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's great

890
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I kind of wish it would just be permanent

891
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It is nice that they have

892
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
New Pokemon

893
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's kind of nice to wander around

894
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Instead of Rattatas everywhere

895
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Now it's Cubones and Meowths

896
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I will say that I noticed a spawn difference

897
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Here in Sacramento versus San Francisco

898
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
In San Francisco there were Gasleys

899
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
All over the place

900
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Turn around you see a Gasley

901
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And I haven't noticed that out here

902
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's Meowths and Cubones everywhere

903
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It's a drought out here

904
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It is, it is

905
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Anything else for your gaming week Loki?

906
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I did play Jackbox Party Pack 3

907
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That was something I was introduced to

908
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Last night

909
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So I got to try out a few of the games in there

910
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Trivia Murder Party which is awesome

911
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Hosted by Satan from South Park

912
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's funny

913
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I think we all played Jackbox Party Pack 3 at this point

914
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And that was the game

915
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I was looking forward to the most

916
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I love it

917
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's a great party game

918
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And I think for people that are looking for You Don't Know Jack

919
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I think this isn't

920
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You Don't Know Jack

921
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But the setup is extremely similar

922
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think people that are missing

923
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You Don't Know Jack will be into it

924
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But I can't stand the announcer voice

925
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I can't stand

926
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The filtered announcer voice

927
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I can't do it

928
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
When Travis Donovan did DJ Satan

929
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
On his show

930
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I thought it was a better filter

931
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's hard to hear on the TV

932
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I thought it was hilarious

933
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I don't care for it

934
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I know we have folks at Jackbox that listen to the show

935
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And you guys are great

936
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The Satan thing

937
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I couldn't connect with that

938
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I had never played a Jackbox game before

939
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Prior to that

940
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I actually got to try it out

941
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
My wife actually played two

942
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You hadn't played Party Pack 2?

943
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
No, I hadn't played any of them

944
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I thought it was fantastic

945
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
With the phone thing

946
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
They should do that with a ton of more games

947
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't know why no one else is doing it

948
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Jackbox games does that

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I understand they do that with all their games

950
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Seriously, this should be something you should be doing with a ton of other games

951
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah, using a phone as a controller is a great mechanic

952
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And everyone needs to do it

953
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Well, to be fair

954
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And maybe this is also interesting

955
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
They were criticized the first year

956
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
When You Don't Know Jack was in there

957
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Because the phone has the delay

958
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So when people would buzz in

959
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
To try to answer on You Don't Know Jack

960
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It didn't really work right

961
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah, I could see that

962
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But they switched it now in Trivia Murder Party

963
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Everybody answers the question

964
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's different

965
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So I wonder

966
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
If maybe

967
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That was their work around

968
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Maybe we're just going to come up with a new trivia game

969
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Interesting, I'd be curious

970
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, we played that

971
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We also played Quiplash 2

972
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Which was fantastic

973
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We also played Fake In It

974
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But Fake In It honestly was the least favorite

975
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I think of the whole group

976
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I didn't like it too much

977
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
There was no real indicator

978
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The questions they were asking

979
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It didn't seem like it would be that hard

980
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
To fake anything

981
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't know

982
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It was just kind of dumb

983
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We got really bored with it really fast

984
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We were like, okay, we're not playing that again

985
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Which minigames did you get for it? Was it the pointing one?

986
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We had the pointing one

987
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We had the numbers on your fingers

988
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And then there was

989
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Raising your hand or not

990
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So there's one of them that you can get

991
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's called texting or something

992
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And everybody but one

993
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The faker gets a certain question

994
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Texted to them

995
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And the faker gets a different question

996
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then all of the answers go on the screen

997
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And you can see them together

998
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, that was the last one

999
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And the spoiler, it was Flaco Jones

1000
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Flaco Jones had gone to the bathroom

1001
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And didn't actually answer the question

1002
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh no

1003
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And so the first round of that were like

1004
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, well, I don't know who it is

1005
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And we were like, it's probably Flaco

1006
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And we just all voted that

1007
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And sure enough, it was him

1008
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Because he just didn't answer any of them

1009
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh, I didn't know the game was still going

1010
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
He could have taken his phone into the bathroom

1011
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
With him and played from the potty seat

1012
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
See, that's the other advantage

1013
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
To having your phone as a controller

1014
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Is that you don't have to take a break

1015
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, and also it's awesome too

1016
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Just like the Twitch support and stuff

1017
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I just think it's

1018
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know what these games are

1019
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I didn't know what the appeal was

1020
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Or how fun they would be

1021
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And I'm just really surprised

1022
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
How fun it was

1023
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, some comments in chat

1024
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's an innovative idea and I'm loving it

1025
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We've had great parties with the Party Pack

1026
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
With friends

1027
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't like using my phone for stuff

1028
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It should all be on the console or PC you play on

1029
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Plus, not everyone has smartphones

1030
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Or Wi-Fi slash Bluetooth

1031
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You know, I kind of see

1032
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That perspective, but at the same time

1033
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I think this is why not every game

1034
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Uses this in the world

1035
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But I think, you know, this is Jackbox's niche

1036
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Right now, and they're doing really well with it

1037
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It works as a party game

1038
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Plus, you can use a laptop or an iPad

1039
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That's true, you could use a laptop

1040
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
All you need, anything with a web browser

1041
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You don't even have to be in the same room

1042
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I know some people who play remotely using the room code

1043
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And the Twitch thing

1044
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't remember if it was the first

1045
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Party Pack or whatever they had before that

1046
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Was when they started realizing

1047
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And we had them on the show for packs 1 and 2

1048
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I really should have sent them an invite for part 3

1049
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But, you know, just

1050
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Everything else going on

1051
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But if you guys are out there listening and want to come talk about part 3

1052
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You can, just shoot me an email

1053
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But, so with part 1

1054
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I think they saw the successes on Twitch

1055
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So I think in part 2, they actually tried to think

1056
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
More about how can we accommodate

1057
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The Twitch audience, and they were seeing that

1058
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Now this one feels like

1059
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
All the games can be done over Twitch

1060
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And there's even thing in the option mode

1061
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
To let the timers be longer

1062
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
To account for the Twitch delay

1063
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah, it's pretty crazy

1064
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I was impressed by how much specific

1065
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Twitch features there were in each of the games

1066
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I went and looked at the settings

1067
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Because I'm that kind of a gamer sometimes

1068
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And I was impressed, everything had settings for it

1069
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, so they're kind of refining that

1070
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, so maybe

1071
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
When they have the Steam sale or something

1072
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll pick up all three Party Packs

1073
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah, probably towards

1074
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Black Friday or something, they'll probably have a super bundle

1075
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That has a ton of stuff, I'm sure they will

1076
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But, what was I going to say about part 3?

1077
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I didn't get to play all of it

1078
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Because it definitely seems like

1079
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
For a lot of people

1080
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Party Pack 3 is trivia murder party

1081
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And other games

1082
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Everybody goes and plays that one first

1083
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We didn't do faking it until the end until when people started leaving

1084
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Because we had 8 people

1085
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So faking it is only up to 6

1086
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So we're just like, oh we can't play that right now

1087
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
We're just going to play these two

1088
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We played trivia murder party twice

1089
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And I like how the second time you play it the same people

1090
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's the siblings

1091
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So it's the junior

1092
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And then they even create a part 2

1093
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
With the subtitle

1094
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Unless you were the survivor the first time

1095
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Then you don't get the junior

1096
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Did you play a third game?

1097
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
We didn't play the third one

1098
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
There's an achievement for making a trilogy

1099
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah, an achievement for making a trilogy

1100
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And you get part 3, the never ending gory

1101
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's awesome

1102
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I only got to play the trivia murder party

1103
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And we played Gespionage

1104
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We played Gespionage quite a bit

1105
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I was going to say one more trivia murder party

1106
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Because basically

1107
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
For anyone that's not familiar with it

1108
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So you answer a trivia question

1109
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
If you get it right

1110
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You get money, if you get it wrong

1111
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You have to play a mini game

1112
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And the mini games, if you fail the mini game you die

1113
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But the one we played

1114
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But your ghost can still play

1115
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So you're not out of the game

1116
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You can still play

1117
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But the final round

1118
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
If you're a ghost, you're at a huge disadvantage

1119
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Well, it depends

1120
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I've had games where you can

1121
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Take over someone's body and win

1122
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So there was one

1123
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This one, you didn't die

1124
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But you had to pick a finger that cut off

1125
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yes, I hated that one so much

1126
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I was like

1127
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What is this? You pick a finger

1128
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, I'll pick this finger

1129
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And come to find out, there's always four answers

1130
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And then if you happen to cut off that particular finger

1131
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You can't answer that question correctly

1132
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That was brilliant

1133
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
We just spoiled it for everybody

1134
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The first time I saw it was brilliant

1135
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You cut off a finger, so like you say, you cut off your first finger

1136
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then you can never answer the first answer

1137
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
All you see is a picture of a finger

1138
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Of a severed finger

1139
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That was fucking brilliant

1140
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It reminded me of Heavy Rain

1141
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's kind of disturbing

1142
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It was a fantastic game

1143
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But then when the answer is that answer

1144
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
You can't guess it

1145
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So you go right back to the killing room

1146
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So it's an interesting mechanic because

1147
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The longer you play, the more likely you are to

1148
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Have severed fingers and fail out

1149
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It prevents

1150
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Indefinite games

1151
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
My favorite one was the one that Shane got

1152
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
That was like the wheel of death

1153
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The wheel of

1154
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The wheel of

1155
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The wheel of

1156
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Losing

1157
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It was like these giant

1158
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Squares for death and the teeniest

1159
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Little sliver for you live

1160
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
There was one where you had to make the

1161
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Longest word out of the letters

1162
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I made a pretty long word

1163
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I forgot to hit submit

1164
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh my god, that happened to me in the first game

1165
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I had a sixth game, aw crap

1166
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It happened to me in the first game, alright

1167
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
We've been talking about Jackbox Party back for ten minutes

1168
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But it's a lot of fun

1169
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Anything else for your game of the week?

1170
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's it

1171
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Fair enough, we'll go to our guests next

1172
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We haven't heard a lot from Shane, how was your game of the week?

1173
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
What have you been playing?

1174
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Pokemon, oh it was an Octillery by the way

1175
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I looked at my list

1176
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I see, so that was the

1177
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
100th Pokemon then

1178
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
100th shiny unique Pokemon

1179
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And I went to round one this weekend

1180
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And I played theater rhythm in the arcade

1181
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And that was really fun

1182
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
How is theater rhythm in the arcade different from the DS?

1183
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Well you don't use the touch screen to play

1184
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You have two little buttons to hit

1185
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And these little rounded

1186
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Knobs

1187
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And so if you've played theater rhythm

1188
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You've got times when you're tapping the screen

1189
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And times when you're sliding your stylus

1190
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Across the screen

1191
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So the knobs act like the stylus part

1192
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And the buttons act like the tapping part

1193
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And because there's two

1194
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Knobs, sometimes you have to

1195
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Do both in the same direction, opposite directions

1196
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It's really interesting

1197
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's pretty fun, I wish I had more songs

1198
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But you can unlock them, I don't know how still

1199
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But I unlocked one song so I was happy with that

1200
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And I want to play it again

1201
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because it was good

1202
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The end of that story

1203
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And that's all I've been playing

1204
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Because it's all I ever play is Pokemon

1205
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So at round one you were just playing the usual stuff

1206
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
DDR Ace?

1207
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No I didn't play any DDR because I was tired

1208
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because I had just packed up a whole bunch of stuff

1209
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And moved it to my new house

1210
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And so I played

1211
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Crossbeats a lot

1212
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Because they had a Halloween event

1213
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And when you played this specific song

1214
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And beat it on different difficulties

1215
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You got new titles

1216
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
For your account

1217
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So I got the title Trick or Treat

1218
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And the title Happy Halloween

1219
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I was happy about that

1220
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And I changed my avatar to a ghost and a pumpkin

1221
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Because I also unlocked that

1222
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And that was cool

1223
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm trying to think if they had anything else

1224
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Noteworthy and new there

1225
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But I think theater rhythm was the only thing

1226
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I saw that was really new

1227
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Okay that's all

1228
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Alright

1229
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No I'm gonna go get food

1230
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay have fun

1231
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
JD how was your gaming week?

1232
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It was good

1233
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So like we talked about I played Guild Wars 2

1234
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I picked up Pokemon Go again

1235
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Because I actually lost my battery about a month ago

1236
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So my phone just didn't have battery to play Pokemon Go

1237
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Because it's a real drainer

1238
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So I've started on the Halloween event

1239
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And I like that a bit

1240
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I've been playing Pokemon Shuffle

1241
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
On my phone which is a puzzle game

1242
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's sort of third party-ish

1243
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I forgot the name of the developer

1244
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But it's a match 3

1245
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Pokemon game

1246
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But it's a more puzzle aspect

1247
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And they're doing all of their Halloween stuff

1248
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So lots of ghost Pokemon events

1249
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I picked up Mini Metro

1250
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Or I picked that back up

1251
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I noticed they added a San Francisco map

1252
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And Mini Metro is a game in which you are developing

1253
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
A subway

1254
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And it's algorithmically generated

1255
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So stations will pop up

1256
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Of different shapes

1257
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And you try to draw lines that will match them

1258
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And you're moving passengers around

1259
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Before they have to wait too long

1260
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
If you have too many unhappy people waiting there

1261
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Your system will close

1262
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Because you've caused a meltdown

1263
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Because they burned the station down

1264
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They riot

1265
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Exactly

1266
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There's a bunch of different world cities

1267
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Most of them are famous for having subways

1268
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Like New York and London and Paris

1269
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And then there's some more exotic ones

1270
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like Melbourne, Australia

1271
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And I think the Auckland one

1272
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Is this is a future scenario

1273
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
In the hypothetical Auckland Metro

1274
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
If they ever make one

1275
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But San Francisco was just added

1276
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And since I live there and I'm a transit geek

1277
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I was super excited to play that

1278
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You're basically building your own BART system

1279
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
What is a transit geek?

1280
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I think Misty

1281
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Who listens to this show a lot

1282
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Is also a transit geek

1283
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
She takes trains everywhere across the nation

1284
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That's definitely part of it

1285
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm also interested in where things go

1286
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And why and how

1287
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I get involved in the city planning process

1288
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Sometimes going to show up

1289
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
At local government stuff

1290
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's kind of like

1291
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You know those government meetings in Parks and Recreation

1292
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's basically very accurate

1293
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Even in San Francisco

1294
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Shane is going to be sad he missed a Parks and Rec reference

1295
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
That's his favorite show

1296
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That's what happens when you leave

1297
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I love it

1298
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I know this is a video game show

1299
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But I have to ask

1300
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The high speed rail in California

1301
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh my god

1302
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's going to happen

1303
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
They're already building it

1304
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But in Fresno, JP

1305
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
They're building it in Fresno

1306
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
To Bakersfield or something

1307
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
These are cities nobody wants to go to

1308
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
There's already a train

1309
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That goes from Bakersfield to Oakland

1310
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And it gets a lot of ridership

1311
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Because people don't necessarily go

1312
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
From one end to the other

1313
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Don't get me wrong

1314
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I love the idea of a high speed rail to connect

1315
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
San Francisco, Sacramento and LA

1316
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And Oakland and the big places in between

1317
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But you need to start

1318
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
With San Francisco to Sacramento

1319
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You don't start it in Fresno

1320
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Well you have to start somewhere

1321
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
To be honest there's less of a fight

1322
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Politically by starting in the Central Valley

1323
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Than there would be trying to figure out

1324
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Which alignment to get to LA

1325
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Which alignment to get to the Bay Area

1326
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Or to get up the Central Valley except the farmers

1327
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Well I mean Hanford has a problem with it

1328
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But they're the only ones

1329
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
If you compare Hanford raising a fuss

1330
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
To Palo Alto raising a fuss

1331
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's why it's starting there

1332
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
You have to start somewhere

1333
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Get something operational and it'll be harder to kill

1334
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Alright so gaming

1335
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So these are the things you have to consider in mini Metro

1336
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Also on trains I picked up Ticket to Ride

1337
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
They added achievements

1338
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And new maps and DLC

1339
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So I played a couple of games

1340
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I played a Steam version of a board game

1341
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Because Days of Wonder is really good about

1342
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Making computerized versions of their games

1343
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And I mean if you've played board games

1344
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Some of the biggest hassle with it

1345
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Is putting all the pieces away

1346
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And it's nice to have a computer do it for you

1347
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And keep score

1348
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That is nice, that is awfully convenient

1349
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I don't like to clean

1350
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You know that now that you've seen the house

1351
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Hey it's not that bad

1352
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Alright anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

1353
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I think that's about it

1354
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14

1355
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Because you all know I love that game

1356
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So I'm still hitting the ground with that

1357
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So even though I kind of went off on Fan Fest

1358
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
A couple of weeks ago

1359
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It really did re-energize my love of that game

1360
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So I've been playing that a lot

1361
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But I have been playing other stuff too

1362
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I randomly, this super random purchase

1363
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But I saw it on the Playstation store and I was like

1364
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Okay I want to get that, I got King of Fighters 94

1365
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So I played that a little bit

1366
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And I forgot how fucking hard that game is

1367
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Or at least for me

1368
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I can get past the first

1369
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Fight barely

1370
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But then the second fight I die a lot

1371
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So it doesn't matter

1372
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I can use Team Europe

1373
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I can use Team Korea

1374
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It doesn't matter I'm going to get my butt kicked

1375
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So that was a fun Neo Geo throwback

1376
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And I remember we were talking about that on the show

1377
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
A couple of weeks ago how those games were going to start showing up

1378
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
In that series that I think a lot of people forget

1379
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Is on Playstation 4

1380
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Because they don't really promote it heavily

1381
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But it's there

1382
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
There's some real deep cuts in the library there

1383
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It was right there when you went to go buy Jackbox

1384
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So it was at least a little promoted

1385
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It was but I also knew to go sort new by date

1386
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So I could find Jackbox

1387
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Even Jackbox I don't think it had a splash banner

1388
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Or if it did I totally missed it

1389
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's kind of a habit now

1390
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Like on Tuesdays I just go to the Playstation store

1391
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And I sort new

1392
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And I just look at what's new and see if there's anything I want

1393
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And I do the same thing on Xbox One

1394
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don't think the store is as well laid out on Xbox One

1395
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
But I will boot up the Xbox One every Thursday

1396
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
To see what's backwards compatible this week

1397
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
What just showed up in my library

1398
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
For the backwards compatibility

1399
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And I've been getting a lot of surprises there

1400
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So that's cool

1401
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So yeah I played a little King of Fighters 94

1402
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So that was cool that that showed up

1403
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But I've also been playing a lot of Dragon Quest Builders

1404
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Now I mentioned that I picked up this game

1405
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
While I was out in Vegas

1406
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I never got around to playing it last week

1407
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But I finally sat down and spent some quality time with it this week

1408
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And I really do like that game

1409
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I mean I know a lot of people are writing it off

1410
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's like a Minecraft clone

1411
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But it doesn't, like when you were watching me play it

1412
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Does it, I mean I should say

1413
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Does it look like Minecraft? Yes

1414
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The graphics look like Minecraft

1415
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But did the interface and the UI look like Minecraft? No

1416
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I actually haven't played Minecraft so I can't give that comparison

1417
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's not Minecraft

1418
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It honestly

1419
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
To me feels like

1420
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
More like a classic JRPG

1421
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But it's just that

1422
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It's in this world

1423
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
That you can break bricks

1424
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And that's how you find things

1425
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But it's got like the very rudimentary crafting system

1426
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That you would saw in a lot of early JRPGs

1427
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So it's just kind of like honestly

1428
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It's honestly like a Super Nintendo style

1429
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Dragon Quest game

1430
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But I don't even know if I can call it that

1431
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Because then you would expect the fights

1432
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But the fights are more like Zelda

1433
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like you can charge your sword and do the spins

1434
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And all that, it's more actiony

1435
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's not like the classic battles

1436
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It definitely looks like there was a collection aspect to the game also

1437
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So like 3D.Dragon

1438
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Actually

1439
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Actually that's not a bad comparison at all

1440
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I would say this game has a lot more in common

1441
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
With 3D

1442
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
3D.Action Heroes

1443
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
3D.Game Heroes

1444
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That game on PS3, you all know which one

1445
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But with a destructive environment

1446
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That's the big difference there

1447
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And that 3D

1448
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
3D.Action Hero

1449
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That was a straight up Zelda rip off

1450
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
No but I say that in the best possible way

1451
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I mean if you're going to rip Zelda off

1452
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Do it good

1453
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And that game did a very good job of doing it

1454
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And kind of bringing a Zelda-esque game to the Playstation

1455
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And I say Dragon Quest Heroes

1456
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Kind of continues that a little bit

1457
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm really into it

1458
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think it's really fun

1459
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I hear there's only like 4 chapters in the game

1460
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
But I've been playing for like 10 hours

1461
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And I'm still on the first chapter

1462
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Like there are long chapters

1463
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
So what exactly do you do in that?

1464
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Do you build up your town?

1465
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So you start in a little hole in the ground

1466
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And you work your way out

1467
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And you find this town

1468
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And there's voices that are talking to you

1469
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Like this world once thrived

1470
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And then the Dark Lord came

1471
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The Shadow Lord came and took it all down

1472
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Like every generic JRPG trope

1473
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But then you start

1474
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The girl will be like

1475
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
If only we could patch the house back together

1476
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So and it's very obvious

1477
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Like where you put the bricks

1478
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So you learn that if you put your bricks

1479
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Like too high

1480
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And if your room has a bed and a light

1481
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
That'll become a bedroom

1482
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And that will get your town points

1483
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Because you have a bedroom

1484
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And so basically you start to learn that if you

1485
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Craft such and such things

1486
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You'll increase the points of your town

1487
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Or you have to craft food to keep yourself alive

1488
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You craft weapons and shields to fight the enemies

1489
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Or you craft bigger and better things

1490
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
For your town basically

1491
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And then the townspeople will start

1492
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Making requests

1493
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It'll be like hey we need to have a forge

1494
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So we can make more stuff or whatever

1495
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So you make this

1496
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But then some of the requests

1497
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's not always about buildings

1498
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Sometimes the request is

1499
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You need to go into this pyramid

1500
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That's way out there through the teleporter

1501
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And you need to go into this pyramid

1502
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And you need to steal the two idols that are in the pyramid

1503
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This is a quest that I just did

1504
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
For one to dislodge the idols

1505
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You have to have the highest weapon

1506
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So you build the weapon

1507
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Then you go to the pyramids

1508
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And you find your way through the pyramids

1509
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Where the walls are not destructible

1510
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And then you find the idols

1511
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And you tear them down with a hammer

1512
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But then when you do that all the people that are praying to the idols

1513
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Turn into the magician dudes from Dragon Quest

1514
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So you have to run the fuck out of there

1515
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
So it's not only building quests

1516
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's the typical type of fetch quest

1517
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You would see in RPGs and things like that

1518
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It's like all that mixed together

1519
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And I think that's kind of why I enjoy it

1520
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's a little bit of Minecraft and a little bit of

1521
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Zelda and a little bit of Dragon Quest

1522
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Kind of like all together

1523
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But I can say all that and how much I like this

1524
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But I think there's some people out there that won't be able to

1525
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
They were not going to be able to stand it

1526
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
They're going to play this for five minutes and go

1527
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
This is dumb

1528
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
But there's a demo out there

1529
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And unlike some other games

1530
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Like World of Final Fantasy and Inokuni

1531
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I think the demo for Dragon Quest Builders

1532
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Is really good

1533
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The demo for Dragon Quest Builders is like the first

1534
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Five quests of the game

1535
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
All strung together

1536
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You get to play it up to the point you get your first teleportal

1537
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And then when you try to go through the teleportal

1538
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It says, sorry but this area is closed

1539
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
In the demo, hope you enjoyed playing

1540
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And you can't progress any further in the story

1541
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Because you can't go through the portal

1542
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So it's a decent demo

1543
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So if you think this might be up your alley

1544
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Just download the demo

1545
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I think this is a safe one to judge the game off of

1546
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So there you go

1547
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Let's see, going to the chat

1548
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

1549
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Let's see

1550
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Dungeon Buster says

1551
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I really like the Japanese demo for Dragon Quest Builders

1552
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Just need to pick it up at one point

1553
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
There you go

1554
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Some folks in the chat room talking about King of Fighters

1555
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I guess talking about King of Fighters 2014

1556
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Rageinator says, there's a King of Fighters 14

1557
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I thought the 13 was the newest one

1558
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, no 14 came out a little while ago

1559
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So yeah

1560
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Vidpower says

1561
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
King of Fighters 98 was the centerpiece of our arcade

1562
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It was the game everyone gathered around

1563
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Good times

1564
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
You know, I guess I'm more of a classic person

1565
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Because my favorite to this day is still

1566
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Fatal Fury Special

1567
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Which is on Xbox 360

1568
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And I don't know if it's on the backwards compatibility yet

1569
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I don't remember

1570
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But that was the last time I remember that game was playable

1571
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I hope they bump that one up

1572
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
For the Playstation 4 archives

1573
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And so forth

1574
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I just like the classic one a little bit more

1575
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I think too

1576
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Anyway

1577
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Alright that's it for our gaming week

1578
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So we're going to get into some news

1579
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But quickly I just want to mention some housekeeping

1580
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We will not be here live on Sunday November 13th

1581
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There will be a show that week

1582
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
There should be a taped show

1583
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It looks like we're going to tape

1584
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Hopefully if it works with Loki schedule on Wednesday of that week

1585
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And we'll have something new

1586
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
At 6 o'clock on Sunday

1587
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But we will not actually be here live

1588
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
To interact with

1589
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Just so you know I'm going to Chicago

1590
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So I won't be here

1591
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But otherwise we'll be here next week

1592
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And then on November 20th

1593
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Episode 666 of our show

1594
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Which I don't think we're doing anything particularly special for it

1595
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's just everybody keeps making this big thing about

1596
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh my god you guys are going to get to episode 666

1597
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And to be fair

1598
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
A lot of shows don't get to episode 666

1599
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Some do

1600
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
If you're more than once a week

1601
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Like Critical Myth

1602
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
They're on 700 something

1603
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But they do three shows a week

1604
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So they can get the numbers faster

1605
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't know if there's a lot of weekly shows out there

1606
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That have hit episode 666

1607
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So I think we're heading into uncharted territory

1608
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
A little bit

1609
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So we're going to have to set the tone

1610
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
For how shows celebrate episode 666

1611
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I'm not sure

1612
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That sounds too ego-y though

1613
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I don't want to say that either

1614
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I don't know what's going to work best for us in our audience

1615
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So be here

1616
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I want Travis to come on

1617
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Do DJ Satan

1618
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I want the Satan voice that I enjoy

1619
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But my understanding is that he already said no

1620
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So whatever

1621
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He wants to retire or whatever it is

1622
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Alright let's get into some gaming news for now

1623
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Loki

1624
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So it's just been a couple weeks

1625
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Since we heard some news about the Switch

1626
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And now we've already got more news

1627
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
On when we're going to hear more news on the Switch

1628
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
So the Nintendo Switch presentation

1629
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
2017

1630
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Is going to be held on January 12

1631
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It'll be streamed online

1632
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And with that they're going to announce

1633
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
The console's price, the release date

1634
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And the lineup of games in development

1635
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So

1636
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I don't expect to hear much until then

1637
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But that's kind of cool that we

1638
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Have a date

1639
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
That they're not just keeping us hanging

1640
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Along with that there is

1641
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Comments regarding the 3DS

1642
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Because people are thinking

1643
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Hey the Switch is coming out

1644
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's a portable system, it's a console

1645
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
What's going to happen with the 3DS

1646
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Is this going to be a successor to the 3DS

1647
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Well apparently the 3DS

1648
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Is not going to be replaced by the Switch

1649
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Instead they're going to coexist

1650
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
With each other so

1651
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And I call bullshit

1652
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Now

1653
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Now I will

1654
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Take this back

1655
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
If in the presentation that we're getting on January 12

1656
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
They mention that the Switch and the 3DS

1657
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Can like talk to each other or something

1658
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Or maybe there's some type of environment

1659
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Created between the two systems

1660
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Where it would be helpful to own both

1661
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
But otherwise I'm sorry

1662
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I don't buy this line

1663
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I think this is to not cannibalize

1664
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
3DS sales but ultimately

1665
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
This isn't really Nintendo's

1666
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Decision because if all the

1667
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Third parties stop making games

1668
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
For 3DS and go over to Switch

1669
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Then guess what the 3DS is not going to be

1670
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Recorded anymore you might have indies which is cool

1671
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And some of that but I think even in the

1672
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
In the indies if it's as easy to make

1673
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
A game for the Switch as it is 3DS

1674
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I think a lot of indies are going to be looking over there

1675
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It's also going to depend on a lot of factors like

1676
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Battery life and stuff because if the battery life on the Switch

1677
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Is abysmal then you know

1678
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
True how portable is it

1679
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But I just I kind of

1680
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Like sorry I know a lot of

1681
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
People have been throwing this at me when I say

1682
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That well so much you know this is the 3DS

1683
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Is a successor and I view this as a 3DS

1684
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Or I've been sent a link to this quote

1685
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I don't know how many times and I'm like

1686
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Okay but they do this

1687
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Companies do this like

1688
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
When they came out with a Playstation Vita

1689
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm sure they said something about well the PSP is not really

1690
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Going away or is still going to support the PSP

1691
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Like of course companies do that

1692
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Because they don't want to cannibalize

1693
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Sales of the existing system

1694
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah it will replace it

1695
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But hey

1696
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You can buy the 3DS for a few months

1697
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But if for whatever

1698
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
If for whatever reason Nintendo remains

1699
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Super committed to 3DS and I'm wrong

1700
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Then I'm wrong that's fine

1701
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But I would have a hard time believing

1702
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
There's going to be the major tent pole releases

1703
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
To substantiate that

1704
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And that's not being made

1705
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
For the Switch

1706
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
You know what I mean

1707
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
They could do that it would make much sense

1708
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But they could do that

1709
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
We'll see I guess

1710
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Thank you Raman Chat says Microsoft said the same thing

1711
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
About the 360 look what happened

1712
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
MXC said they said it before with how

1713
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
The DS was not going to take over Game Boy Advance

1714
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh I remember that

1715
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So I'm sorry but this is

1716
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
This is a line you hear all the time

1717
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I mean Nintendo could also do the Smash 4

1718
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Treatment where they release it on 3DS and

1719
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
On their console like

1720
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
You know with the Switch

1721
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Or you know what else would be really awesome

1722
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Is that what if like the 3DS

1723
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Can serve as like an

1724
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Extra controller when the Switch is on

1725
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The dock or something

1726
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Maybe there is still something they could do

1727
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
To add the 3DS into that environment

1728
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But otherwise I just don't believe that

1729
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
There's a place for the 3DS when the Switch comes out

1730
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You're wrong I'm back

1731
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Oh please tell please let me know how I'm wrong

1732
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Because with the example with the

1733
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Game Boy Advance and the DS

1734
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
The DS played Game Boy Advance

1735
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Games the Switch does not play

1736
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Anything as far as

1737
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Nintendo's confirmed except Switch games

1738
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So all your 3DS

1739
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Games they're not coming over to that

1740
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
You can't play them on that so there's still a

1741
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Part for the 3DS

1742
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
But the developers are going to

1743
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Abandon it to make games for the Switch

1744
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Will they? Because I think they will

1745
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Because this is still going to be a more expensive

1746
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Platform the 3DS and the

1747
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
2DS and the new 3DS

1748
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Those are all still more

1749
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I don't want to say aimed at kids but they're more affordable

1750
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And so parents can replace these

1751
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Systems easier for kids

1752
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Versus a Switch I think

1753
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I don't think anything is replacing anything until

1754
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
We see how that thing sells in the first place

1755
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah I'll give you this

1756
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
This whole thing could be to leave

1757
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
The door open a crack for the 3DS

1758
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
In case the Switch

1759
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Flops which

1760
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I don't know based on just the buzz

1761
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
It looks good but

1762
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
The buzz for the Switch is already better than it was for the Wii U

1763
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But I feel like maybe this is to leave the door

1764
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Open in a jar for the 3DS so that way

1765
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
If the Switch does flop Nintendo can

1766
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Still kind of fall back on it

1767
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yes it's a portable, yes it's a console

1768
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We need to know what the battery life is on that

1769
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So it has to at least match the 3DS

1770
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I feel like if it's even

1771
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Like if it has any potential

1772
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
To push the 3DS out

1773
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So also there's a frog

1774
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Outside I almost hit it with a car

1775
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It's adorable

1776
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Don't hit it with a car then

1777
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Then I was going to go catch it I was like no because I'm about to eat

1778
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's not a Pokemon

1779
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
But it's still adorable like a Pokemon

1780
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Alright

1781
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So what about the fact that we get no new Switch

1782
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Information until 2017

1783
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Expected in my opinion, totally expected

1784
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah

1785
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I like that they set the date

1786
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah I feel even with this presentation

1787
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That they had

1788
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It was more of like people keep bothering

1789
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You know

1790
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I don't know it's just like

1791
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I apologize if you said it and I missed it

1792
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But is this a presentation

1793
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Like a Nintendo Direct type of thing

1794
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah it's going to be a live stream

1795
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So could that mean that it's an E3

1796
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Style presentation which we haven't seen

1797
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Like a live

1798
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Live demo that's what I assume

1799
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah because that would be a very interesting

1800
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Shift for Nintendo

1801
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
To go back to the big E3

1802
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Style conference which you're allowed to do

1803
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Outside of E3 Sony does their

1804
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Expo they do game developers

1805
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Conference Microsoft did their own event

1806
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
For the Xbox One

1807
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
We all remember the famous unveiling of the Xbox

1808
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
One and how well that went

1809
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So there's no reason why Nintendo can't do

1810
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Their own live event I'd just be very curious

1811
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Because we haven't seen Nintendo live in a while

1812
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So it would be very interesting if they did that

1813
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
We saw them at E3

1814
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But they didn't know they didn't Nintendo Direct

1815
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
They didn't do an E3 press conference

1816
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
They didn't do a press conference but they did

1817
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
All sorts of live things for E3

1818
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
They did Treehouse you're right

1819
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Pokemon and all that good stuff

1820
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I guess

1821
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I don't associate the Treehouse stuff

1822
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
With the executives

1823
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
But that's a fair point

1824
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I don't think it's gonna be like

1825
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Here's Reggie and Miyamoto playing

1826
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Mario Do you think it's gonna be like an all day

1827
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Twitch event like all day on January 12th

1828
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
No it'll be some hours

1829
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But maybe two hours at the most

1830
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Interesting

1831
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Let's see going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com

1832
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Dark Tetsuya says yeah maybe

1833
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
This is Nintendo's answer to those other events

1834
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The companies are doing

1835
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I just think they have to have the information

1836
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Out there because I would expect

1837
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It already out by now

1838
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Nintendo could easier than anyone

1839
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Hold their own

1840
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Expo

1841
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Convention

1842
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Nintendo could easier than anyone do it

1843
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Oh yeah I would go to a Nintendo experience

1844
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So many people would go

1845
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Even though Sony experiences in San Francisco I didn't go

1846
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I would go to Nintendo's

1847
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It was really good

1848
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm very tempted to go to the one in Anaheim

1849
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
One of my friends is really trying to talk me into going

1850
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I'm like I am convention out

1851
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I've got to so many conventions

1852
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
But I would go to the Nintendo one in a heartbeat

1853
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I think the Nintendo one

1854
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Would be a ticket mess

1855
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And maybe that's why Nintendo doesn't want to get involved

1856
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Because I think it would be

1857
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It would be faster than

1858
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
PAX selling out tickets

1859
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I feel like Nintendo gets a lot of really strong

1860
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Focused brand loyalty in ways that Sony

1861
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And Microsoft don't get

1862
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh you better believe it for sure

1863
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Loki you were going to say something before I get to another chat comment

1864
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh no I was just thinking

1865
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
What would the new

1866
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
PlayStation event have

1867
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
What would they be showing up

1868
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I guess Horizon Zero Dawn

1869
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It's probably going to be some of the titles from early next year

1870
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But they do announce a lot of stuff

1871
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
At the PlayStation thing

1872
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
We got the Final Fantasy 7 remake

1873
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
We got the actual gameplay footage

1874
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Finally for that

1875
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
There was Dumne no Kuni 2 that nobody cares about

1876
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
There was Rez

1877
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I want to say

1878
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Was that zombie game there that nobody asked for?

1879
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Street Fighter 5 came out of

1880
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
The PlayStation expo

1881
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
No

1882
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Street Fighter 5 was announced

1883
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I thought that was just the characters

1884
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
No it was a huge deal when they announced it

1885
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Wait the last one or the one before that?

1886
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm only talking last year

1887
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I don't know what happened the year before

1888
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
They announced the exclusiveness on Sony

1889
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And it was a huge deal

1890
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
No man's sky

1891
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Well it looked better than it was

1892
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Anyway

1893
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Let's see

1894
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It could be the Nintendo Powerfest

1895
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I love it

1896
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I missed the Powerfest

1897
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It was so good

1898
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Let's see

1899
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Akuma JP in chat says

1900
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Here's a thought, we make games for new systems all the time

1901
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But we're not making a Switch game

1902
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And you know

1903
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I think that's

1904
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
An interesting division

1905
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
That I think it's very obvious

1906
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
To everybody out there that the Switch

1907
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Is not going to be something you can just port

1908
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game over to

1909
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I thought that was the whole rumor

1910
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
That it was so easy that's what's going to make it

1911
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Do better

1912
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Why wouldn't you be able to?

1913
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Because the hardware is not going to be up to speed with PlayStation 4

1914
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah but from what I understand

1915
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's just a little less powerful

1916
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
From the rumors and these rumors that are saying

1917
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
This are the rumors that have gotten everything else

1918
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Right about it so far

1919
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
We'll have a see

1920
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That would be great

1921
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
If it can compete on that level

1922
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Yeah we'll have to take a wait and see approach

1923
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Alright

1924
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Let's get to some more news

1925
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Also about the Switch

1926
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And you know what's very important for this

1927
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Is third parties and people being interested in developing

1928
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
For Switch

1929
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Well one of the people who has expressed interest

1930
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
In making games for the Switch

1931
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Is Hajime Tabata

1932
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And if you don't know that name

1933
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Well you probably know the game he's directing

1934
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Final Fantasy XV

1935
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
So he's interested in making games for the Switch

1936
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Not necessarily Final Fantasy XV

1937
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But the quote is

1938
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm very interested in this machine

1939
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
As a player but also as a developer

1940
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
The Nintendo Switch that you can transform

1941
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Into a controller that you can put into a dock

1942
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
That you can move around with

1943
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
On which you can replace elements

1944
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's been a while that I've told myself I would like to make games

1945
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
On a Nintendo machine

1946
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
So if the Nintendo Switch could be that opportunity

1947
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'd be delighted

1948
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That was an interview with Game Blog

1949
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Where Hajime Tabata said that

1950
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
There's definitely, it's catching the attention of people in the industry

1951
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And we've kind of heard that too

1952
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
In some of the rumors

1953
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Like the rumors were saying

1954
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
That there was a lot of interest out there

1955
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Because people really liked the concept of

1956
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
That you could pick it up and go

1957
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And it sounds like this whole fact that it transforms

1958
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's like a Transformers machine

1959
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
With the fact that the controllers pop off

1960
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And they can be used one way

1961
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
You're not limited to necessarily one configuration

1962
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I just hope it works in execution

1963
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Like it sounds

1964
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Oh they pop off, poof!

1965
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Alright now here's one other

1966
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Big big rumor about the Switch

1967
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
This will be the last thing we'll talk about

1968
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Again this is rumor but

1969
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
If I were to bring out the wheel of plausibility again this week

1970
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm sure it would rank very highly

1971
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Anyhow this is a tweet from a technology

1972
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Reporter for the Wall Street Journal

1973
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's Takashi Mochizuki

1974
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
And is mentioning in this tweet

1975
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Looks like standard capacity

1976
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Of Switch game card at least when

1977
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Console launched

1978
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It was around 16 as in gigabytes

1979
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Enough for one layer

1980
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Blu-ray game so it looks like

1981
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
The Switch game cards are 16

1982
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Gigabyte cartridges however

1983
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
We don't necessarily know if that means

1984
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It's limited to 16 and can't grow

1985
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Later because even the original

1986
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
NES was

1987
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Limited to what 32

1988
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Kilobytes maybe I could be totally

1989
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Wrong on that but that was expanded

1990
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
By the time

1991
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And that's also why cartridges got more and more expensive

1992
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
But that was expanded by

1993
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
The end of its run so

1994
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I don't see why maybe you have a 16

1995
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Gig cartridge as the original

1996
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Configuration but that's gonna grow

1997
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
To 32

1998
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Maybe even 128 if the technology

1999
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Gets there

2000
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
But I notice a lot of people on blogs and so forth

2001
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Are very negative on this 16

2002
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Gigabyte number because it's less than

2003
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
A 25 gigabyte

2004
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Blu-ray but my

2005
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Question is how

2006
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Like you guys do a lot of

2007
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Digital game downloads right

2008
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
How many games out there are more

2009
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Than 16 gigs to download

2010
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I can't think of a lot

2011
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Maybe the major games are bigger than that

2012
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Dragon Age was bigger? No

2013
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Like a lot of the major games are bigger than that

2014
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
They're like 30, 40 gigs

2015
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But those are like major

2016
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Major games

2017
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I don't know it depends on what that

2018
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Thing outputs at

2019
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I imagine the texture sizes

2020
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I think will probably reduce it quite a bit

2021
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Compression maybe

2022
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Wasn't 16 gigs

2023
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Like the entire capacity of the basic

2024
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Wii U

2025
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
So if this is bigger

2026
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Than that that's good news I think

2027
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Well like you know

2028
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Compression I'm sure has placed some of it

2029
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Because I think a lot of that stuff they had

2030
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Especially on disc I'm not sure about

2031
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Actually downloading it though but like a lot of it

2032
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Had to stay in compressed because the drive wasn't

2033
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
As fast or maybe I'm thinking

2034
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
3 but

2035
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't know

2036
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
We'll see I mean

2037
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
They're gonna make it work

2038
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's not gonna be like ah shit you know

2039
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
The game doesn't work too well

2040
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Or or

2041
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I mean they could pull a fucking Microsoft

2042
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And say oh okay well 16 gigs

2043
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Fits on this and we're gonna download the rest

2044
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I was gonna say it's not

2045
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Necessarily out of character to have

2046
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Some of it on the cartridge

2047
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But the rest of it will download

2048
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
If the Switch has a large

2049
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Internal capacity

2050
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Still do 32 gigs please

2051
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Well I was gonna say if you downloaded all the high quality

2052
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Stuff for Xenoblade

2053
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
On Wii U

2054
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That will fill up your entire drive

2055
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Like with all the high

2056
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Stuff but you know maybe the Switch

2057
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Can incorporate something like that I don't know

2058
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So anyway

2059
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2060
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Dartitsia pointing out

2061
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
The cards at the start are right in between

2062
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Dual layer DVDs

2063
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
9.4 gigs and Blu-rays

2064
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
25 gigs respectively

2065
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And I'm sure there's a possibility the cards could get bigger

2066
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Down the line yeah if they go to 32

2067
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Gigs which would be the assuming that any

2068
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Of this information is even accurate in the first

2069
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Place that is very true

2070
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Sj100Matt says as long as it's not

2071
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Proprietary memory cards people

2072
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Will just buy larger SD cards

2073
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
They're so cheap now

2074
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
We can hope you know the 3DS

2075
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Allowed you to use a non-proprietary

2076
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Card so there's hope

2077
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
The Wii let you use a non-proprietary SD card

2078
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I have a 256 gig one or whatever it is

2079
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I don't remember but it's huge

2080
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The Wii kind of struggles to load all of the

2081
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Space because it has to like count all the

2082
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Blocks right but it works

2083
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Yeah the Wii U

2084
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Will allow you to connect an external

2085
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Hard drive if I'm not correct or if I'm not mistaken

2086
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah because their internal storage is

2087
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Yeah stupid but I mean but the

2088
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Good news is you know when we're talking

2089
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
About what's plausible and what's not

2090
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You kind of look at the track record right

2091
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
So Nintendo has a pretty good track record of not being

2092
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Not constricting memory

2093
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
To its ecosystem so that's

2094
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
That's hopeful that

2095
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
We'll be able to do that with the Switch

2096
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
That's kind of standard nowadays anyways

2097
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I mean it feels like Nintendo has often had expansions to its consoles

2098
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Like the N64 had the expansion pack

2099
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
You know there's always been little

2100
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Add-ons that they add on later in the

2101
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Console's life

2102
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Rama says the Switch will use

2103
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Proprietary cards for the games

2104
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
But standard micro SD if you ask me

2105
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And I would agree with that I don't think

2106
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
They would want just anybody making

2107
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Game cartridges they don't want

2108
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
People to circumvent that so

2109
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
No I'm sure it will be circumvented

2110
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Don't you worry

2111
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Well I mean it's so early

2112
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
To know but Loki

2113
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Have you seen anything out there about people

2114
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That are like planning to hack the

2115
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Switch Oh no I haven't seen anything

2116
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
But it's gonna happen It always happens

2117
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It'll have to happen Yeah that's

2118
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
A given it will happen

2119
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
It just you know how easy is it gonna be

2120
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Is the question Yeah interesting

2121
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Alright let's move on

2122
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
With another story Loki

2123
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Alright so this week

2124
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Hello Games actually finally tweeted

2125
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Something out and their tweet

2126
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Was No Man's Sky was a mistake

2127
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And everyone's like

2128
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Whaaaat

2129
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And it actually ended up being that

2130
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Apparently their Twitter account was hacked

2131
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And someone posted

2132
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
That on there and yeah

2133
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
It was some type of back door through LinkedIn

2134
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Is what they blamed too Yeah they're all

2135
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
100% not hacked anymore obviously

2136
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Those mails and tweets were fake

2137
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Back to work and then you know they were saying

2138
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
That umm

2139
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Which you know

2140
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Sorry real quick by the way

2141
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
There's a little bit of tangent but it's not

2142
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Okay so Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

2143
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Is where you guys can call us later on the show right

2144
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I don't know if you guys have noticed this

2145
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I've been getting inundated with Skype spam

2146
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Lately and because the Orange Lounge Radio account

2147
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We've collected you know

2148
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Hundreds of listeners over the years that have called

2149
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Into the show

2150
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
We will get like I just had to clean up

2151
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Like 8 spam messages

2152
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
As we launch for the show tonight

2153
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Do you know what they all were?

2154
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
They were links to LinkedIn

2155
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
That said LinkedIn and it had some weird code

2156
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
After it and it wasn't a phish

2157
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
LinkedIn site it was definitely LinkedIn.com

2158
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
But I think it was some type of back door

2159
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Injection or something I don't know

2160
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
The reason why I bring that up

2161
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
If they were hacked through LinkedIn

2162
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I wonder if it wasn't part of this whole Skype thing

2163
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Or something that's going on

2164
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
LinkedIn got hacked a while ago

2165
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Server hacked

2166
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We were binging Mr. Robot episodes as quickly as we can

2167
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Looking for answers

2168
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
They were saying if anything was a mistake

2169
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It was using LinkedIn without two factor authentication

2170
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Nothing ever comes from LinkedIn

2171
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
That's not true

2172
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I'm going to stick up for LinkedIn

2173
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
My current job

2174
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I got through LinkedIn

2175
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So it does work

2176
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So it's kind of like I'm sorry

2177
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I have to jump to LinkedIn's defense

2178
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I realize why a lot of people pick on them

2179
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
But it actually fucking works

2180
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
In some circumstances

2181
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I got to give props for props to do

2182
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
But it is nice to hear

2183
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
From Sean Murray

2184
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Unfortunately it's not anything that has to do with No Man's Sky

2185
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So that is still in the dark

2186
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So Sean Murray finally tweeted

2187
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
But the tweets were about the hack

2188
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And nothing else

2189
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
But at least it's one of those

2190
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm glad to see you're alive

2191
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I don't mean to sound so

2192
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Someone's alive

2193
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I'm glad to see he's alive

2194
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Because I was starting to get worried

2195
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Well it's like when Pokemon Go was radio silent

2196
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
When they were having all their issues at launch

2197
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It's nice to see something

2198
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah but even Pokemon Go finally figured that out

2199
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
After a week or two

2200
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
The radio silence from Hello Games has been

2201
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Deafening on this

2202
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Because

2203
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Isn't there talk about

2204
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
A possible bundle pack that's going to have No Man's Sky

2205
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
By the end of the year

2206
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
They've still made a lot of promises for what they're going to do

2207
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
They've got

2208
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It's not just that game

2209
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
They've got a few different three-game pack

2210
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
PlayStation 4s that are coming out

2211
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So they have one that was

2212
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
No Man's Sky, Uncharted 4

2213
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And

2214
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Something else

2215
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
There was another one

2216
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Uncharted 4 and two other games

2217
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
It's a Sony game

2218
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Of course they're going to do some of those bundles

2219
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I don't condone the hacking

2220
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
And it's not appropriate

2221
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Or any of that stuff

2222
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
With this radio silence

2223
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I don't want to say they were asking for it

2224
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But they were definitely

2225
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
The longer this goes on

2226
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And they're not saying anything

2227
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
The fan base

2228
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Is doing this type of shit

2229
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Well it's kind of hard

2230
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Especially now after how much

2231
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
That was hyped up by Sony too

2232
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's like

2233
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Who are we going to trust anymore

2234
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
When it comes to these big

2235
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Games that look so amazing and stuff

2236
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
What I'm saying is if they need to

2237
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
They need to just rip the band-aid off

2238
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
If they need to make the tweet that says

2239
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
We've ended all development on No Man's Sky

2240
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And we're moving on to our next project

2241
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
As much as that's going to piss people

2242
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
To fuck off

2243
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Drop it on a Friday at 5pm

2244
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
But as much as it's going to piss people off

2245
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
You just need to get over with

2246
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Drop it on election day

2247
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah but there are British companies

2248
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
That doesn't mean that they're not affected

2249
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
That's true

2250
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
That's actually kind of a brilliant idea

2251
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
If you're going to drop bad news do it on election day

2252
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Or if there's any number of political events they could bury it under

2253
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
That's the best way to make it go away

2254
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
That's true, that's a good thought

2255
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah, and Sjoan Undermat says

2256
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You can be pissed at a developer not providing updates

2257
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
But to a point, right

2258
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And I'm not saying, again, I'm not condoning what happened

2259
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Or what have you

2260
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I'm not going to go hack his email, what the hell is that going to do

2261
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
But I've been on the internet long enough to know

2262
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
That's what's going to happen

2263
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Not having communication is the worst thing you can do

2264
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
For yourself for damage control

2265
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah, anyway

2266
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
But you know

2267
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I want to see the best for everybody

2268
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Involved in that situation

2269
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
You know, I enjoyed No Man's Sky for what it is

2270
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Because I didn't buy into the fucking hype

2271
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
In the beginning

2272
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
So, you know

2273
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Although you all were so mad at me in the beginning

2274
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
When I was like, remember when they would show

2275
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
The No Man's Sky stuff at E3 and I'd be like

2276
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Okay, so where's the fucking game

2277
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Right, and people were like

2278
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And I'm like, guess what

2279
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
That attitude's paying off now

2280
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's not even that, it's just the game wasn't very good

2281
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I mean, just the whole inventory management stuff

2282
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Is retarded

2283
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So that was the whole game

2284
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And a lot of it was thrown in there just to

2285
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Stretch the amount of time it would take to play the game

2286
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And it's just

2287
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Stretching out nothing is what it was

2288
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
There was no game there

2289
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah, but there's no game in Minecraft

2290
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
But add VR support and I'll be all over that shit again

2291
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Alright, well

2292
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Speaking of VR

2293
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Microsoft, I didn't want to get too far into this

2294
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
But Microsoft had a big event where they unveiled a surface

2295
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
That made a lot of people very excited

2296
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
To see that

2297
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
They're also talking about a push

2298
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Into virtual and augmented reality

2299
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
There's going to be a new line

2300
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Of virtual reality headsets

2301
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And they're working with a host of partners for these headsets

2302
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I should note though, this is not for the

2303
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Xbox One, but this is for Windows 10

2304
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Some of the partners for the headsets

2305
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer

2306
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Starting at $299

2307
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
So this was again a Microsoft VR headset

2308
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But you better believe though

2309
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Ideally what they're saying is

2310
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Running on mid-end machines

2311
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Just regular laptops and stuff

2312
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I'm down with that

2313
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Then if it runs on that, it should run on

2314
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Xbox One I would think

2315
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Now I also do want to point out it's a wired device

2316
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And the tracking is handled by

2317
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Sensors on the headset itself

2318
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It's a little different from

2319
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The camera sensors

2320
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So it does something a little bit different

2321
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I think that's similar to the HoloLens

2322
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Yes, most definitely

2323
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Similar to that

2324
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And this should also be noted

2325
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
That speaking of HoloLens, just because

2326
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
This whole thing is happening, that doesn't mean HoloLens

2327
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Is stopping development or anything

2328
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Like that, but there is a difference

2329
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Between AR and VR, so work

2330
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Continues on the HoloLens

2331
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Which, as you might remember on a previous

2332
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Episode, I got to check out one of those dev kits

2333
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And I thought

2334
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
HoloLens was pretty awesome

2335
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Did you watch the presentation for

2336
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
What Microsoft did? No, but to be fair

2337
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I didn't watch Apple's thing this week either

2338
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I didn't watch Apple's thing I didn't watch any of it

2339
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It was funny though, after they showed off

2340
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
The nice thing and Apple was like

2341
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Oh, we got a touch bar

2342
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And everyone was like, eh, fuck that shit

2343
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
To be fair

2344
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
It's a neat idea

2345
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
But I got burned the last time I bought an Apple laptop

2346
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
So I'm not doing it again

2347
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
The virtual reality window thing that they were showing

2348
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Was kind of cool, I thought it would be pretty neat

2349
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I definitely still want to get a HoloLens someday

2350
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
When the tech is actually what it's showing

2351
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Once we're there

2352
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Then yeah, I'll be all over that

2353
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I think the virtual reality stuff is pretty cool

2354
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
In that they're kind of embracing that

2355
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And also the other thing

2356
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
That they showed was the app that they had

2357
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
That you can 3D scan stuff with your phone

2358
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Which I thought was pretty cool

2359
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Of course they said a Windows phone

2360
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I'm like, no, I'm not buying a Windows phone for that

2361
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But eventually all phones

2362
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
So it's exciting

2363
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
That they're getting into that

2364
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And I think with Microsoft backing virtual reality now

2365
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Too, I mean

2366
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
With Windows and everything

2367
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
It's probably going to be

2368
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Just getting better

2369
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It's not going to be a fad, I think

2370
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Alright, moving on

2371
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Loki, a follow up to some news from last week, right?

2372
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yes, so apparently

2373
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Several of the video game companies

2374
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Have been affected by this

2375
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Voice actor strike

2376
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
They have issued a statement

2377
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And

2378
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Basically

2379
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I'm not going to read all of this here

2380
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Let's see if we can just cover it a little bit

2381
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
This is a strike that did not have to happen

2382
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
SAG-AFTRA never communicated

2383
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
To its members

2384
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
What was on the table

2385
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
When on October 19th

2386
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
It declined to counter

2387
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The company's last proposal

2388
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And pushed away from negotiations

2389
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
So obviously, I mean

2390
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I'm guessing the stance by this

2391
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Since I haven't read everything

2392
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
They're kind of defending themselves

2393
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And obviously saying, well

2394
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Come put blame on SAG-AFTRA

2395
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Maybe if they stayed in negotiations a little longer

2396
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
They might be something that they would have

2397
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
You know, been able to resolve on that

2398
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Let's see

2399
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And I guess the offer of a 9% increase

2400
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And additional compensations

2401
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Are meant for bonuses

2402
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
For quick resolution

2403
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
To negotiations expires on

2404
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
December 1st

2405
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
So that's like, it's the last offer that they have

2406
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
This is not good though

2407
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
That this is still going

2408
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
The fact that this wasn't resolved in days

2409
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Now we have to wonder if this is

2410
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Going to be something that's going to take months to resolve

2411
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
How long did that writer's strike go on

2412
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
A few years ago? It was a while

2413
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It was months

2414
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And so now I worry because this is going to affect

2415
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Video games

2416
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Now will possibly

2417
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Games go to non-union

2418
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I kind of think

2419
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
The rise of a silent protagonist

2420
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Yeah, either the rise of the silent protagonist

2421
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Is going to start happening

2422
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
With non-union voice actors

2423
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I think there's plenty of people

2424
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
That will do it

2425
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
But it's not going to have that same star power

2426
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And I'm not saying that I support that

2427
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I'm just looking at the reality of it

2428
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I think for these games to stay on target

2429
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
They're just going to go, okay fine

2430
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Get a non-union voice actor

2431
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Do an internet contest

2432
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
To find somebody to be the voice of somebody

2433
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Like, they'll find it

2434
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Yeah

2435
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But, you know

2436
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I understand the voice actor's perspective

2437
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And some of the things they're asking for

2438
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Make an awful lot of sense

2439
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Especially when we talk about the vocal strain

2440
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Knowing what the projects are

2441
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Having more information on that

2442
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
A little less secrecy for them

2443
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And a lot of that makes sense to me

2444
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I hope they can work it out

2445
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Because the longer this goes on, nobody wins

2446
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Nobody wins

2447
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Anyhow, we'll see

2448
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Going to chat over at

2449
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Live.vognetwork.com

2450
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says

2451
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Great, the alternative might be Chaos Wars

2452
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Level of voice acting

2453
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yeah, that could

2454
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Mean the voice acting quality is going to dip

2455
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
A bit too

2456
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
S2100Matt says, the Rider Strike ruined Heroes

2457
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
In my opinion

2458
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Oh yeah, not just that show, but several shows

2459
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
The Rider Strike just killed those shows

2460
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It helped some things though

2461
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yeah, we did get Doctor Horrible out of the Rider Strike

2462
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
So it wasn't all bad

2463
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
We also got a really good season of Power Rangers

2464
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
It was the worst season they ever did a Big Brother

2465
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Yes, how can you tell?

2466
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It was the winter season of Big Brother

2467
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
It was awful, if you follow that series

2468
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
It was the worst season they ever did

2469
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
But that doesn't make any sense, it's supposed to be non-scripted

2470
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
How would a Rider Strike affect a non-scripted show?

2471
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Right, but yet

2472
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Not to get too far into reality TV

2473
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Here's the crazy part

2474
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So they're doing a bonus Big Brother right now

2475
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
That's only on the online

2476
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And it's like the best cast one they've had in years

2477
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Well it's because they're not using

2478
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
The same casting agency for it

2479
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So yeah, this is the best season of Big Brother

2480
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's the one that's not even on TV

2481
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
People who don't follow it

2482
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Probably don't even know about

2483
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
But it's the best season they've had in years

2484
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
All I know about Big Brother is that

2485
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Davon GIF that everyone shows

2486
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
The one that's always on Twitter

2487
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Hi!

2488
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
She knows how to make an entrance

2489
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
She was a great player, but

2490
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
She was not a great player at all

2491
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
She was an entertaining player

2492
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
That's what you really need for reality TV

2493
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Best diary rooms of anybody

2494
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Not once in a competition

2495
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Kaijuto in chat says

2496
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Big Brother over the top is the shit

2497
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I'm not gonna lie

2498
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It is the best season of Big Brother since probably 11

2499
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Don't forget to vote for Chrissy

2500
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
As America's nominee tonight

2501
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And

2502
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Shane obviously has his feelings

2503
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
About what's going on there

2504
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Kaijuto says

2505
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I have the feeds on right now

2506
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
You never know, they might break out in a fight

2507
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Moving on

2508
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Let's talk about Kingdom Hearts

2509
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Because

2510
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
If you missed Kingdom Hearts

2511
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
It pays to wait

2512
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD

2513
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And 2.5 Remix

2514
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
If you did not pick those up on PlayStation 3

2515
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
You have Kingdom Hearts 4 now

2516
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I did the math

2517
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
You will have the ability to pick them up all over again

2518
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
On PlayStation 4

2519
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It was announced this week

2520
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5

2521
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Plus 2.5

2522
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Remix

2523
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Meaning there will be 6 games

2524
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Well 4 games and 2 movies

2525
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Involved in this

2526
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Will be coming out March 9th in Japan

2527
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
March 28th in North America

2528
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
So for those keeping track at home

2529
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
That's Kingdom Hearts 1, 2

2530
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Chain of Memories

2531
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Birth by Sleep

2532
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And the movies for 3.58

2533
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And Recoded

2534
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Will not include the 2.8

2535
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Final Chapter Prologue

2536
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
These fucking names

2537
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Will not include that

2538
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Because that is a separate PlayStation 4

2539
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Release

2540
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
That's the one that has Dream Drop Distance

2541
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Which is a 3DS game

2542
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Just wait a bit longer

2543
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Wait a bit longer

2544
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Right before they finally bring out Kingdom Hearts 3

2545
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
1.5, 2.5, 2.8

2546
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And 3

2547
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I actually preordered these

2548
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Because I don't really have a big desire to play Kingdom Hearts

2549
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
But to have them all on one console

2550
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Is pretty tempting

2551
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And it was enough, I preordered them

2552
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I have the 1.5 remix on PlayStation 3 obviously

2553
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But when they announced 2.5

2554
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
This was after Final Fantasy 10

2555
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Was on PS3 and PS4

2556
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And I was like, uh uh

2557
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'm not getting those on PS3 because I know they're going to put them on PS4

2558
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Granted, I thought it would happen a little sooner

2559
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
But I'm glad that it's finally happening

2560
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
What, a year later, finally

2561
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Do they change a lot in the HD remakes?

2562
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Because I've been playing through the original PS2

2563
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And off and on

2564
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Well, keep in mind, right off the bat

2565
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
The fact that they're widescreen natively

2566
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Is a huge change

2567
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
These are a little bit HD-er

2568
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Yeah, they're more HD-er

2569
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
But they still play the original games

2570
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
You know, and so forth

2571
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It's interesting because you mentioned that you still use

2572
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
A CRT TV

2573
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You have a CRT TV

2574
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Right, exactly

2575
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So since all my music games

2576
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
A couple are on the Wii

2577
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And we won't talk about San Bodeo Amigo right now

2578
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
But I have a PS2

2579
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And I tried

2580
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
When I first moved into my place

2581
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And I tried doing it with an HDTV

2582
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And it just was unplayable

2583
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
You know, it's 10 or 15 millisecond lag

2584
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Which doesn't sound like a lot

2585
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
But when your timing window is less than 10 milliseconds

2586
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Then that's a big problem

2587
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Oh, and Akdeft in chat brings up a very good point

2588
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
These games are final mixes

2589
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Which are better and improved versions of the original

2590
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So it's kind of like, you know how Final Fantasy 10

2591
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Was like the international version

2592
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
And now 12 is going to be the Zodiac one

2593
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And 12 is going to be the Zodiac one

2594
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Which I'm really excited about that

2595
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
More than Final Fantasy

2596
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
It's really complex because you can't just make your character

2597
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Wait, how did you play some of it?

2598
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Possibly on an emulator on a computer

2599
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I played a good chunk of the PS2 version

2600
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It's really good

2601
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Oh, the PS2 version

2602
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Yeah, because it came out in Japan as the international

2603
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I was like, wait, you played the remaster?

2604
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
What the fuck did you do that?

2605
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Basically because I upped all the textures

2606
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
It looked really good

2607
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
That's different

2608
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
So that is the other big difference

2609
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
That you're playing the last international version

2610
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Or whatever

2611
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And Akdeft points out that on PlayStation 4

2612
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
It's all going to be in HD and 60 frames a second

2613
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So if your non-CRT TV is like mine

2614
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
That has the super good refresh rate

2615
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Where movies don't look real

2616
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
They just look crazy

2617
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
It's one of those smart TV things

2618
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Where the frame rate is so good

2619
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It's not like it doesn't

2620
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
TV looks different now

2621
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
When you have that fast refresh rate

2622
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It just doesn't look real

2623
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Or it looks too real

2624
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
The realness

2625
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Shut up

2626
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Moving on with our next story

2627
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
We're almost to the Classic Game of the Week

2628
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But first, Loki

2629
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Skyrim Special Edition

2630
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Was just released on Friday

2631
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
And already

2632
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
There's Bethesda bug issues

2633
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
With the game

2634
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
What a shock

2635
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I'm going to die from that surprise

2636
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
So apparently there are some issues

2637
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
With the audio

2638
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And this is only affecting right now

2639
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
The PC and Xbox One versions

2640
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So it might not win for the PlayStation 4 guys

2641
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Although you don't have mod support

2642
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
So give it a take

2643
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Apparently

2644
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
It's that wonderful audio

2645
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Anyways

2646
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
The special edition features

2647
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Dramatically compressed audio

2648
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Sounding more muddled

2649
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Than the game's original release

2650
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And that I guess is the issue

2651
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And

2652
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Apparently it says the vanilla game

2653
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Sound assets

2654
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Other than the music and voiceover

2655
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Is in an uncompressed wave format

2656
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
The special edition has the sound assets

2657
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
In a very aggressively compressed

2658
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
XWM format

2659
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Which is compressed sound format

2660
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Designed for games

2661
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
This isn't so bad

2662
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Necessarily it's possible

2663
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
To compress the audio to

2664
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
XWM without significant

2665
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Quality degradation

2666
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Unless you crank the compression

2667
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Way up to insane levels

2668
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
What did Bethesda do?

2669
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
They cranked the compression up to

2670
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Insane levels

2671
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So it sounds like

2672
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
They just need to patch it

2673
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
That's probably going to be a pretty sizable patch

2674
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
They're going to have to download the audio

2675
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
All over again

2676
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Boy oh boy

2677
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
My audio will still be good on the PlayStation 4 version

2678
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Too bad I don't got any fucking

2679
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Good mod support for it

2680
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I still haven't bought the game yet

2681
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Well Alan got it for free

2682
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Technically I have a PC I already have it

2683
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Because I bought Skyrim a long time ago

2684
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Well wait a minute I bought Skyrim on the PC

2685
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
But I didn't get this new one for free

2686
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It is free

2687
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
No because I don't have all the DLC

2688
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I only have the base game

2689
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I looked at it on the store

2690
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
It still wanted 40 bucks

2691
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
You think I have all the DLC on

2692
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I'm pretty sure I have all the DLC

2693
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I never bought any of the DLC

2694
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Because I didn't play enough Skyrim

2695
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Alan on the other hand played it all

2696
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Seems like a special edition on Skyrim

2697
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
For PCs kind of stupid

2698
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Since there's enough mods out there

2699
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Anyways it would probably make it look even better

2700
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Than the special edition

2701
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
There's way too much bloom in that

2702
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Like the god rays

2703
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I mean yellow tint all over the screen

2704
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I'm hoping to check it out at some point

2705
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
But I've got a million games

2706
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I'm trying to play right now

2707
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But I did see that they have

2708
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
The Macho Man Randy Savage mod

2709
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Thank god

2710
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Dragon mods all ready for Xbox

2711
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
That's fantastic

2712
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Unfortunately I read some modder comments

2713
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
They're like yeah we're not supporting the Playstation 4

2714
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
With our mods because

2715
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Of this limitation

2716
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
That's gonna suck

2717
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Alright well let's take a trip down memory lane

2718
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Back when you couldn't mod games

2719
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Like this

2720
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It's a classic game

2721
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Of the week and unfortunately

2722
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
You guys I'm sorry to say that Radio Magic

2723
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Is broken for the second week in a row

2724
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
With the teleporter

2725
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Devices that allow radio magic

2726
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Oh right we get to do Halo again

2727
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Yes we're doing Halo again

2728
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
As I said last time Loki suggested we do Halo

2729
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
And Jamie's not here

2730
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I'm just letting you know chat

2731
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I am your advocate here

2732
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Alright well I thought

2733
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
The nice thing to do since

2734
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
We were unable to make Radio Magic happen this week

2735
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I thought the nice thing to do was to

2736
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Let our guest pick the classic

2737
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Game of the week and I thought

2738
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
This is a very creative pick from JD

2739
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
As well so we're gonna let JD pick tonight

2740
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
The classic game of the week and I kinda think

2741
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Dark Sakura would approve of this

2742
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Pick but there is no music with

2743
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
This pick right? Correct

2744
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And why is there no music?

2745
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Because this is a game about stick figures

2746
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Alright what is the classic game of the week?

2747
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
So this is Kingdom of Loathing

2748
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
This came out in 2003 and it is a browser

2749
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Based with lots of frames

2750
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
It's a multiplayer online game

2751
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
So it's an MMO

2752
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
But it's turn based

2753
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So you have a bunch of adventures everyday

2754
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
In which you can go out and do stuff

2755
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
In the world

2756
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
It was like a BBS game on the way

2757
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It really was

2758
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Black and white aesthetic to it

2759
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's very lightweight

2760
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
So the basic story is

2761
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
You're trying to

2762
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The nasty sorceress is the

2763
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Big boss at the end of the game and you're trying to

2764
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Gain levels so that you can fight her

2765
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
But the bulk of the game you spend

2766
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Just doing all of the side quests

2767
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
And there's so much

2768
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
There's a lot of pop culture references

2769
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And puns all over the place

2770
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Which is why it's one of my favorite games

2771
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Like I got

2772
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Lost just reading the wiki about all of the various

2773
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Items in the game

2774
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You have 40 adventures

2775
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Everyday

2776
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Because there's a daily reset at a certain time of day

2777
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And you go out and

2778
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Just do side quests and main quests

2779
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
You can get more adventures by eating food

2780
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And having alcohol like just in real life

2781
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Hooray! And if you have too much alcohol

2782
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
You get drunk and you have bad adventures

2783
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Or you hurt yourself

2784
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Less hooray! Right

2785
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
There are three

2786
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
There are six different classes that you can be

2787
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And there are

2788
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Three stats

2789
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
There's five elements

2790
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
So like a lot of other games

2791
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It has elemental rock, paper, scissors

2792
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But they're not the same elements you may be used to

2793
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
There's hot and cold

2794
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
But then there's spooky stench and sleaze

2795
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And they all fit together in different ways

2796
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Kind of like a Pokemon

2797
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
This is good against that and not against that

2798
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's a constantly

2799
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Evolving game

2800
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
They have content every couple of months

2801
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And they're really good

2802
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
About having in-universe explanations

2803
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
When stuff goes wrong

2804
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Pretty early in the game's life cycle

2805
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
There was a lot of hacking going on

2806
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
And the currency in the game is meat

2807
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Which is, you know, slang for money

2808
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
But it's also

2809
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
They really go full hog with that

2810
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
They have meat paste and meat smithing

2811
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Anyway, so

2812
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I played a little bit of Kingdom of Loathing

2813
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And I remember all these very sassy jokes

2814
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
There's a lot at Konami

2815
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
He's working hard, huh?

2816
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I was a disco bandit

2817
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Yeah, that's one of the classes

2818
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
It looks interesting

2819
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I've never seen this game before

2820
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
But it's still going, right?

2821
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Even though it qualifies as a classic game of the week

2822
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Because it's, what, 13 years old

2823
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It's still going

2824
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Because it's not a finished game either

2825
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
It's in open beta

2826
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Because they never have a 1.0

2827
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Because it's continuously evolving

2828
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
And they add on a couple of new levels

2829
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
At the end

2830
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
The final level used to be 11

2831
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And now it's 13

2832
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
That happened a bunch of years ago

2833
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Yeah, but they continuously add on

2834
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
New areas in the game

2835
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
And it's all very solid

2836
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
There's a great fan community around there

2837
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
And lots of other stuff

2838
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
There's a chat system

2839
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And in order to gain access to chat

2840
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
You have to pass a test from the ghost

2841
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Of the English language

2842
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Because English is just so tortured

2843
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It's given up the ghost

2844
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And now you have to pass a small typing test

2845
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
In order to get access

2846
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Wow, this really sounds like a game Dark Soccer would approve of

2847
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
In fact, she's probably going to be pissed you took it

2848
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That's alright

2849
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I mean, there's a bunch of channels

2850
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
There's a haiku channel

2851
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
You get to leave after today, I know

2852
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
The chat is all going

2853
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
So what happens if the guest picks Halo

2854
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Could you get away with it?

2855
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And I'm like, I still don't want that phone call

2856
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I'll take that phone call

2857
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
But I'm not taking the Halo call

2858
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I'm forwarding it to Shane's phone

2859
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
That doesn't make sense

2860
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Alright, anyway

2861
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Yeah

2862
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
There's a lot of

2863
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
There's optional player versus player

2864
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
But it's definitely not a big component of the game

2865
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
It's definitely much more a cooperative aspect

2866
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Even though it's like

2867
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
You're generally all by yourself

2868
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
The fan communities and the forums and such

2869
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Are out there

2870
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
The wiki is extensively documented

2871
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And there's

2872
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
This is also a game in which people love to break on it

2873
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And see how things work

2874
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
And in the game it's called spading

2875
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
To figure out what exactly all the mechanics are

2876
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
That underlie everything

2877
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
And so every time there's a new content release

2878
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
People try to figure it out

2879
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And there's a lot of

2880
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Specific details on that

2881
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
The other thing about this game

2882
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Is they also have a radio channel that they do

2883
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Live 365 channel or something?

2884
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I don't think it's on Live 365

2885
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Oh no, nothing is

2886
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
They shut down this year

2887
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
But yeah, they've had

2888
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
A radio show going for a while as well

2889
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Oh that's awesome

2890
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
How do we get on that network?

2891
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Have your people call their people

2892
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I guess, do I gotta throw meat at them?

2893
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
It's also a free game

2894
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Although there are paid things you can buy

2895
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So there are no ads anywhere

2896
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And that is always really nice

2897
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
In a free content thing

2898
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
That you never actually have to spend real money on

2899
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
For a web game

2900
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And it's not pay to win

2901
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Like a lot of free to play games end up being

2902
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Alright

2903
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So this is something that people can play now

2904
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah

2905
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I think it's .com

2906
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Alright

2907
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And Shane, maybe you should go check on your character

2908
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I wouldn't even remember my login

2909
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Well yeah, that's the other thing

2910
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
If you don't log in

2911
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I think it's like two months or something

2912
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Your character will go away

2913
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
As a resource saving thing

2914
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So you do have to play it pretty often

2915
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
So it's not like Neopets

2916
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I think I had a Neopet back in 2004

2917
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Which would have been the last time I fed it

2918
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Oh it's probably dead

2919
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I don't think Neopets ever die

2920
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Well I remember I joked with you

2921
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
When you told me you were going to pick this game

2922
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I was like, oh you should pick Neopets

2923
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
They have another game called Word Realms

2924
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Oh interesting

2925
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So there is, if you do pay

2926
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
There's an item called a Mr. Accessory

2927
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
That if you leave it on your character for a day

2928
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
It'll mark your character

2929
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Undeletable

2930
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
So that is a thing you can do to keep it long term

2931
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
But it means financially supporting the game

2932
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Oh that's smart

2933
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
There's a lot of smart stuff in this game

2934
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Alright

2935
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
There it is, your classic game of the week

2936
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Kingdom of Loathing

2937
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
It's kind of like when Jamie picked World of Warcraft

2938
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
But it's still going strong today

2939
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
So check that out

2940
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Good pick

2941
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I like the fact that it's not your typical

2942
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Console type game

2943
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
It's a web game

2944
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I don't think we've had anything like that

2945
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Cool pick

2946
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
So there it is, your classic game of the week

2947
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Since we did not have Radio Magic though

2948
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
We are going to take a quick in-studio break

2949
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
So when we come back we're going to talk plenty more

2950
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
We're going to get to what's in stores this week

2951
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Do some rapid fire news

2952
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Again we're short so

2953
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
You should send us emails sometime

2954
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2955
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
But we will get to your calls

2956
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
At Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

2957
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2958
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Welcome back everybody

2959
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Orange Lounge Radio live in progress

2960
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Episode 663 for this

2961
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
October the 30th of 2016

2962
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You know an appropriate game for Halloween

2963
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Castlevania I'm sure

2964
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
You know with spooky ghosts and things like that

2965
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And before the show

2966
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Tigerclaw put a link in our chat room

2967
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And I hadn't seen this yet

2968
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But I guess somebody was taking on the project

2969
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
To remake Castlevania in Unity

2970
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And we were watching a little bit of that in studio

2971
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
And I was very impressed

2972
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Was it Unreal or was it Unity?

2973
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I thought it was Unity

2974
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It was one of those engines

2975
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
That it was done on

2976
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Let me check one more time here

2977
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
You know why I'm probably thinking that?

2978
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I think I saw a Zelda thing

2979
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
That was done earlier this week that was in Unity

2980
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
That's probably why my wires are crossing

2981
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
And that one looked really good too

2982
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
So it's tough to

2983
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Kind of look at this and realize that like

2984
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
One guy did it and you're like

2985
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
This is the type of reimagining I would like

2986
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
To see of a Castlevania game

2987
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I mean granted it had some flaws

2988
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
It wasn't perfect like you could see some little graphical bugs

2989
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And things but honestly

2990
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I guess you could just go on there and download it

2991
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And check it out and I'm like alright

2992
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Lords of Shadow was a good game that first one

2993
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I liked that reimagining it was pretty good

2994
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Yeah alright fair enough

2995
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
But yeah I just

2996
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
You liked what you saw Loki of that little

2997
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Castlevania remake? Yeah it looked cool

2998
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Same thing so alright I liked it

2999
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
But then let's see

3000
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Oh Dungeon Buster says the guy also put it up

3001
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
On Kickstarter which is not a smart move

3002
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
That's definitely not a smart move

3003
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
That'll draw attention

3004
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Konami will sue

3005
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
That's not a good idea

3006
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
They don't have a lot going for them

3007
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
They're going to shut you down I wouldn't go to Kickstarter with that

3008
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Now if you want to do

3009
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
A different game

3010
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
That's like you know

3011
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night

3012
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Oh wait you can't do that either

3013
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
But you see where I'm going with this

3014
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
You could do a different type of you know

3015
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Ghosty goblin-y

3016
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
You know type of game

3017
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And it would be okay

3018
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
So you might want to think about that my friend

3019
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Alright

3020
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Anyhow let's get into some rapid

3021
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Fire news and talk about quickly

3022
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
A couple other things going on in gaming this week

3023
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Loki so if you like game soundtracks

3024
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
And you happen to like those soundtracks in

3025
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Vinyl well there's some good news for you

3026
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Shovel Knight they're going to be bringing their soundtrack

3027
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Out to Vinyl and CD

3028
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Very soon

3029
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
So it looks like it's going to be

3030
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It looks like a double LP

3031
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And you can get the CD version for $18

3032
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Vinyl is going to be selling for

3033
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
$35

3034
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
And yeah it looks

3035
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Pretty awesome so

3036
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I'm not sure when that's going to be available

3037
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Looks like the 2 dispersion is on Bandcamp

3038
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And then the double vinyl

3039
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Double LP is going to be on Big Wax

3040
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So soon

3041
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Also the last

3042
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Guardian

3043
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Golden going to be coming around the corner here pretty soon

3044
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Also getting it's soundtrack on

3045
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Vinyl as well also going to be a double

3046
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
LP

3047
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And you can get that through

3048
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Iam8bit

3049
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
And it's going to cost you $35

3050
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
And I'll be coming

3051
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
First quarter of 2017

3052
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
And since we're on the topic of

3053
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Fan games

3054
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
This one thankfully won't get shut down because of

3055
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
You know Sega's wonderful

3056
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Stance hey fan games cool make them

3057
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
So this is going to be one year

3058
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
In fact you can probably do them better than we can at this point

3059
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Yeah exactly and honestly this looks

3060
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Kind of better than

3061
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
No one can touch their Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account

3062
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Nobody will do better than that

3063
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Maybe Arby's they're like neck and neck sometimes

3064
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Arby's and Denny's you know

3065
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Denny's Denny's is really great

3066
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Go right now and look at Denny's

3067
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Sonic Utopia

3068
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
It's a 3D Sonic

3069
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Game and it's

3070
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Supposed to combine all the elements of

3071
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
You know the best elements of

3072
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Different Sonic games so basically

3073
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
They wanted to expand the Sonic

3074
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Gameplay in an intuitive 3D way

3075
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And also

3076
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
They said the capture best of the Sonic

3077
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Style and stuff the trailer

3078
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Looked pretty cool and actually looks like

3079
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
A lot of fun the controls I mean

3080
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It seemed like it would control pretty well but hey

3081
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Don't let the trailer just

3082
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Be the judge you can actually check out this

3083
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Game and download it now so if you go check out

3084
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
The trailer

3085
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
You can also download the game

3086
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
There's a link in the description

3087
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I haven't yet played it yet

3088
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
But judging by the trailer it looked like

3089
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
You know this would probably be a

3090
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Pretty good take on a 3D Sonic

3091
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Game so go check it out

3092
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Alright well

3093
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm going to bring up this story and I didn't realize

3094
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Shane would be here on tonight's show when I put

3095
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
This in rapid fire news but I have a feeling

3096
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Shane's going to turn this into a long form story

3097
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Because this is about Pokemon Sun

3098
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and Moon and there was

3099
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
There was a new trailer this week

3100
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
For Pokemon Sun and Moon

3101
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Which well wait no it's not

3102
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
All bad news oh no I know I know what happens

3103
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
At the end alright so

3104
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Here's the deal is that the final

3105
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Evolutions for the starters were

3106
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Unveiled so you get to see the

3107
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Brand new final forms

3108
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Are you going to butcher their names I can't wait

3109
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Okay

3110
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
This is the only one I'm not sure of Decidueye

3111
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Yeah that's good enough

3112
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
That's how I would say it

3113
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
That's Rowlet's final form and I like this

3114
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
A grass ghost type

3115
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Yes for a couple different reasons

3116
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
People are trying to basically say

3117
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Because the owl it's based off

3118
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Of from what people can tell is an

3119
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Extinct owl in Hawaii

3120
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Called the stilt owl

3121
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
It's also well I'll let you finish the other

3122
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Well it also uses ghost moves

3123
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Like spirit shackles

3124
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Well that's because it's ghost

3125
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
What else did you want to say?

3126
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Oh I was going to point out the connection between the

3127
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Secondary types in all three

3128
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Okay alright well then let me move on

3129
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
To Nsign

3130
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
No I

3131
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I went to purposely mess it up for change

3132
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Incineroar is the second one

3133
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
This and of course I know that one because

3134
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Litten will be the character

3135
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
And it's super cool oh my gosh

3136
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I like the WWF

3137
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Fire belt that it wears

3138
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I love its spinning lariat move it's so cool

3139
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Fire dark type

3140
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And then the worst thing in the

3141
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
World

3142
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Primarina

3143
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That's better than what it is

3144
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Primarina and the diamonds

3145
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Primarina it's a real heartbreaker

3146
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It's not a robot Primarina is the

3147
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Water fairy type

3148
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Of course it's a fairy type

3149
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
And it's a mermaid

3150
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Looking Pokemon and Shane

3151
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Is not a fan

3152
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
It's also based on a siren

3153
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
So now they also unveiled

3154
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Some other Pokemon but if you want to hear

3155
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
On that you'll have to tune into the next episode

3156
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Whenever that is

3157
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
But I will bring up Alolan Persian

3158
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Form because

3159
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Alolan Persian looks like

3160
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Garfield to me

3161
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And I can't get over it like how

3162
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Stupid it looks

3163
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
All it did was eat some bees

3164
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
So the other thing on the secondary types for the

3165
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Starters finals is that ghost dark

3166
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Fairy forms a

3167
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Trio kind of the same way that the

3168
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Fire water grass

3169
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Interesting observation

3170
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
And those are

3171
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Like those are newer types too

3172
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
At least dark and fairy

3173
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Dark is gen 2 and fairy is gen 5

3174
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Or gen 6

3175
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
It's one of the later ones

3176
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
And then

3177
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Also apparently

3178
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
You will run into

3179
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Your old pals

3180
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Ghost isn't strong against fairy though

3181
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Right so it's not a complete trio

3182
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I guess we don't have to talk about

3183
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
No we're just continuing the discussion

3184
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
So red and blue

3185
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
You will run into

3186
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
As part of the game

3187
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
But make sure you knock on their door

3188
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
First before barging in

3189
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
A lot of the stuff I've been seeing on

3190
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Twitter lately and loving

3191
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
But yeah apparently they're all

3192
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Grown up now although they don't look that grown up

3193
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
But also I want to point out

3194
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
That blue is actually

3195
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I can show you some pictures where they look pretty grown up

3196
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Blue is actually wearing green

3197
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Capri shorts and green shoes

3198
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Probably because he's green in Japan

3199
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Yes I know that

3200
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I'm just beating you to it

3201
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I'm just questioning the choice of wardrobe here

3202
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That's all I'm saying

3203
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Why are you questioning against green shorts?

3204
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Because he looks like mom in that wardrobe

3205
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
No he doesn't he just looks super gay

3206
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Because that's what he is

3207
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
If you watch the trailer and he throws out his Pokemon

3208
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And then you see him standing behind it

3209
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Is the flammiest pose I've ever seen

3210
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Any character in Pokemon

3211
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Is flammier than a male Primarina

3212
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And like

3213
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Go for real

3214
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Load it up while I can continue talking about Pokemon

3215
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And then Red has a 96

3216
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
On his shirt to you know

3217
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Harken back to the fact that they came out in Japan

3218
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Oh I just thought it was 69 upside down

3219
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
That's all

3220
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
You want me to show you pictures?

3221
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
No no my god

3222
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
The things you see

3223
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
On Tumblr you can't unsee

3224
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
You've been tweeting enough

3225
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Yeah I just retweet whenever I see

3226
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
If it's like ugly

3227
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Well to be fair so have I

3228
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
If you just go to Shane and Linko on Twitter

3229
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I was going to say man that Pokestop Podcast

3230
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Feed is going to be very interesting

3231
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Oh god I'm just going to

3232
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I'm just going to leave the room for 30 minutes

3233
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
While Shane just reads

3234
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Tumblr porn about Red and Blue

3235
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Well it's not going to be hard to do

3236
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I think it's just images at this point mostly

3237
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Anyway there you go

3238
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You didn't even talk about

3239
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Other things that happen in the trailer

3240
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Because I'm making people wait for the next episode of the Pokestop Podcast

3241
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Hey also guys if you have the demo

3242
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
There's a demo event today

3243
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
So you better go do it before your timezone changes

3244
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Now

3245
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
You can check this out if you're in Japan

3246
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Anyway because I don't think it's coming here

3247
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Kunio-kun

3248
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Nekketsu complete Famicom

3249
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Series is coming out December 8th in Japan

3250
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
This is a 3DS game

3251
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
That's coming out for 4,800 yen

3252
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Or you can download it for a little cheaper

3253
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
4,444 yen

3254
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Arc System Works is putting this out

3255
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And it's going to come with some themes

3256
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And so forth but you might be wondering

3257
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Well what is this game?

3258
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Well this is a collection of every

3259
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Kunio-kun game that was released

3260
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
For the Famicom

3261
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
This means River City Ransom

3262
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Super Dodge Ball

3263
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Renegade

3264
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Crash and the Boys Street Challenge

3265
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And other games that never even came out over here

3266
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Featuring those same characters

3267
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
It's a very unique art style of characters

3268
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And I'm sure a lot of you know River City Ransom

3269
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And Super Dodge Ball

3270
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
So this is a collection of all those games

3271
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
There is all to be said 11 games in the collection

3272
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
So it looks like it's going to be a pretty

3273
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Kickass collection

3274
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Boy it's a bummer the 3DS isn't region free

3275
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Yeah thanks Nintendo

3276
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Just have a Japanese 3DS like what I'm playing right now

3277
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
To be fair they may be switching that

3278
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
With the Switch

3279
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Apparently the Switch is region free

3280
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
If you believe rumors

3281
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I don't

3282
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I believe in disappointment

3283
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Alright let's travel around

3284
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And look at what's coming out in stores this week

3285
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
So this week since we're getting

3286
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000

3287
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000

PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

3298
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And no I don't think this has

3299
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Anything to do with Xanadu the movie

3300
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
But Xanadu Next is coming out

3301
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000

One, Football Man

3305
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Who's going to buy that?

3306
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Some people, it's space

3307
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Couple people, it's a niche title

3308
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Yeah

3309
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Football Manager 17

3310
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
On PC, Mac and Linux

3311
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Mario Party Star Rush on

3312
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000

And that's it

3316
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Alright so Call of Duty probably the

3317
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Big deal game of the week that a lot of people

3318
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Oh and I'm sorry I did miss

3319
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
BlazBlue Central Fiction on

3320
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4

3321
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
How could you miss yet another BlazBlue release?

3322
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
How could you?

3323
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I kind of want to check out Call of Duty

3324
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I like the campaigns, I'm weird like that

3325
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Remember, wasn't that that trailer

3326
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
At E3 that everybody was kind of going

3327
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Oh what's this, this is like a space game

3328
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
This looks like it would be cool, and then it's like

3329
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Call of Duty and everybody's like, oh they just fucking

3330
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
bait and switch to us, that's fucking rude

3331
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Like

3332
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I think a lot of us kind of had that reaction

3333
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I don't know, I may hold off on it because I bought

3334
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Infinite Warfare, or not Infinite Warfare

3335
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Advanced Warfare

3336
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
The last one before Black Ops 3 was

3337
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And like I bought it and I was like

3338
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Oh season pass, I'm gonna go gung-ho multiplayer

3339
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Have not played a thing on it

3340
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
It's like a waste of money

3341
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Just throwing it up, throwing off that money

3342
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And just a quick FYI from the chatroom

3343
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Loki's Xanadu

3344
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Not a Olivia Newton-John movie

3345
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Dungeon Buster clarifying

3346
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Xanadu next is another of

3347
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Falcom's RPGs, that's the

3348
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
studio behind the Ys series

3349
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Not to be confused with Ys

3350
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
It's Ys, that's how you say it

3351
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
So yeah, it's that

3352
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
same type of game

3353
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
RPG in that fashion

3354
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Based around the Xanadu movie

3355
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Yes, where it's starring a roller rink

3356
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And cartoon sequences

3357
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
that make no damn sense and so forth

3358
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Alright, anyway

3359
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
That is such a good movie though

3360
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Moving on, oh actually now see

3361
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Rageonator brings up, I remember

3362
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Fushanadu, or in fact

3363
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Xanadu is what a lot of people said

3364
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Pretty good game and I love the title

3365
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Screen theme, that was a great NES game

3366
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I love that game to this day

3367
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Great game, anyway

3368
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Let's travel to Japan, quick, everybody on the plane

3369
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Let's go, whee, alright

3370
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Coming out in Japan on

3371
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
November the 2nd on the PlayStation 4

3372
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2

3373
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
And Atelier Firis

3374
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Fushigi Na Taibo no

3375
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Renken Jutsuji

3376
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
In a regular premium box

3377
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Special collection box with a music

3378
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Combo set for

3379
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
349 bucks

3380
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
That's a lot of money

3381
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
So yeah, that is all stuff to look forward to

3382
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
This week in Japan on the PlayStation 4

3383
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I don't think

3384
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
There's anything of note on the Wii U

3385
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I think things are very quiet over there

3386
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
So look at the handhelds real quick

3387
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
On the Nintendo 3DS

3388
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Actually there's nothing on the 3DS this week

3389
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
They're getting pumped up for Sun and Moon

3390
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
There's a new, yeah I was gonna say the new

3391
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
3DS XL Sun and Moon edition

3392
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
That's it, there's really nothing

3393
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
It's kinda, kinda quiet on the 3DS

3394
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Well, at least you still have

3395
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
releases on the Vita where that same

3396
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Atelier Firis game is

3397
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
also being released on

3398
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
the 3rd

3399
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
And that seems to be the tent pole for the week

3400
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I'm not familiar with that series

3401
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
But that must be, what is that called

3402
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
over here? Do they have that series here?

3403
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Which one? Atelier

3404
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Yeah they have Atelier

3405
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I just never got into this series then

3406
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
They have a ton of them

3407
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It was like about once a year

3408
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
So yeah, that's a big release in Japan this week

3409
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
It looks like at least the only one that's releasing over there

3410
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So that's pretty much it for Japanese releases

3411
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Alright, well

3412
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
PC's not, or I'm sorry

3413
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Europe is not getting much

3414
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Including, well, Football Manager 2017 on PC

3415
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
It doesn't list it but I'm pretty sure

3416
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is also coming out

3417
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
the same day there as well

3418
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
That's it

3419
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Alright

3420
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Let's get back into some news

3421
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Because usually we would do the mailbag right now

3422
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
But the mailbag's empty

3423
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
That's the second week in a row

3424
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Is it because you guys miss Jamie?

3425
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I understand. Do you miss Jamie criticizing your emails?

3426
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
If you want, I'll criticize your grammar

3427
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I'll do it

3428
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I'll make Shane read emails or something

3429
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
He'll love that

3430
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
He'll criticize your name

3431
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
He'll criticize wherever you're emailing us from

3432
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Your opinion is probably garbage

3433
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
So I'll criticize that too

3434
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
It's a show where every gamer has a voice

3435
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
And then Shane yells back at said voice

3436
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Anyway, participate

3437
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I don't deal with stupidity so if you're going to be stupid

3438
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Just watch out

3439
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We don't have stupid listeners, Shane

3440
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Well, do you want me to start?

3441
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

3442
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
And don't worry

3443
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Shane's going to be too lazy to show up to the show next week

3444
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Probably so

3445
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
He will be too busy playing more Pokemon or something

3446
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Alright

3447
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

3448
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Actually, you could send an email where you rant about Shane

3449
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I would love that

3450
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
And then I'll come over

3451
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
That would be hilarious

3452
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Especially because he moved

3453
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And now he's a little bit closer

3454
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Not too close, far enough away

3455
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
What would happen is I'd read the email

3456
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
This is John Doe

3457
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
And I'm emailing him

3458
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Talking about how much I hate Shane

3459
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
By the time I'd be done reading the email

3460
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Shane wouldn't even knock

3461
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
He'd just barge through the door

3462
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
And he'd just say, hold on a minute

3463
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I got something to say

3464
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I got something to say

3465
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Alright, let's get back into some news

3466
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Aw, strangers with candy

3467
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
You know last night at Rocky Horror

3468
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I made a strangers with candy joke on TV

3469
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I said something about going back to high school

3470
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
And I said, I was a user, a boozer, and a loser

3471
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
And I counted

3472
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Two people in the audience laughed

3473
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
See, you're just pointing out all the reasons

3474
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Why that is a stupid thing to go to

3475
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Shut up

3476
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
You should have thrown in, I stole the TV

3477
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I know, I should have

3478
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Did you catch that joke?

3479
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Oh my god, it's only the best

3480
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Okay, is it still on Netflix and Hulu

3481
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
No, it's not on Netflix

3482
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It might be on Hulu still

3483
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
But it's long gone from Netflix

3484
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Okay, I'm telling you guys, strangers with candy

3485
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Which was a

3486
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Comedy central show in the late 90s

3487
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Late 90s, early 2000s

3488
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
It stars Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert

3489
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Before he had the whole success

3490
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Of the Daily Show

3491
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
And they're on this show

3492
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
And it's about a 40 year old woman

3493
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That goes back to high school

3494
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
After she was in jail, basically, for so long

3495
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
It's so good

3496
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It's a parody of those self-help movies

3497
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
From the 70s

3498
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I've seen the movie, it's on YouTube

3499
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
That it's all based on

3500
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I was at my rock bottom

3501
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
It's like one of those scared stiffs

3502
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
It's still on Hulu

3503
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Is that the Hulu Plus or the Hulu Free?

3504
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
There is no Hulu Free anymore

3505
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Get rid of it

3506
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
But if you have Hulu, check out Strangers with Candy

3507
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Because it is Rob Roberts' favorite TV show ever made

3508
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
There is a movie too

3509
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Yeah, I think the movie's not that great

3510
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
The movie's not as good as the show

3511
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
But it's a good cheat

3512
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
It's a good cheat

3513
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Wasn't the movie the one where she stabbed somebody with a fork

3514
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Or something like that?

3515
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I think so, yeah

3516
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I do have to say, not having seen Strangers with Candy

3517
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Was that episode really confusing?

3518
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Oh yeah, because they did the trivia

3519
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
That's right, no, none of that would have made sense

3520
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
If you've never seen Strangers with Candy

3521
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
So you owe it to yourself to watch this show

3522
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
And you should watch the episode

3523
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
The spelling episode

3524
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
The spelling bean

3525
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
And...

3526
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
That's probably the best episode of the show they ever did

3527
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
That was in the second season

3528
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I don't know, because there's also the one with the blind guy

3529
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
And that one's really good too

3530
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
What's the name of that episode?

3531
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Wait, is it that one?

3532
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
No, it's the blank page

3533
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
That's it

3534
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And then it's the fourth episode

3535
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
In the first season

3536
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Who Wants Cake

3537
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
That is great

3538
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
And Stephen Colbert's character

3539
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
In that show

3540
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Is the funniest thing in the world

3541
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So please do yourself a favor

3542
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
And watch that show

3543
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
There you go

3544
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Kaijuto says

3545
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
It was just the echo of Rob's laugh

3546
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
And the silence

3547
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Oh no, there were definitely people laughing

3548
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
There were people laughing loudly

3549
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Just there weren't very many of them

3550
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
So the people who got it really loved it

3551
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Yeah

3552
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
And I'm not afraid to waste everybody's time

3553
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
With a joke that only two people are gonna get

3554
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And really get

3555
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I mean, that's kind of the beauty of Rocky

3556
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
A lot of things will just fly over your head if you don't get it

3557
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
But it's funny for the people who are there for it

3558
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It is, it is

3559
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Alright, see what happens when you don't email us

3560
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
We talk about Hulu

3561
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Alright, let's move on

3562
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
With some more gaming news stories

3563
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
So once again, this was something I didn't actually

3564
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Watch, I was busy watching

3565
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
The Microsoft conference

3566
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
And apparently there was an Apple conference

3567
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Going on at the same time, or near

3568
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
The same time

3569
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Close enough

3570
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I just didn't care

3571
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
But yeah, they were talking

3572
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
A little bit about Apple TV

3573
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
One thing I wanted to mention is

3574
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Hey, Minecraft is coming to Apple TV

3575
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Because Minecraft is coming to everything

3576
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Something that is kind of cool about it

3577
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
You will be able to play your Minecraft worlds

3578
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
With other users that are also on other Apple devices

3579
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Like iPads and iPhones

3580
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
And

3581
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Yeah

3582
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
And that's coming at some point

3583
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
So you like Minecraft

3584
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Do you think this is a good idea for Apple TV?

3585
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Sure, I mean, it's always good to have

3586
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
More things that it can do

3587
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I mean, I didn't get an Apple

3588
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I looked at

3589
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I talked someone out of getting an Apple TV

3590
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Because they were looking for streaming devices

3591
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
For their home, and it's like, oh yeah

3592
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
This doesn't have a remote on it

3593
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Your remote is an iPhone

3594
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
It's like, no it's not, you get a remote

3595
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
With Apple TVs, not that one

3596
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
That I looked at, they should all come with them

3597
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
They come with a really garbage one, but yeah

3598
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
They should have a little silver one, yeah

3599
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
But then again, this is a qualified

3600
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Walmart employee, so

3601
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Very possible that he did no shit

3602
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Just saying, no

3603
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Hey, yeah, you

3604
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Know that you need an

3605
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
iPhone to control, and I was like

3606
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Fuck that shit

3607
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Yeah, no, the guy was an idiot, because they

3608
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Definitely come with remotes, I've seen it

3609
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I thought so, but he was very insistent

3610
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
And I was like, well I'm not going to have you buy this

3611
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
When you can just buy Roku for 40 bucks

3612
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
So forget it

3613
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Alright, well I'm kind of surprised

3614
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
That there isn't more gaming on Apple

3615
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
TV, like I know there was like that harmonics

3616
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Game, and there's a few things here and there, but it's just like

3617
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
You feel like

3618
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
How long do you think it is going to be before they get into VR

3619
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Because I have a feeling that Apple will try to

3620
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Do something, you know

3621
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I'm really surprised they haven't, but sometimes

3622
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
They show up to the party late, and they'll put their own

3623
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Little spin on it, they have to figure out how to market it

3624
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Like they market all the other stuff, you know what I mean

3625
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
We're Apple, we're releasing something, go buy it

3626
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Yeah, we'll see

3627
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Anyway, well speaking of the Apple

3628
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Platform, one thing that people are very much

3629
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Looking forward to is Super Mario

3630
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Run, now obviously

3631
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
This isn't restricted to just the Apple

3632
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Platform, although I think it's coming out there first

3633
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Before it comes out on the Android devices

3634
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Just like every game

3635
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Not always, Ingress was on Android

3636
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Before it was on iOS, of course

3637
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
But only because it was developed by Google

3638
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
It was developed by a spin-off Google team, yeah

3639
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Anyway, so apparently

3640
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Nintendo is really determined to make

3641
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
This a huge game

3642
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
This was in an interview with Bloomberg

3643
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Where Tatsume Kimishima

3644
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Who of course is the president

3645
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Of Nintendo right now, said

3646
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened

3647
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
When we delivered Pokemon Go

3648
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
You delivered Pokemon Go?

3649
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Hold on

3650
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Nintendo really didn't do anything with Pokemon Go

3651
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Let's get that clear first

3652
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
They provided the intellectual property

3653
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
That's it, but anyway

3654
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
In terms of expectations, we all saw what happened when we

3655
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Delivered Pokemon Go, and honestly I was quite surprised by it

3656
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Myself, there's no doubt that

3657
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
More people are using smartphones to play games

3658
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And at this time we're using

3659
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
And as this time we're using

3660
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Mario, that's a very important

3661
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Intellectual property for us

3662
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
And that's what Miyamoto's team is working on now

3663
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Making sure it spreads out

3664
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Just as quickly as Pokemon Go

3665
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
More than 20 million people

3666
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Have already registered to receive

3667
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Notifications when the game is available

3668
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Continuing with some comments

3669
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
In terms of the game itself

3670
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
You can download it and play a certain part of it

3671
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
And then pay a fixed price

3672
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
And play it over and over as many times as you want

3673
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Without having to pay anything extra

3674
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And that should give peace of mind that kids can play it

3675
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And we're hoping that it will help it become

3676
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
More popular

3677
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
So there's no limited Pokeballs

3678
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Or incubators or any of that stuff

3679
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
So it will be one fee

3680
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That's going to be the whole game

3681
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
We knew that was coming, they've said that before

3682
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
It was going to be one of those typical iPhone games

3683
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
It's basically now everything's shareware

3684
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Again, you get the first episode free

3685
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
You've got to pay to unlock it

3686
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
That's what Super Mario Run is going to be

3687
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
It's going to be shareware

3688
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I mean, I like the shareware model

3689
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Those are my first games

3690
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Yeah, don't get me wrong, I like that model

3691
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Bigger than Pokemon Go, Loki?

3692
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I would way rather something be shareware for real

3693
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Than to try to be freemium

3694
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
And just nickel and dime you out of everything

3695
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
You know

3696
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
If they're talking about the biggest Pokemon Go at launch

3697
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
No, and I'll tell you why

3698
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Pokemon Go is free, for one

3699
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Pokemon Go was kind of a unique gameplay thing

3700
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Where actually

3701
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
People were never really exposed to this kind of

3702
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Augmented reality thing

3703
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Versus a licensed runner

3704
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I'm sorry

3705
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Even if it is Mario

3706
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
It'll be popular

3707
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Don't get me wrong, but they're not going to

3708
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Fucking do news stories about it

3709
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
People aren't gathering at fucking parks for it

3710
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
It's not going to be like that

3711
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Because it's not bringing anything that unique

3712
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
To the table

3713
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
It's a Mario game, which people have been waiting for

3714
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
But it's a fucking runner

3715
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I'm sorry, it's just kind of

3716
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Whatever, cool

3717
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I think the game will be huge

3718
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
It will be Candy Crush huge

3719
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
It will be, you know, draw something huge

3720
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
It will not be Pokemon Go huge

3721
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Because, and you're kind of hitting the nail on the head

3722
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
It's not going to have that same effect

3723
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Where it's on the news and all this stuff

3724
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Because it's not a social game

3725
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Pokemon Go became a very social thing

3726
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Where you got together with friends

3727
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And you all downloaded the game

3728
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And you went out into the real world

3729
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
And there's all the, oh you're walking and exercising

3730
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
There's nothing like this

3731
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Mario Run's not going to have that

3732
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
But that's not to say the game's not going to do extremely well

3733
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
It's going to do very well for Nintendo

3734
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
It's going to be number one in the store

3735
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
For some time

3736
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
It's just not going to be Pokemon Go levels

3737
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
And also if it's a purchase game

3738
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Even if people don't like it, then they buy it

3739
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Because it's Mario, that's going to drive a lot of sales

3740
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
And that actually, that's the thing

3741
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I really hope it's a good game

3742
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
But the fact that they have a part of it that's free

3743
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
If it's not a great game

3744
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
You're not going to get that conversion I think

3745
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
That's true

3746
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I still think people will download it

3747
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Just because it's Mario

3748
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Well they'll download it, but they might not buy it

3749
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
And Nintendo's only going to report on who downloads it

3750
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
They're not going to report on who buys it

3751
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Anyway, MXC in chat says

3752
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Could it be bigger than Pokemon Go

3753
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Since it will be iOS exclusive to start

3754
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
That's a very good point

3755
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Well Pokemon Go couldn't afford to be only iOS only at start

3756
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Because then it would have locked out these situations

3757
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Like if JD and I wanted to go to Old Town Sack or something to play

3758
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
We couldn't do it because JD's on Android and I'm on iOS

3759
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So it would have cut that element out of it

3760
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Now with Super Mario Run, again

3761
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Because the social element isn't the same

3762
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
They can get away with doing that

3763
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
But you bring up a darn good point

3764
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
How can they meet those kind of numbers

3765
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,000
When it's not even going to be on both platforms at first

3766
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And I think it also may show Nintendo a little bit though

3767
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
It should really show them

3768
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Because they've kind of missed the boat on a lot of this social gaming stuff for a very long time

3769
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I mean, yeah, sure, Miiverse

3770
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I know they're very big on parties in the same room and so forth

3771
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
But there's a whole other element to online gaming

3772
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
That Nintendo's just kind of slept on for a long time

3773
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Well, I think they also don't know how to handle it

3774
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Because Nintendo is so focused on their family friendly, all ages audience

3775
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
And you just can't subject that to the internet without losing some of that

3776
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:07,000
You know, that's I think one of the reasons why

3777
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,000
All of the chat and the friending and stuff is so locked down on all of the things

3778
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Doing a code exchange handshake thing like with DS and all of that

3779
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
It's designed to make sure you're not just adding random people

3780
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
That's why Nintendo is not very good at social

3781
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Because it's not designed to be explosive, viral, social growth

3782
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I'm a little pissed they took away my swap notes so I can't send my friend's dicks anymore

3783
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
On 3DS

3784
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Good thing you have Snapchat for that

3785
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
But that's not Nintendo

3786
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
See, it's a missed opportunity

3787
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I can't send to Snapchat and have it go

3788
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Nintendo needs to put Mario stickers in Snapchat

3789
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Maybe they will when Super Mario Run comes out, who knows

3790
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Alright, moving on, Loki

3791
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So there's some more developments in the ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus

3792
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
The two main points from this

3793
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:03,000
One, they are issuing a subpoena to Samsung

3794
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:09,000
To basically get some information related to Samsung's use of the source code and technology

3795
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Provided by Oculus in order to create the Samsung Gear VR

3796
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
So because of that they have to comply within three weeks

3797
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I guess of this lawsuit

3798
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
The other thing is that they are issuing

3799
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:35,000
They want Oculus to provide the imaging of the hard drive from John Carmack

3800
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
As part of this discovery right now

3801
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
It's interesting to see they're dragging Samsung into this as well

3802
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,000
God, I hope there's no Hillary Clinton emails on that

3803
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Let's not even go there

3804
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I'm a little late for that now

3805
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
You know, a couple more days

3806
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Sorry, I couldn't help myself

3807
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
People will not just shut the fuck up about it

3808
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Never could the FBI director

3809
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Does she have any porn or emails?

3810
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Because that's really all that I'm interested in

3811
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
She's getting subscriptions from like

3812
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I'm sure that it's not in hers

3813
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Alright, back to

3814
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Then again, if you've been reading about where the emails were found

3815
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Maybe there was porn there, but nobody wants to see it

3816
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Anyway, back to

3817
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Back to the ZeniMax Oculus thing

3818
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
So what, any chance they're going to settle out of court?

3819
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Isn't that how these

3820
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
All these lawsuit stories are

3821
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
And then they settle out of court

3822
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I think ZeniMax has the eye and the prize there

3823
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
They're hoping to get the big payout

3824
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
So I don't think there's going to be any settling

3825
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
If ZeniMax does end up winning

3826
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Can you use that money to please patch your games?

3827
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Fix that shit?

3828
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Because, I don't know

3829
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Well, if you are a fan of classic games

3830
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Like us here at Orange Lounge Radio

3831
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
You can be

3832
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Confident that GameStop is trying to build up more of the classic gaming

3833
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
In their stores

3834
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Which is ironic because they stopped taking trades of classic games

3835
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Not too long ago

3836
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Yeah, they were kind of like, nah, we're kind of over that

3837
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
But now they're back doing it

3838
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
GameStop is now accepting retro consoles as trade-ins

3839
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
This originally was a pilot thing

3840
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
But it was a success

3841
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
So all stores nationwide

3842
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Will now accept NESes, Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast games

3843
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:26,000
They will also take Sega Saturns, Game Boy Colors in advance, GameCube, and Xbox

3844
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Are they just taking them or are they selling them again?

3845
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I think they are taking them

3846
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
And they're probably either selling them online

3847
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Or I know the way they used to do it

3848
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Is like one store in the area was kind of like the retro store

3849
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
But I don't know what they're doing now

3850
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
As far as the turnaround

3851
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I don't know if they're selling them online

3852
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
But sell them on eBay

3853
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Yeah, I mean it seems like if all they're going to do is just sell it online

3854
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Like it doesn't make any sense from the consumer's perspective

3855
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
To not just do it at all

3856
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Like if I were to buy a retro console

3857
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I sure as hell wouldn't buy it from GameStop

3858
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I'd buy it from eBay

3859
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Or some other online source

3860
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Or from another independent game store that would probably have that stuff

3861
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
I think there's going to be a lot of people though

3862
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
That dig up these cartridges

3863
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And then they hear that, oh, GameStop's buying these

3864
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
They're going to go unload the games at GameStop

3865
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Because they don't

3866
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Yeah, they're hoping that

3867
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Oh, hey, look at you

3868
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
You got a nice sealed Chrono Trigger there

3869
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
We'll give you two cents for that

3870
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Yeah, exactly, right? We'll give you $2.50

3871
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
In-store credit

3872
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Anyway, I mean

3873
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I'm a big retro game fan

3874
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
So I guess this is cool

3875
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I like going to flea markets

3876
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
And finding stuff there

3877
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Sometimes you find some gems there

3878
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Although the people who specialize

3879
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
In selling games at flea markets

3880
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
They know what they're doing

3881
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
You're not going to find deals there

3882
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
But sometimes you find games amongst other stuff

3883
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And that's where you find the best stuff

3884
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Yard sales

3885
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Yeah, it's basically yard sales, for sure

3886
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
But I guess that's cool that all the retro stuff

3887
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Is kind of coming back

3888
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I find it very interesting that Genesis

3889
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Is in that list because I think back to

3890
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
We were at Target today

3891
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And one thing I noticed in the video game area

3892
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
There's an Atari Flashback 7

3893
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
For God's sake, they're up to 7

3894
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
How different new stuff could they

3895
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Possibly have on that now?

3896
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
It's got to be HDMI at this point

3897
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Yeah, I'm sure they've judged

3898
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
HDMI, man, I'm sure the upscaling

3899
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Of that 4-bit graphics

3900
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
But then

3901
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
They also had a Genesis

3902
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
System that had a bunch

3903
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Of the Sonic games, of course

3904
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Altered Beast, which you'd expect

3905
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
And I guess somehow, amongst the

3906
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Midway closure, they picked

3907
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Up the rights to Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3

3908
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
The Genesis versions

3909
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
So those are all on there as well

3910
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
And then I believe the Genesis flashbacks have

3911
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Some homegrown games on them

3912
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
In fact, you notice when you look at the back of the box

3913
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Some of the pictures are big

3914
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Which are all like the Sega games

3915
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
And there's a bunch of small pictures

3916
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I've never heard of any of these games

3917
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I think they're homegrown games that are in there

3918
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
So that's kind of interesting that they do that with Flashback

3919
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Yeah, they did that with the Coleco one

3920
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
These aren't very good

3921
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
But I think the Atari one does that too

3922
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I think some of those games on there are homegrown games

3923
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
But then there also was a Genesis

3924
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Portable system that was like

3925
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
The exact same thing, it was like a Flashback

3926
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
But they actually called it

3927
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
A Game Gear

3928
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Flashback or something

3929
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
It was like the name, it actually had a little

3930
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Tie-in to what the Sega handheld

3931
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Used to be called

3932
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
And you could have a handheld

3933
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
One of these, and it was relatively

3934
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Cheap, I think it was only like 30 bucks

3935
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
For the handheld

3936
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
But I still didn't buy one

3937
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Because I'm like, okay, I don't need

3938
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
A Genesis handheld, I'm never going to play it

3939
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
But I thought that was neat that that was

3940
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Out there, but also the reason why I bring that up

3941
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Is that kind of stuff

3942
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Is kind of becoming more and more where it's like

3943
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
You have the consoles with the games built in

3944
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Is there going to be a market of people

3945
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Looking to buy a second-hand Genesis system

3946
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
At GameStop

3947
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Some people there are collectors

3948
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Probably, but I just don't know

3949
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
If you'd really want to do it that route

3950
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Because it would be cheaper probably

3951
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Just to buy a system that has a lot of that stuff

3952
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Built in, or even buy one of those systems

3953
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Buy a flash card, if you're not looking

3954
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
To collect the actual stuff

3955
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
You're just looking for those games

3956
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Buy a flash card, really cheap

3957
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
And then download all the ROMs to it

3958
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Or you can buy

3959
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
The Nintendo Classic system that's coming out in a couple weeks

3960
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Thank you for bringing that up

3961
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Because I was going to say, Nintendo is also getting into this game

3962
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Big time, I'm sure a lot of you

3963
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Are looking at that Nintendo

3964
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Classic thing that's coming out

3965
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
That's coming out in two weeks

3966
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Yeah, next week really

3967
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Well, not next week, but the week after next

3968
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Very, very soon

3969
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Yeah

3970
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Cool

3971
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Alright, so yeah

3972
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Those are some things you can trade in at GameStop

3973
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Who probably also sells

3974
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
The Flashback consoles, I imagine they have to

3975
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Alright

3976
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
In any sense they will

3977
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Well, it might depend on the size of the store too

3978
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
The mall ones that are really small may not have room for them

3979
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
But the one we were at today was a strip mall one

3980
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
That's huge, so some of the GameStops are a lot bigger than others

3981
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Alright, anyway

3982
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Let's move on, Loki, one more story from you

3983
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And then we're going to get calls here soon

3984
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Okay, so this is pretty cool

3985
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I have no interest in going to Blizzcon

3986
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
But

3987
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Now I have slightly more interest

3988
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
If I were going

3989
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Weirdo Yankovic

3990
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
This is going to be the actual

3991
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Music act at Blizzcon

3992
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
This year

3993
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
And that is the best band

3994
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Musician whatever they've ever had

3995
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Closing the show at Blizzcon

3996
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I'm sorry, and by the way

3997
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Remember earlier in the show I said Metallica

3998
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Did it one year

3999
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Blink 182 did it recently

4000
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
And I'm trying to think, they've had a lot of those

4001
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Types of bands

4002
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Right, we were talking about the different types of music

4003
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Well, it's always been kind of like that type of music

4004
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
It's awesome that Weirdo Yankovic is doing it

4005
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
It's a great choice

4006
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
And it kind of makes you go, why haven't they done this before?

4007
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Why didn't they have Weirdo Owl before?

4008
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Maybe this first year it worked out

4009
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
He's just such a geek, you know

4010
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
And there's great overlap there

4011
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Yeah, it's great overlap

4012
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
That almost, almost

4013
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I'm not going to, but it almost makes me want to buy the stream

4014
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I might

4015
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
He's probably listening

4016
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Maybe I'll buy it for Allen

4017
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
If they have an Overwatch

4018
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Because he plays a lot of Overwatch

4019
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
So I think Allen would really appreciate it

4020
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
They do have a Bastion skin

4021
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Do they? Well, he never plays Bastion

4022
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
So maybe I don't need to get it for him

4023
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
If you're interested in that virtual ticket

4024
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
$40 gets you the concert

4025
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
As well as the panels and the rest of the show

4026
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I mean, it's cheaper than a concert ticket

4027
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Oh no, that's next weekend, isn't it?

4028
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Yeah, November 4th

4029
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
It's not Veterans Day weekend

4030
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Like it usually is, it's the weekend before

4031
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
So that's pretty cool

4032
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I'm excited, yay Weird Al

4033
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
And what a great choice there

4034
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I hope the concert blows the roof off

4035
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
And Blizzard goes, we should do more music like this

4036
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
In the future

4037
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Anyhow, so here we are towards the end of the show

4038
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
And usually the phrase

4039
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Would be something a little different

4040
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
But I think tonight we should best say

4041
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Last and certainly least

4042
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
We have a story

4043
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
About

4044
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Uwe Boll

4045
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Remember him? Do you remember Uwe Boll?

4046
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Isn't he the guy who did the lawsuit over Kadabra?

4047
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Or no, that's Yuri Geller

4048
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
No, no

4049
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
No, you think he's somebody else

4050
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Uwe Boll was the great

4051
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Director

4052
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Of video game movies

4053
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Such as House of the Dead

4054
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Alone in the Dark

4055
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Postal

4056
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
BloodRayne

4057
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Name of the King, a dungeon siege tale

4058
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Well folks, it was announced this week

4059
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
That Uwe Boll

4060
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Is retiring from

4061
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Filmmaking, that's right

4062
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
He's chosen to retire from the film industry

4063
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Because, shock of shocks

4064
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
He was no longer making money from it

4065
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Can't imagine why

4066
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Actually he was saying that he was

4067
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Losing capital financing his movies

4068
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Himself, in a quote he said

4069
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
The market is dead

4070
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
You don't make any money anymore on movies

4071
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Because the DVD and Blu-ray market

4072
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Worldwide has dropped 80%

4073
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
In the last three years

4074
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
That is the real reason I just cannot

4075
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Afford to make movies

4076
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Well

4077
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Yeah, you can't

4078
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Uwe Boll

4079
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
You could sell your movies to Netflix

4080
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Or Amazon or Hulu

4081
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
If they were any fucking good

4082
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
At all

4083
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
But that's the part that's missing

4084
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Is these movies

4085
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Are

4086
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Shit

4087
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
They're really bad

4088
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Unfortunately

4089
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I think there's a Roku app for that

4090
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I kind of want a movie app called Shitflix

4091
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
That's just like really bad movies

4092
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I'm pretty sure there's like

4093
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Gonna be like pornos called that

4094
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Uh oh

4095
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Well no, I like that though

4096
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
No, I like that like really bad B movies

4097
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
There's a lot of interesting

4098
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Apps on the Roku that are

4099
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
You know, have to do with films and stuff

4100
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
There might be just like an equivalent of the Razzie

4101
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
You know like

4102
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Anyway, Uwe Boll

4103
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Continued to rant saying

4104
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I've been using my money since 2005

4105
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
And if I hadn't made this stupid video game

4106
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Based movies, I would never

4107
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Have amalgamated the capital

4108
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
So I could say, let's make the Darfur movie

4109
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I don't need a Ferrari, I don't need a yacht

4110
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'm invested in my own movies and I

4111
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Lost money

4112
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
By the way, he has one more film coming out

4113
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
It's his final director effort

4114
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
It's called Rampage, President Down

4115
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Please tell me that's not based on

4116
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I hope it isn't, please

4117
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Please

4118
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
That would be an interesting game to turn into a movie

4119
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Well, Uwe Boll

4120
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I got two words for you

4121
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Bye Felicia

4122
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Now you gotta find out about this

4123
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Rampage

4124
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Rageinator in chat says

4125
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
In fairness, his movies

4126
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
They have a trailer, it looks generic

4127
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
In fairness, his movies have to improve

4128
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Dramatically to qualify as shit

4129
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
You insulted shit movies everywhere

4130
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I apologize

4131
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I apologize deeply

4132
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
You gotta love the

4133
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Tagline

4134
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
This bill will not be vetoed

4135
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Really?

4136
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
That's just bad

4137
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
For some reason I hear Arnold Schwarzenegger in my mind

4138
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Saying that line

4139
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Not to be vetoed

4140
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Do not veto it

4141
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Who stars in this movie?

4142
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I use my quote

4143
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Who's starring in this movie?

4144
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Who's featured?

4145
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Yeah, I was trying to read the plot here

4146
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Bill Williamson is back

4147
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Alive and well

4148
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I guess this is a sequel to something

4149
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
So his name is actually William Williamson?

4150
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Hey, wait a minute

4151
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Don't make fun of him

4152
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Don't make fun of him

4153
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Yes, Bill Williamson is back

4154
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
and alive and well

4155
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Doing a recon mission around DC this time

4156
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
This time he wants to cause

4157
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
major population disruption

4158
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
within the USA

4159
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
which will result in a devastating consequence

4160
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
reverberating

4161
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
throughout the world

4162
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
His new mission this time is to bring down

4163
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
the president of the United States

4164
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
and his secret service detail

4165
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Bill brings with him

4166
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
an all freakin'

4167
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
havoc and acidity

4168
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
This is a third

4169
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
of a series of movies?

4170
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
It sounds so generic

4171
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
There's like no plot to it

4172
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Guy goes after president

4173
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Bill Bill Bill goes after president

4174
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
And it's like Sharknado

4175
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
will make more money

4176
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Now that's a good shit movie

4177
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Because it's not a generic movie

4178
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
It's just over the top

4179
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
This isn't over the top

4180
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
This is like, crap

4181
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
If it was like, yes

4182
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
and Bill Williamson is coming back

4183
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
with his, you know

4184
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
cannon or something like that that fires live sharks

4185
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
William Williamson

4186
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
and Rob Roberts

4187
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
You should do like a Saints Row movie

4188
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Just make it, well actually they should just

4189
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
do a Saints Row movie would be fantastic

4190
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
You need to find your third co-star

4191
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
John Johnson

4192
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Right? Right? I do need to

4193
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
But yeah, this is starring

4194
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and I have no

4195
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I honestly do not recognize

4196
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
any of the names on this

4197
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
but we've got

4198
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Is there anybody that

4199
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
No

4200
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
There's no names

4201
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Bill Williamson is played by Brendan Fletcher

4202
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
And we've got Bruce

4203
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Blaine, Loretta Walsh

4204
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Zane McG-

4205
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Okay, I don't even fucking know

4206
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
None of these people

4207
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
These are the actors

4208
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line

4209
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Save us from a Nuevo film discussion please

4210
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype

4211
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
If you want to give us a call

4212
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
We can talk about anything that we've discussed so far

4213
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Or perhaps

4214
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
You have something new you'd like to discuss

4215
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

4216
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
on Skype

4217
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
While we wait for some calls to come in

4218
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Loki, do you have anything, last minute story you want to discuss here?

4219
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Oh goodie, Uwe Boll plays a part in the movie himself

4220
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
He is Rampage Killer number two

4221
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Because he's just like Alfred Hitchcock

4222
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Just like him

4223
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
He's just like M. Night Shyamalan

4224
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Just like him

4225
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Just like him, exactly

4226
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Remember when Lady in the Water was like

4227
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
If that was like watching M. Night Shyamalan

4228
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Blow himself on it

4229
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
It was so bad too

4230
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Because all the other movies were pretty good

4231
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
It's like, oh man, I wonder what this is going to be like

4232
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Oh man, this is so fucking terrible

4233
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Actually, I think, wasn't the village before that?

4234
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
The village was before that

4235
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I thought the village was okay to me

4236
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
I did not hate the village

4237
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I didn't like the village

4238
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Lady in the Water and then The Happening

4239
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
The Happening was so bad

4240
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Oh and The Visit was so bad

4241
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I mean, the village and The Sixth Sense

4242
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Are the only two Shyamalan movies I've seen

4243
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
So maybe that affects my opinion

4244
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
A lot of people liked Signs

4245
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
The ending kind of made people go

4246
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Like literally, fuck you

4247
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Signs could have been so much better than what it was

4248
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Unbreakable was pretty good though

4249
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Oh yeah, Unbreakable was great

4250
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
That was a great movie

4251
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
The ending for that was probably one of the best

4252
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Out of any of his movies, that was a great twist ending

4253
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
So, anyway

4254
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Orange Lawns Radio, all one word on Skype

4255
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
If you want to give us a call

4256
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Any last minute stories here?

4257
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
No, slow

4258
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Slow news week

4259
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
It's slow. Alright, well you know

4260
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Things are so slow around here, I think we should

4261
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Probably take a moment

4262
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
To do a little bit of ranting

4263
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
You know, because I think we missed this last week

4264
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
So, I'm going to take an opportunity to do

4265
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
The FUs of the week

4266
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
So with that

4267
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Here is justice

4268
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Here is punishment

4269
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Here is

4270
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
This is fucked up

4271
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Loki

4272
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
My FUs week goes to Microsoft

4273
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
For their wonderful Windows 10 updates

4274
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Because all that happened

4275
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
During the week I was awake

4276
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I was ready to work on my game

4277
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
There was an update that needed to be done

4278
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I was like, damn, I'll just do the update real fast

4279
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
And then be done with it

4280
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
And on top of that it screwed up my touchpad again

4281
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Trying to install some sort of driver's port

4282
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
That don't really work with it

4283
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
And it's still not quite right

4284
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Even after I uninstalled it

4285
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
It's just very twitchy now

4286
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Thanks a lot

4287
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Shane, do you have any FUs you'd like to get out

4288
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Of the system?

4289
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
FU to Walgreens for not having

4290
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
The Power Ranger toys I want

4291
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Same with you, Target

4292
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
But otherwise, no

4293
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
My FU of the week goes to Shane

4294
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
For calling me fat

4295
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
There's a whole story behind it

4296
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And I didn't do it on the show

4297
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
But I'm going to before it's over

4298
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
And I'll find a way

4299
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Shane called me fat today

4300
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
No, because you implied you were

4301
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
And I was like, I didn't say that

4302
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
And you kept pushing me

4303
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
So I was like, okay then, you're fat

4304
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
JD, do you have an FU of the week?

4305
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
The cost of airfare

4306
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I found out I need to fly back to Florida

4307
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
And that's the worst time

4308
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
The worst time to go

4309
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
That you need to go

4310
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
FU to that

4311
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
FU to airfare

4312
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
It sucks

4313
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Alright

4314
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Well, we've got one call coming in

4315
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Let's get to it

4316
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountains Radio, who's this?

4317
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Hi, this is Ragingator

4318
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Hi Ragingator, what's on your mind tonight?

4319
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Just two questions

4320
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Unfortunately, they're probably going to entail

4321
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
answers

4322
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Well, no

4323
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I know it's a little bit early for this

4324
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
But since

4325
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
it's just a matter of a few weeks away

4326
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Obviously

4327
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Thanksgiving

4328
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
is coming up, which means Black Friday

4329
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
and sales and whatnot

4330
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And chances are

4331
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
all the major retailers are going to

4332
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
be having their sales

4333
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Plus, obviously, Steam

4334
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
That being said, are there any

4335
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
names that you folks are looking

4336
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
forward to picking up if they

4337
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
go on sale? Anything you have your eyes

4338
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
on during a Black Friday sale

4339
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
You know, since Shane can't

4340
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
find three games for me to buy during

4341
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
a Target sale that's going on right now

4342
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
I don't know about a Black Friday sale I found them, you just didn't want them

4343
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I don't know why Well, you know

4344
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
as far as Steam goes, there's always

4345
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
something that suckers me in on a Steam sale

4346
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
And I gotta say, Valve is pretty genius for

4347
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
building in that wishlist thing

4348
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
I love it when they email me when a wishlist

4349
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
thing goes on sale I love it and I hate it

4350
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
because they'll go, an item on your wishlist is on sale

4351
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
and then I'll be like, oh fuck, it's only

4352
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
99 cents bought, and then I just bought

4353
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
70 games for 99 cents a piece

4354
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
So, I love it

4355
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
and I hate it, but the honest answer is

4356
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
probably some of the stuff that's on my wishlist

4357
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
which oftentimes is stuff

4358
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I already own on console, but it's like

4359
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I want it on PC as well

4360
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Sometimes you want the best

4361
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
of both worlds, right? I'm hoping

4362
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
3DSs go on sale because I don't have

4363
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
one, and I'd love to pick one up

4364
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Yeah, there'll be a deal

4365
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
if not 2DS, there might be a 2DS sale

4366
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Well, I don't want a 2DS

4367
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
You might luck out, there might be a 3DS sale

4368
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
but I wouldn't expect to get Pokemon Sun and Moon on a discount

4369
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
I'm not expecting a game that came out a week before

4370
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
to be on sale, no

4371
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Well, sometimes they'll do

4372
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
like, buy the game

4373
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
and get a $10 gift card

4374
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
or something, sometimes they do that

4375
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
that's like the little enhanced thing

4376
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I want VR games

4377
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I want more VR games

4378
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
for my PS4, that'd be great

4379
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
to see some of those that I have

4380
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
a pretty solid interest in

4381
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
to drop to even lower

4382
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
That'd be very cool

4383
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Loki, anything you're gonna have your eyes on for Black Friday?

4384
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Not really, because I have so much stuff in my

4385
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
backlog now, it's just

4386
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I don't know, hopefully they drop some of the prices

4387
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
of those PlayStation VR games

4388
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
but even right now, even looking

4389
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
at what's coming out later on

4390
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
there's not really anything on the horizon

4391
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
except for in December, I think there's some rollercoaster

4392
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
game that's coming out that might be interesting

4393
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
but that's kind of it

4394
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that came out apparently

4395
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
at launch, but

4396
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
It's mostly digital too, though

4397
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
It's just kind of not

4398
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
a lot of stuff I really want to pick up

4399
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
it's kind of a lull right now, I guess

4400
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
AkumaJP has another example

4401
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
of a sale that happens

4402
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
AkumaJP suggests, buy a 3DS and get

4403
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
50% off a new game

4404
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
they do those types of things as well

4405
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
that's when I bought my Xbox One

4406
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
that's what finally broke me, is they did buy an Xbox One

4407
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
get a free game, so I got

4408
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Forza Horizon 2 at the time

4409
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
so that's what finally broke me on an Xbox One

4410
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
so anyway, there you go

4411
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Rage Nator, I think for a lot of us, we kind of have to see

4412
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
what's on the table first, and then we go

4413
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
ooh, that's an attractive idea, we'll see

4414
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I don't know, what was your other question?

4415
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
You said you had a second question

4416
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Well, since you folks

4417
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
brought up GameStopper

4418
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
and

4419
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
obviously GameStopper is universally

4420
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
hated, pretty much

4421
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
that, I would like

4422
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
to take my question

4423
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
in a different route

4424
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
is there

4425
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
a traditional brick and mortar store

4426
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
that you folks

4427
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
used to, at one point or another

4428
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
really used to love going to

4429
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
for your games and other

4430
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
entertainment?

4431
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Great question, is there a brick and mortar store

4432
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
that maybe is gone, or maybe it's still there

4433
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
but maybe a brick and mortar store

4434
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
that you would go to for your games

4435
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
that was fun, for me

4436
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
it was Software, etc. and then GameStop

4437
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
bought them, was the problem

4438
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I thought that was the other way around

4439
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
was the other way around, yeah, because EB Games got bought

4440
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
by GameStop, I just remember

4441
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
back in the day, when Software, etc. was the place

4442
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
where I got a service

4443
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Software, etc., Babbage's

4444
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
and then I think Electronics Boutique

4445
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
was another, all those stores, but they all

4446
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
got bought by GameStop, even if it is the same

4447
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
company now, like it was

4448
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
different 20 years ago, it was much different

4449
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
20 years ago, that was before the age of pre-ordering

4450
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
or when you would

4451
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
sign up on a list to get a

4452
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
phone call the day it comes out, and they would

4453
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
just hold it for you, I think was the thing

4454
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
I remember that was the thing

4455
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I used to do pre-orders over the phone

4456
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
yeah, it was like much different then

4457
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
so, yeah, I remember certainly for those

4458
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
what about JD? When I was a kid

4459
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I actually looked in the phone book for

4460
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
video game stores, because, I mean

4461
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
yeah, there were chains in malls and stuff, but I found

4462
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
some pretty neat, like small

4463
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
independent used game stores, and I

4464
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
missed those, because they're not really around anymore

4465
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
there was one in Orlando that

4466
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I liked, and

4467
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
even in San Francisco, I moved there in

4468
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
2009, and there was one on Powell

4469
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
in North Beach, and I think it closed

4470
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
a couple years after I moved, so I

4471
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
missed those

4472
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
and you know, I miss, and

4473
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Shane, I know you're going to like this answer too

4474
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I miss the retro

4475
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Toys R Us

4476
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
oh, okay, you said retro, I was like, oh where is this going, but Toys R Us

4477
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
the retro Toys R Us, where you would actually have the

4478
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
pull tags, and you'd have to pull the tag

4479
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
and then they'd get it for you up front, and that's

4480
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
where we used to get, like, that's where my family always got

4481
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
conversation, we need to make another trip to the

4482
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Toys R Us set time for God, because the Chico

4483
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Toys R Us still has pull tags

4484
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
and that whole system, I was like, oh my

4485
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
gosh, is Chico stuck in 1993?

4486
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
probably, as somebody

4487
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
who lived there in 1996

4488
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
yes, it probably is still stuck there

4489
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
but anyway, yeah

4490
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I like Toys R Us back in the day

4491
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
that's where my family got all the Commodore 64 games

4492
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
but a lot of these stores just kind of

4493
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
changed over the years, you know, it's just

4494
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
different now, online also really really

4495
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
changed the game, it really really did

4496
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Loki, any quick memories you want to share

4497
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
real quick?

4498
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
places I used to buy games, it was pretty much like

4499
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
software, etc, I think

4500
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
was the local store I used to go

4501
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
to

4502
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
honestly, back when I was

4503
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
purchasing games from stores like that

4504
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
well, console games

4505
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
console games would pretty much be

4506
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
wherever I'd go to, like Walmarts

4507
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
and stuff like that

4508
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
actual PC games, I used to

4509
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
buy a lot of shareware, and they

4510
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
used to have those kiosks everywhere

4511
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
used to buy dead shareware disks

4512
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
at my local video store

4513
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
and used to pick up demos all the time

4514
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
oh yeah, the old school computer

4515
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
shops, yes

4516
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
I used to get

4517
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
wherever, or you even go to the computer show and sale

4518
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
and stuff like that

4519
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I don't know if they still do that

4520
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
no, not anymore, like that was the huge one they do at

4521
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Cal Expo, right?

4522
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
all sorts of legitimate things

4523
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
now it's shoes

4524
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
so, Rage Nator, it sounds like you had a

4525
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
quick story before we let you go

4526
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
well, I was

4527
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
going to say that

4528
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
it's kind of hard for you guys to relate

4529
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
because you're out in California

4530
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
you don't know

4531
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
in the Buffalo area

4532
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
but out in

4533
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
one of the local burbs

4534
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
in the Buffalo area

4535
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
which is called

4536
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Amherst

4537
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
there's a plaza

4538
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
they're called the T.G. Max

4539
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Plaza, obviously because

4540
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
T.G. Max is in there

4541
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
but back in the 90's

4542
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I used to love going there

4543
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
because they had Toys R Us

4544
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
there, like what you were

4545
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
mentioning, they had the pull tabs and all that

4546
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
I used to love buying my games there

4547
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
when I started buying games on my own

4548
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
and right

4549
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
within the same plaza

4550
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I used to love going to media play

4551
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
yeah

4552
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I mean

4553
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
yeah, they had the video games

4554
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
there, but aside from that they had

4555
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
everything else there that

4556
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
I could possibly want

4557
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
music, movies

4558
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
posters, you name it

4559
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
we had the

4560
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
gathering cards

4561
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
that place was heaven, I swear to god

4562
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
there was times

4563
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
that on the weekend

4564
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I would be there literally all

4565
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
day to the point where

4566
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
I was there until clearly closing

4567
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
and they had to kick me out

4568
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
sounds like a fun place, but I will say this

4569
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
even though we are all the way

4570
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
in California, we have T.G. Max

4571
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
out here as well, and there's a T.G. Max Plaza

4572
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
here, and that's where the Mongolian barbecue

4573
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
is, so we

4574
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
have our own T.G. Max Plaza that we go

4575
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
to, so there's that

4576
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I also miss CompUSA, they had

4577
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
a computer lab set up to demo

4578
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
their games, and I played the logical

4579
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
journey of the Zoombinis there a bunch

4580
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
that was the early PC days

4581
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
and my brother and I

4582
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
would sit there on the computers and just play games

4583
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
until they were done, I feel like the first time I ever

4584
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
played the Castle of Dr. Brain was that

4585
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I love that series, right?

4586
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
oh my god, yes

4587
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
alright, I'm going to let you go

4588
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
but thanks so much for the call

4589
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
thanks for the trip down memory lane

4590
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
later, alright

4591
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Orange Launch Radio, one word on Skype

4592
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
if you want to try to get in, although I didn't see any other calls

4593
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
coming in, so I don't know, it might be a quiet night tonight

4594
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
but I'll give it a couple minutes just in case

4595
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
yeah, trip down memory lane

4596
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
good times, that CompUSA

4597
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
building here in SAC

4598
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
still, still no new tenant

4599
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
it's still just empty

4600
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I think I finally saw a sign

4601
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
that they were going to turn it into some event center

4602
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
or something, but it's kind of sad

4603
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
that CompUSA building has been empty forever

4604
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I mean, they went out of business a long time ago

4605
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
but nothing will beat

4606
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
the sign that still is up

4607
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
that says Circuit City

4608
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
oh, those things are ghost towns

4609
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
there is still a sign that says Circuit City, which is funny

4610
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
because the store did convert

4611
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
it was, I want to say

4612
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
it was a Good Guys for a short minute

4613
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
when they were still around, then they went under

4614
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
and then it was, it's a wine store now

4615
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
it's nothing but wine

4616
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
yeah, no, it's a great conversion

4617
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
but it's still, for some reason

4618
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
the sign in the front says Total Wine

4619
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
or whatever the name of the store is, but the sign in the back

4620
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
still says Circuit City

4621
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
it's crazy

4622
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
alright, we got one more call coming in, then we'll wrap it up

4623
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

4624
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
hey, what's going on everybody, it's Ranma

4625
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
hey Ranma buddy, how you doing?

4626
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
nostalgic

4627
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
right, in fact I brought up Circuit City and that was another place we used to go check out

4628
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
like games and stuff at, but anyway, what's on your mind buddy?

4629
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
I want to back up what Rage Nator said

4630
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
because I remember growing up

4631
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
in my small little town

4632
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
it was like this one little store

4633
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
called Weekend Gifts where I would buy all of my

4634
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
video games from, because I wasn't

4635
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
really allowed to travel outside of the town

4636
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
and there were a couple other stores

4637
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
back and forth I'd get my games from

4638
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
and then, what usually

4639
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
sucked because it's a smaller store

4640
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
games were a little bit more expensive

4641
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
yeah

4642
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
when I got into high school and I had a bus pass

4643
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I traveled from point A to point B

4644
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I discovered software, etc

4645
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Circuit City

4646
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
and sales

4647
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
and sales

4648
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
yes, I was so excited

4649
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
like it wasn't that long ago, because Alan

4650
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
and I, well I guess Alan and I have been together a while

4651
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
now, but it was probably about five years ago, Alan and I

4652
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
took a road trip to Oregon

4653
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
it was about five years ago, and we stopped

4654
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
at a mall in, I want to

4655
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
say it was Ashland, where we

4656
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
stopped, we stopped at a mall in Ashland

4657
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
to like eat or whatever, and in the mall

4658
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
they had a GameStop, and

4659
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
a software, etc

4660
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
they still had a fucking software, etc

4661
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
and bonus, there's

4662
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
no sales tax in Oregon

4663
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
so I was like, alright, fuck it, I'm gonna go

4664
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
buy a game here, just so I can have

4665
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
say I shopped the software, etc while I was

4666
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
here, and I actually had a receipt

4667
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
I don't know if it's still, it's probably long closed

4668
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
this was a good five, six years ago, but

4669
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
sorry, I just had to bring that up, because that

4670
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
was a nostalgia trip for me, that that was still open

4671
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
like in the year 2010,

4672
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
2011, it was awesome

4673
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
brother, let me tell you

4674
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
if memory serves me correctly

4675
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I still have friends that live up in my

4676
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
in the towns, in the areas

4677
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
I used to hang out in, the town over

4678
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
where the software, etc it was

4679
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
from my understanding

4680
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
to this day, it's

4681
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
still a software, etc

4682
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
rad, although

4683
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
it's funny that we're reminiscing, because there

4684
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
literally is no difference between software, etc and GameStop

4685
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
now, like it's really just the

4686
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
logo and all the purple, is the only thing

4687
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
that differentiates them at this point, so

4688
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
but, I don't know, there's just something

4689
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
about it, there's something about it

4690
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
true, but you know what

4691
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
my thing was, I just loved

4692
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I just like funko way, and you go

4693
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
in every month, you get like this

4694
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
this newspaper of all the sale

4695
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
prices, and you knew what they had

4696
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
and they had these cool demos up

4697
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
and it was like, they

4698
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
only carried the popular games

4699
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
so, what they didn't have, you had to

4700
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
run over to Toys R Us

4701
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
or software, etc, or at the

4702
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
time, if you really wanted to do it,

4703
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
KB Toys, to get those games

4704
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
because KB was the spot

4705
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
where I used to get my Master System games

4706
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
My Atari 2600 games came

4707
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
from KB Toys, that was old school

4708
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
I think I bought my first Game Boy Color at KB Toys

4709
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Yeah, wow, they didn't

4710
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
last long past

4711
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
the Nintendo 64 era, right?

4712
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
They were, they went

4713
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
under a long time ago, anyway

4714
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Alright, good times

4715
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
good memories, so

4716
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
yeah, lots of

4717
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
stores that are unfortunately long gone

4718
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Where do you buy your games now?

4719
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Um

4720
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
I actually buy my games from

4721
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
either Micro Center

4722
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
or Best Buy

4723
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
or Nintendo World

4724
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
If I have to go to New York City

4725
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
I kind of bless myself

4726
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
before walking in, so that I

4727
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
don't have a stroke talking to these

4728
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
people about a particular game I'm looking for

4729
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
or something like that

4730
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Since you're in New York City, you can just go straight to the

4731
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
30 Rock Nintendo store and

4732
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
get it from the stores, that's pretty awesome

4733
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Yeah, and then I can go upstairs and play

4734
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Star Fox on the Wii U on a big ass

4735
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
250 inch screen

4736
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
That's the life, the life

4737
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
of New York City, but you pay a premium to live there

4738
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
just kidding

4739
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Sky, you have no idea

4740
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I have some idea

4741
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Yeah, keep in mind, our buddy

4742
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
JD here is from San Francisco, we get

4743
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
near full from our friends over there, so

4744
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
we have some idea

4745
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
I'm just thankful they didn't hike up my rent

4746
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
this year, because my place

4747
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
is about the size

4748
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
of the old studio

4749
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
of what I came to visit

4750
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
that time

4751
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Which is small

4752
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Does New York have rent control?

4753
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Oh, New York has rent control, but when you're living somewhere

4754
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
and you're paying month to month

4755
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
because you need to rent out the basement

4756
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
it gets a little tricky

4757
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
At least

4758
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Squatter's rights are on my side

4759
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we wrap up

4760
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
the show, thanks for the call and the memories

4761
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Alright, Rob, one more thing

4762
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Stay fabulous, brother

4763
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Always, always, stay black

4764
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
I try

4765
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Work on it, alright, take care

4766
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Bye

4767
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight

4768
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
If you didn't get through, you should email us

4769
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
or participate at orangeloungeradio.com

4770
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
That is

4771
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
gonna wrap it up for another episode of

4772
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4773
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Hey, Shane, thanks for being here tonight in studio

4774
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
I'm sure you had a great time

4775
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
as always. Did you catch any Pokemon during

4776
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
the show? I'm not catching anything right now

4777
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I'm working through the story

4778
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry about that

4779
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
He needs a ditto

4780
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Did you not pay attention earlier?

4781
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Is it because you're too fat?

4782
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Worked it in! Yay!

4783
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Rude and unnecessary

4784
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Uh, JD, thanks for being here

4785
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I hope you had fun. Was it fun being

4786
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
in the studio? Absolutely

4787
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
What do people out there need to know about the way

4788
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
OLR really works?

4789
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Oh, man

4790
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Um, I don't know if there's anything

4791
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I can share

4792
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
It's all a secret

4793
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Alright, you'll just have to come find out for yourself

4794
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Alright, anything you're here to plug

4795
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
You don't really have a show or anything

4796
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Do you have a blog, a Twitter

4797
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Or something that people should follow

4798
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Twitter is probably the best place to find me

4799
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
If you want to know more

4800
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
I retweet a lot of stuff

4801
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Sometimes it's politics, sometimes it's ash

4802
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Or not ash, it's red and blue in fan art

4803
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Who knows what, you'll be fine

4804
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
And your Twitter account is?

4805
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
jai underscore d-i-t

4806
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
It's jaydee from French

4807
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
That's how you say it!

4808
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
So it's French for I have said

4809
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
But it's also my name

4810
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Because puns are very central to me

4811
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
I remember the first week I was like

4812
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Is it jaydee? What is it?

4813
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Oh, it's jaydee, it's his name, I get it

4814
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
I'm looking right now for this fan art

4815
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
I'm not seeing it

4816
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Because I have to compare to see if I have any of it

4817
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Alright, uh

4818
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Any final thoughts to leave with our listeners tonight?

4819
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
You know, I don't know if they're still around

4820
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
But For Your Entertainment used to have

4821
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
A DDR machine in the mall

4822
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
One of the malls in Orlando I went to

4823
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
I think a lot of those stores closed, sadly

4824
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
It was all part of the Suncoast

4825
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
That's another fun thing

4826
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
As always, I just want to say

4827
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Thank you for listening to Orange Lawns Radio

4829

4830
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000

02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
On the show next week

4834
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
A nice five star review wherever you found this show

4835
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Like iTunes or Google Play

4836
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Will go a long way in helping us with discovery

4837
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
We really appreciate each and every

4838
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Five star review

4839
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
And my final thought tonight is

4840
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
I'm glad I got capped for tomes on Final Fantasy 14 already

4841
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
So I don't have to play again tonight

4842
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I can play more Jackbox Party Pack or something else

4843
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Loki, last but not least my friend

4844
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Your final thought tonight

4845
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I get pizza tomorrow? I don't know

4846
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Pizza party!

4847
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Fortunately I have to watch a

4848
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
You know

4849
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
I'm gonna call a keynote

4850
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I'm gonna get a presentation from our CEO

4851
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Well good luck with that

4852
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
But at least I get pizza

4853
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Good luck with that

4854
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Happy Halloween everybody

4855
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Be safe, don't be a fool

4856
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
But I think most of you probably already finished your celebrating

4857
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
I was gonna say it wasn't a Halloween thing

4858
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
And I almost did this too

4859
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
But I totally want to make some of those Borderlands pants

4860
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
That they have

4861
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Have you seen those?

4862
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Where they paint them so they look cel shaded?

4863
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
I would just wear those regularly

4864
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

4865
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Have a good Halloween, we will see you in 7 days

4866
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
BlizzCon

4867
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
So we know we'll get a lot of PC gaming news

4868
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Happening this coming weekend, so that to look forward to

4869
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
So we'll see you in 7 days to talk all about it

4870
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
And whatever else is going on in the gaming world

4871
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Have a good one everybody, good night!

4872
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:28,000
It's at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern

4873
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000

4874

Or VOG Network

4877
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
But you know they were all still true

4878
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
See you next week

4879
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Thanks for watching!
