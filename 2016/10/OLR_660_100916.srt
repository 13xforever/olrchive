With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This week, we're back from another round of conventions as we wind down the year, and

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,440
how better than to come back to the imminent release of PlayStation VR with a healthy lineup

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
of launch titles.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,480
We'll give you the wrap-up and the rundown of this and plenty more news, and it all starts

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,500
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,740
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,420
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,820
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 660 for this October the 9th

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,700
of 2016.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,420
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live here from Sacramento, California, where we are

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,360
headquartered and here with me in studio as he is every week.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,100
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
Hello.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
How are you?

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
I'm good.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Good.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,100
I heard your Twitter got hacked today.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
What's up with that?

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,100
I don't know.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,100
That was weird.

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,420
Yeah, there's some account posted on my thing, and I was notified about it like a few minutes

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,420
later.

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,420
What were they spamming?

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,420
I don't know.

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,180
It was like trying to lure someone to click the link with sexy pictures, but honestly,

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,060
from my standards, it wasn't sexy enough.

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,500
There was no boobies there.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,300
I mean, there is lingerie and that's classy, I guess, but I'm not classy guy.

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,420
So you know, if someone's going to hack it, then I better see like full frontal.

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
Come on.

34
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,440
You wasted all this time to hack the password or something.

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,140
And this is what you put up there.

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,140
Come on.

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,140
Don't waste my time.

38
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,020
I mean, that's just it's stupid.

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,020
But you you were on it and you fixed it, but that's you said you had to factor off on your

40
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
account, right?

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,020
Yeah, I had it.

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,060
I turn it on whenever they add stuff like to the social networks, I always turn on like

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,540
day one, like or whenever I first hear about it, that that's supposed to make your account

44
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,620
like an iron fortress.

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,620
So that right.

46
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,060
And well, it was weird, though, because when I went to go and change the password, it was

47
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
off.

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,060
Two Factor was off.

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,360
So I was like, well, weird.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,120
So they could, you know, most of the time with these Twitter hacks is that these just

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,420
social engineering or they even go to the extent of like cloning your phone and logging

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,580
in with your mobile, which they didn't do that with mine, because why would you do that

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,580
with mine?

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,580
Really?

55
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,980
I mean, come on.

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
That's just stupid.

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,500
But yeah, I saw a log in attempt also on the VOG Minecraft one as well, which is also that

58
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,420
would just be absolutely pointless since I don't use it anymore.

59
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,900
So who cares?

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
All right.

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,260
Well, I'm glad you got everything fixed on your account and you took down the not so

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,100
sexy pictures that somebody posted.

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Yeah.

64
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
I, you know, it was disappointing.

65
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,660
I mean, just.

66
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Yeah.

67
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,860
Oh, anyway, not here tonight, of course, still on a break from the show Dark Sakura, but

68
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,220
we will be hearing from her later and during our classic game of the week, thanks to the

69
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,900
magic of radio, Dark Sakura should be joining us.

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,680
We're hoping she's going to be able to join us for a tape show in November.

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,740
So still a little ways out, but we miss Dark Sakura, but thankful she can still be on the

72
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,920
show, at least in part through the classic game of the week.

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,620
Coming up tonight on the show, we have an interview.

74
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,840
Very excited to welcome Ryan from Retro Dreamer Studios, which is making the game Monsters

75
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,160
and Monocles available right now on Steam Greenlight.

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,060
Loki and I played this game like for the first time a couple of years ago.

77
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Yeah, a couple of years ago.

78
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Yeah.

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
One of the SAC Indie arcade events.

80
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,500
But this is, you know, and you might think, oh, Indie game means, you know, I'm not going

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,180
to see a lot of it out there, but that's quite not the case with this game.

82
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,340
I mean, not only is it on the Steam early access, but they have announced they're going

83
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,540
to be on PlayStation four as well.

84
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,500
And there's a lovely cut trailer that PlayStation has on the official channel and everything

85
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
coverage on it.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah.

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
The media and stuff.

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
And so it looks, I mean, it's a good game.

89
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,860
It was good a couple of years ago, so excited to welcome Ryan here live in about 20 minutes

90
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
or so.

91
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,100
And if you guys have played the game and have any questions, or if you haven't played the

92
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,380
game, you still have questions, you'll be, you'll be able to ask those live in our chat

93
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,520
room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

And if you are listening to our show, you can participate live, uh, with our chat room,

96

97
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,940
And if you guys could do me a favor tonight, I know there's a lot of stuff going on in

98
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,580
the real world outside this show.

99
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,220
Um, thank you guys for choosing to, uh, listen to OLR live tonight or in podcast form.

100
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,820
You know, I appreciate you every either way, but since I do have to read comments on the

101
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,940
fly, uh, try not to fill up the chat room with talk about politics tonight.

102
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,100
Uh, there's other, you go to Twitter politics, there's politics going on.

103
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,940
Don't worry about it.

104
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,980
Is the orange fair going to say some weird stuff again, because I'm totally down with

105
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,980
that.

106
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Here's, here's the thing.

107
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,500
Next week on, is it next week or the week after I've checked our calendar, but I think

108
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,060
it's next week on OLR.

109
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,420
We actually have cat president developers that game are on the show.

110
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,380
Uh, so, um, and I'll, I'll check the calendar during the break tonight and double check

111
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
the week.

112
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,760
Um, but politics will be permissible when we're talking about president cap.

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,020
That's the only time you can, uh, break that rule.

114
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
So thank you guys.

115
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,220
Uh, but we do have, uh, some on topic comments here in chat, uh, from Bobby Black Wolf saying,

116
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,160
uh, it might've been an authorized app that hacked.

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,380
So if you had like something tied to your Twitter, that was the next thing I was gonna

118
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,380
look at.

119
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,380
Right.

120
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Yeah.

121
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,760
I think it's always a good idea to clean that stuff out once in a while too.

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,920
And the biggest offenders are those fricking quiz apps like, and I don't know if you even

123
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,100
know I don't do that.

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,460
Some people do like the whole, what, which, which one of the mean girls are you?

125
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,660
If it did any of that, that would be Facebook because you know, that's where you're taking

126
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
quizzes.

127
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
I don't do that on Twitter.

128
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,300
Twitter is pretty lean, but some of that shows up on Twitter.

129
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,020
I know I've used some of those like track who follows and unfollows you on Twitter just

130
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,740
because you know, if a lot of times people follow to inflate their number account or

131
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,260
their, their follower numbers and they immediately unfollow.

132
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,420
So I do use one of those programs to kind of like catch those people cause I'm pretty

133
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,060
good about following people back.

134
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,920
If you're just a spam bot, I'm not interested in following celebrities.

135
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,100
Some celebrities that I like, you know, on TV and stuff, but if they post a lot or repost

136
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,580
or, you know, forward a lot, I kind of have to take them off.

137
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,780
And then going to another real world thing I want to address here real quick before we

138
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,980
get into some games.

139
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,180
Tiger Claw in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, the whole week with Hurricane

140
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,100
Matthew was uneventful for me.

141
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,980
You put on the hurricane shutters and anticipating the storm only to find out it never touched

142
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
down in South Florida.

143
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,300
I'm very thankful that didn't have an effect on you.

144
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,060
I really hope our listeners in Florida have similar stories to what you have.

145
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,660
So you know, I was thinking of y'all this week cause I know we've, we've got a few listeners

146
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,140
in Florida and that were in the area that could have potentially been impacted.

147
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,180
So I'm really, I'm hoping you all have stories like Tiger Claw out there.

148
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,860
So yeah, stay safe you guys.

149
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,020
So anyway, I think, I think we want to start off tonight by getting into some of the news

150
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,060
from last week that we missed, um, with our kickoff topic tonight.

151
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,140
First off though, let me just kind of ask Loki with no, with no show last week.

152
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,300
I mean, I'll talk about gamer X here in a minute, which is where I was at, but how was

153
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,220
your, how was your weekend off with no show last week?

154
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,700
It was never a weekend off, but it was just, um, I just went and played Ingress.

155
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,220
I was going to do something like normally like when I have a night off like that, I'll

156
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,980
try to go see a movie or something, but there wasn't anything good playing at all.

157
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,820
And it was just, no.

158
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,460
Um, so I decided that I was going to probably just play Ingress and I had actually more

159
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,500
than I wanted to do, um, but I just didn't get it done.

160
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,980
So I hung out with some of the people that are around here and, um, played a little bit

161
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,100
Ingress on my way home and that was it.

162
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,780
Surprisingly that went, the time went by really fast, so.

163
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Good deal.

164
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
But yeah.

165
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
Um, yeah.

166
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,300
Uh, well I was at gamer X, uh, this is the fourth year of gamer X. Dark Soccer was there

167
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
with me.

168
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,060
We were staffing the vog table, uh, cause we were a, uh, what do they call the intro

169
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,060
level sponsor?

170
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Like eight, eight bit sponsor.

171
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,340
I think we were, uh, voice East network was, so we were there.

172
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,940
Uh, also our pals, uh, captain spike and first make slide kick from game buoy were there.

173
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,420
X differ from guys on a show is there.

174
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,420
So there was, you know, a few shows on our network were represented there at gamer X.

175
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,740
Uh, and if anybody is listening to OLR for the first time, because they met us at the

176
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
table.

177
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Hello.

178
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
And thank you for checking it out.

179
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Really appreciate it.

180
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Um, real quick.

181
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,720
Our show was friends that came together.

182
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,520
We all used to play dance, dance revolution and music based games at the arcade.

183
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,960
And there was a real sense of community that was built around that.

184
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,400
So we kind of took that community outside the arcade onto the internet and that that's

185
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,380
the community that's kind of continuing today, even though we don't necessarily focus on

186
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,920
music games per se.

187
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,000
Um, we certainly, you know, still have a great love of video games in general, especially

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
niche things that other people miss out on.

189
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,500
Sometimes we really love here.

190
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,400
So that's, that's what all ours all about.

191
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,540
But uh, with gamer X, you know, um, gamer X is a smaller convention.

192
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,680
There's a big focus on panels.

193
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,560
They do a lot of panels on things like diversity and visibility and, you know, sometimes it's

194
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,240
about kind of justifying why there needs to be a gamer X sort of thing, which, you know,

195
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
I totally understand as a gay gamer myself, representation and all that is important.

196
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,440
It's really great to see people like yourself in video games.

197
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,400
And that's why it's great that we have all these video games to kind of let you, you

198
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
know, do, you know, Bioware games are infamous for this.

199
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,280
They kind of let you do the game that you want to do.

200
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Um, so they, they run a lot of panels and they also, it's not just that, but also kind

201
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,400
of encouraging people to develop because one of the great ways to have representation in

202
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,960
gaming is to encourage more minorities to develop, get out there, make a game.

203
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,440
Um, you know, it's, it's, I know I've had struggles of my own and making a game in the

204
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,240
past, but if I had the time to really sit down and do it, I could make a game.

205
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,920
Loki's been trying on and off over years to make it mentally, I've just not been able

206
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,360
to focus on anything.

207
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,200
It's really frustrating, but if Loki can do it, you can do it.

208
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,400
And so I'm trying, I'm, I just, there's, there's a really big theme about just trying to get

209
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,000
more minorities to participate in, uh, the game making process.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm not just talking about gays, I'm talking about, you know, non-binary individuals, transgender

211
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,160
individuals, um, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, you know, I'm talking about

212
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,640
like the gamer X is, uh, really speaks to, I think a lot of different minorities out

213
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
there.

214
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,280
Um, and you know, again, I hate that this has to be said, but I feel like it does.

215
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,680
The goal is not to eliminate the white man, the straight white man from video games.

216
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
That is not the goal.

217
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,760
Uh, the goal is to add more.

218
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
That's what it is.

219
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
You just, just add more.

220
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,960
So, um, yeah, I, I feel like it's always the first thing I hear when there's a, you know,

221
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,440
talk about gamer X is where's the straight white man game making expo.

222
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,920
And it's like, you're, you, you aren't unwelcome from gamer X.

223
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Um, they, you know, if you bought a ticket, you get in, um, and you, and you agree to

224
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,440
follow the rules about no harassment and all that stuff, which any con would have anyway.

225
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Back to the game.

226
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,680
So there's a lovely expo hall and we were in this hall and they had some bigger companies

227
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,280
where they're like Intel, which was doing this fun little like photo session.

228
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,640
And, uh, they had some indie games, uh, that were running on Intel hardware that you'd

229
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
see at their booth.

230
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,960
Oculus was there, which we talked about a little bit on last week's show, which was

231
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,000
in, or last time we did a show, which was interesting because of, you know, Oculus was

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,800
going through their own struggles in the news, um, a couple of weeks ago, but they were there

233
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,360
and they were showing off, um, you know, and I don't think any of the personalities with

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
Oculus were there.

235
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,760
Um, you know, you certainly weren't going to see Palmer lucky or Zuckerberg or anybody,

236
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,300
you know, they have their team that goes out and does these demos.

237
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,480
So they were there and, you know, so a lot of people got to try Oculus for the first

238
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
time, which was cool.

239
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
Um, let's see who else was like showing a game that was there.

240
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,080
Um, blizzard was doing their job recruitment thing again.

241
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,560
So, um, but there was a lot of indie developers to some of the same people I'd seen the year

242
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,500
before were coming back and they were either showing their game was about to be released

243
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,200
or they were working on a new game now and they were kind of showing that again.

244
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,280
So that was pretty cool.

245
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,160
But um, I had a really good time, you know, it's just, it's just, it's just a fun show

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,640
and a great crowd and it's just a very different vibe from a lot of other gaming expos.

247
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,160
Like actually something about gamer X just feels really relaxed and chill to me.

248
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,780
Like there's just something about it where I, it could just like, if I could just kind

249
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,160
of put my finger on why I really like a con like gamer X, they did a thing called the

250
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
gamer X slumber party on Friday night.

251
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,680
And all it was was they just took one of their tiny rooms and it was just a chill space.

252
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,560
It was just chill and I loved it because, and it was nothing, it's nothing disgusting

253
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,360
or dirty or awkward or anything like that.

254
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,540
It was just come hang out with nerds.

255
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,800
And some guy was like, I ordered pizza, there's pizza in the back if you want some.

256
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,840
And I actually met like a ton of new people just going to this thing and just chilling

257
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
out and everybody was just really cool.

258
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,800
And you know, the, we could instantly bond over nerdy things that we had in common.

259
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
And yeah, it was just kind of, I didn't really experience something like that at any of the

260
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
other cons I've been to, not to knock the other cons.

261
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,080
There's great things I take from every con, but that was something that felt very unique

262
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
to gamer X.

263
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,380
So yeah, it did a lot of great networking with that.

264
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,200
Big thanks to anyone that came out to our panel on Sunday.

265
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,120
We had kind of a smaller room so we couldn't fit a lot of people in there, but I had a

266
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,680
good time and I felt like the panel was well received by the group in there.

267
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,420
And there was a lot of people in there who weren't actually listeners of any of our shows.

268
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,560
They were just kind of curious about podcasting and all that and what it is.

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,980
So yeah, hope, hope some folks decided maybe they want to start their own show or, or enjoyed

270
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,980
what they heard here.

271
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,360
Um, so there was that.

272
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,640
And then, uh, gamer X teams up with magfest and they actually had a lot of classic games

273
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
there.

274
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,640
They had a whole little arcade with DDR and the star Wars arcade game.

275
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,160
I got to play a little bit.

276
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,320
And um, one night until they closed, cause they had to close convention center space

277
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
around midnight.

278
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
Um, I was playing super Mario world.

279
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
So you want to hear something funny completely off topic here.

280
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,880
Um, so I just realized, or found out the other day that they've opened a classic arcade in

281
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Sutter street.

282
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,440
You're locally in Folsom.

283
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Really?

284
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah.

285
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,840
Like classic, like old school, like a coin op type place, like a coin op type place.

286
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Hmm.

287
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
I thought that was weird.

288
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Yes.

289
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
It's like the Sutter street arcade or something like that.

290
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Huh?

291
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Check that out.

292
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Yeah.

293
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,240
I just told some friends to go to coin up this, man, retro games are making a comeback,

294
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
but that's, that's okay.

295
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Who doesn't love retro games?

296
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,840
I just thought it was interesting to see like an actual arcade opening up.

297
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Um, our pal Bobby Black Wolf is in chat saying, I forget there are people that still have

298
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,360
never heard of a podcast.

299
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Um, yeah, you know, there was a lot of people at gamer X.

300
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,940
I kind of ran into the same thing.

301
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,360
So I know, uh, Bobby was at siege, which was a, like a game developer conference type of

302
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,600
thing in Georgia.

303
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,040
He was there this weekend.

304
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,320
Um, and I was finding the same thing at gamer X.

305
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,660
I was kind of thinking in the back of my mind, like, well with NPR and stuff, everybody's

306
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,580
probably heard of a podcast by now, but no, I found there was a lot of people.

307
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,100
I was kind of having to explain it to like the concept of what it is and why we do it.

308
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,040
Um, for me, I find that a lot of people, and this is what's getting harder and harder.

309
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,860
A lot of people kind of want to know why would they listen to a podcast when they have YouTube

310
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,700
and Twitch these days, which is an interesting issue that our podcasting community is facing

311
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:22,540
because YouTube has videos that people recorded a while ago that you can watch as well, whereas

312
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,460
we record audio that you can listen to.

313
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Right.

314
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
And we're live.

315
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
We're fortunate enough to be live.

316
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,220
I mean, there's a lot of podcasts that aren't live that are still worth your time.

317
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,060
Um, but you know, I also kind of tried to solve the thing that sometimes you, you, you

318
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,820
can only have so many of your senses distracted.

319
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,700
Like when you're watching a YouTube or something like that, that's, that's typically all of

320
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,220
your senses being used at once.

321
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,000
But when you're doing a podcast, you can still, and I know I've had people say the weeks that

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,240
we don't do OLR, I'm bored Monday at work, which is a huge compliment to me.

323
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,880
Um, but they say, I'm, I listen to you guys at work while I'm doing my data entry job

324
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,920
or my, you know, coding job or whatever it is because they can look and think and type.

325
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,760
You know, it's just the podcast only takes one of their senses.

326
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,020
So that's, that's kind of one way I try to kind of put the podcasting out there is that

327
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:14,200
sometimes you can't completely devote yourself to entertainment, but you can be entertained

328
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
while you're doing other things.

329
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,360
That's like saying, why listen to the radio when you can watch videos on YouTube?

330
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Yeah, I know.

331
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
I know.

332
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Right.

333
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
But it was interesting.

334
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,560
But, um, I, I, you know, these are, it's, it's one of those things where like, these

335
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,360
are things that I wouldn't hear from our audience.

336
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,840
If I was only to listen to the feedback from the, from the, from our audience, none of

337
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,280
them are going to say, why should I listen to a podcast?

338
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Or what?

339
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Cause they're already listening to a podcast.

340
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Right.

341
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
So these are the things that I get to hear.

342
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,440
Cause you'll crash your car if you're watching a podcast.

343
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,920
So, uh, anyway, um, so yeah, uh, that was, that was gamer X.

344
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,240
Uh, it was a good time, but really chill three days.

345
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,700
The only kind of downside was that the last day, and they know this and there was really

346
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,480
nothing they could have done about it because they announced their expo long before the

347
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,860
NFL announced their schedule and the hotel where gamer X was at, was at the Hyatt, literally

348
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,800
across the street from Levi's stadium where they had the super bowl this year.

349
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,840
Uh, so now the 49ers play there and they were having their, I think it was their first game

350
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,320
there against the Cowboys.

351
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,880
Um, and I wouldn't have known that normally, but it was everywhere.

352
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,720
Uh, so, uh, they were playing their game there and I didn't realize how many people come

353
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,140
to the hotel across the street from the stadium to watch the game.

354
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,720
And so their bar was completely taken over by football people.

355
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Yeah.

356
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,960
I thought that was weird too.

357
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
You're almost there.

358
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Keep going.

359
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I don't know.

360
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,080
So I don't know, but it's like, I'm almost like I'm right there.

361
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Maybe so they can go home.

362
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,440
Maybe they can go join in the tailgate parties or something with the Niners loss.

363
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,360
So I don't know what parties tailgating would be nice.

364
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Yeah.

365
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,080
But anyway, uh, it was, unfortunately it caused some conflict and uh, I heard that a slur

366
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,280
got hurled at somebody, uh, which isn't very nice.

367
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,880
Um, but I did think it was kind of interesting because, um, when the football fans on the

368
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,000
lower level would cheer and they would go, yeah, well, you know, whenever the, uh, things

369
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,300
would score the tabletop gamers were on the mezzanine.

370
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,680
So like the second floor.

371
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,800
So somebody that, and this all happened while the OLR or the VOG network panel was happening

372
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
in the room.

373
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,860
Um, so we didn't see any of this like happening until we walked out and it was already going

374
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
on.

375
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,760
So what would happen is that the, the dude bros would cheer on the first level whenever

376
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,340
something happened in the football game and they go, yeah.

377
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,460
And then everybody up on the second floor, yes, they started, everybody just started

378
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,740
going yes.

379
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,820
And it was like, I died laughing the first time I heard that.

380
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,900
So that became the, it was like the, the dueling cheers that would go back and forth.

381
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,100
And I just, I, I like cried from laughing so hard when that was going on.

382
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,840
So, um, you know, it's unfortunate that the safe space that gamer X tries to create got

383
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,920
punctured a little bit with a very angry drunken individual that said something that they really

384
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,220
should not say at a convention dedicated to this.

385
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,620
Um, but you know, I felt otherwise they did the, the gamer X folks did the best job they

386
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,300
could making lemonade out of lemons, so to speak.

387
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,520
So anyway, uh, so that was, uh, yeah, that was, that was gamer X.

388
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,780
I had a really good time.

389
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,660
Uh, anyway, uh, we're just a few minutes out from my getting Ryan here to talk about monsters

390
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
and monocles.

391
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,980
So, um, I'll do the last week's news here in a minute, perhaps.

392
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,100
Um, uh, let me get to some comments from chat here as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

393
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,220
Uh, Alan alchemy and chat says it was totally out of gamer X's control too.

394
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,620
They can only police their own people in area.

395
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Yeah.

396
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,340
And I think most people realize that I think everybody that attended gamer X realizes that

397
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,500
nobody faults the staff for that, but it's just one of those.

398
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,820
It still sucks kind of situations.

399
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,940
And we, as soon as our panel was done and as soon as the expo hall closed, we realized

400
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,980
the game would be over in about 30 minutes.

401
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,980
So we hightailed it the fuck out of Santa Clara and drove home because we didn't want

402
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
to be stuck in that traffic.

403
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
Oh God.

404
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
No.

405
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Uh, and it was already getting pretty bad.

406
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,820
So, you know, cause they, for some stupid reason, they narrow it down to one lane.

407
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,600
I think it's because that way they can keep the light green the entire time.

408
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,580
I don't know, but it was just, Oh my God.

409
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,660
So I couldn't imagine trying to leave there at like four 35 o'clock when it was going

410
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,660
to get really ugly.

411
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,100
So I felt bad that I couldn't really see gamer X through till the bitter end.

412
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,940
So that wasn't really fair to them, but I did have to work on Monday.

413
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,660
So anyway, um, let me quickly ask Loki, how was your gaming week before we give Ryan a

414
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
call here?

415
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Well, it was brief.

416
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,580
I played basically ingress and um, but I did actually play console game.

417
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,820
I played cluster trucks, which I've been looking for this game coming out for quite a while

418
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
now.

419
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,660
Uh, it's from a new developer named Landfall games.

420
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,900
And the premise of the game is basically that you're hopping on the back of trucks to the

421
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,020
finish line and there's a lot of obstacles in the way.

422
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,980
So trucks can be, you know, they're just kind of on their own AI, but there's like, you

423
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,540
know, giant hammers, lasers, moving platforms, jumps, all sorts of crazy shit.

424
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,500
And it's just kind of jumping from one to the other and it gets really hard and it's

425
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,700
really fun cause you can get going pretty fast.

426
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,460
It's a very speed run centric games.

427
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
Yeah.

428
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,020
You were recommending this to me before the show saying if I like super meat boy, I probably

429
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
get it right.

430
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,020
Yeah.

431
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,380
I mean, maybe it's not as hard as super meat boy, but it's definitely, you know, challenging

432
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,820
and fun because you die a lot, but it's like, you know, there's some cool stuff that happens

433
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
too.

434
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,020
Um, and you get power ups and stuff like that.

435
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
So I'd highly recommend that.

436
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,540
It's on PlayStation four and PC right now.

437
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,340
I bought both because I was going to play the PlayStation four version and my wife wanted

438
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,500
to watch TV and I was like, dammit.

439
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,180
So I'll buy the steam version and then ended up watching TV because I'm weak.

440
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,140
It's just that Grey's Anatomy is just so addictive.

441
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,340
I've played through quite a bit of it.

442
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,900
I'm in like the seventh stage or seventh world, I guess, and each world has like 10 levels.

443
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,980
So that's seven out of 10 or seven out of eight levels that worlds that they've got.

444
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,240
So it gets really challenging though.

445
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,900
Like my least favorite, but most challenging was laser world because there's one level

446
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,500
like literally in the beginning you're like, ah, fuck.

447
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,620
Cause it's just all you see when you first start is all these lasers in the sky and they're

448
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
all swooped down.

449
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
You're like, ah, shit.

450
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,300
Just dodging lasers like crazy.

451
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,820
Sounds like that scene in resident evil.

452
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,020
That doesn't sound pretty at all.

453
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
So yikes.

454
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
All right, cool.

455
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,300
All right, well, uh, I'll tell you about my gaming week a little bit later, but, uh,

456
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,100
we want to make sure we get, uh, Ryan here on the show who's, uh, from retro dreamer

457
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,980
and is, uh, one half of the team making the game monsters and monocles.

458
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,740
And I believe we have Ryan on the line now.

459
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
You there, Ryan?

460
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
I'm here.

461
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
How are you doing?

462
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
Hey, good.

463
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
Welcome to orange on radio.

464
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Thanks for having me.

465
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Hey, no problem.

466
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
It's always nice to support.

467
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
You know, we're an indie podcast.

468
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,100
We like to support indie developers and it's even sweeter when the indie developer happens

469
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,300
to be pretty much your neighbor because you're, no, it's great.

470
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,420
And it was great to meet you guys out at indie arcade.

471
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Oh, was that like two years ago?

472
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Yeah, it was two years ago.

473
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,900
That was a, that was the first time we got to play monsters and monocles.

474
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,580
I've been making this game too long.

475
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,540
Okay, well, first off, before we get into the history of the game, let's talk a little

476
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,060
bit about what the game is.

477
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,500
So for those that don't know what monsters and monocles is, what's the pitch?

478
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,140
What's what's, what's the game in a nutshell?

479
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Sure.

480
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,540
So a very kind of classical, like frantic top down twin stick shooter very much inspired

481
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,020
by like old arcade games.

482
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,860
You've got your gauntlet, you've got a smash TV is four player co-op, both local and online.

483
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,820
And it's a procedural game.

484
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,580
So the levels, the objectives, the loot and stuff is different each time you play.

485
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,460
It's kind of, kind of the, the core of the game right there.

486
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,540
And we just launched an early access about two months ago and we're working on trying

487
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,380
to do monthly content updates.

488
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,620
And I think we probably about six to nine months of content update planned before we're

489
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
done.

490
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Oh, wow.

491
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,620
That's a, that's pretty impressive.

492
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,620
Yeah.

493
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,620
We got a long way to go.

494
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,740
Um, you know, it's a, it's a, we're at a great point.

495
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,060
Like we're, like we're, we're so happy to see that people are enjoying the game and

496
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,940
where it is now, but like knowing where we want to take it versus where it is now, like

497
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,980
I can't wait to start getting more and more of the content and then people getting to

498
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,100
see that stuff.

499
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,500
So, and if you guys want to check out monsters and monocles for yourself, it is available

500
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,020
on Steam early access right now.

501
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,420
You can also check out the website monstersandmonocles.com and at least like, you know, it's a radio

502
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,580
show so I can't show you a game play, but at least check out, there's like a bunch of

503
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,340
YouTubers that have been doing the, the preview on the Steam early access that are showing

504
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
off the game.

505
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,500
So at least check it out cause it's got a, it's got a pretty cool little art style to

506
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
it.

507
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Yeah.

508
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Yeah.

509
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
I know.

510
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
And we're a two man team working on the game.

511
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,620
I do all the programming and Craig does all the art and I absolutely, I adore Craig's

512
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,620
art.

513
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,620
It's one of the reasons we ended up working together is like, I've always loved the work

514
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,860
that he's done and I jumped at the chance to get to do a game with him.

515
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,300
So yeah, you guys are kind of like a retro look, like a, like a 16 bit kind of to me

516
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,780
is kind of the look of the game.

517
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,860
But you, you, it's like a steampunk theme game, right?

518
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Yeah.

519
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Yeah.

520
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,180
Victorian steampunk instead of a rope, like we've been calling it a gentleman mic and

521
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,300
you know, it's like, it's, it's very much a silly kind of lighthearted game.

522
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,940
Like there are no serious overtones or themes to it.

523
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,060
It's very like fast paced fun.

524
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:18,460
Like we have a crumpet cannon and we have a dog in a smoking jacket and Baron Von Dogface

525
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,500
that you can play as, as a character.

526
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,900
It's very much just kind of like a lighthearted, like jokey game.

527
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,940
Like if you could have told 12 year old me, like make your ultimate arcade game, it would

528
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,340
ended up a lot like this.

529
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
That's awesome.

530
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,860
So where, where, and well, that kind of leads into my question.

531
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,540
So, so how long has this big game been in development and where, where the heck did

532
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,640
this idea come from?

533
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,300
How was this game born?

534
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:43,080
So we started development in January of 2014.

535
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,700
So it's a little over two and a half years now.

536
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,980
And Craig and I had been wanting to make a game together for ages and it just had never

537
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
really worked out time-wise.

538
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,460
Like I was doing a job, he was, he was working on another project and it never lined up until

539
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,460
then.

540
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,060
And so we sat down and said, what's a, what's a short game that we can make in like six

541
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,120
to nine months?

542
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,600
And two and a half years later, here we are.

543
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,240
You know, and for us, the genesis of it was we loved the arcade growing up and like going

544
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,460
to the arcade with your friends, like with a stack of quarters, playing a game together

545
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,200
and just having a blast.

546
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,080
And it was that kind of gaming experience we really wanted to recapture with Monsters

547
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
and Monocles.

548
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,880
But times have changed and technology has changed.

549
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
Like we don't live near each other.

550
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Craig lives down in LA.

551
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
I live up in Davis.

552
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,280
And it was, you know, how can we recreate those experiences with what we have available?

553
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,600
Even though we, you know, we're at a different stage in our lives, we both have kids now,

554
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
we don't live near each other.

555
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,680
And so, you know, kind of focusing on fast gameplay that you can jump in and out of,

556
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,520
you know, that, that kind of quick, like, like focused, focused missions and stuff instead

557
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,760
of these long, like kind of more narrative, narrative structured games, you know.

558
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,600
If I'm playing online, you know, long term, our goal is to be, he could jump into the

559
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,960
game and play with me for as long as he can manage.

560
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,520
And then if he has to go, he has to go and I can keep playing, you know, and, and we

561
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,600
can enjoy the time that we have together when, when we can play.

562
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,000
And, you know, when I want to play, want to play solo, I can do that too.

563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,320
That's pretty cool that you can kind of drop in and out like that.

564
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,460
That's, and that's, that, that does remind me a lot as well of like, like you compared

565
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,040
to Gauntlet earlier and Gauntlet was a lot like that.

566
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,840
You could just kind of walk up, join in and then, you know, when you inevitably die, because

567
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,800
Gauntlet was designed to go through your quarters.

568
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I'm sorry.

569
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
That game was...

570
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
It was.

571
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Player, player needs food badly.

572
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Yeah.

573
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,920
There was like the built in mechanism that you would die after a certain amount of time.

574
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
So yeah.

575
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
No.

576
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,160
And I mean, that was, I mean, that was arcade designed in a nutshell, right?

577
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,440
Like it was, it was designed to take your money at a constant rate.

578
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
So we don't do that.

579
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
That's good.

580
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
It's just the one price.

581
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,440
You give us 15 bucks, the game is yours forever.

582
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Awesome.

583
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,360
And that includes these content updates, right?

584
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,860
Are you, are you planning DLC or is all this stuff that you're doing like free add-ons?

585
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,480
We're not talking about any DLC at this point.

586
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,320
I mean, we're still in early access, like all the stuff that we're doing now, we still

587
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,880
consider a base part of the game.

588
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,520
And you know, we're also working on allowing people to mod the game as they see fit.

589
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,040
So you know, I'd love to get to the point where people can add new guns, new enemies,

590
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,000
new maps, if they want to be really ambitious, you know, and how much people kind of want

591
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,740
to get involved with that, you know, it's going to scale, like adding a new character

592
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,120
would just be basically drawing the art for the character and editing a data file or two.

593
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,720
And then, hey, all of a sudden, you've got a new character that you can send to other

594
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,920
people or put up on Steam Workshop.

595
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,960
Okay, that's going to be awesome that you open it up to modders, I mean, there's going

596
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
to be awesome stuff.

597
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,320
And then there's going to be, you know, CD, humor, weird stuff, too.

598
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,160
But yeah, I mean, you know, I assume that the first thing that's made is a gun that

599
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
shoots a penis.

600
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm just expecting that to happen.

601
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,360
It seems to happen whenever you open up mod support.

602
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,040
I might just do it as the example to get it out of the way.

603
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,120
Yeah, you might as well just do the dildo gun.

604
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Just get it out of the way.

605
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
This is true.

606
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
What is that they have in Saints Row, the giant purple dildo bat or whatever?

607
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, the dildo bat.

608
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah.

609
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I mean, it is true.

610
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,120
Yeah, we always talk about the TTP of a game or the time to penis.

611
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Yeah.

612
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,800
No, it's, but you know what, I mean, I grew up as a PC gamer and I loved like kind of

613
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
getting into the data files.

614
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,480
Like I got my start in making video games by going and messing with the games that I

615
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
had purchased.

616
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,160
You know, I couldn't afford developer tools and this was before the days of like Linux

617
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
and free compilers and all that stuff.

618
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,320
So I got my start by like finding these files and like mucking with them and seeing how

619
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,880
it changed the game.

620
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,080
And that's really important for me.

621
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,840
Like if I can get one kid into video games by he mucked with my game and said, hey, maybe

622
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
I can do this too.

623
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,960
Like that would be like mission accomplished for me.

624
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,480
That would be the best thing ever.

625
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Are there other games on your resume that you've done?

626
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,680
I saw that Retro Dreamer had done some like mobile development, but are there?

627
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,400
So this is my first game with Retro Dreamer.

628
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I've been making games professionally for 12 years now.

629
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,760
And I started in mobile and did mobile for a long time, like even before the iPhone and

630
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,480
stuff.

631
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,480
And then from there, the iPhone took off and all of my work was basically on the iPhone.

632
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:24,200
So I worked for companies like N.G. Moco, which is now DNA, Electronic Arts, and some

633
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,000
other big companies too, doing contract work and making games for them.

634
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,620
After a while I ran away screaming and said, maybe I'll be an indie developer.

635
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
And now here we are.

636
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,620
You know what's interesting?

637
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,820
We hear that story a lot from indie developers here on this show is that like half the indie

638
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,440
developers kind of were starting on like as indie and then the other half are like, well,

639
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,200
I used to do the big studio development and I ran away screaming and wanted to do my own

640
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
thing.

641
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Yeah.

642
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,760
I mean, it's studio work, it's really rewarding in some way because you're usually working

643
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,520
with an amazing group of people and they really are amazing because they're all like you.

644
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,120
They got into games because they wanted to make them and they know a ton of stuff and

645
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,560
it's super inspiring, but it's definitely a grind, especially when it's not your idea

646
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,280
that you're making.

647
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,500
So indie is a great alternative for some folks.

648
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,860
Tell me a little more about how this creating a game across a great distance works because

649
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,420
that's kind of fascinating to me is that, you know, you guys have been working on this

650
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,820
game for a while and you do it across this great distance of, you know, you being in

651
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,460
Northern California and your other developer being in Southern California, and that's,

652
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,960
you know, that's a good eight hour drive.

653
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,880
You guys can't just meet up for lunch to toss around ideas.

654
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,420
But I think that's pretty cool because for people out there that might be thinking about,

655
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,340
I want to make an indie game, but I need a little extra help.

656
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,300
That help doesn't necessarily need to be in your own hometown.

657
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,340
You're developing kind of across these great distances.

658
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
How does that work?

659
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Yeah.

660
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,880
I mean, we use tools that, you know, just everybody else uses.

661
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,640
We use Slack for day to day chatting.

662
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,500
We used to use Skype, but Skype wasn't reliable for us, so we stopped using that.

663
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
And Slack has been great.

664
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,560
We just have a chat room up 24 seven.

665
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,220
If Craig's working on a new enemy or a new monster, he'll just drop images in and I can

666
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,380
see them being comment back and forth.

667
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,980
And it's, you know, it's kind of like a persistent conversation, you know.

668
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,780
It doesn't matter the time of day.

669
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,500
If I have an idea, I can paste it in there.

670
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,060
I can tell him that I've pushed a new build up to Dropbox.

671
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
Well, now Steam.

672
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,780
We don't use Dropbox anymore.

673
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,100
And he can check it out.

674
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,480
And you know, if he's working on new art or a new map or something, he can drop in there.

675
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,100
And that's just kind of our back and forth.

676
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
That's pretty cool.

677
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Yeah.

678
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,020
And then, you know, besides that, once you're greenlit on Steam, you can push builds of

679
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,060
your game whenever you want.

680
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,740
So that's been great for us for kind of staying in sync on what's in the game and what's not.

681
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,060
And yeah, besides that, you know, Craig does all the art.

682
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
He gives it to me.

683
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
I integrate it with the game.

684
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,020
And then design is an iterative process.

685
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,820
We've had multiplayer in from day one.

686
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,420
So we can play the game together and hop on Skype or some other voice chatting thing and

687
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,860
talk about what we like, what we don't like, and take notes and kind of go from there.

688
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,820
So one thing I've been very curious about.

689
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,660
So Loki and I first got to play your game at the Sac Indie Arcade event in 2015, right?

690
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Not this year, but last year.

691
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,000
So we got to play the game at that event.

692
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,500
And at the time we played it, we thought, oh, this is going to be out real soon.

693
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,440
This looks like a finished product, but you're still kind of working on it.

694
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,760
And I think, and the reason why I ask is I think a lot of games kind of go through this

695
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,120
is that you might play it, I mean, you might even play a big AAA game or something at E3,

696
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,940
and it still doesn't come out for, you know, a good year and a half or whatever.

697
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,240
So what have you been doing to your game since it felt so playable to now?

698
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
I don't know.

699
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,120
No, we've been doing a lot.

700
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,760
So there have been a few big things that kind of slowed us down.

701
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,880
First I had a new baby, so that definitely took some of my time.

702
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:52,760
And on the game side of things, we've had networking in from day one, but the game engine

703
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,400
that we use, Unity, they added a whole new one.

704
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,120
But as part of adding the new networking stack, they completely deprecated the old one, which

705
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,360
means we've marked this for removal at some point in the future.

706
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,320
We haven't announced when we're going to remove it, but we're going to remove it, and of course

707
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,140
that's what we had used to build it all up at that point.

708
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,920
And so we had to make the call, well, what do we do?

709
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Do we move to this new system?

710
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,360
Do we move to our own system?

711
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,400
And so there was a lot of testing there, and we eventually made the call to write our own

712
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,640
networking stack directly on top of Steam's feature list, and that was probably a good

713
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,400
four months of work right there.

714
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,880
And then besides that, we've been polishing the game.

715
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,720
We really spent a lot of time changing the core mechanics.

716
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,440
We weren't happy with the core game feel.

717
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,360
And in a game like this, where it's an arcade-y thing, there's nothing to hide the gameplay

718
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
behind.

719
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,600
If there's something in the gameplay that's not working, it's going to stand out like

720
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,840
a sore thumb from the very first moment, and it's going to keep annoying you the whole

721
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,700
time you play.

722
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,040
So we stripped the game back to core principles.

723
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,800
I think we cut it down to like two guns in one map and three enemies for about, I'd say

724
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,480
about five months.

725
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,240
And we tweaked how much damage do guns do, how fast do they fire, how do they affect

726
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,000
player movement, how fast does the player move, how fast do enemies move, and just fine-tuning

727
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,840
each and every little piece and how they interact with each other until we were at a point where

728
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,400
we thought, yes, this works.

729
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,600
And to be honest, that's something we probably should have done to begin with, but it's tough

730
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,680
when you have these shows that you're going to, because you want to promote the game and

731
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,160
kind of build awareness.

732
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,840
You polish to the point where you say, this is something we can take to a demo and people

733
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,440
are going to have a good time with it.

734
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,160
But that doesn't necessarily mean that those underpinnings of your game are solid enough

735
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,240
to build the entire game around.

736
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,600
And that's kind of where we got stuck.

737
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,400
That's a very interesting thing to think about, I think, for a lot of people, is just how

738
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,200
much has to go into balance with the game.

739
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:00,800
Because if, like you say, a gun is too overpowered or something, that core mechanic is broken,

740
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,960
people aren't going to bother to play to the fourth or fifth level to see all the cool

741
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,720
art that you have later in the game.

742
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Yeah.

743
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,900
And weapon balance in particular is a minefield because our launch is a great example of that.

744
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:19,160
We had a gun, the auto-stake launcher, which is basically like a crossbow that shoots vampire

745
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,280
killing stakes, but the auto is the upgraded version of it and it shoots it super rapidly.

746
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,080
And it cooled down.

747
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,120
We have this overheat mechanic where, for more powerful guns, since we don't have ammo

748
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,360
in the game because we don't want people dealing about ammo and like, can I shoot, can I not

749
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,880
shoot, we wanted people to shoot as much as they want.

750
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,240
So instead of doing ammo, we have this overheat thing where a powerful gun will eventually

751
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,040
overheat and you have to flip to your other gun for a little bit while it cools down.

752
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,280
And the auto-stake launcher was set to cool down a little too quickly, and so people realized

753
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,280
that they could basically just spam it and it trivialized the game for a lot of people

754
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,120
who realized that, and they could just fly through the content.

755
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:06,520
And that was one gun out of 25, I think, and we just missed that one value and it trivialized

756
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,080
the game for a lot of people.

757
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,640
So that's getting fixed, actually that's been fixed, that was fixed in the last update.

758
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,800
But yeah, it's so easy to just make one wrong change that kind of throws everything out of whack.

759
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,040
Wow, okay, that's so important, I think, too, to look at that balance and everything.

760
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,800
And I think when, you know, you and your co-developer might play this game over and over and over

761
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,280
and over again, and even these internal, you know, these companies that have war developers

762
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,080
might play it internally over and over and over again, and they're still not going to

763
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,680
come up with that scenario that your users might come up with.

764
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,960
And it's funny because you mentioned how much time we play, some of the people in our Discord

765
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,680
server for the game give me trouble because I'm now at about 1400 hours of time played.

766
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,400
I played the game a lot, but it's so easy to miss stuff, especially when you play a

767
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,440
game as much as we do, you just end up building these assumptions into your mind and you miss

768
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,960
stuff that other people see.

769
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,000
Right, I bet that's dangerous is that you start to assume because you just kind of know

770
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,600
the inner workings of the game.

771
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,560
You know, I think that it's so important to get new people to play the game and see

772
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
their reactions.

773
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,200
So that's part of the reason why you do different expos and things, right?

774
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,840
Like you did the Sac and the Arcade event where we saw you, but you were recently at

775
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
PAX, right?

776
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Yeah, absolutely.

777
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
And PAX was amazing.

778
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,600
PAX is, I love small shows, local shows, because it's a great chance to kind of connect with

779
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
people more than you can at a big show.

780
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,000
But the big shows are so amazing, too, because people come from all over.

781
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,280
And this show was really special to me because it was the first time we'd had a show since

782
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,440
the game had launched, and I was actually meeting people who bought the game and enjoyed

783
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,320
the game and came up to tell me about it, and that just meant the world to me.

784
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,040
As a small developer, if I can give players any advice, if you really like a game, reach

785
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,920
out to the developer and tell them if they're an indie developer, because it means the world

786
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
to us.

787
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,420
We don't hear it very often, but when we do, it makes our day.

788
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,100
So having that show and having people come up to me, I was on cloud nine all four days.

789
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,340
It was fantastic.

790
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,380
So they could send that love digitally via Twitter at MonsterMonocles, right?

791
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,300
Yeah, or my personal one is at rje.

792
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,940
I will see either of those pretty much 24-7.

793
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,140
You must have got on the Twitter bandwagon early, like me, because you have a three-letter

794
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,140
name and I have a four-letter name.

795
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,380
Yeah, one of my friends mentioned it to me, and I made an account and then just let it

796
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,620
sit there for probably three years, and then I was like, oh, maybe I should actually check

797
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,260
Twitter out.

798
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,780
Convenient.

799
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,160
We actually have a live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, and people of course

800
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
can ask questions.

801
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,980
We have a good question here from RageNator in our chat room I want to ask you here.

802
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,460
Are there any games that you look to as being inspirational, or to put it another way, is

803
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,180
there a game or games that in your mind are the epitome of how a game within a genre should

804
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
be made?

805
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Wow, that's a tough question.

806
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,700
Yeah, those are almost two separate questions, too.

807
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,300
Are there games that have really inspired you with Monsters & Monocles?

808
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,580
I guess you talked a little bit about the retro arcade stuff, right?

809
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,580
Gauntlet?

810
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:18,740
Yeah, specifically within the context of Monsters & Monocles, I would say shooters and co-op

811
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,260
games from the arcade.

812
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,700
The most direct comparison, like I said earlier, were Gauntlet and Smash TV, just in terms

813
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,700
of pace and style and thematics and stuff like that.

814
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,580
But I mean, you could look at other arcade games, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-op

815
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:42,140
was one of my all-time favorite gaming experiences in the arcade.

816
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,220
I think it's hard for the second part of that question to talk about the epitome of a game

817
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,980
within a genre, because I feel like that's going to be a very personal thing.

818
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:57,580
For me, I think I'd have a really tough time picking a game.

819
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,260
Maybe open-world games, like I adore the Yakuza series from SEGA, but that's a very

820
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,940
specific niche thing that I apparently love and nobody else in America does.

821
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:14,780
No, well, he's in Canada, but one of the guys that helped with our website, or helped, back

822
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,060
when we first had done it a long, long time ago, loves Yakuza and always keeps me updated

823
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,340
on what's going on with that series.

824
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
So you're not alone.

825
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,900
Oh, it's the best.

826
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:31,220
It's such an interesting series to me, and I could talk for hours about it, but I won't.

827
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Look at this.

828
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,340
You're winning tons of points in our chat room.

829
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,780
Tigerclaw says, big points for mentioning Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Dungeon

830
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,460
Buster said, holy shit, a fellow Yakuza fan, yeah, it's really the best.

831
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,420
Hey, there's three of us, all right.

832
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,620
You guys should start a club.

833
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,420
The first one on the PlayStation 4 that's coming out is coming out in the States in,

834
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,180
I think, January, and I'm clearing my calendar.

835
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
I'm going to play it to death.

836
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,460
I can't wait.

837
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,460
I just want to point out, he threatened to do this in a tweet before the show, too, that

838
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,300
he was going to derail this with the Yakuza chat.

839
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,300
Look what happened.

840
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,100
Hey, it's not nearly as bad as it could be.

841
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,260
I haven't gotten to any of my theories about how that game is put together, but it really

842
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,380
is a fascinating series that I think more people should check out.

843
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,060
All right, fair enough, and it's one of those things where it's like, there's so many games

844
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,420
and just not enough time.

845
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Oh, geez, yeah.

846
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,780
I mean, just this week, I think I bought four games and I played one of them.

847
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,260
I don't know how I'm going to, like, this is my Steam backlog problem in a nutshell.

848
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,140
I have so many games I want to play.

849
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,460
And I don't know if you're as big of a fan as I am, but can you imagine that right now

850
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,460
is the time we were supposed to be playing Final Fantasy XV as well?

851
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,460
Oh, my God.

852
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,620
Well, yeah, and then the World of Warcraft expansion came out of nowhere, and I had completely

853
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:49,140
forgotten I had pre-ordered it, and then I lost about 60 hours of my life to that.

854
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,980
It's fantastic, by the way.

855
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
I agree.

856
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,980
I agree.

857
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,460
Yeah, and God, yeah, and there's just so many, like, you know, when we talked about launching

858
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,460
the game, we tried to find an empty week on the calendar where there wasn't a ton of great

859
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,600
stuff coming out, and that week doesn't exist anymore.

860
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,060
There's amazing stuff coming out every week of the year, and it's mind-blowing to me.

861
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,840
There's never a better time to be a video game fan.

862
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,700
There's just an embarrassment of riches.

863
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,620
Yeah, and this week especially, we're going to talk about it a little later in the show,

864
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:24,340
but PlayStation VR this week, I mean, that is going to blow up PlayStation with, I think,

865
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,180
there's something like 40 new releases this week.

866
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,740
Yeah, and I'm so sad I didn't get a pre-order in on time.

867
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,740
I missed it.

868
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,980
Oh, no, we're going to talk about that a little later in the show, about where we're standing

869
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,660
on the VR right now, but let me go back to Monsters & Monocles a little bit.

870
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,700
Funny enough, since we brought up PlayStation, I just kind of want to ask you, like, I noticed

871
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,220
that there is, it's out there that you guys are working on a PlayStation 4 version.

872
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,740
I know I've seen the trailer on the official PlayStation account.

873
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,500
Are you guys talking at all, any type of time frame for when that's going to happen?

874
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,900
So it's definitely a ways off, it'll be next year sometime.

875
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,340
We need to finish the Steam version before we can bring it over to PlayStation.

876
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,420
We can't do early access on the PS4 like we are with Steam, so we need to get all the

877
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,900
content in and kind of have that blessed 1.0 version and be out of early access on Steam,

878
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,060
and then that's the version that will come over to PlayStation.

879
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,780
I'm hoping it'll be very close to the time that we do the 1.0 on Steam.

880
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,140
The game is up and running on the PlayStation already and has been since, god, for over

881
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:32,420
a year now, and Sony let us show it at PlayStation Experience last year, which was another fantastic

882
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,820
show that we got to do.

883
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,820
Oh, cool.

884
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,900
So yeah, no, we're really excited about the PlayStation version, especially for the local

885
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
co-op mode.

886
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,460
We've had local in from day one for people who prefer to play that way.

887
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:52,860
But PC gamers, we've noticed local co-op doesn't get a ton of use, it's much more online.

888
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:58,020
But I feel like with friends and family, local on a console is kind of where the heart and

889
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,020
soul of local is.

890
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,700
So I'm really excited to have a console release too.

891
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,940
And was that hard to get involved with PlayStation?

892
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,820
Because for an indie developer, the fact that you guys are a two-man team, getting invited

893
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,180
to PlayStation Experience, that's a pretty big deal.

894
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:18,420
Yeah, PlayStation Experience was amazing and definitely a bit out of the blue.

895
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,180
But Sony has been an amazing partner.

896
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,660
And the amount of outreach they've done over the last few years to indie developers has

897
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,660
really been amazing.

898
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:31,900
And again, especially if I kind of look back at where things were when I started 10 to

899
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,700
12 years ago, if you wanted to get into console development, you needed to have an official

900
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,620
company that had its own building, you needed to have a security setup for dev kits and

901
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,620
stuff.

902
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:51,220
And then dev kits, you were talking $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 just to get started.

903
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:58,180
And then if you wanted to ship anything, there was no digital, so you had to find a publisher.

904
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,460
Consoles, just like everything else, has gotten easier and easier, and I think we're better

905
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,460
off for it.

906
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,500
I think we've seen a wider variety of games than we've ever seen before, and that can

907
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,460
very much be attributed to the walls being lowered and them being more accepting of smaller

908
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,460
teams.

909
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:19,340
Well, Ryan, I'm going to wrap things up here because we've taken plenty of your time tonight.

910
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,100
I really appreciate you joining us here on the program, though, but I really want to

911
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,060
wish you continued luck with the continued development of Monsters & Monocles and the

912
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,220
monthly content things you guys are planning over on Steam.

913
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,740
And again, if you guys are interested at all, if this sounds like this kind of old-school

914
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:40,180
arcade game, Smash TV meets procedural generation meets steampunk jokes and stuff, if that sounds

915
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,820
up your alley, I really encourage you guys to check it out on Steam Early Access right

916
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,820
now.

917
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,980
Somebody posted the link in the chatroom earlier, so there you go, and those of you listening

918
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,220
on the podcast feed can find it with one easy search, I'm sure.

919
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,540
It would be very hard to forget a name like Monsters & Monocles.

920
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,740
Ryan, anything else you want to plug here real quick before we let you go?

921
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,580
No, you know what, that's it.

922
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,660
And just thanks so much for having me on, let me chat about the game a bit.

923
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,540
If anybody has any other questions about the game and didn't get them in tonight, feel

924
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,620
free to hit me up on Twitter at R-J-E.

925
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,580
And yeah, if you check out the game, I hope you have a blast.

926
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,580
Is that a pun?

927
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,580
It is now.

928
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,580
All right, excellent.

929
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,380
Ryan, thank you so much for taking the time out to join us here at Orange On Radio.

930
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,740
Best of luck with the game, really look forward to the continued patches and the eventual

931
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,740
PS4 release.

932
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,740
Thanks guys, have a good one.

933
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,740
All right, take care, buddy.

934
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,900
All right, bye-bye.

935
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,900
Bye-bye.

936
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,740
So Ryan with Retro Dreamer, talking about Monsters & Monocles, thanks to him for taking

937
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,740
the time out.

938
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,740
That's great.

939
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,300
You can tell he's just a gaming fan, too.

940
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,860
And obviously he has his things he's passionate about, which might not even necessarily be

941
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,140
the same genre he's developing in right now.

942
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:53,940
Like I don't think I see a lot of Yakuza necessarily in Monsters & Monocles, although Dungeon Buster

943
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,020
says in our chat, says a great interview and good luck.

944
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,500
Also please put in a Yakuza themed Easter egg.

945
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,260
You never know.

946
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,260
You never know what might happen with that.

947
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
There you go.

948
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,540
All right, well, moving on, getting back into some news, well, let me talk about my gaming

949
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,540
week real quick.

950
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,120
So I already talked a little bit about GamerX, but I want to talk about some of the video

951
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,940
games I was playing this past week, which, like Ryan, I was also playing that new World

952
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:21,100
of Warcraft expansion, but Final Fantasy XIV got a patch this past week, so I was checking

953
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,100
that out as well.

954
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,680
Actually it feels like it was this past week because I was gone and GamerX was actually

955
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,340
two weeks ago, so I was checking that out as well.

956
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,460
So here's something else I've been playing.

957
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,300
So do you remember how we kept telling the listeners, we said if they actually announce

958
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,740
the NX, we'll do a show, right?

959
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,060
Obviously that didn't happen because we didn't do a show, but I would say the number two

960
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,060
thing on the list happened last week.

961
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,760
What was the number two thing?

962
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,220
Lost Odyssey became backwards compatible on Xbox One.

963
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,700
Oh yeah, that's right.

964
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:58,180
So you know I was excited about that, so I've been playing some Lost Odyssey on Xbox One,

965
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,300
and I've got to say that game has aged pretty well.

966
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,500
For as old of a game as it is, it holds up really well.

967
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,460
Looks great on Xbox One.

968
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,580
I remember one place that that game got razzed in the early days, especially in the review,

969
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,260
was the loading times.

970
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,940
Well think about this now.

971
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,340
It's now on your hard drive.

972
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,540
And I guess you could install games back during Lost Odyssey, but I want to say there was

973
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,980
something like, it wasn't recommended for the multi-disc games or something.

974
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,220
I seem to remember that being a thing back in the day.

975
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,800
But anyway, you can install it to the Xbox One drive, and I feel like some of the loading

976
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,420
times for battles and stuff aren't as bad as they were.

977
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,660
So interesting, maybe some of that stuff has even been improved upon a little bit.

978
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,560
So I've been able to play very far into the game, but yes, thank you to everybody who

979
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,860
tweeted me the day that that was announced, which was conveniently the day that I was

980
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,860
leaving to go to GamerX.

981
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,960
I didn't get to check it out until I got back, but yes, I definitely got in on Lost Odyssey

982
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,080
and was playing that and checking that out.

983
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,600
So very, very, very, very happy about that.

984
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,960
And there's also other backwards compatible stuff that popped in this week.

985
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,920
Puzzle Quest 2, which was cool, Bejeweled 3, like just some random...

986
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,080
Yeah, there was some PopCap stuff that was actually on there for free.

987
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:17,720
I'm not sure if that was a glitch or something, but like Bejeweled 2, 3, I want to say, was

988
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,720
it Feeding Frenzy 1 and 2, and then something else.

989
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,840
Oh no, I didn't catch any of that when it was...

990
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,600
Well, I'd also bought all those games on 360, so...

991
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,440
Right, yeah, I think I owned quite a few of those as well, and I don't have an Xbox One

992
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,960
yet, so who knows.

993
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,320
But anyway, it was really cool to be able to revisit Lost Odyssey, and yes, I was very

994
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,020
excited when they announced that and getting to go visit that.

995
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,120
So yeah, if you haven't played it yet, now's a great time to go visit it.

996
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Although, I had heard...

997
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,800
I don't know if this was changed, but I had heard you actually still can't buy it digitally,

998
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
which kind of surprises me.

999
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,920
I don't think you can.

1000
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
It's weird.

1001
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,920
So you gotta go find a used copy somewhere, which you can find them, but I think they

1002
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,680
got smart and they started jacking up the prices.

1003
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,960
I was at a local store.

1004
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,960
I was at the local...

1005
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,960
I was at Dimple.

1006
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,080
They were charging $19.99 for it, and I was like, dang, this thing must be scarcer than

1007
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
I thought.

1008
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,360
I don't think they're that savvy, but yeah.

1009
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,200
Anyway, so yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.

1010
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,280
I think that was between being at a convention and everything, that was a lot in my week.

1011
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,400
So let's talk about some of the news that we missed last week, since we never got around

1012
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,240
to that particular kickoff topic.

1013
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,720
So some of the things that we had missed last week, the Japanese NES Classic was announced.

1014
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,000
Did you hear about that?

1015
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah, the Famicom one.

1016
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,280
The Famicom one.

1017
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,880
So they are getting some different games.

1018
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,840
So they are not getting some of the things that we're getting, and I don't have the list

1019
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,240
of what they don't get, but they are getting Yie Ar Kung Fu, Solomon's Key.

1020
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,200
They are getting the Japanese version of River City Ransom on theirs, which is pretty cool.

1021
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,760
So yeah, NES Open Tournament Golf.

1022
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,080
So they're getting their own cool little...

1023
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,560
It's almost worth the import, maybe.

1024
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
I know, right?

1025
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
I wonder if that would work on...

1026
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,560
I don't see why not.

1027
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,560
It's HDMI.

1028
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,560
HDMI, yeah.

1029
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,600
Yeah, that's a good point.

1030
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,280
Those might be fun to import.

1031
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
Hmm.

1032
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,360
You bring up a good thought there.

1033
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,400
So that was big news.

1034
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,480
I guess the Lost Odyssey news, of course, that I already touched on, was a pretty big deal.

1035
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,640
Neo Geo titles are coming to the PlayStation 4 Arcade Archives.

1036
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,360
I don't know if you guys are following that series on PlayStation 4, but that's where

1037
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,040
you can get Bubble Bobble, Gradius II, Mighty Bomb Jack.

1038
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,600
They have some old-school 80s classics in here.

1039
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,280
Well, now they're going to get Neo Geo games.

1040
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,640
They've announced Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, going to be coming to PlayStation 4.

1041
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,800
If only they had that wrapped into some sort of classic arcade-type thing, you know.

1042
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,840
Let's see.

1043
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,560
Also, uh, Bit.Trip Runner 3 was announced, so that series is going to be continuing.

1044
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,200
Is it so hard, like, I know this is like something that, they've done different games like this,

1045
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,360
but can we get, like, a remaster of, like, the old San Francisco Rush or something like

1046
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
that?

1047
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:08,040
Or, like, because those games look like dog shit on, you know, everything, because at

1048
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,920
the time, that's all it could do.

1049
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,200
But nowadays, like, I don't necessarily want them, like, to make new stuff because the

1050
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,080
new Rush games aren't that great, but the old ones are great, so let's just, I'm sure

1051
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,040
they can update everything and just keep the same tracks.

1052
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,640
What the hell does that have to do with Bit.Trip Runner?

1053
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,640
I don't know, we were talking about classic arcades.

1054
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,520
Alright, well, I'm excited about Bit.Trip Runner 3 because I love the first two.

1055
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,400
The second was a huge, like, step up from the first two, and the first was pretty good

1056
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,000
as it was, so that will be very, very interesting.

1057
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And for those of you that are playing Stardew Valley, you're going to be able to get divorced

1058
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,040
in Stardew Valley now, so if you don't like your spouse, you can fix that.

1059
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,040
That's new in Stardew Valley.

1060
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,680
Well, that's a lot better than the previous way, which was throwing her into a combine,

1061
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,680
but, you know.

1062
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,960
Do you remember Firewatch, that indie game that had come out on PlayStation 4 not that

1063
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,880
long ago, and I think they just released on Xbox One recently?

1064
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
Yes.

1065
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,680
Firewatch has sold one million copies.

1066
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,320
They're going to make a movie out of it, apparently.

1067
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:06,680
That's kind of random, but I could, I can kind of see it, like, you know, it was a game

1068
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,720
that was very driven by story.

1069
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,560
I don't, I mean, it's going to be interesting.

1070
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,880
Is it going to be a scary movie?

1071
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,320
Like, what are they going to do with it?

1072
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,520
I haven't played the game, so I don't know what the story is.

1073
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,320
I'm curious about that.

1074
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,920
That'll be interesting.

1075
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,120
So that is some of what you missed last week.

1076
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,920
Obviously, we can't fit everything in, but those are some of the things that caught my

1077
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
eye.

1078
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,040
Before we get into this week's gaming news, I want to mention we will be here live next

1079
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
week.

1080
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,240
We will have an OLR live next week.

1081
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,880
However, I'm going to be running in really late, as I'm going to be gone this weekend.

1082
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,160
This is convention time of year, Loki.

1083
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
I'm going to be gone this weekend as well.

1084
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm going to be at Final Fantasy Fan Fest in Las Vegas.

1085
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,160
So I will be there for the convention Friday, Saturday.

1086
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,720
So I fly back on Sunday.

1087
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,920
Thankfully, Vegas is only like an hour and 15 minute flight.

1088
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
So it's really short flight.

1089
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,960
But I fly back and I get home at like one o'clock.

1090
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,440
So I'm going to be cutting it, which I know it sounds like a lot of time, but it's really

1091
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,840
not when you consider that I have to drive back from the airport and you know, all that

1092
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,840
stuff.

1093
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
So Loki is going to take care of producing the show next week.

1094
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,960
So I'm not as worried about that, but it's, it's, you know, we're going to be cutting

1095
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,160
it a little close next week.

1096
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,760
So I just, you know, kind of, kind of letting you guys know that we may get a late start

1097
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,200
if anything weird happens with the flights.

1098
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,200
But hopefully that won't happen.

1099
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:29,560
We will also not have a live show, Veterans Day weekend, which is going to be November

1100
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,760
13th.

1101
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,120
There will not be a live show.

1102
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:39,480
However, as a lot of you are highly anticipating the 666th episode on the show scheduled to

1103
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:45,120
take place the next week on 20 November, we will be doing something that we can actually

1104
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,120
number as a show.

1105
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,720
So we'll probably tape earlier in the week.

1106
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,720
We've done this before.

1107
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,880
We'll tape on like a Tuesday or Wednesday night.

1108
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,480
And then that'll be our show for the week so that we don't lose the numbering.

1109
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,600
And we can still bring you episode 666 on 20 November, which by the way, I still have

1110
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,640
no idea what we're doing or how I get.

1111
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,880
Now it's just a thing.

1112
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,120
Now it's just a thing that we have to do to do episode 666 on 20 November.

1113
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,880
So we'll, we'll be figuring that out in the next month.

1114
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,920
I am going to Chicago.

1115
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,240
Just the planets and stars aligned in just the right way.

1116
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,360
They're doing a big Ingress thing in Chicago.

1117
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,520
And usually I would not spend all this money to fly out just to play a stupid cell phone

1118
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,520
game.

1119
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,040
But it's like, I haven't really spent quality time in Chicago.

1120
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,000
I went to, I went to anime, oh shit, I forget the name.

1121
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,760
I'm going to get such shit for that.

1122
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,480
Anime Midwest something happens there.

1123
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,640
I forgot the name because it's been like 10 years since I was there.

1124
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,560
I didn't see anything but like the hotel and like a little piece of downtown when I

1125
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,560
was there.

1126
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,120
So I get to spend some proper time in Chicago and I have some friends that live there.

1127
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,880
So thanks to my buddies that used to do the show Koopa Club and I know some more people

1128
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,680
just from the internet that live there.

1129
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,640
So it's kind of one of those things where it all lines up where I get to visit all those

1130
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,560
folks and then also see, get to play some Ingress out of it at the event.

1131
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,200
So but because of that, we will not be here live that weekend.

1132
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,720
So just so you guys know.

1133
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,080
Yes, and Wardle King says 666 still on November 20th.

1134
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,920
Yes, we will do whatever we have to do to make sure that that happens, even if we have

1135
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,160
to put out something really short as episode 665.

1136
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,160
You know what?

1137
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,200
After 600 plus episodes, we've earned it if we want to call a 20 minute show a show.

1138
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,800
All right.

1139
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,040
That's our housekeeping stuff.

1140
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,120
Don't forget to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1141
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,880
We're also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

1142
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,640
Let's get into what's been going on in the news this week.

1143
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Loki.

1144
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,640
All right.

1145
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,920
So apparently the Washington State Gambling Commission has issued a warning to Valve to

1146
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,640
basically telling them, hey, you guys have to stop users from using Steam to, you know,

1147
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:56,680
gamble Counter Strike Go skins or else, you know, basically.

1148
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,760
I want to say there was a lawsuit against them for that, but somehow they it got dropped.

1149
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,880
But yeah, apparently, you know, it's there's quite a bit of money in it.

1150
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,560
It says that and I hardly I don't believe this number real quick.

1151
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,040
I mean, they basically according to, I guess, estimates from some e-sports betting report,

1152
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:24,960
they're seeing that Counter Strike Go Lounge has made approximately one billion dollars

1153
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,320
in skin gambling since January 1st and August 1st death.

1154
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,080
That's not there's no way.

1155
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,640
I'm sorry.

1156
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,680
There's maybe one million in magic money that doesn't fucking exist, but I'd one billion

1157
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,000
dollars in real money.

1158
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,520
No, no, I'm sorry that that's there's no fucking way.

1159
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
I mean, I don't know.

1160
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,600
I don't really know if Valve is necessarily responsible for that, because, I mean, they

1161
00:58:53,600 --> 00:59:02,560
do facilitate you buying stuff and, you know, you can trade it and sell it on their store.

1162
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,560
It's just mainly a third party site that's kind of exploiting them to do gambling and

1163
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,560
stuff.

1164
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,560
So I don't really know how much control they have over other than, you know, banning those

1165
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,060
sites.

1166
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:18,800
But I mean, I mean, as long as they don't make the situation worse by, I don't know,

1167
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,760
say introducing something else that could be sold and gambled for.

1168
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,800
Oh, wait, but they just did.

1169
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:31,880
So yes, they're actually bringing monetized limited use sprays to Counter Strike Go.

1170
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,280
That's right, graffiti.

1171
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,680
So you can earn them in your weekly drops.

1172
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:42,600
You can buy them on the Steam Marketplace or purchase a community made graffiti box

1173
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,720
with the proceeds of the sale being shared among community artists.

1174
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:52,580
All right, I don't know if you can trade the, I assume if you're buying them in the marketplace

1175
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,260
you can probably trade them.

1176
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,180
Yeah, most of that stuff you can trade.

1177
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,620
I mean, there's parameters around when you can trade and what kinds of accounts can do

1178
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,500
it, because that's been exploited an awful lot.

1179
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:06,180
But you know, for the average user like you and me who are playing games, you know, the

1180
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,020
way they're intended and so forth, yeah, you can probably trade that stuff.

1181
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:14,460
I don't know who'd want to use it, but people will buy stuff like that.

1182
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,460
They will.

1183
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:19,660
Well, and so with that, you know, that just means that's one more thing that could be

1184
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,180
possibly thrown on that market.

1185
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,620
I don't know, it's like, I don't, I think the whole gambling thing is stupid.

1186
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:32,260
Yeah, I mean, that seems like that could be a pretty big deal that could have some big

1187
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:36,540
fallout if that, you know, if Valve is found to be facilitating this type of thing, because

1188
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,540
I guess I just never thought of the gambling.

1189
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,180
The reason they're saying they're facilitating is because they have the, I guess, the APIs

1190
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,560
in place where you can, you know, read Steam, you know, information about Steam accounts

1191
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,300
and stuff like that through a website.

1192
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,900
And then also they facilitate, you know, the trading and stuff.

1193
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,780
They have that back end for it.

1194
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,860
But I mean, it's websites using like a creative way to kind of, you know, game the system,

1195
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,860
I guess.

1196
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,140
And this is like that YouTube guy who is running the company on the side.

1197
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:10,220
Yeah, it's basically, so the way they kind of have it, from what I understand, they have

1198
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:16,060
basically like an escrow account that, you know, takes the skin in and then you would

1199
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:21,340
gamble, you know, takes the skin from everybody that's participating or gun or whatever.

1200
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:27,220
And then you're gambling, basically you pay money or pay using that skin to gamble in

1201
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:33,240
a raffle to win something else that's more valuable, I guess.

1202
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,740
And so that's how they're supposed to be gambling.

1203
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:41,940
I mean, it's, it is gambling, but it's just kind of, I don't know, I mean, who's it really

1204
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,940
hurting?

1205
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,060
That's what I want to know.

1206
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,300
Like kids, are kids doing this because kids don't have any fucking money.

1207
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,300
I mean, and...

1208
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,580
Well, they have mommy and daddy's wallet and they know how to find numbers.

1209
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,900
Mommy and daddy are fucking dumb if they're, you know, basically saying, okay, spend whatever

1210
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,900
you want.

1211
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:02,300
I mean, and like, is it, you know, is it like people that are, you know, have an income

1212
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,140
that are just dumb and betting on this stuff?

1213
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,340
I mean, like, who's this really hurting is what I want to know.

1214
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,780
I mean, I just can't see that there's that much money in that.

1215
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:15,820
I mean, if a gambling site is making a billion dollars off this, allegedly, and then how

1216
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,300
much money, then Valve should be just fucking rolling, no wonder there's no fucking Half

1217
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,380
Life 3, they're rolling in fucking money.

1218
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,540
I just don't, I don't believe those numbers.

1219
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:29,020
Does that, does that, could that billion count when money goes in and out and back in type

1220
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,020
of thing?

1221
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:35,520
Like how when people win a $50 jackpot in Vegas, but they put the money right back in,

1222
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,520
you know, that type of thing.

1223
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,700
It's kind of like the money counts multiple times because it's going out and in the machines.

1224
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:45,860
I just, I mean, I don't believe those numbers.

1225
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:50,180
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Raginator says some people will gamble on

1226
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:54,980
virtually anything, including when or where a farm animal shits, sadly enough.

1227
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,540
Yes, but that's usually for charity.

1228
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,980
People will bet on Mugen, right?

1229
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,420
The I guess it's all fake currency.

1230
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,540
Yeah, that's all the bet and that's just fake.

1231
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,260
I mean, that's just fake.

1232
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,260
It's not money.

1233
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,820
Somebody's probably made it money.

1234
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,300
No, it's just, it's, it's for fun.

1235
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,580
You just go on there and you try to guess which character is going to win and then you

1236
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,580
never get it right.

1237
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,580
At least in my case.

1238
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,580
All right, well, we'll shift topics.

1239
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,460
Back to the salt mines.

1240
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,060
We're going to shift topics here and talk about a big change that's happening in gaming

1241
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,060
this week.

1242
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,740
Um, and uh, you know, I don't know if people will be betting on this or what have you.

1243
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,980
I bet people are going to be betting on, is it going to be successful or not?

1244
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:40,020
But the only one that stands to win or lose money would be Sony, the makers of PlayStation

1245
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,020
VR.

1246
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,020
That's right.

1247
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:46,460
I say gaming's changing this week because it's going to be the first console VR that

1248
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,460
is being released.

1249
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,380
And that is happening this week is what the, the Thursday, the 13th is when this is happening,

1250
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,380
right?

1251
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:57,500
Um, what's pretty impressive about this is that there are a ton of games that are going

1252
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,820
to be released, uh, the same day as the PlayStation VR.

1253
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:07,540
A partial list, Batman Arkham VR, Battlezone, Eve Gunjack and Eve Valkyrie, Harmonics Music,

1254
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:13,860
Harmonics Music's VR game, Hatsune Miku Project Diva X, uh, Job Simulator, Super Stardust

1255
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:20,260
Ultra VR, PlayStation VR Worlds, Rez Infinite, Rise of the Tomb Raider Blood Ties, Playroom

1256
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:23,620
VR, Thumper, Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

1257
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,300
Um, so that's just a partial list.

1258
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:30,300
I mean, there is a ton of games, uh, that are being released this week with the PlayStation

1259
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,300
VR.

1260
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,180
Now, some of these will require the PlayStation VR, but not all of them do.

1261
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:38,860
For example, Rez Infinite doesn't require the PlayStation VR.

1262
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,980
It's just, you know, it's going to be a totally different experience.

1263
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,980
Yeah.

1264
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,980
With the VR.

1265
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:46,900
So we've been talking, Loki and I, about the PlayStation VR and that we have both, uh, pre-ordered

1266
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,900
the device.

1267
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,900
Yeah.

1268
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,220
I pre-ordered it, was it, I want to say almost a year ago at this point.

1269
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,220
Yeah.

1270
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,220
I feel like...

1271
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,220
No, no, no.

1272
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,220
It wasn't a year.

1273
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:56,220
It was in March.

1274
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,220
Yeah.

1275
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,220
It was in March.

1276
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,220
It was the day.

1277
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,220
It was like GDC or something around there is when they kind of did their big announcement.

1278
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,140
Yeah.

1279
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,140
And that's when I first went up on Amazon and that's when I pre-ordered my PlayStation

1280
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,420
VR as well.

1281
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:09,380
So, um, are you looking forward to Thursday and the arrival of your PlayStation VR?

1282
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,420
No, cause I've already canceled my pre-order.

1283
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,420
Oh.

1284
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,420
So you canceled your pre-order.

1285
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,420
Why?

1286
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,420
Why'd you do that?

1287
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,220
I canceled my pre-order because one, it was expensive and I, it would really strap me

1288
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,900
as far as money's concerned.

1289
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:25,580
Two, I didn't think I would get a lot of use out of it, seeing as I have a Gear VR for

1290
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:31,380
my phone and I have an Oculus Rift DK2 that I don't really use.

1291
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:36,940
I kind of wanted a nice consumer headset because that would have been, you know, a lot nicer.

1292
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:42,660
But also I was kind of worried with all this, you know, PlayStation Plus stuff or not PlayStation

1293
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:48,820
Plus, PlayStation Pro stuff that, you know, are these games going to actually play well

1294
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,820
on this system?

1295
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,740
I mean, I guess it's supposed to, but what exactly is that going to, you know, mix in

1296
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,740
with it?

1297
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,740
And it's just, I don't know.

1298
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:00,300
And I just was kind of worried that that wasn't going to be, it wasn't going to, it's going

1299
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:06,540
to be just kind of an okay system, but really is it worth me dropping $400 plus money for

1300
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,540
games?

1301
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,540
And that's a lot of money.

1302
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,540
I could buy an Xbox One and games for that.

1303
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,540
I mean, seriously, why, why would I do that?

1304
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,540
And what would I get more value out of?

1305
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,900
Probably another game console versus PlayStation VR.

1306
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:23,740
And on top of that, then after I canceled it, the, you know, the embargo came up for

1307
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,580
people talking about the system and I got to watch the live streams from Giant Bomb

1308
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,580
and stuff.

1309
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:32,300
And it only confirmed what my worries were that it's a hot mess.

1310
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,300
Really?

1311
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,300
Yeah.

1312
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,700
Like the move controllers work about as good as the move controllers used to.

1313
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,860
I mean, they're just not very good at tracking.

1314
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:48,040
The graphics themselves are okay, but you know, it was caught, there was serious issues

1315
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,940
with the camera tracking where your head was.

1316
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:56,940
It was just like, it literally was bouncing around like crazy and it was just, the controls

1317
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,300
weren't as good as like, if you're playing on a Vive or something like that, it wasn't

1318
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,300
as accurate.

1319
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:07,060
And just, you know, if I'm going to drop that kind of money on a headset, I'm going to pick

1320
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,060
up something.

1321
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,060
I want something that's going to be good.

1322
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,060
And come on.

1323
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,500
And knowing what this trend, what they're doing nowadays with stuff, this is going to

1324
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,500
release now.

1325
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,820
And in a year or two later, there's going to be a better one.

1326
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,900
So why am I going to waste my time being an early adopter?

1327
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,620
Haven't I learned anything from the Kinect, the move, the blah, blah, blah.

1328
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,580
I mean, I know I've learned my lesson.

1329
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,580
I'm not going to do it.

1330
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:32,660
I still want to play some of that stuff because it looks fun, but is it worth five hundred

1331
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,660
dollars? No.

1332
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:41,260
Well, I'd love to tell you what I think of my PlayStation VR that I had preordered, but

1333
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,860
I independently came to the same conclusion you did this week and I canceled my PlayStation

1334
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,020
VR preorder a few days ago.

1335
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:53,300
And I think what it is, I think you kind of hit the nail on that.

1336
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:59,380
Well, it was money is a huge component and it's the fact that, you know, I can use this

1337
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,500
money to do a last minute trip to Chicago.

1338
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,860
And so it's kind of one of those things where do I necessarily need to be an early adopter

1339
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,580
on this? And I think that's what it kind of came down to for me is do I need to be the

1340
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:15,180
person that has this first at this price level when I'm kind of unsure of what the future

1341
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,220
holds. And I think something you said hits the nail on the head, which, you know, I'm

1342
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,900
sure Sony diehards would tell me I'm wrong on.

1343
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:28,020
But I, I do have extreme reservations about them releasing this and the pro in the same

1344
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:33,940
year. It's an extreme amount of mixed signals with, you know, what is this thing going to

1345
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,060
do that the pro can or cannot do?

1346
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:42,780
I just I honestly, as a consumer, as a gamer fan who, you know, I'm fortunate enough to

1347
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,820
have money that I can spend on games, but I don't have all the money in the world.

1348
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,940
I just I can't justify this and the pro, not that I don't want, you know, VR to be

1349
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,220
successful. I think it's going to be successful.

1350
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:59,380
I hope it is. I'm not sure if I hope Sony's platform is successful, but I want it to I

1351
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:03,580
don't want it to fail at all. I feel almost bad canceling it, but I shouldn't.

1352
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,300
I've got always hundreds of dollars.

1353
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:11,260
Right. And I'm always wary, though, of third party or third party like of accessories

1354
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:16,860
release after the fact, because look at like the support that even like move in 3D

1355
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:23,140
more when they're pushing 3D, like all their games are supporting 3D and like the move

1356
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,940
controller and stuff. And they even have a stupid looking gun thing that you could get

1357
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:29,140
for it. It was supposed to be the better way to play these games.

1358
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:33,140
And that just fucking fell off the table like, oh, no, we're not supporting it anymore.

1359
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,460
And then they bring back the move controllers to use with this because, oh, it's easy.

1360
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,740
We don't have to develop anything else.

1361
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,460
It's just it's old tech and it just it worked OK.

1362
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:46,260
I like the move controllers, but I'm worried that it's not going to be up to snuff for,

1363
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,180
you know, playing a VR game like this.

1364
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,220
And it's just. I don't know, I just can't see in all these games that are coming out or

1365
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:57,700
just seems like they're experiences, they're like shorter games.

1366
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:03,620
I mean, I don't really want to play like this tech demo of something, you know, for Final

1367
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:10,540
Fantasy and for, you know, Tomb Raider and for Batman and all in like was it, you know,

1368
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,020
Battlefront or something like that.

1369
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,380
It's not going to be a Battlefront game.

1370
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,900
It's going to be kind of something different.

1371
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,060
No, I don't want to play all these little experiences.

1372
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,380
Five hundred dollars is not worth tech demos.

1373
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:25,060
If I want to play that kind of tech demo shit, I will get a fucking better computer and a

1374
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:29,140
Vive or something, because then I could download tech demos for free and I can buy

1375
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:33,260
shit on Steam, which is probably way cheaper than the shit that they're selling.

1376
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,700
Forty, you know, the sixty dollars per game.

1377
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,740
No, I am not paying that kind of money.

1378
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,740
Yeah, and I think I started to see the dollars add up with especially when you start to

1379
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,900
see how many games are coming out and so forth.

1380
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,820
It's kind of like, whoa, I'm going to be paying for the PlayStation VR and then pay for

1381
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:53,140
this and this. And it's interesting because probably what even a month ago and I

1382
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,940
probably even said it on the show in my mind, I think when they announced the pro, I was

1383
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,820
kind of in my mind, I was like, OK, I'm going to keep the VR and I'm going to cancel the

1384
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:05,940
pro. But now, like, I don't know, I can't really pinpoint where the switch in my mind

1385
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,060
happened, but I think the opposite is going to hold true.

1386
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,420
I think I will end up keeping the pro and I think I am going to end up getting that

1387
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:16,020
system. But I'm not I kind of want to wait, wait and see where the VR is in a year.

1388
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:20,300
I want to see if this really does kind of become like the next must have thing in

1389
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:24,780
gaming or if it is kind of more like the even with the pro, I would just hold off on

1390
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,260
that because, like, I think that.

1391
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:32,820
I need to see what exactly what enhancements I mean, they're talking stuff, but like, I

1392
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,980
don't know what the enhancements are going to be.

1393
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,300
I feel like especially considering what I might be able to get selling my current

1394
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:43,580
PlayStation 4 to kind of upgrade it, I feel like it's a it's it's a smaller investment.

1395
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:47,260
It's only probably a couple hundred dollars at the end of the day, as opposed to five

1396
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,740
hundred plus dollars for the VR.

1397
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:51,940
Does that make sense? I guess so.

1398
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,460
That's that's kind of where I'm at.

1399
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:57,740
Dungeon Buster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says nothing wrong with a

1400
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,860
wait and see approach.

1401
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,820
Act Def says PlayStation VR will be worth it, but right now you probably don't need it.

1402
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,180
Yeah, I mean, I went gung ho when Kinect came out.

1403
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,260
I went gung ho when like all these systems came out and it was fine.

1404
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,020
I had fun with them. But like in the in the end, it's just like, why did I waste all

1405
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,740
that money on it? Why did I spend so much money on this stuff?

1406
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:24,700
Like, I don't know, like I just I still feel that compulsion to buy it.

1407
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:28,940
Yeah. Yeah. No, I even though like even though I've seen is kind of shit and even the

1408
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:32,980
reviews have been just kind of like I want to say Game Informer, give it like a C minus

1409
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,900
and like people are just like, oh, my God, you know, this is a mess.

1410
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,860
And they even like just watch the giant bomb stream.

1411
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,220
They have like four hours where they're playing around with it.

1412
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,140
Just watch it. I mean, you just seem like, holy shit, this is what they're fucking

1413
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,380
releasing in this state.

1414
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,340
It's just. I don't know.

1415
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,020
I mean, yeah, it's interesting, because I hadn't even seen or heard any of that when I

1416
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,020
finally made the decision.

1417
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:59,660
Well, and in the interest of disclosing something else that I kind of ultimately

1418
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:04,140
helped me be at peace with my decision, my pal Shane is keeping his preorder.

1419
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:09,220
So when you know that your good buddy who's over at your house at least once, if not

1420
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,780
twice a week, ended up buying it, you're like, you'll bring it over and I'll get to

1421
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,300
play it at some point.

1422
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:20,340
It looks nice. I may end up instead, you know, I saw that they announced a new the one

1423
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,380
of the first phones that's going to support that dream thing.

1424
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:30,900
The so the new VR, it's not really a headset, it's like lenses and stuff for.

1425
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,420
So there's the Google Pixel.

1426
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:38,180
I may upgrade my phone and do that instead, because none of that necessarily need new

1427
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,500
phone. But I mean, the payments aren't that expensive.

1428
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,740
And a nice new phone would be nice, I guess.

1429
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,300
And then I can see what VR looks like on that.

1430
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,460
I think the screen was at 4K or something.

1431
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,220
I mean, that'd be pretty sweet, you know, on a phone.

1432
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,180
But yeah, yeah, I don't know.

1433
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,940
Maybe that might be the route to go or nothing.

1434
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:03,140
I mean, my phone's fine. The other thought I was like, I should rebuild my DDR pads.

1435
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:06,020
I've been wanting to do that for a long time now.

1436
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:09,660
In fact, I'm actually in the point where I'm gathering all my notes because I had it

1437
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:13,900
before fucking Windows decided, hey, we're going to crash and erase everything.

1438
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:20,260
I had actually sketched out a new pad design I was going to make and then it went away.

1439
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,860
But I have all my notes on paper, so I'm going to put that digital again.

1440
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,340
All right. So, you know, it's it's it's a weird place.

1441
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:31,580
I wish the PlayStation VR a lot of success, but I just kind of want to take a wait and see

1442
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,860
approach where it's going to be any year.

1443
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:38,220
And I really feel like, unfortunately, the throwing the pro into it really muddled a lot

1444
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:43,020
of and it caused all these questions about is it going to be the best here or am I going

1445
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,260
to end up having to buy both, which is a lot to ask in a year?

1446
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:49,660
I just I think the reality is that muddled the message way too much.

1447
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:53,300
Like, here's the thing, even like with the pro and stuff like that, it's like, am I going

1448
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,220
to drop money on another console and what are my gains really on that?

1449
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,220
Or could I buy a new PC?

1450
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:03,660
Because like like even like games and stuff, we're going to talk about a little bit later,

1451
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:06,220
just like dealing with, you know, issues.

1452
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,020
I mean, PCs have their issues, too, with like some of these ported games.

1453
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:14,460
But like, am I going to just I can buy a lot of these console games, like even like No Man's

1454
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,420
Sky was like, oh, I got to get PS4 for that.

1455
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:22,220
They had on Steam. And then in the end, it's like, OK, I was anticipating that.

1456
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:26,620
I mean, it's like there's not a whole lot that you like, especially like PCs sounding

1457
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:32,340
really good because now I can get my No Man's Sky and I can get my Forza Horizon three.

1458
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,780
Why do I need two consoles?

1459
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,900
I can just have a PC, which funny enough, you would have thought that I would have been

1460
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,780
all over Forza Horizon three this week.

1461
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,380
But I just, you know, with with the traveling and with having other stuff to play right

1462
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,820
now, I just I haven't jumped on that bandwagon right away.

1463
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,220
I thought I would have been all about that.

1464
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:53,340
I probably won't end up buying Forza Horizon three until after I'm back from Vegas, honestly.

1465
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,340
So I have a month break between weekend trips.

1466
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:03,100
So but anyway, yeah, so I I'm going to I will probably end up holding onto the pro.

1467
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,300
I'm going to pick that up this year.

1468
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,340
And then next holiday, I'll evaluate VR.

1469
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,660
I want to see if it's still supported in a year.

1470
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,420
I want to see kind of what they're talking about.

1471
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,860
Microsoft does, because they're going to have their system.

1472
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,740
And who knows? By then, VR support.

1473
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,220
Yeah, because we don't know if Microsoft's going to win.

1474
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,620
We know they have AR, but we don't know if they're going to do VR.

1475
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,460
So it'll be interesting.

1476
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,860
Well, they talked about like their system would support VR.

1477
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:28,780
So. Let's see what they do.

1478
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,260
I mean, let's see. Oh, and maybe we'll see what the annex is by then.

1479
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,220
Maybe they'll have an announcement by that.

1480
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:37,140
We were going to do so good and not even bring up an X tonight.

1481
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,900
And there you go. There you go. You be quiet.

1482
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,140
All right. Well, I'm just let me put it this way.

1483
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,820
Here's here's my my parallel with the annex.

1484
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:47,660
And this is because like look at like we didn't know.

1485
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,740
Yeah, I had more about this, but like it's like we didn't really know too much about

1486
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,300
like PlayStation VR until now.

1487
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:59,780
And and I just think we're just going to be disappointed because we're making up in

1488
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,020
our head what it's going to be.

1489
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,980
And what they have is probably not as exciting as what we're imagining it to be.

1490
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,580
This all being said, I will be buying and playing the ever living shit out of the

1491
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,780
Rez Infinite just just so we're clear.

1492
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:17,460
Some of these games that don't require the VR, I will still be buying and playing the

1493
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,420
crap out of and starting with Rez.

1494
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:23,380
So just to be clear, this doesn't change my love of Rez whatsoever.

1495
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,260
All right. Let's let's move on to some more news.

1496
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,780
Loki. All right.

1497
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,340
So Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

1498
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,380
Guess what? There's still going to get mods on PlayStation 4.

1499
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:43,620
But there's a little bit of a catch with that.

1500
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,500
So mods are going to be coming.

1501
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:51,980
So first, the mods, I believe, are coming to Skyrim, ironically, first.

1502
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,620
And then later on, they're going to be coming to Fallout 4.

1503
01:17:56,180 --> 01:18:03,180
The main issue, though, that's going to differ between the what's available on PC and

1504
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:08,740
Xbox versus PlayStation 4 is PlayStation 4, you will not be able to use external assets.

1505
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:14,580
So you're only going to be able to use the assets that are on the disk or digital copy

1506
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:19,300
or whatever. So you're not going to have like, you know, reskins or, you know, new

1507
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:24,860
models, you know, lightsabers, that type of stuff that's not going to be available to

1508
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,900
you. But, you know, all the other stuff that tweaks and, you know, other tweaks that

1509
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,580
they have available, those could be something that you'll see.

1510
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,100
Is this to try to prevent nudie mods?

1511
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:39,180
No, this is I think to get around their weird compression and formats that they have to

1512
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,660
have their external stuff in.

1513
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,580
It's still disappointing, but I'll take it.

1514
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,940
Does that mean I'm going to buy Skyrim on PlayStation 4?

1515
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,780
Probably not. If I get an Xbox one, I'm fucking buying it on that.

1516
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:57,620
I'm just excited.

1517
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:01,180
At least they're getting some type of mods on PlayStation 4, because we were looking at

1518
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,220
exactly something's better than nothing.

1519
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:07,060
I'll take something. I don't really need the reskins and stuff like that.

1520
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:12,820
I mean, honestly, from what I had on PC, I didn't have a lot of things that changed the

1521
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,940
model. So I think some of the stuff was kind of cool, like the dubstep gun and stuff like

1522
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:18,460
that. And of course, you got to put the nudie mods in there, too.

1523
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,420
I mean, because because we're all children.

1524
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,700
So, I mean, that's fine.

1525
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,100
And, you know, I am a little disappointed that we're not going to have the Macho Man and

1526
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,740
Randy Savage dragons in Skyrim on console.

1527
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:37,580
But, you know what? Once again, this is where PC fucking this excels versus the goddamn

1528
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,180
consoles. All right.

1529
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:44,900
Well, then how about some really, you know, highly anticipated games being released on PC

1530
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:49,420
such as Final Fantasy 15, Final Fantasy 15?

1531
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,660
Some folks have been asking, is this going to come out on the PC?

1532
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,940
And in fact, the co-director of the game, Hajime Tabata, has said that if they are to

1533
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:02,980
develop a PC version of the game, it's going to take at least a year, probably more than a

1534
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:08,500
year. And this is in an interview with a Spanish website called Vida Extra, which, you

1535
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:13,540
know, is floating around out there and being translated and so forth, saying that on that

1536
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:18,060
hypothesis, not talking about something real, just an idea, something like this would take

1537
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,180
us more than a year.

1538
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,860
We should work to adapt the engine, which is very laborious, and from there develop its

1539
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:28,980
course. And this is a little bit of a changing course from what was said back in April

1540
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:32,860
where they were saying they were going to take a good, hard look at bringing Final Fantasy

1541
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:35,420
15 to PC after it was launched on consoles.

1542
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,220
But, you know, now that's going to be a huge amount of development time.

1543
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,500
But imagine the ways people would just mod Final Fantasy 15, you know?

1544
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,980
Well, I don't think it's necessarily a worry of modding.

1545
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:48,740
I'm just surprised it's going to take them so long, being that these platforms are now

1546
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:51,820
kind of very similar to the PC in the first place.

1547
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,740
I'm just surprised. I thought development time would have been shortened because of

1548
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,460
that. But I don't know.

1549
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,580
Yeah, you would think it would have been a shortened development time, but apparently,

1550
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:06,340
yeah, they say it's going to take a year to do that.

1551
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,940
So whatever. Got time.

1552
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,980
You still got to wonder if maybe it will depend on how well Final Fantasy 15 sells on

1553
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:18,060
consoles if they want to invest those resources to develop for PC or not.

1554
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:23,100
I think it's going to sell fine, but I think it'll sell fine, too.

1555
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,380
We'll see. But anyway, Loki.

1556
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:31,980
All right, so there's going to be some Pokemon Go updates, actually, I think.

1557
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:35,420
I'm not sure when these are going to be happening and if they've happened.

1558
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,820
No, not yet. So they're going to be doing some tweaks.

1559
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,260
They're going to be improving the gyms.

1560
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:46,100
So now when you're going to train your Pokemon on gyms, you can actually take up to six

1561
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:50,740
Pokemon because before, you know, when you battle a gym, you choose six, and when you

1562
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,580
train, you only choose one, which is kind of odd.

1563
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:57,940
Then also what's going to be nice is the medals that you earn right now, which are

1564
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,260
pretty just kind of pointless.

1565
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,580
They're actually going to have a point pretty soon.

1566
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,940
So any medals you earn for, like, say, catching the same type Pokemon or walking a

1567
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:13,100
certain distance and stuff, they'll give you perks to basically improve stats to

1568
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:18,580
catching Pokemon, make it a little bit easier to capture Pokemon or increasing the

1569
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:23,300
odds of capturing the same type or rare ones or whatever the case may be.

1570
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,700
And they were saying that the medals you get for catching a certain amount of Pokemon

1571
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,860
will affect the capture rates of their type.

1572
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:36,620
So like, you know, if you get poison type or something, it'll make it easier to catch

1573
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,100
poison type Pokemon or something like that.

1574
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,420
Well, that'll be good for folks who feel like it's too hard to capture things right

1575
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:41,700
now.

1576
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:45,500
Well, dude, yeah, I think some of the stuff that happened, like some of these

1577
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,380
Pokemon, it's just really silly.

1578
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:50,660
Like, you know, I've gotten Pikachus or whatever.

1579
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,540
That'll be like CP 31 or something like that.

1580
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:57,300
And I throw I mean, it's bright green on the ring.

1581
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,460
It's like, OK, this should be an easy capture.

1582
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:05,340
I do a spin balls, you know, it's a perfect throw and it's like, fuck you, I'm escaping

1583
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:05,980
and I ran away.

1584
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,260
It's like, what the hell is that?

1585
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,420
It's like I'm not going to waste a more powerful ball to catch this weak ass Pokemon.

1586
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:16,540
I got to admit, though, ever since I got the accessory, I've been playing more.

1587
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:21,500
I finally hit level 20 and I'm damn near level 21 in Pokemon Go because I evolved a

1588
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,940
bunch of shit today because I've been getting so much Pidgey candy and Rotata candy from

1589
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:29,500
just catching the shitty mon with the little app that I have or I'm sorry, the little

1590
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,100
physical device that I have.

1591
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,340
So I've been playing more of Pokemon Go thanks to that thing, I got to say.

1592
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:39,940
And the crappy thing about it, though, is that I run out of pokeballs, the regular ones

1593
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:45,180
so fast that actually I do only use great and ultra balls to capture Pokemon on the

1594
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,420
phone now because I need all my regular stuff to use my device.

1595
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:52,820
Otherwise, I end up in the shitty position that I was in when I was at gamer X and I

1596
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,740
actually have to buy more pokeballs, which sucks.

1597
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,940
Yeah, exactly what they would want you to do.

1598
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,260
Yeah, I know, I know I won't do that again.

1599
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,460
I promise I won't have to stick again.

1600
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,860
I just have to do a quick note for the live listeners while I'm showing that we are

1601
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,660
streaming right now.

1602
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:11,500
We're going up and down with the live stream and unfortunately is completely out of my

1603
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,100
control.

1604
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:17,020
It's some type of error I've not seen before on Winamp where it's saying it's hanging on

1605
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,060
the receiving authorization response.

1606
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,020
So unfortunately, this is on our server host side, which, you know, things have been

1607
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,700
running pretty smooth for the past few months.

1608
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:29,900
I wonder if the inclement weather out there is fucking things up or something, but it's

1609
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:30,700
unfortunate.

1610
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:34,380
You mean the hurricane doesn't push those packets even faster?

1611
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,620
That's not how it works?

1612
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:37,300
Shush.

1613
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,980
But yeah, unfortunately, that is happening live.

1614
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,340
But we're still recording everything for the sake of the podcast, folks.

1615
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,180
So, you know, we've been talking a few stories here.

1616
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:49,020
So we're just going to keep recording it for nothing else to say a podcast.

1617
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,340
I apologize to live listeners.

1618
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:54,260
But again, like a lot of live things, there are just some situations that are out of my

1619
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,420
control. And this is one of them.

1620
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,940
It's not our Internet's working fine here in the house.

1621
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,420
And, you know, there's no weird anomalies on our websites or anything.

1622
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,020
And I show it just went down again and then reconnected there.

1623
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,060
So it's that sucks.

1624
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:10,900
What can you do? I may be during the Classic Game of the Week, if this is still happening,

1625
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,940
I'll go do a quick recycle of our Internet, see if that helps.

1626
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,340
But unfortunately, I kind of doubt it.

1627
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,500
I really think this is on our server side right now.

1628
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,100
So there you go.

1629
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:24,540
All right. For now, though, before we get to the Classic Game of the Week, we still have

1630
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,620
some more news. And I want to talk about Bloodstained, right?

1631
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:33,820
This is the highly anticipated Kickstarter that, you know, it's not Castlevania, but

1632
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,900
wink, wink, it's going to pretty much be Castlevania.

1633
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,540
Well, in more of a sense than Mighty No. 9, it's not Mega Man.

1634
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:46,180
But anyway, so Bloodstained was pushed back to 2018.

1635
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:50,060
That was some news that came out is that they're pushing Bloodstained back to 2018, which

1636
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,420
is anyone surprised?

1637
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:52,900
Nope, didn't think so.

1638
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:58,580
But what does this mean for the Wii U and the Vita ports of the game?

1639
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:03,980
Because by 2018, is the Wii U really going to be a thing anymore?

1640
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,100
I mean, if they keep pushing back this NX thing, maybe it will be.

1641
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,420
But, you know, this brings up a very interesting question is that at the time they did

1642
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:15,100
this Kickstarter, they probably figured that the Wii U and the Vita versions were very

1643
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,540
important, but now not so much.

1644
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,260
Right. So, yeah.

1645
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:26,740
So there was some questions posed to Koji Igarashi about the Wii U port and so forth.

1646
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,140
And he said, yes, it's a complicated problem.

1647
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:32,940
As timelines move on, certain pieces of hardware become irrelevant.

1648
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:37,140
However, this was a game that was backed by people and we made promises to listen to

1649
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,540
them. They're the people that gave us life, so to speak.

1650
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:43,700
Any sort of change that we do or are considering that goes outside the scope of the

1651
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:48,300
promises we've made must be done with lots of explanation, care and done with lots of

1652
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,300
back and forth with them to see what options we have.

1653
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,980
So in other words, he's kind of saying that, you know, we kind of promised it on the Wii

1654
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:56,020
U, so we have to deliver it on the Wii U.

1655
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:01,060
But if we hear from our backers that this again, my interpretation is if we hear from

1656
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:04,820
our backers that they would be OK with us moving that to Nintendo NX or, you know,

1657
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,860
whatever that system ends up being, then we'll do it.

1658
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:10,540
So it'll be interesting to see what develops with that.

1659
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,580
I think a lot of people may have backed this because it was going to Wii U.

1660
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:19,140
You know, there's been a lot of Nintendo fans that want to see more software on Wii U.

1661
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:22,820
So I know there's a lot of people that backed Shovel Knight, that backed, you know, some

1662
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,460
of these other games to get the Wii U ports to happen.

1663
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,460
So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out if they choose to

1664
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,580
cancel the Wii U release, although I would think if they promise it for NX, then it's

1665
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:41,700
going to be OK. Or even better, if NX is straight up backwards compatible with Wii U's

1666
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:45,940
digital library. I know, I know, it's a stretch.

1667
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:47,780
However, who knows? Who knows?

1668
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:52,220
But if that could be a thing that maybe, you know, it would work on both.

1669
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,500
I hope that's a thing.

1670
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,780
That would be awesome.

1671
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,540
I purchased all digital on the Wii U.

1672
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:59,500
Yeah, of course, I'm very much expecting.

1673
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,740
We don't know how fucking networking works.

1674
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,780
And so we can't tie our stores together.

1675
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,900
We'll see. We'll see. We'll give them a chance.

1676
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:13,020
No offense, and that's not even necessarily a Nintendo thing, because, you know, there's

1677
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:17,260
been a lot of, no, actually, no, I think there's only a Nintendo thing now that I think

1678
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:18,860
of it. Yeah, fuck them.

1679
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,540
All right. Moving on, a few more stories here before we get to the classic game of the

1680
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,140
week. Loki.

1681
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:31,420
Speaking of fucking them, Digital Homicide, the wonderful shovelware developer who was

1682
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:37,580
suing Steam users for negative reviews or comments left about their games, they have

1683
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:44,340
decided to drop their suit, probably because they basically said that they are requesting

1684
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:50,940
to dismiss the matter since, I guess, it's a function of financial inability, even

1685
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:53,140
though they said that they believe their case was strong.

1686
01:28:53,140 --> 01:29:02,060
Yeah, as Alan Alchemy in chat says over at live.vognetwork.com, what a shock.

1687
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,300
Yes, I'm so surprised.

1688
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:06,100
We're going to die from that surprise.

1689
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:11,340
Yeah, so good for them, I guess.

1690
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:18,420
Well, let's move from talking about that studio to an awesome studio, and that is Jackbox

1691
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,540
Games, who's been on this show a couple of times.

1692
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,980
They were here for Jackbox Party Pack 1.

1693
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,580
Jackbox Party Pack 2.

1694
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,380
And guess what's coming out real soon?

1695
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,540
Jackbox Party Pack 3.

1696
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:31,580
And there is a release date that has been announced for that.

1697
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:36,940
October 18th is when the Jackbox Party Pack will be out on all of the different platforms

1698
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:41,580
that it's scheduled to come out on, except Xbox One, which comes out on the 21st of

1699
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:45,220
October. That's probably because the whole staggered kind of Xbox One stuff happens,

1700
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,540
usually happens on like Thursdays.

1701
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:50,780
So anyway, it's just a few days late on Xbox One that probably won't matter in the big

1702
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:51,620
scope of things.

1703
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:56,500
Jackbox Party Pack, again, several party games that you'll be able to play with smart

1704
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:01,860
phones, things that are designed for streaming as well, which is a thing that they've

1705
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,220
embraced. And they talked about that on some of their previous interviews.

1706
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:08,780
The games that will be included in the Jackbox Party Pack, Quiplash 2.

1707
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,460
So the sequel to that game.

1708
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,020
But that's the only sequel.

1709
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:13,780
The other games are going to be all new.

1710
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:18,100
Trivia Murder Party is the next game that they're doing.

1711
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,700
That's awesome.

1712
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:22,740
That's a deadly quiz show where you match wits with a trivia obsessed killer.

1713
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,660
So that'll be fun.

1714
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,020
I love that.

1715
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:25,740
I love that.

1716
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:31,300
There's also one called Gespionage, which they're saying is the data mining guessing

1717
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,620
game. That looks like it'll be fun based on the previews.

1718
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,860
T-K-O.

1719
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:38,020
That's T-E-E-K-O.

1720
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:43,380
It is a T-shirt game where you battle your custom T-shirts to the death.

1721
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:47,460
So it sounds like you make custom T-shirts and then they battle each other, like probably

1722
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,820
a voting type thing that a lot of the Jackbox Party Pack games do.

1723
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:57,380
And then lastly is a game called Fakin' It, where one of your friends is hiding something

1724
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,100
in this game for tricksters.

1725
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,900
I'm assuming it's probably like one of those like two truths and a lie type of games.

1726
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,340
So that will be in the Party Pack as well.

1727
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,500
Only one controller required for navigating menus.

1728
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,420
Otherwise, everything is played on mobile devices and tablets and so forth.

1729
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:16,340
There's an audience mode for streamers, allowing 10,000 people to participate with some

1730
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:17,300
of the games as well.

1731
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:18,860
Yeah, I know.

1732
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:20,180
I love Trivia Murder Party.

1733
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,740
That's the best name out of all those.

1734
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:26,260
So that'll be a lot of fun. So good luck to our buddies over at a Jackbox game with the

1735
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,140
release of that.

1736
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:30,980
I mean, I understand with broadcasting stuff live and stuff like that, it's too bad they

1737
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,340
don't have like TV shows like that where you can play like 10,000 people at once, like

1738
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,340
actually live.

1739
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:39,980
Oh, you mean like one versus 100 like they used to have on Xbox 360?

1740
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:44,260
Yeah, I'm talking about like, you know, like a TV show on TV.

1741
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,180
Not necessarily.

1742
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,100
You know.

1743
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,300
Oh, like something.

1744
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,140
Oh, didn't they try to do it?

1745
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,460
Wasn't there that Seacrest hosted thing on NBC, the million dollar...

1746
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,060
What the hell was it?

1747
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,660
Oh, I've already lost interest.

1748
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:03,660
All right, but you'll be picking up the Jackbox Party Pack, right, Loki?

1749
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,140
I haven't picked up the other ones.

1750
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,580
Probably not.

1751
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:05,900
What?

1752
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,020
I don't play with a lot of people, so yeah.

1753
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,060
You'll probably play it at somebody else's house.

1754
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:13,180
It's like I'll play the PlayStation VR through Shane.

1755
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,540
Because he'll bring it over here.

1756
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,140
So you'll play...

1757
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,780
I'll try the VR when he brings it over.

1758
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:18,660
All right.

1759
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,860
Anyway, let's travel back to a simpler time when we weren't...

1760
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,260
We didn't...

1761
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:25,740
We couldn't play games on our mobile phones.

1762
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:28,220
In fact, we probably didn't even have mobile phones at all.

1763
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,220
Our phones were still stuck on the wall and you had to have a cord.

1764
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:34,020
We're going to take a trip to memory lane with our...

1765
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:34,420
What are you talking about?

1766
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,580
I play games over my phone all the time.

1767
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:39,820
Oh, is that like calling the weather or the...

1768
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:40,780
No, it's a modem.

1769
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:41,980
Oh, yeah.

1770
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:42,380
All right.

1771
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:43,260
Tricky trick.

1772
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:43,580
All right.

1773
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,220
Modems were the only way to do it.

1774
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,540
It's the classic game of the week.

1775
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:53,020
And thanks to the magic of radio.

1776
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:54,540
Here she is, everybody.

1777
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:55,660
Dark Sakura.

1778
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:56,780
Hi.

1779
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:57,660
How are you?

1780
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,660
Full of orange chicken.

1781
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:00,780
Yes.

1782
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,420
Thank you for going to Panda Express.

1783
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,260
I appreciate that.

1784
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,180
That's what I do.

1785
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:04,780
That's right.

1786
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,380
So I'm going to take a moment to enjoy the fried panda.

1787
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,580
The Dark Sakura got me from Panda Express.

1788
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,340
And you're all going to check out this week's classic game of the week.

1789
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,260
Yay.

1790
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:14,860
Dark Sakura.

1791
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,020
What did you pick for the kids, boys and girls?

1792
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:20,700
I picked a game that I wanted to buy at gamer X.

1793
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:22,620
It was 176 bucks.

1794
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:23,700
176 bucks.

1795
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,020
And I think I already have a copy.

1796
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:31,780
Lords of Thunder, specifically the really awesome version that

1797
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,380
came on the PC Engine duo.

1798
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,580
Listen to this music.

1799
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:37,860
I want to rock.

1800
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,260
Isn't that great?

1801
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:40,100
It's pretty great.

1802
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,740
It's totally a product of its time.

1803
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:46,780
Um, in Japan, it was known as Winds of Thunder and it was a shoot

1804
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,740
them up by Hudson's Loft and Red Entertainment.

1805
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,780
Lords is so much more metal.

1806
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:52,460
Right.

1807
01:33:53,980 --> 01:34:01,220
At any rate, um, it came out for the Turbo Graphics, uh, duo, um, in 1993.

1808
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,580
And it also was ported to the Sega CD in 1995.

1809
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:12,260
Um, the Turbo CD version came out on virtual console, um, in February, 2008.

1810
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:17,620
And the game itself is an unofficial followup to Gate of Thunder.

1811
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,660
And as you can tell, it's got a pretty bad-ass rocking soundtrack.

1812
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,260
It's metal as fuck.

1813
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,220
We don't talk about Gates on this show.

1814
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,820
Oh, Gates of Thunder.

1815
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:29,380
Oh, that's fine.

1816
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:29,780
That's fine.

1817
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:30,980
Okay.

1818
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:31,380
That's fine.

1819
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:32,940
Girl.

1820
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:40,940
Anyway, the game is, uh, about an evil God and his dark generals that get

1821
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:48,740
woken up and fuck shit up in the world and inherit this armor from your ancestor

1822
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:54,580
Drack, the legendary knight Duran, goes off to defeat the army, not want a grandpa

1823
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,100
Drack.

1824
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,140
It's the ancestor.

1825
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:03,820
Might not be his grandfather, but anyway, you select, uh, this, uh, the stage.

1826
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:07,180
You actually get the first six stages and you can select them kind of like how it

1827
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,580
happened in Thunder Force Three.

1828
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:13,420
Um, and then you pick one of four armors to use that gives you different

1829
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,580
shots and different bombs.

1830
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:21,460
Um, the game itself is great, especially the Turbo version.

1831
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:25,220
The Sega CD version was kind of considered a bit of a weak sauce

1832
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:31,860
translation, um, even though, uh, it was fairly close to it.

1833
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:38,380
It's basically the Sega CD really needed shooters and, uh, Lords of Thunder was

1834
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:40,940
a really, really good shooter to have on it.

1835
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:43,540
It just was dated by the time it came out.

1836
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,060
I think it came out like two years later.

1837
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:52,220
Um, but if you've got the virtual console version, you'll have the

1838
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:56,420
Turbo graphics version and it is far superior of the two.

1839
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:58,060
It's just such a good game.

1840
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,940
And really it's just standard shooter fair.

1841
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:02,580
Wow.

1842
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:06,900
I don't know why all of a sudden in the middle of the video, do they do that on

1843
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:10,380
YouTube now, they just play ads for other stuff right in the middle of the video.

1844
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:12,820
I don't know because I have ad block.

1845
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:13,820
That's ridiculous.

1846
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,260
I thought this computer had it too.

1847
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:15,900
It's red.

1848
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,700
There's a particular ad block for Google.

1849
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:18,820
Well, that's embarrassing.

1850
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:19,980
Or for YouTube.

1851
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,060
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

1852
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:21,780
Bring back the metal.

1853
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:22,940
Thank you.

1854
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:23,940
We want our butt rock.

1855
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:30,100
Uh, anyway, well, since I've been completely derailed, my bad.

1856
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,220
And there's only the two versions of this.

1857
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:36,300
We'll go ahead and put the nail in the coffin for Lords of thunder.

1858
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:37,580
Get it.

1859
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,140
Yeah.

1860
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:38,860
Coffin.

1861
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:45,780
Okay.

1862
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:46,260
All right.

1863
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:46,820
There it is.

1864
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:52,020
Your classic game of the week, Lords of thunder, but only on the Turbo.

1865
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,100
Well, the Sega version's okay.

1866
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,460
Not the Sega, not the Sega CD.

1867
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,500
Fuck Sega CD.

1868
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:58,940
Throw it in the garbage.

1869
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,220
I have one.

1870
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:00,900
Burn it.

1871
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:01,860
I have two of them.

1872
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,740
I have three of them.

1873
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:03,340
Technically.

1874
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:04,500
You know what would be metal?

1875
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:05,220
I have a CDX.

1876
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,260
Destroy one of them.

1877
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,340
But they're expensive now.

1878
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:12,060
I'm not so metal that I'm not frugal.

1879
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:13,460
All right.

1880
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,260
Lords of thunder is your classic game of the week.

1881
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,660
Thank you, dark Sakura.

1882
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:19,740
Have a rocking day.

1883
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:20,580
You're welcome.

1884
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,300
And I will.

1885
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:40,260
So while we were out last week, some other news that they announced was that they're going to be bringing over a game to America that has been out in Japan since like 2011.

1886
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:43,980
It's been out in Japan for five years and we're finally getting it.

1887
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:45,700
It's not a video game though.

1888
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,540
It's a trading card game.

1889
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:54,540
The Final Fantasy trading card game will be coming out here in the States on October 28th, 2016.

1890
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,420
So that's pretty exciting.

1891
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:58,220
The first set coming out called Opus One.

1892
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:00,260
It has 216 cards with it.

1893
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:07,980
Apparently there's also going to be some other decks available at launch, including Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 10 and Final Fantasy 13 starter sets.

1894
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,260
And of course there will be booster sets because that's how trading card games work.

1895
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:24,420
So all the cards feature designs by Yoshitaka Amano, Tetsuya Nomura, Akihiko Yoshida, there will be standard and premium foil versions of it.

1896
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:29,260
So if you want to see how this game works, there's already some YouTubes that are going out there.

1897
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:33,260
Square Enix is putting some stuff up on the YouTube about how to play the game.

1898
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:38,020
And I got to admit as a Final Fantasy fan boy, this sounds like something I might want to learn how to play.

1899
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:38,980
It looks pretty cool.

1900
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:45,860
Do you know of any other games you can think of that would translate well to a trading card game, Loki?

1901
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:49,140
Do you think there's any other series you'd like to see become a trading card game?

1902
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:55,100
No, I can't really think of anything.

1903
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:56,780
Surprisingly, there's not really...

1904
01:38:56,820 --> 01:39:01,420
I actually know it would be kind of fun or kind of cute, but I don't know how they would play.

1905
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:05,340
But Enter the Gungeon, I'd like to just because the art style is pretty awesome.

1906
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,140
I'd love to see that.

1907
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:06,580
Yeah.

1908
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:06,980
Yeah.

1909
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:07,380
All right.

1910
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,780
Yeah, I don't really know.

1911
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:12,260
I like this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1912
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,540
Act Def says, I use STAB on Aerith.

1913
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,900
Maybe that'll be a move you can actually do in the trading card game.

1914
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:19,340
I don't know.

1915
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,540
I like retro stuff, so it would always be cool to see.

1916
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:24,700
I want to see the Guardian Legend become a trading card game.

1917
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:25,580
All right, that might...

1918
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:26,980
That may not work so well.

1919
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:27,700
How does that work?

1920
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:28,940
I don't know.

1921
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,100
How does the game work?

1922
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:32,660
Two phases, shoot and explore.

1923
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,900
Doesn't necessarily have to be a complex card game.

1924
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,980
No Man's Sky, the collectible card game.

1925
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,020
Oh, there you go.

1926
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:42,980
You're on a planet and there's stuff there.

1927
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,180
You leave the planet.

1928
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,540
And some of the cards are just blank.

1929
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:50,100
This planet looks exactly like the other planet.

1930
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:54,620
Or there was a card here that we've removed from the deck.

1931
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,940
Every week that you play, you have to remove two cards from your deck

1932
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,740
permanently because some features got eliminated.

1933
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:02,380
I like that.

1934
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:05,700
You've now achieved the worst score possible on Steam.

1935
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,820
All right, I'm just kidding.

1936
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:10,940
Dungeon Buster is quoting me there saying,

1937
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:13,380
wow, I'm just throwing a little unnecessary shade.

1938
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:13,620
Come on.

1939
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:16,620
Actually, the concept of No Man's Sky and exploring play...

1940
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:18,460
Actually, that would, I mean, all seriousness,

1941
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,500
actually kind of make a cool trading card game, I think.

1942
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,340
You know, I'm sure, please.

1943
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:25,380
I'm sure there's got to be other space exploration card games

1944
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,860
that are out there and plenty.

1945
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:30,220
I'm just not as well versed in the tabletop side of things,

1946
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:32,020
but I'm sure I've seen something like that before.

1947
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,140
So, you know, but something that, you know,

1948
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:36,700
kind of branded with that No Man's Sky stuff.

1949
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,340
Or how about we do Day of the Tentacle?

1950
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:40,940
You can have the three different timelines

1951
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,820
and then you do stuff and it affects the other timelines.

1952
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,740
Well, anyway, regardless,

1953
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,620
I'm looking forward to the Final Fantasy trading card game.

1954
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:49,980
I don't usually get super into trading card games.

1955
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:53,060
You know, I used to play Magic back in the day,

1956
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,980
but not so much anymore.

1957
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,860
But Final Fantasy, you know, I got a weak spot for that series.

1958
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,060
So I'll check that out.

1959
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,660
Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news

1960
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:03,980
and quickly touch on a few other things that happened through the week.

1961
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:06,740
OK, so I remember correctly,

1962
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,380
I think, wasn't TwitchCon going on at the same time as GamerX

1963
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:10,060
or something like that?

1964
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,380
TwitchCon was the exact same weekend as GamerX in a different city.

1965
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,260
It was in SoCal in San Diego this year.

1966
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,420
Right, so one of the things that was announced

1967
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:22,180
shortly around there was that Twitch Prime is going to be a new thing.

1968
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:26,860
It's a premium experience that is included with Amazon Prime.

1969
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,500
And so with that, you get a free game or a free game loot every month.

1970
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,500
So, cool, I guess.

1971
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:38,380
I mean, since you are paying for Amazon Prime,

1972
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:41,180
it's nice to get more and more things with it.

1973
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:45,460
Along with, it looks like with Twitch Prime,

1974
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:49,700
you can also, let's see here,

1975
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,740
get ad-free viewing.

1976
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,900
So that's kind of nice.

1977
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:59,740
And exclusive emotes and chat badge.

1978
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:03,300
And one free channel subscription every 30 days.

1979
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:08,220
That alone is going to be huge for the economy on Twitch,

1980
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:12,860
because there's a lot of streamers that make a secondary income off,

1981
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,020
or even maybe primary income for some people,

1982
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,580
off those subscriptions.

1983
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:21,500
So the fact that many people like myself already have Amazon Prime.

1984
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:24,900
So for me, this is really a something for nothing for me,

1985
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:26,620
even though, yes, I know it's not nothing

1986
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:29,460
because I'm paying yearly for Amazon Prime.

1987
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,260
And this is going to be an excuse for them to jack up the price again.

1988
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:35,940
However, I enjoy Amazon Prime enough

1989
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:39,340
that I would have renewed it with or without this.

1990
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:42,660
So the fact that this is going to be a part of it too is cool.

1991
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:46,660
And so this will allow me to throw free money every month at a streamer.

1992
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:50,940
And maybe someday if I stop doing so many podcasts in a week

1993
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:54,300
and do more streaming, it's something that could be benefit me too,

1994
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:56,860
is that some folks could subscribe to my stream

1995
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,460
and kick money back that way.

1996
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:59,940
So that's huge.

1997
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:04,460
Yeah, so I was really happy to hear this news.

1998
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:07,060
I think a lot of us were waiting to hear,

1999
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,660
you know, what's going to come of this Amazon marriage.

2000
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,100
Is there going to be a Twitch Prime?

2001
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:13,500
People were asking that the very first day this was announced.

2002
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:14,780
So that's pretty cool.

2003
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:19,180
So Oculus, during their Oculus Connect keynote,

2004
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:23,260
they had revealed that the Oculus Touch controllers

2005
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:25,180
are going to be coming out this year.

2006
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:28,780
Looks like December 6th, and they're going to cost $199.

2007
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,700
Along with that, they're include two games,

2008
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:34,580
including VR Sports Challenge and The Unspoken.

2009
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,620
You know, and I remember that like Oculus,

2010
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:41,620
one of the things that they were touting is that they were cheaper than the Vive,

2011
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,900
but not anymore.

2012
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,300
Not with this.

2013
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:49,580
I mean, you kind of need this for the experience, and that's expensive.

2014
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,740
I mean, I guess that is an advantage

2015
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:55,540
that PlayStation VR has, too bad their controllers are shit.

2016
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,580
So they need to come up.

2017
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:59,460
No, seriously, all they need to do is fix the camera issues

2018
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,940
where it can't track you very well.

2019
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,740
That can be done with a firmware update,

2020
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:06,100
and come up with a new controller, new motion controller,

2021
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,340
and then I'll be on board.

2022
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:11,980
All right, well, moving on to free games.

2023
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:14,580
Maybe you don't want to pay that type of money for your gaming rig,

2024
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,020
but if you want something free,

2025
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:19,180
you can get Beyond Good and Evil free on the PC,

2026
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:22,140
but you do have to have a Uplay account.

2027
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,780
But I think most people have that anyway,

2028
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,980
because they probably got convinced to sign up for one

2029
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,740
through one of the other Ubisoft games.

2030
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:30,980
But you will be able to get Beyond Good and Evil free on PC.

2031
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:34,460
That is free from October 12th, so that's going to be this week.

2032
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,740
Yeah, so they're one game free a month thing that they've been doing.

2033
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,860
Yeah, so that's pretty cool.

2034
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,140
So some other games that were released,

2035
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:45,500
Prince of Persia, Sands of Time, Splinter Cell, Rayman Origins, The Crew,

2036
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,700
Beyond Good and Evil is this upcoming month.

2037
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:51,100
And some people, this is like one of their favorite games ever made,

2038
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:53,020
and there's always those rumors about a sequel.

2039
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:56,380
So I think some folks will be excited to check that out,

2040
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:59,420
and maybe some folks that missed that the first time around.

2041
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,980
Also, Street Fighter V is chugging along.

2042
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:04,740
Now the people have calmed down a little bit.

2043
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,580
Now they have story mode in the game.

2044
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,860
But some other extras are going to be coming to Street Fighter V,

2045
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:13,380
including Halloween costumes and stage updates

2046
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:15,860
to go for the month of October.

2047
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:18,220
The costumes will be available for $4.

2048
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:19,780
That will be 10 different colors there,

2049
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,980
and the special Halloween stage can be purchased for $2

2050
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:27,380
or 40,000 fight money, which I'm assuming is the in-game currency.

2051
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:30,020
I haven't played a lot of Street Fighter V, admittedly.

2052
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:33,140
So they were able to do that at New York Comic-Con,

2053
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,340
which I think happened this past weekend.

2054
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,100
They were able to try that out.

2055
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:38,540
And then the exclusive content is going to be available

2056
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:42,380
from October 11th this week through November 29th.

2057
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:43,700
And then that's it.

2058
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:45,380
It is limited time stuff.

2059
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:49,220
So if you are wanting to get your Halloween on, check that out.

2060
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:54,180
That is a Ghostly Ryu, a Franken-Nash, and a Wolfman Nakali

2061
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:58,140
are the different costumes that you can check out.

2062
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:00,420
Supposedly, though, Street Fighter V not the only game

2063
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:01,940
that's getting Halloween costumes.

2064
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:06,300
Overwatch also going to be getting some spooky loot boxes.

2065
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:09,620
I'm assuming this is going to be very similar to their...

2066
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:12,340
They didn't call it the Olympic event, but it was the Olympic event,

2067
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:15,380
the Summer Games event or whatever they're doing.

2068
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,980
This was leaked from the Xbox store.

2069
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:20,980
There's a screen that got snapped that's floating around the internet

2070
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:24,300
that shows that you can purchase Halloween loot boxes.

2071
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:28,780
So, yeah, probably something that is going to come out

2072
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:31,420
with some new Halloween skins for the characters

2073
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:34,820
and probably some poses and things like that as well.

2074
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:39,820
Also, something that has been noted is that the box art

2075
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,140
contains the skull logo, a purple skull logo,

2076
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,700
that is often associated with Sombra,

2077
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:48,380
who's supposed to be the next rumored hero in the game.

2078
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,700
It was actually rumored to be the first hero announced for the game,

2079
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,100
even though they did Anna instead.

2080
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:56,820
And Blizzard has also been said somewhere else

2081
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:00,220
that the next character for Overwatch is coming sooner rather than later.

2082
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:02,820
So it could all be lining up,

2083
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:06,020
or it could just be a typical Blizzard misnomer.

2084
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:08,100
But who knows? That could be coming very soon.

2085
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:11,540
It should be noted, though, that BlizzCon is not too far away.

2086
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:13,940
I think it's the first weekend in November.

2087
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:16,340
So I don't think they would hold off the Halloween stuff

2088
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,300
till early November. That doesn't make sense.

2089
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,700
But wouldn't it be great if they would come out at BlizzCon

2090
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:23,860
and say, there's a new character in Overwatch today?

2091
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,460
That might be a big thing. So who knows?

2092
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:29,420
We'll see. Halloween events in different games.

2093
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:30,460
Enjoy them.

2094
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,820
Meanwhile, let's take a look at the new things

2095
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:34,860
that will be arriving in stores this week.

2096
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,700
Loki, what about in the US? What's in stores this week?

2097
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,500
There's a lot of things coming out of this week.

2098
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:41,220
So let's start off with 100-foot robot golf.

2099
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,700
That's coming out in PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.

2100
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:45,580
Oh, God, it's all the PlayStation VR games.

2101
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:47,340
Oh, here we go. Get a book.

2102
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:50,060

Dragon Quest Builders on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

2104
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,620
That was that kind of Minecraft-type game.

2105
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:58,940
Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour

2106
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:01,860

2109
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:16,300
Looks like Roost on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2110
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:18,900
Rise of the Tomb Raider 20-year Celebration

2111
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:21,260
on PlayStation 4.

2112
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,260
I guess that's the PS4 version of it,

2113
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:25,340
because didn't we not get that?

2114
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:26,940
Wasn't that...

2115
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:29,060
Because Rise of the Tomb Raider never came out on PlayStation 4.

2116
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,140
Yeah, it's going to be, though, now with the...

2117
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,220
Yeah, this week.

2118
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,820
And then Valkyrie Drive Bikuni.

2119
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,100
That's on PlayStation Vita.

01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:42,980

01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,180

01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,060

01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,340

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,

2130
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,700
Loading Human, PlayStation VR Worlds,

2131
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:14,580
Rigs Mechanicized, Combat League.

2132
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:18,500
And then, of course, Sports Bar VR,

2133
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:21,820
Super Hypercube, Super Stardust Ultra VR,

2134
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:25,020
The Assembly, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood,

2135
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:28,140
Wayward Sky, and World War Tunes.

2136
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,940
Those are all PlayStation VR.

2137
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:32,060
On PlayStation VR and PlayStation 4,

2138
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,500
we have Resident Infinite, Roller Coaster Dreams,

2139
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,260
and it looks like Thumper.

2140
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,340
That's also on PC as well.

2141
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:42,060
And then Shadow Warrior 2 on PC.

2142
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,540
Dun Dun Patchy Resurrection on PC.

2143
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,980
Disney Magical World 2 on 3DS.

2144
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,900
Farah Bell on PC, Mac, and Linux.

2145
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:58,020
Also, Manuel Samuel is going to be coming out on Xbox One.

2146
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:02,660
And then yet another toys game

2147
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,620
that's going to be coming out one week from today,

2148
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:08,140
and that's Skylanders Imaginators.

2149
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:10,460
That's on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,

2150
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:15,780
Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

2151
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,140
Busy.

2152
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:19,860
Yeah, it is very, very busy.

2153
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:21,140
Did you get through it all? Is that it?

2154
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:21,860
That is it.

2155
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,300
All right, let's go over to Japan.

2156
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:27,060
And Japan is also getting the PlayStation VR this week,

2157
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,100
so it's causing a few things to come out with that.

2158
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,700
Although my list is not as extensive as the one Loki has,

2159
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:33,620
but I know there's a lot of digital releases,

2160
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:36,140
and my list doesn't capture all the digital stuff.

2161
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:37,940
But what we do have coming out in Japan this week,

2162
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:39,460
of course, PlayStation VR.

2163
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,860
Also, there are some games as well on PlayStation 4.

2164
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:44,340
Rigs Machine Combat League is out.

2165
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,620
We also have PlayStation VR Worlds.

2166
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,460
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens randomly in there,

2167
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:52,260
even though, of course, that's not necessarily a VR game.

2168
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,780
Rise of the Tomb Raider is also out in Japan this week,

2169
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,300
and that's kind of the highlights from the list that I have here,

2170
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:00,380
but those are all things that you can expect in a physical form.

2171
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,380
Again, this list is not going to capture anything that is digital.

2172
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:06,940
In Japan, Paper Mario Color Splash is out this week,

2173
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,700
as well as Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens.

2174
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:11,820
So we got the color splash here in the US,

2175
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:14,340
looks like a little early, compared to Japan.

2176
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,900
So that is out this week in Japan.

2177
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:17,860
On the PlayStation Vita,

2178
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,140
the Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens is out there as well.

2179
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,740
A game called Plastic Memories in regular and limited edition,

2180
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:27,100
and Kangoku-to Mary Skelter in regular and limited edition.

2181
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:29,980
And lastly, on the 3DS this week,

2182
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,260
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens.

2183
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:35,380
Otherwise, a slow week on the 3DS, a very, very busy week.

2184
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:38,780
Next week, however, was some new amiibo coming out

2185
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:40,500
and a Mario Party game.

2186
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:43,220
So Mario Party Star Rush, specifically.

2187
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:46,180
So that is the Japanese in stores.

2188
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,220
How about UK?

2189
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:50,700
So there's Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary World Tour

2190
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:53,020
on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2191
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:56,420
Gears of War 4 on Xbox One and Windows 10.

2192
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:59,300
And then here they lie on PlayStation 4,

2193
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,340
even though this is a mobile game,

2194
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,180
I just thought that the name that they have listed on here is hilarious.

2195
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:05,820
Really Bad Chess.

2196
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,860
That's on iPad and iPhone.

2197
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:11,700
A Resident on PlayStation 4.

2198
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:18,180
Let's Sing 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Wii.

2199
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:19,900
That's kind of surprising.

2200
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:23,500
And finally, Emergency 2016.

2201
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,460
All right.

2202
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,820
Busy week releases all across the globe,

2203
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:31,780
but especially with the PlayStation VR, certainly.

2204
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:33,140
Let's get to the mailbag.

2205
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:35,180
["The Orange Lounge Radio"]

2206
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,660
Every week, you guys send us emails.

2207
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:43,860
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

2208
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:47,140
is the place to send us an email if you are so inclined.

2209
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:49,420
And we read emails on this show.

2210
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,340
Usually after a break, we come back to an empty mailbox

2211
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,300
because people go...

2212
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,300
They don't email us because they know there's no show that week,

2213
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:58,380
and then they don't email us because there was no show during the week.

2214
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:01,860
But we did get one email this week, so we will read that email now.

2215
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:04,140
And it's from our pal, Ragenator, who says,

2216
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:07,100
Hi, guys, it's Ragenator yet again with a last-second email.

2217
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:08,180
What time did he send this?

2218
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:11,220
Oh, my God, he sent this during the show at 6.30.

2219
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:12,620
Well, lucky you.

2220
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:15,620
All right, anyway, I can't think of a timely subject for this email,

2221
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,740
so instead, I will pose this question.

2222
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:20,940
Suppose that for whatever reason, you're filthy, filthy, filthy rich

2223
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:23,820
to the point where even Bill Gates would say, damn.

2224
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:26,460
Now, with that being said, if you could create your idea,

2225
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:29,140
a geeked-themed man cave...

2226
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:30,980
Why has it got to be a man cave?

2227
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:31,900
I get what you're saying.

2228
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:35,100
Where space and money are no object, what would you do?

2229
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:36,940
For me, I'd do the following.

2230
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,620
The man cave would be in the basement, and to get down to the man cave,

2231
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:42,580
you would go down a slide and land in a ball pit.

2232
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:45,300
One area would have a custom-made, one-of-a-kind,

2233
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:48,060
thousand-inch 32K 3D TV...

2234
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:49,380
Dude, those don't exist.

2235
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:50,820
With a 7.1 sound system...

2236
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:52,260
That's why it's custom.

2237
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:54,300
And every console hooked up to it,

2238
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:58,540
plus a top-of-the-line PC that would even make NASA's computers jealous.

2239
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:02,020
I'd also have one of those speaker systems that look like retro jukeboxes

2240
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:05,180
with built-in lights set up to play all my music.

2241
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:07,980
In another area, I'd have two of every arcade game

2242
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:10,260
and pinball table ever made set up.

2243
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,140
How big is your basement, dude?

2244
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:14,940
Plus stuff like skeeball and other arcade favorites.

2245
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:18,460
In a third area, I'd have an actual in-home pizzeria.

2246
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,860
Throughout the basement, I'd have tons of gaming posters,

2247
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:24,220
80s and 90s pop culture posters,

2248
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:28,500
for example, Beavis and Butthead, Nick cartoon posters, etc., on the walls.

2249
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:30,900
Plus, I'd have enough decorative lighting around

2250
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:33,220
to make Spencer's gifts jealous.

2251
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:36,180
That email there from our pal, Raginator.

2252
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,940
So, what would you do with a limitless budget?

2253
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:41,540
What would be in your man cave?

2254
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:44,620
Or will man cave, Loki?

2255
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:46,860
I don't know. I mean, it's just...

2256
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,940
What's the point of having a man cave at that point?

2257
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:52,900
Just buy, like, make your own family fun center

2258
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:55,420
or something like that, or just a theme park.

2259
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:56,380
I mean, like, I guess...

2260
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,740
I'm gonna answer this for Loki.

2261
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:00,780
Loki's dream man cave would have a passcode

2262
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:02,900
that his wife and kids don't know.

2263
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:06,220
No, that's not true at all.

2264
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:07,260
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2265
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:08,140
I wouldn't need to lock my wife out.

2266
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,180
She just wouldn't want to come down there.

2267
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:11,220
That's fine.

2268
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:13,180
And, you know, she can have whatever she wants.

2269
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,220
That's fine.

2270
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:15,820
My kids is just...

2271
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:18,140
Yeah, it wouldn't matter.

2272
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:20,700
I always drive by, like, on my way to work and stuff.

2273
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:23,260
I see these, like, somewhat, not high-rise buildings,

2274
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,900
but, like, you know, just several stories, tall buildings.

2275
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:30,260
I'm like, wouldn't it be fun just to fill that full of, like, game stuff?

2276
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,180
So, something like that.

2277
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:33,540
I'd just buy a building and fill it full of game stuff.

2278
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:36,580
Or open up, or, hey, if I want to make some of that money back,

2279
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:39,500
even though I have a limitless amount of money,

2280
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:42,740
it would be nice to open up a really kick-ass, like,

2281
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:45,740
arcade fun center thing with, like, ridiculous shit

2282
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:47,060
that you only see in, like, Japan.

2283
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:50,900
You know, like, those indoor ski slopes and fucking, you know,

2284
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:54,020
beach and all sorts of crazy stuff.

2285
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,420
But mainly arcade games.

2286
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:00,180
Yeah, I feel like if I had that type of budget, I would want...

2287
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:03,900
I'd make the most kick-ass laser tag game on the face of the goddamn earth.

2288
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:06,340
There you go. You're gonna bring back Qsar.

2289
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:07,380
I would buy that shit.

2290
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:10,620
You're gonna combine every old Qsar that went into...

2291
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:13,060
out of business into one super Qsar that you're gonna run.

2292
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:14,220
It would be a super Qsar.

2293
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:15,260
I love that.

2294
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,060
Committed reality super Qsar.

2295
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,100
Ah, there you go. Now that's a low-key idea.

2296
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,140
I like that.

2297
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:21,180
That is a low-key idea.

2298
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:24,140
Let's see, for me, yeah, I'm kind of in that whole part of...

2299
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:26,820
I don't know if I would want that all in my house,

2300
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:27,900
because that would be...

2301
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:30,140
I mean, admittedly, to have all that stuff in your house

2302
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:32,260
would kind of be a little lonely.

2303
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,900
You know, I mean, not to sound like all depressing,

2304
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:37,300
but it's like, you know, okay, so I could enjoy all this,

2305
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:39,740
but it would be really boring to not be able to enjoy it with other people.

2306
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,900
I mean, obviously, Alan lives here. He'd be able to enjoy it too.

2307
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,540
And obviously, I would have friends over now and then,

2308
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:48,580
but maybe this is like the super cheesy side of me or something.

2309
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:49,620
But I would want...

2310
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:51,940
Like, if I had that time of space and set up and so forth

2311
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:55,060
to set up this arcade that's like fun all the time,

2312
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,500
I would want kids who can't have fun all the time

2313
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:00,020
to be able to experience that as well.

2314
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:03,860
So I would want a space where responsible,

2315
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:07,180
well-behaved and parented children...

2316
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:10,380
When I say parented, I mean, you know, disciplined,

2317
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:11,940
you know, that type of thing.

2318
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:16,420
Kids that have good fucking manners could come and play machines

2319
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,580
and aren't going to wreck them and be ridiculous.

2320
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,660
Even if they wreck them, you can have a fleet of people to repair shit.

2321
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:22,700
It wouldn't fucking matter.

2322
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:26,500
I want a place where kids are not going to bully other kids.

2323
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,940
That's why I don't want those kids there.

2324
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:29,180
I'm not so worried about the machine.

2325
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:32,540
Somebody's going to spill a soda on a machine and it's going to suck,

2326
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,980
but I don't want those kids that are going to bully the other kids.

2327
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:40,180
I want it to be a place where people can have fun and that type of thing.

2328
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,380
Is that cheesy?

2329
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:43,460
But I swear to God, it's my honest thing.

2330
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:48,860
It's like I would be so bored if I had all that in my house alone.

2331
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:51,140
It's like, you know, you hear about the crazy rich people

2332
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:52,580
that live in a castle up in the...

2333
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:54,740
Like Enya, right?

2334
01:57:54,780 --> 01:58:00,180
Enya lives in a fucking castle in the middle of God knows where

2335
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:03,340
and then the United Kingdom somewhere, if even that.

2336
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:06,380
She lives in a castle with, what, cats?

2337
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,460
And her giant quill pen that I'm sure she uses to write her songs.

2338
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,300
Like, you know, she's...

2339
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,980
Wouldn't it be a little boring eventually?

2340
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:14,820
I don't know.

2341
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:16,540
So is that a cat-soul?

2342
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:22,020
Maybe I just opened a cat cafe.

2343
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:22,740
Cat cafe.

2344
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:25,140
That would be enough for me.

2345
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:26,900
All right, so anyway, there you go.

2346
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:31,700
Sorry if that's cheesy, but those are the answers to the questions that we got.

2347
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:34,580
So if you want to send us cheesy questions, you sure can.

2348
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:37,420
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

2349
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:40,140
is the place where you can send your emails.

2350
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,660
So we got a few more stories for you guys

2351
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:45,260
before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2352
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:46,740
But first, Loki.

2353
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,220
All right, so, you know, you may remember a few years ago,

2354
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:53,100
there was...

2355
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:57,060
Was it Lizard Squad was like a little hacking click or whatever

2356
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:59,140
that would just do your ass shit.

2357
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:01,260
And they would not be allowed in my arcade.

2358
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:03,860
Yeah, they were responsible for, I guess,

2359
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:06,340
or they claimed responsibility for DDoS attacks

2360
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:10,740
against Xbox Live and PlayStation Network in 2014.

2361
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:13,460
Well, apparently, they have been convicted

2362
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:17,140
for over 50,000 counts of cybercrime,

2363
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:20,260
including harassment, fraud, and data breaches.

2364
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:24,980
So apparently, they were two 19-year-olds.

2365
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:27,220
And yeah, they were charged,

2366
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:32,500
and I guess the charges carry a 10-year maximum sentence in prison.

2367
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:37,740
Well, bye.

2368
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,540
Somebody's got to get punished for this.

2369
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,780
You can't... These are crimes that you're committing,

2370
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,660
and you don't get to just get away with them scot-free.

2371
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:47,540
So have fun in the slamma.

2372
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:52,340
Yeah, so apparently, they were both under Lizard Squad and Poodle Corp.

2373
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:57,380
And I guess they even had hacked Taylor Swift's Twitter account.

2374
01:59:57,420 --> 02:00:00,740
And what else?

2375
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:04,780
They had conspired with other members of Lizard Squad

2376
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:07,460
to run cyber attacks for higher websites,

2377
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:11,500
trafficking stolen payment card accounts.

2378
02:00:11,540 --> 02:00:16,980
Well, it's probably they're being made an example of a little bit,

2379
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:19,860
but that's what has to happen to deter other people from doing it,

2380
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:22,980
because it shows that, yes, they will do something about it.

2381
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:28,500
So I hope they can catch a few more of these folks that do this shit,

2382
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,420
and show that you can't get away with it.

2383
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,380
Anyhow, shifting gears here a little bit,

2384
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:36,900
let's talk about something that Phil Spencer, of course, the head of Xbox,

2385
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:38,940
was talking about bad reviews this week.

2386
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:42,420
And he kind of dropped a truth bomb on some people.

2387
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:44,980
And this was in an interview that he was doing this week,

2388
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:47,900
where he was discussing about the ReCore,

2389
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,700
because ReCore was a game that came out recently.

2390
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:53,460
And now ReCore has an average score of 63% on Metacritic.

2391
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,900
And here's a quote from his interview.

2392
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:59,940
I think there are certain reviews that are written more to get clicked on

2393
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:03,820
than they are to actually accurately reflect the quality of the game,

2394
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:06,220
and that kind of bums me out.

2395
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:09,140
On the reviews, honestly, I thought some of the reviews were a little harsh

2396
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:11,300
in their terms of the view of the game.

2397
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:14,300
I didn't try to tell anybody that it was a 10, speaking about ReCore.

2398
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:17,140
I think we knew, as with any games, that there are certain things,

2399
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,500
if we started from the beginning and we knew what do we get,

2400
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:22,060
there's a couple things we would have done slightly differently.

2401
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:25,140
But then he goes on to talk about Forza Horizon 3,

2402
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:27,740
where, you know, he was talking about Forza Horizon 3

2403
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:30,020
and the scores that that's getting, saying,

2404
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:32,020
we're very proud of how the game ended up,

2405
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:35,420
and I think 7, 8, 9, like anywhere in there, is fine.

2406
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:39,660
3 or 4, I mean, somebody gave Forza Horizon 3 a 4,

2407
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:41,900
and that's when he said, I think there are certain reviews

2408
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:43,500
that are written more to get clicked on

2409
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:46,460
than they are to actually accurately reflect the quality of the game,

2410
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:47,860
and that kind of bums me out.

2411
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:51,820
And I thought that was a pretty darn good truth bomb

2412
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:54,100
he kind of dropped on people, is that, you know,

2413
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,980
there's people that write some click-baity shit out there,

2414
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:01,100
and we've certainly accused certain journalistic websites out there

2415
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:04,860
of this in the past, and I'm sure that this is still going on, right, Logie?

2416
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:07,740
Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a lot of these sites

2417
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:10,780
that are a little harsh or whatever, especially if you read the reviews

2418
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:13,180
and the reasons that they give for it, sometimes they're a little,

2419
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:17,860
like, political, you know, it's just, it's silly stuff.

2420
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:21,100
But to be a fair counterpoint, I mean, you know,

2421
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:24,060
if a group of 100 people play a game,

2422
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,420
there's gonna be somebody that doesn't like it,

2423
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:28,180
for whatever weird reason, right?

2424
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:32,660
I mean, like, even Rotten Tomato movie reviews and stuff, you know?

2425
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,980
I mean, there's gonna be people that love it,

2426
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:38,660
but there's always gonna be that one in a crowd who doesn't like it.

2427
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:40,860
Like, I'm sure this has happened to all of you.

2428
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:43,860
Haven't you seen a movie that you hated,

2429
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:46,140
that everybody else, like, lost their shit over,

2430
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:48,180
and you're like, why is this movie that good?

2431
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:51,460
That's why you just find reviewers, like, that you kind of align with

2432
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:54,740
as far as what their tastes are versus what your tastes are,

2433
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:59,060
and then kind of go off of that, or go off of, you know,

2434
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:02,100
just even, like, some of these playthroughs and stuff

2435
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:03,820
when they do previews and stuff, and just judge it

2436
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:05,540
based off of what you're seeing on there, and...

2437
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:08,260
Are you saying you have to review reviewers?

2438
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:10,180
Not necessarily.

2439
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:13,460
Just don't, like, if, I mean, obviously, if you're reading the reviews,

2440
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:18,260
don't just go by the score, find out what made them come to that conclusion.

2441
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:20,580
And if their reasoning is kind of ridiculous,

2442
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:23,540
then you can, you know, make that judgment based on that,

2443
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:27,260
because some people don't like certain types of games,

2444
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:30,660
and for whatever reason, those people, they have them review those games,

2445
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:33,460
and I don't know.

2446
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:35,820
I can only assume that because that would have been

2447
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:37,860
such a dumb decision in the first place,

2448
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:40,660
you know, to have somebody that hates a genre review that genre,

2449
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:42,860
that they're really doing it just to clickbait,

2450
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:46,700
but, or they're just that dumb, editorially.

2451
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:48,940
Going to Tigerclaw in our chat room, saying,

2452
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:51,620
you can't take Rotten Tomatoes seriously, though.

2453
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:54,260
Even if movies get bad reviews, and you end up loving it,

2454
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:57,340
it's just a critic's opinion, but your own opinion matters more.

2455
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:58,900
You know, and I think he's bringing up a point,

2456
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:02,100
and this happens a lot with movies, is that there's movies that critics hate,

2457
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:03,700
and it's usually comedies, right?

2458
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:06,020
The critics usually hate them, but, like, you know,

2459
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:10,980
the Joe average movie viewer might like it a lot more,

2460
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:13,700
and especially, like, genre movies, too, right?

2461
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:16,500
Right, and, well, and I think also, a lot of these reviews,

2462
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:18,500
especially when it comes to games, it's not necessarily,

2463
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:21,380
you kind of have a preconceived notion of whether you're gonna like a game or not.

2464
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:24,540
It's more of, like, is it functional?

2465
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:26,460
You know, if the game is glitchy as shit,

2466
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:31,300
or if it runs poorly, or it's just, you know, controls terribly,

2467
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:36,100
I mean, that's gonna play into it a lot, versus, you know,

2468
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:39,340
oh, this game, I didn't like the graphics in it, or something like that.

2469
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:42,340
You know, well, you'll know based off of watching, you know, the trailers,

2470
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,900
and the, I mean, I don't know, you're gonna have an idea

2471
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:47,540
of whether you like it or not, and, you know,

2472
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:50,780
also maybe wait and see how it is,

2473
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:53,900
or if you don't want to purchase something, rent it,

2474
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:54,900
and try it that way.

2475
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:58,380
Oh, my God, the way, we've always fucking done it back in the days

2476
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,660
when there's actually rental places.

2477
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:03,780
I mean, there's Redbox now in the US,

2478
02:05:03,820 --> 02:05:06,820
but I'm sure there's some place you can rent something,

2479
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:11,740
maybe even Gamefly, to try a game out before you want to buy it.

2480
02:05:11,780 --> 02:05:13,060
ActDeft in chat says,

2481
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:15,820
you don't judge something solely based on reviews.

2482
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:17,580
Yeah, and that's, I think that's really important.

2483
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:20,180
Kind of the gamers have to take some onus for this, too,

2484
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:23,340
is that you can't do 100% of your judgment on reviews,

2485
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:26,300
but this is where live streaming, I think, has really stepped in a lot,

2486
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:29,740
is that I think there is a lot of people to kind of watch other people play games,

2487
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:31,300
and make a decision based off that.

2488
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:33,780
It's just an extension of what we probably did as kids,

2489
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:35,260
where you would want to buy a video game

2490
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:36,460
because you went over to your friend's house,

2491
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:39,340
and you played it over there, and you won it at your house.

2492
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:42,540
Akayjudo in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2493
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:45,660
Movies, music, games, books are all subjective.

2494
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:47,900
I never listen to critics or gamers.

2495
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,100
I know what I like and what I don't.

2496
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:54,700
So, good feedback on this topic there.

2497
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:57,180
But, you know, I just thought that was very interesting

2498
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,300
that, you know, the head of Xbox went so far

2499
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:01,900
as to kind of call out clickbait in that regard.

2500
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:03,180
Thought that was very interesting.

2501
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:04,340
Anyway, a few more stories for you.

2502
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,460
Loki.

2503
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,780
All right, so this is kind of interesting.

2504
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:08,100
I'm not sure what's gonna come of this,

2505
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:12,100
but I do like the developers, so...

2506
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:17,260
PewDiePie and also the developer,

2507
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:20,020
or one of the designers of Goat Simulator,

2508
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:23,420
Armin, I'm gonna try to pronounce his last name here,

2509
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,140
Ibris, I butchered that.

2510
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:29,340
Anyways, Armin, we'll just go by his first name,

2511
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:32,780
one of the designers there, and I follow him on Twitter.

2512
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:36,740
So they're actually collaborating to develop some games.

2513
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:38,020
So the first game they're gonna release

2514
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:42,340
is a mobile game called the PewDiePie Tuber Simulator,

2515
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:46,140
where you actually play as a YouTuber.

2516
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,620
And I know they have similar games like this

2517
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:50,700
on Steam already, so I'm kinda curious to see what it is.

2518
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:54,100
But basically, you know, they're saying that,

2519
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:56,980
you know, as far as a partnership,

2520
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,860
there's comedy's huge entertainment,

2521
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:01,780
but it still fills in its infancy in the game industry.

2522
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:04,300
Felix and I would like to work on changing that.

2523
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:05,860
So they're looking to make funny games,

2524
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:09,740
and Goat Simulator's pretty funny.

2525
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:12,500
Yeah, I'd be curious to see what happens.

2526
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:15,060
Yeah, it's a weird partnership, but I'm with you.

2527
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:17,140
It's like, well, the developers of Goat Simulator are really,

2528
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:19,980
you know, that was a hilarious game, so, you know.

2529
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:24,500
Yeah, it's silly. I mean, I don't know.

2530
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:26,100
Can't be that bad.

2531
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:29,140
How bad can it be? Famous last words.

2532
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:32,380
All right, anyway, last tonight before we open up the Skyplines

2533
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:35,420
at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, some more Twitch news.

2534
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:37,660
This actually, I think this came out after TwitchCon.

2535
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:40,540
I don't think this was something they actually unveiled at TwitchCon,

2536
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:44,940
but this is, you know, we've seen this develop before.

2537
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:47,100
You remember that whole bit system that they had

2538
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:50,940
where you could actually tip live streamers in bits,

2539
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:53,620
which would turn into real-world money, basically?

2540
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:56,140
I think it was like, I don't know, it was 10 cents or 1 cent per bit

2541
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,180
or something like that.

2542
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:00,100
Well, it was announced this week that you will be able to,

2543
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:03,260
if you don't wanna actually spend money on Twitch,

2544
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:08,420
even though now with Twitch Prime, Twitch can be ad-free for you,

2545
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:14,460
if you want, you can watch ads on Twitch to earn bits.

2546
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:16,540
Kind of similar to, like, mobile games, right?

2547
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:17,580
Yeah, mobile games do that a lot.

2548
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:19,940
Yeah, you watch an ad and you earn some of the in-game currency.

2549
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:20,980
And I'm fine with that.

2550
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:23,700
Yeah, that's kind of interesting. It's not mandatory, I suppose, right?

2551
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:26,220
So if you sit through a 30-second interactive ad,

2552
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:29,380
you can earn some bits, and they're slowly rolling this out.

2553
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:32,740
You can still choose to purchase 100 bits for $1.40.

2554
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:35,980
So I think it must be 1 cent for each bit that you do there.

2555
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:38,980
But now you can earn the bits by watching a sponsored video

2556
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:40,780
or perhaps doing a survey.

2557
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:44,500
They say that this will typically reward users with 5 bits,

2558
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:46,420
but some offers will be worth up to 100.

2559
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:49,300
I imagine the more interactive ones that are surveys and stuff

2560
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:51,260
will probably reward you more.

2561
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:53,780
Or sign up for such-and-such website and all this.

2562
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:55,180
It'd be very interesting to see.

2563
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:57,300
I hate any of those apps.

2564
02:08:57,340 --> 02:08:59,580
It's not mandatory, so it's interesting.

2565
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:02,060
Yeah, it's not mandatory, but, like, for example,

2566
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:05,700
Tap My Katamari, or not Tap My Katamari,

2567
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:09,020
the Katamari, oh, it was Tap My Katamari.

2568
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:10,060
That's what you're thinking of.

2569
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:12,500
Yeah, OK. Tap My Katamari, that was the...

2570
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:14,180
OK, yeah, Tap My Katamari, they tried...

2571
02:09:14,220 --> 02:09:15,220
Cookie Clicker Katamari.

2572
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:16,980
Cookie Clicker Krem... Yes, thank you.

2573
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:22,020
So that game, they added that right before I saw playing it,

2574
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:26,780
all these offers you could do to earn in-game currency and stuff,

2575
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:28,660
and none of them fucking worked.

2576
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:31,220
Like, you go to a website and answer some survey questions

2577
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:32,780
and shit like that, and it's like,

2578
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:35,140
yeah, there'll be a short delay before when that says

2579
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:36,900
credit to your account.

2580
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:39,220
Two weeks later, still fucking nothing.

2581
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:41,180
So that kind of shit, I don't like.

2582
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:45,460
Watching the video's fine, because that shit at least works.

2583
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:46,180
I mean, that's kind of cool.

2584
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:48,020
But every time I hear about this tip system,

2585
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:52,140
it just, it reminds me of, like, those fucking adult chat rooms

2586
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:54,700
where you're, like, tipping the people that have sex on camera

2587
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:55,660
and shit like that.

2588
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:59,540
It's just, like, that's where they should have the ads.

2589
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:02,340
Get free money for that shit.

2590
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:05,340
But, like, tipping people, like, pennies, you know,

2591
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,380
it's kind of silly.

2592
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:10,620
And it makes me wonder, though, if we stream this show on Twitch,

2593
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:12,740
not that we would ever leave VOG or whatever,

2594
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:15,260
but if we were to, like, stream this show on Twitch,

2595
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:18,580
could we actually get people throwing their bits at us

2596
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:20,580
and use that money to buy new mics?

2597
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:21,820
Show us your bits.

2598
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:24,820
Show me them bitties!

2599
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:28,140
Show me your naughty bits.

2600
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:29,900
Oh, man, there's so many puns.

2601
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:31,460
So many puns with this.

2602
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:35,460
Anyway, this is, I guess, is opening up in the U.S.,

2603
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:38,340
so it's something that you can participate in here in the U.S.,

2604
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:39,860
where our show is based.

2605
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:42,540
But you can use the bits in any chat channel

2606
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:44,180
that has the cheering enabled,

2607
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:46,740
which I don't think cheering is enabled for everybody yet,

2608
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:49,740
but they are looking at expanding that to more users in the future.

2609
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:52,620
So, yeah, very interesting how this is developing,

2610
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:54,940
and probably more and more people are going to get in

2611
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:56,700
on streaming this video game stuff.

2612
02:10:56,740 --> 02:11:00,260
So, very curious to see how that unfolds.

2613
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:03,180
Anyhow, it is time to open up the Skype line

2614
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:06,060
at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2615
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,740
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio.

2616
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:09,900
Kaijuto in chat says,

2617
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:12,780
Fuck those bits, but if peeps want to use them, that's cool.

2618
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,700
Yeah, I guess the cool thing is,

2619
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:17,660
at the end of the day, this really doesn't affect

2620
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:20,260
the, you know, content itself or whatever.

2621
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:21,860
None of it's mandatory.

2622
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:26,580
Although, you got to worry that there might be some streamers out there

2623
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:28,900
that are going to be like, they're going to hold their streams hostage,

2624
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:32,540
where it's like, I'm not going to do anything unless I get a thousand bits.

2625
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:34,420
So, exactly like those adult chat rooms.

2626
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:37,060
Yeah, but yeah, I'm not going to show my boobies

2627
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,500
until I get so much, you know, money or whatever.

2628
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:40,660
But then I would think,

2629
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:42,540
but see, I think there would be a trade-off for that,

2630
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:44,100
because if you do that,

2631
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:48,420
it's very easy to just go find something else on Twitch.

2632
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,860
You know what I mean?

2633
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:51,260
But sometimes they have a nice rack,

2634
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:52,740
and so you stay there.

2635
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:58,540
Anyway, again, it's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2636
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:00,140
If you want to give us a call,

2637
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:03,540
and we can talk about anything we've discussed in our show.

2638
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:05,980
No, but it's silly to hold your channel hostage

2639
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:07,980
for what is literally pennies.

2640
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:09,460
Yeah, literally pennies. Yeah.

2641
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:13,220
And does the streamer get that full penny,

2642
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:14,500
or do they get like a fraction of the penny?

2643
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:18,940
Well, because it costs $1.40 to get 100 bits,

2644
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:20,940
that's where Twitch is getting their money.

2645
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:24,180
Because you're buying $1 in currency for $1.40.

2646
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:25,180
Yeah, that's where it's coming from.

2647
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:26,340
Anyway, our phone is going off,

2648
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:28,540
so I do want to get to some of the calls.

2649
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:30,660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2650
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:31,820
Hey, this is Marcus.

2651
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:33,300
Hey, Marcus, how you doing?

2652
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:34,940
I'm doing fine, thanks.

2653
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:36,420
Saw you at GamerX, actually.

2654
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:38,180
I remember running into you there.

2655
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:40,060
Thank you for coming to the panel. I appreciate that.

2656
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:40,780
Yeah, it was great.

2657
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:42,620
Hope you had... And thank you for the ribbon.

2658
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:43,980
Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

2659
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:45,540
So, how many ribbons did you get?

2660
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:47,780
A ton. They're all in the backseat of my car still,

2661
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:48,860
because I had to...

2662
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,460
It was... I had it on the gear shift,

2663
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:51,420
and it was getting in the way.

2664
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:52,340
But there's a ton.

2665
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:53,700
I walked out of there with a ton of ribbons.

2666
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:57,580
I actually... I ended up getting a special guest ribbon,

2667
02:12:57,620 --> 02:12:59,420
and I can't tell you how,

2668
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:00,620
but I got a special guest.

2669
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:02,860
It was like my coup de grace at the very end,

2670
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:05,020
was I was actually a special guest of GamerX

2671
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:07,020
for the last two minutes of the show.

2672
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:08,700
So, that was exciting.

2673
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:09,460
Yeah, if you didn't see that,

2674
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:11,260
if you're not following me on Twitter,

2675
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,220
there was, like, people had these ribbons,

2676
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:14,180
was like the big thing this year,

2677
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:16,060
and it wasn't just the con itself,

2678
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:19,100
but, like, you know, certain booths had ribbons,

2679
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:20,980
certain cosplayers had ribbons,

2680
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:22,540
and I was like, nobody told me

2681
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:24,020
this was gonna be a fucking ribbon party.

2682
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,580
I would have had some VOG ribbons made.

2683
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:26,660
Why didn't I know this?

2684
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:29,060
So, that is the lesson learned.

2685
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:31,500
Between Dragon Con and GamerX,

2686
02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:34,340
I am fucking getting some podcasting ribbons made.

2687
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:36,020
That's the lesson I'm learning from these,

2688
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:37,700
because I like ribbons.

2689
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:39,540
But anyway, my goal was to collect them all.

2690
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:42,540
And even some of the organizers for GamerX

2691
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:44,420
saw my lanyard and were like,

2692
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:45,660
you have a lot of ribbons.

2693
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,340
And I was like, gotta catch them all.

2694
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:48,060
It'll make them laugh.

2695
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,260
So, anyway.

2696
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:50,300
Anyway, sorry, Marcus.

2697
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,540
What did you call in to talk about tonight?

2698
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:55,660
Well, I actually wanted to call to talk about PlayStation VR.

2699
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:56,940
Yeah.

2700
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:59,980
So, I also am one of those people, you know, pre-ordered it

2701
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:02,060
the minute it went up.

2702
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:05,580
Been wondering about that pre-order ever since.

2703
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:09,540
It's really tough right now.

2704
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:12,540
I mean, the text reviews I've read,

2705
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:15,820
from what I saw, they looked really positive.

2706
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:17,940
At least the scores were pretty high.

2707
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:21,660
But I know Loki mentioned that Giant Bomb streamed

2708
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:24,060
for like a bunch of hours, PlayStation VR.

2709
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:25,740
And it was like a mess.

2710
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:28,140
And I watched that stream too.

2711
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:31,180
And I almost, you know, tipped it over for me.

2712
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:32,540
It's just, it's like,

2713
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:38,180
what was happening was, it was beyond anything.

2714
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:40,940
I have a Oculus Rift.

2715
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:42,540
I also have a Gear VR.

2716
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:44,060
Those are fine.

2717
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:46,820
But what I saw on that stream was just like,

2718
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:51,980
extreme nausea, just like, it would be so bad.

2719
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:56,660
But so many reviews never mentioned anything like this.

2720
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:59,540
So it was like, what was happening with Giant Bomb?

2721
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:02,020
Some people have suggested, oh, they just set it up wrong.

2722
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:05,300
But I mean, they had other games there before,

2723
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:07,820
previously, Super Hypercube, et cetera.

2724
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:09,540
I don't see how you really set that up wrong.

2725
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:11,940
Yeah, I know, I think they set it up fine,

2726
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:13,660
because they had people there before

2727
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:17,540
with Super Hypercube, et cetera, on PSVR in the same setup.

2728
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:18,860
And it ran just fine for them.

2729
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:21,020
But it was just this stream now

2730
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:25,140
with their new review units in, it was a nightmare.

2731
02:15:25,180 --> 02:15:27,740
But I have seen some other negative feedback out there,

2732
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:29,180
not just Giant Bomb, but you know,

2733
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:30,940
after I canceled the VR already,

2734
02:15:30,980 --> 02:15:32,820
I saw like another review on it

2735
02:15:32,860 --> 02:15:34,540
that was kind of negative in nature.

2736
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:35,940
But you know, what's interesting, Marcus,

2737
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:38,780
we just had this conversation here in studio about reviews

2738
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:41,260
and how much can you trust reviews, right?

2739
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:43,980
So, yeah, I think most of what I've been seeing

2740
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:47,140
has been kind of just average to kind of like,

2741
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:50,100
eh, you know, maybe it's not the best thing.

2742
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:52,220
Like, I know Game Informers was kind of,

2743
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,540
it was the sea mines that they gave it.

2744
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:56,700
I'm trying to think of what other reviews I read.

2745
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:59,620
But yeah, I mean, I just kind of go by

2746
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:00,900
what we're seeing in the stream,

2747
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:02,740
because I think the Giant Bomb one,

2748
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:05,460
I wouldn't, I think that they're pretty competent

2749
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:07,260
as far as setting something up.

2750
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:09,500
If they are having trouble setting it up accurately,

2751
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:10,980
then I would assume that the end user

2752
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:12,300
is going to have trouble setting it up,

2753
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:14,300
then if that's going to be the case.

2754
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:17,980
So I would take what their experience was during that.

2755
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:19,620
It's not necessarily even a setup.

2756
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:23,780
It was just, even the tracking on it is very obvious

2757
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:25,860
that it's not tracking that very well.

2758
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:27,220
Well, let me ask you this, Marcus,

2759
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:30,260
because you sound like a VR enthusiast, you know,

2760
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:33,020
because you already have what, Gear VR and Oculus.

2761
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:35,540
So you've already kind of put your feet in the water,

2762
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:37,900
so to speak, so I think that already puts you

2763
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:39,380
on a different perspective, necessarily,

2764
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:40,780
than where Loki and I are.

2765
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:43,540
But have you actually played PlayStation VR?

2766
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:45,540
Have you gone to one of these Best Buy things

2767
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:47,980
or some type of event where you can try it?

2768
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:50,540
Yes, I've played it.

2769
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:53,700
I got to play it at E3.

2770
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:56,340
You know, pretty nice setup there.

2771
02:16:56,380 --> 02:17:00,140
But I had, you know, previously I've had no problems with it.

2772
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:03,940
It's been fine. It's a really comfortable headset.

2773
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:05,300
I can't say, you know, the quality of the games

2774
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:09,620
are what I was looking for, but I thought it was just fine.

2775
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:13,100
So I don't know, could something have happened,

2776
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:16,860
like, between the development units and these retail units?

2777
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:19,060
Because it's like, I don't,

2778
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:21,060
I never experienced anything like that.

2779
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:23,100
And it's kind of wild.

2780
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:25,220
I'm not sure I would let one stream

2781
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:26,580
have such an impact either.

2782
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:28,380
I mean, you know, with as much as people

2783
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:29,620
enjoy Giant Bomb or whatever,

2784
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:31,100
I'm not sure I would let one stream

2785
02:17:31,140 --> 02:17:32,300
sway my decision with that.

2786
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:33,940
Yeah, that's true. I'm just scared.

2787
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:37,180
Like, you know, it does require really good setup or whatever.

2788
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:41,860
And what it is, it's a $600 decision, right?

2789
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:42,380
Yes.

2790
02:17:42,420 --> 02:17:44,500
I mean, that's ultimately what's making all of us nervous.

2791
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,860
And what made myself nervous is, like,

2792
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:49,420
this is a $600-plus decision.

2793
02:17:49,460 --> 02:17:51,980
I mean, okay, you could argue, well, I don't have the move.

2794
02:17:52,020 --> 02:17:54,900
So it would be a $600 decision, basically.

2795
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:57,660
You know, and on top of that, the price of games.

2796
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:59,620
And so, yeah, that's, you know,

2797
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:03,340
am I wanting to pay $600 to be an early adopter on this?

2798
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:06,140
And I think I finally came to the conclusion that,

2799
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:10,100
no, I want to spend $600 to go to Chicago and see my friends.

2800
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:13,500
And I will wait and maybe get the VR next time.

2801
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:14,620
Yeah.

2802
02:18:14,660 --> 02:18:18,220
I mean, I guess I'm fortunate enough to be able to, you know,

2803
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:20,660
not make this decision be like a make or break.

2804
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:23,500
Like, I need, you know, this money for rent or something.

2805
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:26,540
I can afford it, even though it'd be kind of gross

2806
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:28,340
if it's like a crap product.

2807
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:33,260
But I think at this point, I'm still going to get it.

2808
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:39,900
Um, so I don't know, I'll probably call in after I've played it, you know.

2809
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:42,100
Oh, totally. I totally wouldn't care for our listeners.

2810
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:44,420
How wonderful or awful it ends up being.

2811
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:46,860
You know what, I mean, if I had the disposable income,

2812
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:50,700
you know, if it, like, if that kind of money wasn't such a big deal,

2813
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:54,780
yeah, I probably would still pick it up anyway just to try it.

2814
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:57,820
But because I figure a lot of that stuff's going to be patched out eventually,

2815
02:18:57,860 --> 02:18:58,940
I would hope.

2816
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:01,220
But I just don't.

2817
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:04,860
But at the same time, don't necessarily prepare for disappointment either.

2818
02:19:04,900 --> 02:19:06,740
Although, I guess if you put the bar low,

2819
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:09,300
then you're only going to get your expectations exceeded.

2820
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:11,820
But look at the, you know what, you're going to need to play ResVR.

2821
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,060
That's going to be fucking rad.

2822
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:16,100
Like, you know, but, you know, I finally had to answer that question

2823
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:17,980
that a lot of people have been asking me.

2824
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:20,860
Is ResVR worth $600, Rob?

2825
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:23,900
And for me, it's like,

2826
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:27,740
yes, but just not today.

2827
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:31,060
So that's where I ultimately ended up.

2828
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:33,300
Yeah, you know, I'm going to get it.

2829
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:34,980
We'll see how it goes.

2830
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:38,220
All right. Well, I look forward to hearing from you again next week

2831
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:42,260
or the week after to tell me all about what I'm missing out on.

2832
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:43,180
Yeah, sure.

2833
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:46,220
All right. Marcus, anything else before we let you go?

2834
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:47,180
No, that was really it.

2835
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:50,020
You know, just wanted to share my stress, I guess.

2836
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:51,740
No, I hear you. We're all feeling it right now.

2837
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:53,020
This is the time.

2838
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:55,380
All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2839
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:59,860
But again, great to see you at GamerX, and we'll see you next time.

2840
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:00,500
Sure thing.

2841
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:01,700
All right. Take care, buddy.

2842
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:02,020
Bye.

2843
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:03,060
Bye.

2844
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:06,180
All right. Wow, we have a surprising number of calls lighting up the line tonight.

2845
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:08,020
I figured all the politics out in the world

2846
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:11,860
and just the fact we have a lower turnout than usual tonight would have scared people off.

2847
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,540
But that is apparently not the fact.

2848
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:15,740
So hello, you're on Orange Noms Radio. Who's this?

2849
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:17,180
Hey, it's Brad from Pod Culture.

2850
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:19,940
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. How are you?

2851
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:21,380
I'm Peachy Keen.

2852
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:23,700
Good to hear from you. What's on your mind, buddy?

2853
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:26,180
Well, everybody likes cats, right?

2854
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,060
Of course. Who doesn't?

2855
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:30,180
And y'all like clicker games?

2856
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:31,620
Yes.

2857
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:32,980
Cat clicker game for you.

2858
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:35,300
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

2859
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:36,740
On Android and iOS.

2860
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:39,780
This is the one you texted me about earlier in the week, isn't it?

2861
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:40,780
Oh, yeah.

2862
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:46,540
Luckily, I've been so distracted, I haven't had time to fall down this kiddie hole.

2863
02:20:46,580 --> 02:20:48,100
Yeah, it's a rabbit hole. I did kiddie hole.

2864
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:52,700
I haven't had time to do that yet, so I'm a little scared of this.

2865
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:54,620
But what is this, Brad?

2866
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:57,700
It's pretty appropriate. It's PolitiCats.

2867
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:00,140
PolitiCats. What are you doing, PolitiCats?

2868
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:06,900
You're a cat, and you campaign, and your tapping is your votes.

2869
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:09,900
And the more you tap, the more votes you get.

2870
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:13,020
And it's just frickin' ridiculous.

2871
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:18,260
Oh, my God, there's these power-ups, and you go from, like, being town treasurer

2872
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:22,100
to county commissioner all the way up the ranks.

2873
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:25,500
So I guess you can get president, but eventually it ramps up.

2874
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:28,780
So you can go all the way from a mayor in a small town in Alaska

2875
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:30,740
all the way to the vice presidency?

2876
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:36,460
Pretty much, yeah. And you can see rest from the litter box.

2877
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:39,100
Do they put tongue-in-cheek jokes like that in the game?

2878
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:40,620
I would hope so.

2879
02:21:40,660 --> 02:21:44,860
There are power-ups, there are endorsements that you can get,

2880
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:50,740
and one of them is catty-purry.

2881
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:53,900
Yeah, so you can get these different cat pun celebrity endorsements.

2882
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:55,620
Okay, I like that.

2883
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:58,700
Is this a free game, or where's the money made in this game?

2884
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:02,260
There are some in-app purchases you can get, typical gems and stuff,

2885
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:07,060
but I've been playing it for about a week now and haven't had to put in a cent.

2886
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:09,580
Gotcha. Are you still playing that nonstop night tour?

2887
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:11,140
Did you finally give up on that?

2888
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:13,540
In theory, I'm still playing it,

2889
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:17,940
but I've been distracted with this damn political cats game.

2890
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:22,140
It's tough when they put cats in it. It makes it very hard to resist, isn't it?

2891
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:26,700
Oh, yeah, there's all kinds of different cats that you can choose from,

2892
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:31,180
starting out, and if you want to pay an extra three bucks, you can unlock Garfield.

2893
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:33,260
Really? They have licensed cats?

2894
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,020
They have one licensed cat.

2895
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:39,700
Garfield, that's awesome, and you too can hate Mondays and enjoy lasagna.

2896
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:42,060
And there's little crap that you can unlock for the cat,

2897
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:47,180
like glasses and hats and stupid little furry wings and bubbles and all that kind of crap.

2898
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:49,700
Can you get nurble, though?

2899
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:53,140
Not yet, but there is a little gray, heavy type cat.

2900
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:54,180
Okay. All right.

2901
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:56,060
You have to pay money to get rid of nurble.

2902
02:22:58,420 --> 02:22:59,860
I'm waiting for Simon's cat.

2903
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:03,020
If that shows up, I'll pay a couple of bucks for Simon's cat.

2904
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:05,380
No love for a fucking Heathcliff, unfortunately.

2905
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:08,020
Oh, that's just a Garfield ripoff.

2906
02:23:08,060 --> 02:23:11,220
Oh, hey, but it had a way better theme song.

2907
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:13,260
Maybe so.

2908
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:15,780
All right, so PolitiCats, I will definitely check that out.

2909
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:20,220
Hey, before I let you go, I know you're a big fan of the Forza Horizon series,

2910
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:24,060
and I've been very slow to pick that up just because it's been a crazy past couple months,

2911
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:26,380
but are you enjoying Forza Horizon 3?

2912
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:28,700
I am. I am a lot.

2913
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:33,940
I was lucky enough to be gifted a copy by someone who will remain aimless.

2914
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:37,380
But yeah, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

2915
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:43,420
It's actually the first digital game, full digital game that I've got.

2916
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:46,460
And fortunately, it's one of the Xbox Anywhere's,

2917
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:50,300
and that's how I found out that my video card isn't compatible.

2918
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,340
Don't.

2919
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:54,460
Well, yeah, I need a DX12 compatible,

2920
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:58,460
but who needs it when you can stream from the Xbox app?

2921
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:01,260
That's true, when the Xbox app works, right?

2922
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:03,900
Yeah, the latest update broke it.

2923
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:07,020
I haven't had that problem yet, but then again, I don't do that streaming a lot,

2924
02:24:07,060 --> 02:24:11,900
but I was going to try streaming some Lost Odyssey to my PC so I could play it over there.

2925
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:15,060
So I'll have to see if that will still work or what's going to happen.

2926
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:21,180
Unless you're on the insider preview program stuff, probably not.

2927
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:24,580
But because I'm stupid, like being on the cutting edge of stuff,

2928
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:29,340
yeah, I think it's just the latest insider preview up there that broke it.

2929
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:31,020
I don't think I'm on that insider preview.

2930
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:34,380
And I've played, like when Dungeon Siege 3 came out on Games with Gold,

2931
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:38,380
I played a lot of that on my PC through the streaming.

2932
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:40,300
So that's cool, yeah.

2933
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:44,340
I actually do a lot of streaming, even though it's just me and the cats.

2934
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:48,620
But I actually, because I'm in here in the studio so much,

2935
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:51,820
do most of my gaming streaming from the Xbox to the PC.

2936
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:55,340
Yeah, same thing. It's weird because Alan and I don't usually end up in our living room together,

2937
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:57,260
but like we're in the office together all the time.

2938
02:24:57,300 --> 02:25:00,500
So sometimes if like, you know, I want to hang out and, you know, we're kind of doing it,

2939
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:05,180
I'll play on my PC streaming from the Xbox sometimes, just a little easier.

2940
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:08,700
Plus the multi-monitor setup goes a long way because I can stream on one monitor

2941
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:11,580
and still kind of keep an eye on emails or whatever on the other.

2942
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:18,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, well, I was going to try and play for so while I was listening to the show.

2943
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:20,380
But it broke.

2944
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:22,540
I'm like, okay, fine, I'll listen to O.R.

2945
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:26,060
All right. All right. Well, Brad, my friend, I'm going to let you go.

2946
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:26,540
All righty.

2947
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:31,020
But thank you for calling into the show and check out Pod Culture here on the networks

2948
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:34,540
Monday at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

2949
02:25:34,580 --> 02:25:35,820
All right. Later on, guys.

2950
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:37,020
All right. Take care, buddy.

2951
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:37,420
Bye.

2952
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:38,700
Bye.

2953
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:41,940
All right. We'll try to squeeze in maybe one more call here before we wrap up tonight.

2954
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:42,780
Let's get to it.

2955
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:44,740
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2956
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:45,940
Hey, what's up, man? It's Kaijuto.

2957
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:47,860
Hey, Kaijuto, my friend. How are you?

2958
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:48,420
I'm all right.

2959
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:52,140
I just want to say that first caller, what was his name again?

2960
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:53,180
Marcus.

2961
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:55,620
Yeah, him and I do sound exactly like each other.

2962
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:57,700
I've been going back and forth with them in the chat room.

2963
02:25:57,740 --> 02:26:00,180
I don't know if you guys agree, but I think they sound a lot alike.

2964
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:01,860
I think you should have them on at the same time.

2965
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:05,660
I hear some similarity, but I don't think it's as...

2966
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:08,340
I mean, especially because of the quality of their connections.

2967
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:10,500
I don't know how it comes out over them, but they have very different...

2968
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:14,260
I'm not saying one's bad or the other, but they just have a very different sound through the connection.

2969
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:16,900
But maybe that isn't as apparent on the internet radio.

2970
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:18,420
Yeah, I don't know.

2971
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:23,180
But anyway, I'm just calling to say I am absolutely excited about PlayStation VR.

2972
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:29,900
I haven't been really paying too much attention to the reviews and who hated it, who liked it.

2973
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:37,140
I saw some people, like regular people, not anyone affiliated with Sony or anything like that.

2974
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:39,620
And I mean, people have been falling in love with this thing.

2975
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:42,140
I didn't even know I wanted PlayStation VR.

2976
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:43,940
Like, I wasn't like that in the VR.

2977
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:47,380
And I started watching these people experience it on YouTube.

2978
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:50,660
And I'm like, all right, I got to go into a best spot and I got to try this out.

2979
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:53,540
And man, I was I was floored by this thing.

2980
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:57,220
This thing was so much fun, so amazing.

2981
02:26:57,660 --> 02:26:58,620
I definitely want to get one.

2982
02:26:58,660 --> 02:26:59,340
I was disappointed.

2983
02:26:59,380 --> 02:27:02,700
I called my local GameStop and they were already sold out.

2984
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:04,980
But I'm in good with the people there.

2985
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:12,380
So they were like, you know, they have a 48 hour policy that if somebody doesn't pick up their preorder in 48 hours, then it goes up on the shelf.

2986
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:17,500
So they were like, you know, if somebody doesn't happen to pick up theirs, they'll inform me.

2987
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:19,660
But I'm pretty much set for VR.

2988
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:22,260
Like, all I really need are those motion controls.

2989
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:23,620
I already have the camera.

2990
02:27:23,660 --> 02:27:25,140
Of course, I got the PlayStation 4.

2991
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:27,020
So I'm all set, man.

2992
02:27:27,020 --> 02:27:30,540
Whenever I could get a hold of one of those, I definitely want to get into it.

2993
02:27:30,580 --> 02:27:31,540
I don't care about the wires.

2994
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:37,100
I never I've always been a wire person, so it doesn't bother me having all the wires around it.

2995
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:39,900
I mean, it's it's a great it's a great headset.

2996
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:40,860
It's a great feel.

2997
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:46,940
I haven't tried Oculus or Vibe or anything like that, but I didn't even notice this thing was really on my head.

2998
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:50,860
Like, you feel a little bit in the center of your head, but it's very relaxing.

2999
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:54,740
Like, I know people are talking about, well, not with the PlayStation VR, but with other stuff.

3000
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:56,780
They're like, you know, you get neck cramps up and stuff like that.

3001
02:27:57,100 --> 02:28:02,060
Like, I can see myself playing this thing for at least I don't play games for that long anyway.

3002
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:08,020
I could see myself playing for like maybe the length of a movie, like an hour and some change, and then I'm done.

3003
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:12,780
You know, like, I don't feel like my neck is going to get tired or I'm going to get dizzy or sick or anything like that.

3004
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:22,780
Very interesting that you were really sold on is funny because I was I was telling the first caller, Marcus, you know, I was asking if he'd actually tried it in person.

3005
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:27,060
And it's very interesting that you were really sold, it sounds like, on that experience.

3006
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:32,300
Like, it sounds like you kind of didn't know how you felt, but once you tried it, you were like, yep, I'm jumping in day one.

3007
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:35,220
Yeah, they didn't have the move controllers.

3008
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:37,500
I just played with the PlayStation.

3009
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:38,500
I tried out the demos.

3010
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:39,820
I did the shark thing.

3011
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:44,740
I actually knew there was a shark in it, but still didn't think I was going to react the way that reacted to the shark.

3012
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:47,020
Like, it still scared me, like, whoa.

3013
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:49,940
Because for me, it was the whole scale of it.

3014
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:56,260
It's like, you know, I fooled around with the, you know, with the phone, VR, porn, VR, all that stuff.

3015
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:03,580
To me, to me, it felt like a view master, like I look at the view, you know, it's cool.

3016
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:07,900
I can look around, I can see stuff, but it's like a panoramic view master for me.

3017
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:14,260
But this thing, like, I feel like I'm small in this world, like whatever is supposed to be big, I'm smaller than that thing.

3018
02:29:14,620 --> 02:29:19,660
Whatever is supposed to be small and that, you know, like I was literally the size of those things, which that totally like blew my mind.

3019
02:29:19,660 --> 02:29:25,100
Like, it totally tricks your brain into thinking that you're really in these places, you know, and it's weird.

3020
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:26,980
Like, when you take it off, it's completely weird.

3021
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:29,980
Like, when I took it off, it was like, I literally felt like I came out of the matrix.

3022
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:33,260
Like, yeah, it's crazy.

3023
02:29:33,580 --> 02:29:43,740
Alright, well, that's, I would also be curious to hear from you in a couple weeks and see if you felt it was worth what you put down for it and, you know, what you kind of walk away with from the experience.

3024
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:45,180
Yeah, I can't wait.

3025
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:57,260
Like, I definitely, another reason I want to get on it quick is because I'm a little worried that maybe after two years, like when they bring the price down, they might give you like more of a gimped version of the headset and I want that particular headset.

3026
02:29:57,260 --> 02:30:03,620
You know, I don't want like a watered down gimped version with, you know, you know, lesser whatever the hell they always do with those types of things.

3027
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:07,780
So, I think this is the type of thing that you want to be an early adopter of.

3028
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:10,380
Alright, fair enough, fair enough.

3029
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:13,820
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call and your insight.

3030
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:14,660
Yep.

3031
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:15,860
Alright, bye bye.

3032
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:19,820
Alright, that's gonna do it for our calls tonight.

3033
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,060
We're gonna go ahead and wrap it up there.

3034
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:25,180
But if you didn't get through, please consider sending us an email because you heard how empty the mailbag was.

3035
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:28,860
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.

3036
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:31,540
Loki, I didn't catch, is there any last minute stories tonight?

3037
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:32,300
No.

3038
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:40,420
Yeah, there wasn't really, I mean, to be fair, it was kind of a slower news week than usual, probably with the looming releases ahead and everything like that.

3039
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:41,740
So, a little bit quiet.

3040
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:47,020
But we'll probably pick up again as we start to get into the very, very, very busy month of November.

3041
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:54,940
Next week, I'll be coming fresh from Vegas, and we'll be able to talk about Final Fantasy XIV a little bit and how that was, seeing that firsthand.

3042
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:55,780
Who knows?

3043
02:30:56,060 --> 02:31:04,420
You know, last year, one thing I was critical of about the event was that they could have used it as an excuse to show off some of the other Final Fantasy stuff.

3044
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:05,220
So, who knows?

3045
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:07,420
Maybe they'll show off a little Final Fantasy XV on the side.

3046
02:31:07,420 --> 02:31:07,820
We don't know.

3047
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,260
We'll see.

3048
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:10,620
But I'll be coming fresh from that event.

3049
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:13,340
We'll talk about that and whatever else happens in the news next week.

3050
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:20,540
Before we wrap things up here in studio tonight, I do want to thank everybody for downloading OLR or listening to us live, however you checked out the show.

3051
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:23,420
Please remember to help us spread the word about the show.

3052
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:26,220
A little word of mouth goes a long way in getting the word out.

3053
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:29,860
And yeah, we really appreciate all you guys.

3054
02:31:30,620 --> 02:31:36,700
If you want to leave us a five-star review somewhere on a site like iTunes or wherever it is that you found this show, that goes a long way as well.

3055
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:41,620
But, you know, telling a friend or two about the show is definitely, definitely the best thing for us.

3056
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:45,220
So, with that being said, final thought time.

3057
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:47,860
Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3058
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:52,780
Um, no, I just, I don't know.

3059
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:55,300
We forgot to do FUs of the Week, but that's not a big deal.

3060
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:56,260
Oh, oops.

3061
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:58,220
Yeah, I totally did forget to do FUs of the Week, didn't I?

3062
02:31:58,220 --> 02:31:58,740
That's all right.

3063
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:01,940
Um, I guess I'm having a pretty good week, all things considered.

3064
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:03,540
So, I'm eating FUs of the Week.

3065
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:08,980
Um, yeah, I guess I'm, I'm still going to try to work on my game.

3066
02:32:08,980 --> 02:32:13,740
At the same time, I'm working on designing DDR pads because I really want to build some new ones.

3067
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:17,140
Um, this week's been basically just cleaning out the house.

3068
02:32:17,140 --> 02:32:21,940
So, I've cleaned up a lot of my cord messes that I've had that my wife has been annoyed by.

3069
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:23,380
So, I did that.

3070
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:27,100
Um, yeah, I really am just trying to work on it.

3071
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:38,260
Just, like, I literally get home after putting the kids to bed and it's just, it takes an immense amount of focus to be able to work on my laptop while the TV's on.

3072
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:43,260
And then after my wife goes to bed, just an immense amount of focus to stay awake.

3073
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:47,060
And that's just not, I'm not winning that battle.

3074
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:49,140
All right.

3075
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:54,780
Uh, well, my final thought tonight is I'm really excited to go to Vegas next week, see some friends I haven't seen in a long time.

3076
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:57,260
And, uh, geek out over Final Fantasy 14.

3077
02:32:57,660 --> 02:33:03,940
Uh, excited for other conventions coming up as well, including MagFest, uh, in, uh, January in DC.

3078
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:05,060
Looking forward to heading to that.

3079
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:08,460
In the meantime, um, a shameless plug for my Twitter.

3080
02:33:08,460 --> 02:33:10,860
Follow me on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E.

3081
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:12,740
I've met a lot of really rad people on Twitter.

3082
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:16,820
So, uh, as long as I figure out that you're human, I'll usually follow you back.

3083
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:19,620
Uh, so yeah, uh, appreciate all those follows.

3084
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:21,340
And I guess, I guess that's it.

3085
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:22,060
We're done.

3086
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:23,060
We're out of here for the night.

3087
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:28,020
So, uh, we will see you in a week's time here with another episode of OLR.
